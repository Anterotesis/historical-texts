         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Wise man tells us, that <hi>no man knoweth Love
or hatred, by all that is before him.</hi> The great
variety wherein God dispenseth outward things in
the World, with the many changes and alterations,
which <hi>according to the counsell of his will,</hi> he
continually workes in the dispensations of them, will
not allow them nakedly in themselves, to be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the fountaine from whence they flow. Seeing
also, that the <hi>want,</hi> or <hi>abundance</hi> of them, may <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi>
by the Goodnesse and Wisdome of Cod, be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and cast into an usefull subserviency, to a
Good <hi>infinitely transcending</hi> what is, or may be contained in them, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that in the distribution of them, God should walke according to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
uniforme <hi>Law</hi> of procedure, all the various alterations about them, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
one <hi>eternall purpose</hi> for a determinate end. Of <hi>Spirituall</hi> good things,
there is another Reason and Condition; for as they are in themselves Fruits, Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and Pledges of an <hi>Eternall</hi> unchangeable love; so the want of them, in their
<hi>whole kind,</hi> being not capable of a <hi>tendency</hi> to a greater <hi>Good</hi> than they are, the
Dispensation of them, doth so farre answer the eternall spring and Fountaine from
whence it floweth, as in respect of its <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> not to be obnoxious to
any alteration. This is that which in the ensuing Treatise is contended for. In the
middest of all the <hi>changes</hi> and mutations, which the infinitely wise providence of
God, doth daily effect in the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> things of this World, as to the
communication of his <hi>love in Jesus Christ,</hi> and the mercifull gratious distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>unsearcheable Riches of his Grace,</hi> and the hid Treasures thereof pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by his bloud, he knows no repentance. Of <hi>both these</hi> you have had full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And though your concernement in the <hi>former,</hi> hath been as eminent as
that of any person whatever in these latter Ages of the World, yet your <hi>Interest</hi> in,
and acquaintance with the latter, is, as of incomparable more <hi>importance</hi> in it
<pb facs="tcp:59070:3"/>
selfe, so answerably of more <hi>value</hi> and esteem unto you. A sence of the excellency
and sweetnesse of <hi>unchangeable love,</hi> emplying it selfe in the <hi>Golden oyle</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
spirituall Mercies, is one letter of that <hi>new name,</hi> which none can
read, <hi>but he that hath it.</hi> The Series and Chaine of eminent providences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you have been carried on, and protected in all the hazardous worke of <hi>your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
which your God hath called you unto, is evident to all. Of your preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by the <hi>power of God through Faith,</hi> in a course of Gospell Obedience, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of the <hi>immutability</hi> of the <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Promises
of God, which are <hi>yea and Amen in Jesus Christ,</hi> your own soule is only possessed
with the experience. Therein is that abiding joy, that secret refreshment, which
the <hi>world cannot give.</hi> That you and all the Saints of God, may yet enjoy that
Peace &amp; Consolation which is in believing, that the <hi>eternall</hi> Love of God is <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
that he is <hi>faithfull</hi> in his <hi>Promises,</hi> that his <hi>Covenant</hi> ratified in the death
of his Sonne is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> that the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>purchase</hi> of Christ, shall be
certainly bestowed on all them for whom <hi>he died,</hi> and that every one, who is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interested in these things, shall be kept unto salvation, is the ayme of my present
<hi>plea</hi> and Contest. That I have taken upon me to present my weake endeavours in
<hi>this cause of God,</hi> to your <hi>Highnesse,</hi> is so farre forth from my perswasion, of your
Interest in the <hi>Truth</hi> contended for, (and then which, you have none so excellent
or worthy) that without it, no other considerations whatever, either of that <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and Power whereunto of God you are called, nor of your peculiar regard to
that Society of men, whereof I am an unworthy <hi>Member,</hi> nor any other personall
Respects whatever, could have prevailed with, or emboldened me thereunto. <hi>Sancta
sanctis.</hi> The things I treat of are such, as sometimes <hi>none of the Princes of this
World knew,</hi> and as yet few of them are acquainted with. Blessed are they who
have their portion in them. When the urgency of your High, and important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
wherein so many Nations are concerned, will lend you so much leasure, as to
take a view of what is here tendred, the knowledge which you have of mee, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you from a Temptation, of charging any weaknesse you may meet withall, upon
the Doctrine which I assert and maintaine. And so that may <hi>ruune</hi> and <hi>be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
whatever become of the <hi>nothing</hi> that I have done, in the defence thereof, I
shall be abundantly satisfied. That is the <hi>Sheild</hi> which being safe, I can with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
see these papers dye. <hi>Unto your Highnesse,</hi> I have not any thing more to
adde: nor <hi>for you</hi> greater thing to pray, than, that you may be established in the
Assurance and sence, of that <hi>unchangeable Love,</hi> and free acceptance in Christ
which I contend for: and that therein you may be preserved, to the Glory of God,
the Advancement of the Gospell, and the Reall Advantage of these Nations.</p>

evidence of no small incouragement, that God will yet graciously imploy you in the work and

of Piety and Literature, with whose management, for their sevlice, you are at present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted.
Of the Jewels of <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> whereof by the Lord's appointment, the Children
of <hi>Israël</hi> coming out from amongst them, spoiled the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> did they dedicate to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
in the wilderness; when, the <hi>Lord planted the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the
Earth; and said to Sion Thou art my people.</hi> Though some outward provisions, and furnitures
of Literature, now, through the good hand of God, made serviceable to you in your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon the great Worke, and imployment committed to you, were first deposited, when
<hi>thick darkness</hi> was over the land: Yet that they may be made eminently subservient to the will
of God, in raising up againe the <hi>Tabernacle of David, that was falne down,</hi> the Experience of a
few yeares, I no way doubt, will abundantly reveale and manifest. That in the vicissitude of
all things, given them by the mysterious and dreadful <hi>wheeles</hi> of providence, your <hi>good
things</hi> also, (as every thing else that is pleasant and desirable, or given of God unto
the Sons of men hath done) have fallen into the possession and disposal of men, some
enemies, others utterly useless, and unfruitful to the Lord in their generations, cannot
be denyed: But what is there in his waies, or worship, in his workes, or word, that God hath
not, at some season or other, delivered into the power of the men of the world, though they
have abused and perverted them to their own destruction? Neither is there any other use of
this Consideration, but only to informe them of the Obligations they lye under, to a due and
zealous improvement of them, to whose Trust and Cate the Lord committe any of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
when he rescues them from the Captivity, under which they have been detained, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men. This is now your lot, and condition, in reference to many who for sundry generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
possessed those places, and advantages of eminent service for the house of our God, which
<pb facs="tcp:59070:4"/>
you now enjoy. What may justly be the Expectation of God from you, under this signal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of his goodness, what is the hope prayer, &amp; expectation of very many that feare him,
concerning you, in this nation; what are the designes, desires, aimes, and endeavours of all sorts
of them, who beare <hi>ill will</hi> at whatsoever is comely, or praise worthy amongst us, you are
not ignorant. Whatever consideration at any time or season, may seem to have had an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
upon the minds and wills of men, under the like Sacrament, and designement to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of truth with your selves, to incite and provoke them to a singularly industrious and
faithful discharge of their duty, is eminently pressing upon you also; and you are made a <hi>spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
to men and Angells,</hi> as to the acquitment of your selves. The whole of your imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I confess, both in the General intendment of it, for the promoting and diffusing of
light knowledge, and Truth in every kind whatever, and in the more special designe thereof,
for the defence, furtherance, and propagation of the Antient, inviolable, unchangeable truth
of the Gospel of God, is in the dayes wherein we live, exposed to a Contention with as much
opposition, contempt, scorne, hatred, and reproach, as ever any such undertaking was, in any
place in the world wherein men pretended to <hi>love light, more then darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an hellish darkness, which the light of the Sun cannot expel. There is no ignorance
so full of Pride, folly and stubborness, as that which maintaines it selfe, in the midst of plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
meanes of light and knowledge. He that is in the darke, when the light of the Sun <hi>is as
seven dayes,</hi> hath darkness in his eye, <hi>and how great is that darkness?</hi> Such is the Ignorance you
have to contend withal; stubborne, affected, prejudicate beyond expression; maintaining it's
darkness at noon-day, expresly refusing to attend to the Reason of things, as being that alone,
in the thoughts of those men, (if they may be so called) who are possessed with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the world is disturbed. From those who being under the power of this enthralment do
seem to repine at God; that they are not beasts, and clamorously traduce the more noble part
of that kind &amp; offspring, whereof themselves are, which attempts do heighten, &amp; improve the
difference between Creatures of an intellectual Race, and them, to whom their perishing
Composition gives the utmost Advancement; whose eternal seeds, and principles, are laid
by the hand of God in their respective beings, you will not I am sure think it much if you
meet with Oppositions. Those who are in any measure acquainted with the secret, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
exaltations of wisdome and knowledge, against folly and ignorance; with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and conditions, wherewith they advance themselves in their gloryings, even then, when
the precedency of (that which is bestial in this world) force and violence outwardly beares
them down with insultation and contempt, will rather envie, then pity you in any contest
that on this foot of account, you can be engaged in. You are not the first, that have <hi>fought

<pb facs="tcp:59070:4"/>
in this address unto you; wherein I shall crave leave a little further to communicate
my thoughts unto you as to the matter in hand. Next to the <hi>Son</hi> of his love who is the <hi>Truth,</hi>
the greatest and most eminent gift, that God hath bestowed on the Sons of men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to them, is his <hi>Truth</hi> revealed in his word. The knowledge of him, his mind and
will, according to the discovery which he hath made of himselfe, from his own bosome, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
magnified his word, above all his name.</hi> The importance hereof, as to the eternal Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Sons of men, either in ignorance refusing and resisting, or accepting and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of it, is that which is owned, and lyes as the bottome and foundation of all, that we any
way engage our selves <hi>into,</hi> in this world: wherein we differ from them, whose hope perisheth
with them. Unto an enquiry after, and entertainment of this divine and <hi>sacred depositum,</hi>
hath God designed the fruit and labour of that, wherein we retaine the resemblance of him;
which whilest we have our being, nothing can abolish. The mind of man, and divine truth,
are the two most eminent Excellencies, wherewith the Lord hath adorned this lower part of
his Creation: which when they correspond, and are brought into conformity with each other,
the mind being changed into the Image of Truth, there is <hi>glory</hi> added to <hi>glory,</hi> and the whole
rendred exceeding <hi>glorious.</hi> By what sutableness and proportion in the things themselves,
(that is between <hi>Truth</hi> and the mind of man,) as we are men, by what Almighty secret and
irresistible power, as we are <hi>corrupted</hi> men, our minds being full of darkness and folly, this is
wrought, is not my business now to discuss. This is on all hands confessed: that setting aside
the consideration of the eternal issues of things, every mistake of divine Truth, every opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, or rejection of it, or any part of it, is so farre, a chaining up of the mind, under
the power of darkness, from a progress towards that perfection which it is capable of. It is
Truth alone that Capacitates any soule to give glory to God, or to be truly useful to them
who are <hi>partakers of flesh and blood</hi> with him: without being some way serviceable to which
end, there is nothing short of the fulness of wrath, that can be judged so miserable as the
Life of a man. Easily so much might be delivered on this account, as to evince the dread
of that judgment, whereto some men in the infallibly wise counsel of God are doomed, even
to the laying out of the labour and travel of their minds, to spend their dayes and strength in
sore labour, in making opposition to this Truth of God. Especially is the sadness of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
encreased, in reference to them, who upon any account what ever, do beare forth
themselves, and are looked upon by others, as <hi>Guides</hi> of the blind, as <hi>Lights</hi> to them that sit
in darkness, as the <hi>Instuctours</hi> of the foolish, &amp; teachers of Babes. For a man to set himselfe, or
to be set by others, in a way wherein are many turnings &amp; cross pathes, some of them leading
and tending to places of innumerab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e troubles, and perhaps death and slaughter, undertaking
to be a guide to direct them that travel towards the place of their intendments, where they
would be, and where they shall meet with rest, for such an one I say, to take hold of every one
that passeth by, and pretending himselfe to be exceeding skilful, in all the windings and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of those wayes, and pathes, and to stand there on purpose to give direction, if He shall,
withal his skill and Rhetorick, divert them out of the path wherein they have perhaps safly
set out, and to guide them into those by wayes, which will certainly lead them into snares, and
troubles, if not to death it selfe, can he spend his time, labour and strength, in an imployment
more to be abhorred? or can he designe any thing more desperately mischievous to them,
whose good and welfare he is bound and promiseth to seek and promote! Is any man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
under heaven more to be lamented, or is any man's imployment more perilous then
such an ones, who being not only endowed with a mind and understanding, capable of the
Truth, and receiving impressions of the will of God, but also with distinguishing Abilities
and Enlargements for the receiving of greater measures of Truth, then others, and the more
effectual improvment of what he doth so receive, shall labour night and day, dispending the
richest treasure and furnishment of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bule, for the rooting out, defacing, and destruction of
the Truth, for the turning men out of the way, and pathes that lead to rest and peace? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
think of the uncomfortable drudgery, which men give up themselves unto, in laying the
<hi>hay and stubble of their vaine and false Conceptions,</hi> upon the foundation, and heaping up the
fruit of their soules, to make the fire that consumes them, the more fierce and severe, but it
forces compassionate thoughts of that sad Condition, whereto man-kind hath cast it selfe, by

all that stand in their way, roving up and down to gaine Proselytes, unto their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and in the meane time, utterly ignorant or negligent of the great doctrines and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which are as in <hi>him, the head</hi> &amp; <hi>Life</hi> of Soules? How many
a man seemes to have no manner of Religion at all, but some one errour. That is his God, his
Christ, his worship; that he preaches, that he discourseth of, that he labours to propagate: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
by the righteous judgment of God it comes to pass that such men in all other things wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; dye away; all the sap and vigour of their spirits, feeding that one monstrous <hi>excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
which they grow up dayly into. Desire of emerging and being notable in the world, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
and respect in the hearts and mouthes of them, whom peculiarly they draw after
them, with the like unworthy aimes of selfe advancement, may without evill surmizing (when
such attempts are, (as in too many,) accompanied with irregularity in Conversation) be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be Advantages given into the hands of the <hi>envious man, to make use of them</hi> for the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his tares, in the field of the poor seduced world.</p>
            <p>That this procedure is also furthered by the burdensomeness of sound doctrine unto the
generality of men, who having itching eares, as farre as they care for these things, do spend
their time in Religion, in nothing else, but either <hi>to tell, or to heare some new thing,</hi> cannot be
denyed. Besides to defend, improve, give and adde new light, unto old truths (a worke which
hath so abundantly and excellently been labour'd in, by so many worthies of Christ, especially
since the Reformation) in any eminent manner, so as to bring praise and repute unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
(which whether men will confess or no, it is evident that too many are enslaved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
is no easy taske: and for the most part of what is done that way, you may say, <hi>Quis leget
haec?</hi> The world (sayes every one) is burden'd with discourses of this nature. How many have
we in our dayes, who might have gone to the grave in silence among the residue of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and their names have remained for a season in the <hi>voisinage,</hi> where they might have
done God the service required of them in their generation, would they have kept themselves
in the <hi>forme</hi> of wholsome words and sound doctrine; that have now delivered their names into
the mouthes of all men, by engageing into some singular opinions, though perhaps raked out
of the ashes of <hi>Popery, Socinianisme,</hi> or some such fruitful heap of errour, and false notions of
the things of God?</p>
            <p>I desire not to judge before the time; the day will manifest all things: and the hidden secrets
of the hearts of men, shall by it be layed open: when all the wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Something you will find in this kind attempted, by the weakest of your number, in this

business are so known to all, that I shall by no meanes burden you with a repetition of them.
The attempt made by <hi>Mr Goodwin</hi> against the truth here asserted, was by all men judged so
considerable (especially the truth opposed, having a more practical influence into the walking
of the Saints with God, then any Other by him assaulted, and the defending of it, giving more
advantage into an inquiry after the mind of God, as delivered in innumerable places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
then any of the rest opposed) as that a removal of his Exceptions to our Arguments,
and an Answer to his Objections, was judged necessary by all. Other reasons manifesting this
endeavour to be in order and in season, I have further communicated in the entrance of the
Treatise it selfe. In my addresses to the work, I could by no meanes content my selfe, with
a mere discussing of what was produced by my Adversary. For he having kept himselfe

               </gap>ts, which are
already most clearly and solidly answered, (by one especially, renowned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>) to have
tyed my selfe unto a contest with him, had been merely <hi>actum agere,</hi> without promoting the
cause I had undertaken in the least. As I account it by no meanes an ingenuous proceeding,
for men to beare up their own names, by standing upon the shoulders of others, to deport
themselves Authours, when indeed they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Collectours, and Translatours; So I am very

think it necessary to multiply books of the same matter, without some considerable addition
of Light, and strength to the Cause, whose protection and promotion is undertaken. On this
consideration, besides incident discourses, which I hope through the Grace of him, <hi>that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
seed to the sower,</hi> may be of use and have an encrease amongst the Saints of God; I have
made it my aime (and what therein I have attained, is with all submission of mind and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cast before the thoughts of men, whose <hi>senses are exercised to discerne good and evill</hi>) to
place each Argument insisted on, upon it's own proper <hi>basis</hi> and foundation: to Resolve every
Reason and <hi>Medium</hi> whereby I have proceeded, into it's own principles: discovering the
fountaine and <hi>well-head</hi> of all the streames that run in the field of this contest, as also to give
some clearings and evidence, to our Conclusions from the several Texts of Scripture discussed,
by discovering the Reason of them, and intent of God in them. Some Arguments there
<pb facs="tcp:59070:6"/>
are, and sundry Texts of Scripture, that are usually produced, and urged in the defence of the
cause under consideration, that I have not insisted on: nor vindicated from the exceptions of
the Adversaries. Not that I judge them <hi>indefensible</hi> against their most cunning, or most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
assaults, and so <hi>slighted</hi> what I could not <hi>hold,</hi> for indeed I know not any one Text of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
commonly used for this end, nor any Argument by any sober man framed to the same
purpose, that is not capable of an easy and faire vindication: but meerly because they fell not
in <hi>regularly,</hi> in the method I had proposed to my selfe, nor would so do, unless I had gone
forth to the issue of my first intendment, and had handled the abode of Believers with God
at large, from it's principles and causes, as I had done, that part of our doctrine which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the Continuance of the love of God with, and unto them; which the growth of the
Treatise under my hand, would not give me leave to do. What hath been, or may yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be done, by others who have made, or shall make it their business, to draw the saw of this
Controversy, to and fro which Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I hope will give satisfaction, as in other things,
so in the particulars by me omitted. As to what I have to speak, or at least think it convenient
to speak, concerning <hi>him,</hi> with whom in this discourse I have much to do, and the manner
of my dealing with him, being a thing of personal Concernment, not having any influencing
Aspect on the merit of the cause, I shall, in not many words, <hi>absolve</hi> you of your trouble in
the Consideration thereof. My Adversary is a person, whom his worth, paines, diligence, and
opinions, and the contests, wherein on their account he hath publikely engaged, have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from being the object of any ordinary thoughts, or expressions. Nothing not great, not
considerable, not some way eminent, is by any spoken of him, either consencing with him, or
dissenting from him. To interpose my Judgment in the crowd, on the one side or the other,
I know neither warrant, or suffcient cause: We all stand, or fall to our own masters; And
the <hi>fire</hi> will <hi>try</hi> all our workes. This only I shall crave Liberty to say; that whether from his
own <hi>genius,</hi> and <hi>acrimony</hi> of Spirit, or from the provocations of others, with whom he hath
had to do, many of his <hi>Polemical</hi> Treatises have been <hi>sprinkled</hi> with <hi>Satyrical Sarcasmes,</hi> and
contemptuous rebukes of the persons with whom he hath had to do. So that were I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in my thoughts, by the consideration of those Exacerbations and exasperations of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which upon other accounts, besides bare difference of opinion in religious things, have
fallen out in the dayes and seasons which have passed over us, all of them labouring to exert
something of themselves, in every undertaking of the persons brought under their power, I
should have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>terly discouraged from any contests of this nature. Much indeed of his
<hi>irregularity</hi> in this kind, I cannot but ascribe to that prompt facility he hath, in putting abroad
every passion of his mind, and all his conceptions, not only decently clothed, with language
of a full and choice significancy, but also trim'd and adorn'd with all manner of signal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
that may render it keen or pleasant according to his intendment or desire, What

of his opinion by Argument, and the orderly pursuit of it is incumbent on him, (a course of

adorned and accompanied: yet it cannot be denyed, but that his <hi>Allegorical</hi> amplifications,
illustrations and exaggerations of the things he would insinuate, take great impressions upon
the minds of them, who are in any measure intangled with the seeming probabilities, which
are painted over his Arguments, by their sophistry, and pretence of Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The great store also of words and expressions, which for all occasions he hath lying
by him, are of no little use to him, when being pressed with any Arguments, or testimonies of
Scripture, and being not able to evade, he is forc't to raise a cloud of them, wherewith after
he hath a while darkned the wisdome and Councel of that, wherewith he hath to do, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
slipps out of the cord, wherewith he appeared to have been detained, and triumphes
as in a perfect Conquest, when only an <hi>unarticulate</hi> sound hath been given by his trumpet,
but the charge of his Adversaries not once received or repelled. But not any where, doth
he more industriously hoist up, and spread the sailes of his luxurient Eloquence, then when he

            </p>
            <p>The Course &amp; Condition of my procedure with him, whether it be such as becometh Christian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and sobriety, with an allowance of those ingredients of zeal, in contending for the trut, hwhich
in such cases the Holy Ghost gives a command for, is referred to the Judgment of all, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and account themselves so, in the things of God. As to any bitterness of expression, personal
reflections by application of <hi>Satyrical</hi> invectives, I know nothing by my selfe, and yet I dare not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that I am hereby justified. The calme and indifferent Reader, not sensible of those commotions,
which the discovery of <hi>Sophistical evasions,</hi> pressing of inconsequent consequences, bold Assertions &amp;c:
will sometimes raise in the most candid and ingenuous mind, may (and especially if he be an observer
of failings in that kind) espie once and againe, some signes and appearances of such exasperations as
ought to have been allayed with a spirit of meekness, before the thoughts that stirred them up, had
been turned out of doores, in the expressions observed. Although I am not conscious of the delivery of
my selfe in any termes, intimating a Captivitie under the power of such a snare for a moment, yet what
shall to the Christian Reader occurre of such a seeming tendency, I humbly refer it to his judgment,
being content to suffer <hi>loss</hi> in <hi>any hay or stubble</hi> what ever, that I may have layd upon the foundation
of truth, which I am sure is firmly fixed by God himselfe, in the business in hand.</p>
            <p>For what further concernes my manner of dealing in this Argument, I have only a few things to
mention, (<hi>Reverend Brethren</hi>) and you will be discharged of the trouble of this prefatory address un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. The matter in hand I hope you will find attended and pursued, without either Iocular or histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
diversions, which are judged meet by some to retaine the spirits, and intice the minds of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which are apt to faint and grow weary, if alwaies bent to the consideration of things weighty
and serious. With you, who are continually exercised with severer thoughts and studies, then the
most of men can immix themselves withal, such a condescention to the vanity of men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> minds,
and lightness of their spirits, I am sure can find no approbation. And as for them who make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
to run through books of a <hi>Polemical nature,</hi> in what subject soever, in pursuit of what is personal,
ridiculous, invective, beating every <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Section,</hi> to find only what ought not to be there, and
recoyling in their spirits, upon the appearance of that which is serious, and pressing to the cause in hand,
I suppose you judge them not worthy to be attended to, with such an imposition upon the time and
diligence of those who sincrely seek the Truth in love, as the satisfying of their vaine humour would
require. It is indeed of sad consideration to see, how some learned men (forgetting the loss of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
houres, wherewith they punish their Readers thereby) in discourses of this naturedo, offend against
their professed intendments, by perpetual diversions in long personal H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, delighting some
for a moment, instructing none, in the mattter inquired into. Some parts of this Treatise you may
perhaps judge not so closely, &amp; scholastically argumentative, as the regular lawes of an accurate dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
would require. In the same judgment with you, is the Authour: where yet he supposes himselfe
not without just Apologie, and that such, as renders his way of procedure not blame worthy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
otherwise he should not think any excuse sufficient to exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate such an errour. He is worthily blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
who had not rather chuse to want a fault, then an excuse. The truth is, neither would the matter
<pb facs="tcp:59070:7"/>
treated of, nor the persons, for whose sakes cheifly this labour was undertaken, admit of an accurate
scholastical procedure in all parts of the Treatise. The doctrine asserted, and the errour opposed, are
the concernments of the common people of Christianity. <hi>Arminianisme</hi> is crept into the bodies of
sundry congregations, and the weaker men are, who entertaine it, the more gross and carnal are their
notions, and Conceptions in, and about it. <hi>Pelagius</hi> himselfe was never so injurious to the grace of
God, as some amongst us. Now the souls of men, whose good is sought in this work, are no less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in the sight of God, though they are unacquainted with Philosophical termes, and wayes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
than the soules of the most learned. Besides, that which we account our wisedome, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
may, if too rigo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ously attended, be our folly: when we think to sharpen the reason of the Scripture,
we may straighten the Efficacy of the spirit of it. It is oftentimes more effectual in it's own liberty, then
when restrained to our methods of arguing. And the weapons of it keener in their own soft breathings,
then when sharpned in the forge of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> There is a way of perswasion and conviction in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
that is more divine &amp; sublime, then to be reduced to any Rules of Art that men can reach unto.
God in his word, instructs men to make them wise <hi>unto salvation.</hi> Syllogismes are not (doubtless)
the only way of making men <hi>wise</hi> with humane wisedome, much less divine: Some Testimonies, on
this account, are left at their own liberty, improved only by Explanation, that they might lose nothing
of their <hi>owne</hi> strength, seeing no other can be added to them: Where the corrupt Philosophy, or sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
arguings, or indeed regular syllo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tical proceedings of the Adversaries, have rendred a more
close <hi>Logical</hi> way of proceeding necessary, I hope your favourable judgments, will not find cause to
complaine of the want thereof. Whatever is amiss, what ever is defective, what ever upon any account,
cometh short of desire or expectation, as I know none in the world more able to discerne, and find out,
then your selves, so there are none from whom I can expect, and justly promise my selfe, a more easy &amp;
candid Censure, a more free and general pardon, a more favourable Acceptation of this endeavour for
the service of the Truth, then from you. Besides that personal Amity, and respect, which God by his
providence hath given me (one altogether unworthy of such an allay of common perplexities in
his pilgrimage) with you, and amongst you, besides that readiness and ingenuous promptness of mind,
unto condescention, and candid reception of labours in this kind, which your own great worth, and
abilities furnish you withal, exempting you, and lifting you above that <hi>Pedantick</hi> severity, and humour
of censure, which posseth <hi>Sciolists,</hi> &amp; men corrupted with a desire of emerging in the repute of others.
You know full well, in what streights, under what diversions, imployments, business of sundry natures
incumbent on me, from the Relations wherein I stand, in the University, and on sundry other accounts,
this work hath been carried on. The truth is, no small portion of it, owes it's rise to Journeyes, and such
like avocations from my ordinary course of studies, and imployments, with some spare houres, for the
most part in time of absence, from all books and asisstances of that nature whatever. Not longer to
be burthensome unto you, with things of no greater concernment, then what may have respect to one every way so unworthy as my selfe, what is of the <hi>seed</hi> which God hath graciously supplyed, I am sure
will find acceptance with you; and what is of it's worthless Author, or that I have added, I am fully
content may be consumed by <hi>the fire, that tryes our workes</hi> of what sort they are.</p>
            <p>My dayly prayer (<hi>Honoured Brethren</hi>) shall be on your behalfe, that in the dayes, wherein we see
so many fall from the truth, &amp; oppose it, on the one hand; a great indifferency as to the things of God,
leading Captive so many on the other, so few remaining, made useful to God in their generations, by
a conjunction of zeale for the truth, and ability unto it's defence, and those for the most part so closely
engaged in, and their hands so filled, with the work of publique <hi>beseeching Men to be reconciled to God in
Christ,</hi> and building up of them, who are called in their most holy faith; You may receive helpe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and encouragement to engage you by all meanes possible, to spread abroad a savour of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Jesus Christ, &amp; to labour continually that the truths of God, (for whose defence you are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
appointed) may not be cast down, nor trampled on under the <hi>feet</hi> of men of corrupt <hi>minds,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and falshood, as is the manner of some, who yet would be accounted sound in the faith; but keeping
close to the forme of wholesome words, &amp; answering the mould of Gospel doctrin, whereinto you have

Eph. 6. 18. In what variety of Expression the thing is revealed in the Scripture, is in
the Treatise it selfe abundantly declared. The Latin word is <hi>Classical, Persevero,</hi> is <hi>Constanter
sum severus:</hi> In that sense as <hi>Seneca</hi> saies, <hi>Res severa est verum gaudium.</hi> It's extreme in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is, <hi>Pertinacy;</hi> if these are not rather distinguished from their objects, then in themselves.
<hi>Varro</hi> lib 4. de ling: Lat: Tells us that <hi>Pertinacia is a continuance or going on, in that, wherein one
ought not to continue, or proceed. Perseverantia</hi> is that, whereby any <hi>one continues in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he</hi> ought so to doe. Hence is that definition of it commonly given by the <hi>School-men</hi> from
<hi>Austin:</hi> Lib 87. qu: 31, who took it from <hi>Cicero</hi> (one they little acquainted themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
<hi>lib. 2, de Invent:</hi> it is say they, <hi>In ratione bene fundatâ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stabilis &amp; per petua permansio.</hi> And
this at present may pass for a general description of it, that is used in an <hi>Ethical,</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi>
sense. Perseverance was accounted a commendable thing among Philosophers. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
Perseverance is that part of <hi>Fortitude whereby the mind is established in the performance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good and necessary work, not withstanding the assaults and opposition it meets withal, with that
tediousness and wearisomness, which the protraction of time, in the pursuit of any affairs, is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
withal. Aristotle</hi> informes us that it is excercised about things <hi>troublesome,</hi> lib. 7. Eth:

from <hi>pertinacy;</hi> And of men infected with that deprav'd habit of mind, he says there are three
sorts, <gap reason="foreign">

differenced from a <hi>stable resolved</hi> frame of mind, what ever it may resemble it in. Now though
<pb facs="tcp:59070:8"/>
there is no question, but that of two persons <hi>continuing</hi> in the same work, or opinion, one
may doe it out of <hi>pertinacy,</hi> the other out of <hi>perseverance,</hi> yet amongst men who judge of the
minds of others, by their fruits, and of the Acts of their minds by their objects, these two dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
or Habits are universally distinguished, as before, by <hi>Varro.</hi> Hence the Termes of
<hi>pertinacy</hi> and <hi>obstinacy</hi> being thrust into the definition of <hi>herisy,</hi> by them who renouncing any
infallible living Judge and determiner in matters of faith, to make way for the inflicting of
punishment on the entertainers and maintainers thereof, they take no thought of proving it
<hi>such,</hi> but only because it is found in persons embracing such errours; The same Affection of
mind, with the same fruites and demonstrations of it, in persons embracing the Truth, would
by the same men be termed <hi>perseverance.</hi> But this is not that whereof I Treat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Evangellical perseverance,</hi> is from the Scripture at large explained in the <hi>Book</hi> it selfe. As
it relates to our Acceptation with God, and the immutability of Justification (which is the
the cheife and most eminent part of the Doctrine contended for,) as it hath no conformity
in anything, with the <hi>moral perseverance</hi> before described, so indeed, it is not comprehended
in that strict notion and signification of the word it selfe, which denotes the continuation of
some Act, or Acts in us, and not the <hi>uninterruptibleness</hi> of any Act of God. This then is the
cause of perseverance, rather than perseverance it selfe; yet such a cause, as being established,
the effect will certainly and uncontrolably ensue. They who goe about to assert a <hi>perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Saints,</hi> cut off from the <hi>absolute unchangableness</hi> of the decree, purpose, and Love of
God, attended with a <hi>possibility</hi> of a contrary Event, and that not only in respect of the free
manner of it's carrying on, whereby he that wills to persevere, may not will so to doe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in respect of the issue and end it selfe, will, I doubt not, if they are serious in what they
pretend, find themselves entangled in their undertaking. As perseverance is a Grace in the
<hi>subject</hi> on whom it is bestowed, so it relates either to the spiritual habit of faith, or the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of new life they have received from God, or to the actual performance of those duties
wherin they ought to abide. In the first sense it consists in the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>being,</hi> or <hi>not being.</hi>
Whilest the habit of faith remaines, there is in respect thereof an <hi>uninterrupted perseverance</hi> in
him in whom it is; and this we contend for. As it respects <hi>Actions</hi> flowing from that Habit
and principle; so it expatiates it selfe in a large fieild. For as it imports not at all a perpetual
performance of such Acts without <hi>Intermission,</hi> (which were naturally as well as spiritually
impossible, whilest we carry about us a body of death,) so neither doth it necessarily imply <hi>a
constant tenour</hi> of proceeding in the performance of them, but is consistent with a change in
<hi>degrees</hi> of performance, and in other respects also, not now to be insisted on. Perseverance in
this sense being the uninterrupted continuance of Habitual grace, in the hearts of Believers
without <hi>intercision,</hi> with such a walking in obedience, as God according to the tenour of the
new covenant will accept, upon the whole of the matter, it is in it's own nature, (as every
thing also is that hath not it's being from it's selfe) liable and obnoxious to <hi>Alteration;</hi> and
therefore must be built and repos'd on that which is in it selfe <hi>immutable,</hi> that it may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
on that supposition, <hi>immutable</hi> also. Therefore is Perseverance in this sense resolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Cause of it before mentioned, which to doe is the cheife endeavour of the following
Treatise. Of the Groundlessness of their opinion, who granting <hi>final perseverance,</hi> doe yet
plead for the <hi>possibility of a final Apostacy,</hi> and an intercision of faith, no more need be spoken,
but what upon the account last mentioned hath been argued already. Some discourses have
passed both of old, and of late, concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of this perseverance, and wherein it doth
propperly consist. Many affirme it not really to differ from the habit of faith and love it
selfe, for which <hi>Bradwardine</hi> earnestly contends. <hi>Lib. 2. de Cau: dei: cap.</hi> 11. Concluding

which (as before was observed) he denyed, but to manifest that it was immediatly and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of habitual grace, given it by confirmation, is he cannot tell: for, in those who are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in Grace, he asserts only in <hi>inpeccability</hi> upon supposition, and that not alone from
their <hi>intrinsecal principle,</hi> as it is with the blessed in heaven, but from help and assistance also
dayly communicated from without: <hi>Durandus</hi> in 3. <hi>d. 3. q.</hi> 4, assignes the deliverance from sin
which those who are confirmed in grace doe obtaine unto the Holy Ghost: so far well: but he <hi>kicks</hi> down his <hi>milke</hi> by his addition, that he doth it only by the removeal of all occasion
of sin: But of these persons, and their Judgment in the point under debate, more afterwards.</p>
            <p>For the thing it selfe last proposed, on what foot of account it is placed, and on what foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
asserted, The <hi>Treatise</hi> it selfe will discover. That the thing aymed at, is not to be
straightned or restrained to any one peculiar Act of grace, will easily appear. The main
foundation of that which we plead for, is, The <hi>Eternal purpose</hi> of God, which his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requireth to be absolutely immutable and irreversible. The Eternal Act of the will of
God designing some to salvation by Christ, infallibly to be obtained, for <hi>the Prayse of the,
glory of hu grace,</hi> is The Bottome of the whole; Even that <hi>foundation</hi> which standeth for ever,
having this seale, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> For the Accomplishment of this eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and for the procurement of all the good things, that lye within the compass of it's in

taking away sinne, bringing <hi>in Life and immortality,</hi> interposed, giving further causal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into the truth contended for. In him and for his sake, as God graciously, powerfully,
and freely gives his Holy Spirt, faith, with all the things that accompany salvation unto all
them, whom he accepts and pardons by his being made <hi>sinne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or them,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness unto
them,</hi> so he takes them therby into an everlasting Covenant that shall not be broken, and
hath therein given them innumerable promises that he will continue to be their God for ever, and preserve them <hi>to be,</hi> and <hi>in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing</hi> his people: to this end, because the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Grace, and living to him, as in them inherent, is a thing in i'ts own nature chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable,
and lyable to failing, he doth according to his <hi>promise,</hi> and for the Acccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of his <hi>purpose,</hi> dayly make out to them, by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> from the great treasury
and store-house thereof, the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>supplies,</hi> encreasing of faith, Love,
and Holiness, recovering them from <hi>falls,</hi> healing their <hi>back-slidings, strengthening them with
all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long suffering with joyfulness,</hi> so
preserving them by his power through faith unto salvation: And in this way of delivering the
doctrine contended about, it is clearly made out, that the disputes mentioned are as needless,
<pb facs="tcp:59070:9"/>
as groundless, so that we shall not need to take them into the state of the controversy in hand,
though I shall have occasion once more to reflect upon them, when I come to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the doctrine of the School-men, in reference to the opinion proposed to debate. The
mayne of our enquiry, is after the <hi>Purpose, Covenant,</hi> and <hi>promises</hi> of God, the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Christ, the supplies of Grace promised and bestowed in him: on which accounts, we
doe assert and maintaine; That all true Believers who are in being so, interested in all those
causes of preservation, shall infallibly be preserved unto the end, in the favour of God, and
such a course of Gospel obedience as he will accept in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>That, (as was formerly sayd) which at present I ayme at in Reference to this <hi>Truth</hi> is, to
declare it's <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress,</hi> it's course, and opposition, which it hath found in several Ages
of the Church, with it's state and condition at this day, in respect of Acceptance with the
people of God.</p>
            <p>It's rise, with all other divine truths, it owes only to Revelation from God, manifested
in the Scriptures of the Old and new Testament; some of the most eminent places
wherein it is delivered in the old Testament are: <hi>Gen: 3. 17. chap: 17. 1. Deut: 33. 3. Josh:

<hi>primitive Christians,</hi> to the most of whom it was given not <hi>only to believe, but also to suffer for
Christ,</hi> to me is unquestionable. And I know no better proof of what those first Churches
<hi>did</hi> believe, than by shewing what they <hi>ought</hi> to believe, which I shall unquestionably be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
they <hi>did</hi> believe, unless most pregnant Testimony be given of their <hi>Apostacy.</hi> That
<hi>Paul</hi> believed it for himselfe, and concerning others is evident. <hi>Ro. 8. 38, 39. 1 Cor. 1. 8, 9. Phil:</hi>
1. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.. 9, 10, are sufficient proof of his faith herein: That he built up others in the same
<hi>perswasion,</hi> to the enjoyment of the same peace and Assurance with himselfe, is undenyable.
And if there be any demonstration to be made of the beliefe of the first Christians, of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
comparable unto this, I shall not deny but that it ought to be attended unto. But that
we may not seem willing to decline the Consideration of what those who went before us in
the several Ages and Generations past, apprehended, and have by any means communicated
unto us, of their thoughts about the businesse of our contest, (having no reason so to be) I
shall after a little preparation made to that work, present the Reader with something of my
Observations to that end and purpose.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Ancients in matters of Religion and worship of God, of the Right use and improvement of their writings, of the several Considerations that are to be had and
exercised by them who would read them with profit and Advantage, after many disputes and
contes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s between the <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Divines of the Reformed Churches,</hi> the whole concernment
of that Controversy, is so clearely stated, Mannaged and resolved by Mounseiur <hi>Dalie</hi> in
his Book of the <hi>Right use of the Fathers,</hi> that I suppose all farther labour in that kind may be
well spared. Those who intend to weigh their Testimony to any head of Christian Doctrine,
doe commonly distinguish them into three greater <hi>periods</hi> of time: The first of these is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of them, who lived and wrote <hi>before the Doctrine,</hi> concerning which they are called
out to give in their thoughts and verdict, had received any <hi>signal opposition,</hi> and eminent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
in the Church on that acccount. Such are the Writers of the first 300 years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Nicene Counsel,</hi> in reference to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> and so the succeeding
writers, before The stating of the <hi>Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>donian, Eutichian,</hi> and <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresies. In the
next are they ranked who bare the <hi>burthen</hi> and heat of the Opposition made to any Truth, and
<pb facs="tcp:59070:9"/>
on that Occasion wrote <hi>expresly</hi> and at large on the controverted doctrines. Which is the
Condition of <hi>Athanasius, Basil, Gregory,</hi> and some others in that <hi>Arian</hi> Controversy: And in
the last place succeed those who lived <hi>after</hi> such concussions, which are of less or more esteem,
according as the Doctrines enquired after, were less or more corrupted in the general <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi>
of the latter dayes. According to this order Our first period of time will be with the
Rise of the <hi>Pelagian Heresy,</hi> which gave Occasion to the through, full, and Cleare discussion of
the whole doctrine concerning the grace of God; whereof that in whose defence we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
is no small portion: The next of those whom God raised up to make head against that
<hi>Subtil</hi> opposer of his Grace with his followers, during the space of an 100 yeares and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
onwards, ensuing the promulgation of that <hi>heresy:</hi> What have been the thoughts of men
in the latter Ages until The <hi>Reformation,</hi> and of the <hi>Romanists</hi> since to this day, manifested in
a few pregnant instances, will take up the third part of this designe. Of the Judgment of the
Reformed Churches, as they are commonly called, I shall speak particularly in the close of
this discourse. For the <hi>first</hi> of these! not to insist on the paucity of writers in the first 300
yeares, sundry single persons in the following Ages, haveing severally written three times as
much, as we have left and remaining of all the others, (the names of many who are said to
have written, being preserv'd by <hi>Eusebius Eccles: Hist:</hi> and <hi>Hierome lib: de script:</hi> their writings
being perished in their dayes) nor in general of that corruption, whereunto They have almost
every one of them been unquestionably expos'd, I must be forced to preface the nomination
of them with some Considerations: The first in that known passage of <hi>Hegesipus,</hi> in <hi>Euseb:
Hist: Eccles:lib,</hi> 3. 26. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So far Hel setting out the corruption of the
Church even as to doctrine, immediatly after the Apostles fell asleep: whereof whosoever will
impartially, and with disingaged Judgments serach into the writings, that of those days do
remaine, will perhaps find more Cause than is commonly imagined, with him to Complaine.</p>
            <p>2 The maine work of the writers of the first Ages, being to contend with <hi>Heathenish Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi>
to convince them of their madness, and folly, to write <hi>Apologies</hi> for the worship of God
in Christ in General, so to disswade their Rulers from <hi>persecution,</hi> or in contesting with <hi>Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
for the most part appearing to be men either <hi>corrupt</hi> in their lives, or <hi>mad</hi> and brainsick
(as we say) as to their Imaginations, or denying the Truth of the person of Christ, what can
we expect from them, as delivered directly and on set purpose to the matter of our present
contest? Some <hi>principles</hi> may in them possibly be discovered, from whence by a regular dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
some Light may be obtained into their thoughts concerning the points in difference.
Thus <hi>Junius</hi> thinks, and not without cause, that the whole business of <hi>Predestination,</hi> may be
stated upon this one principle, <hi>that faith is the free Gift of God flowing from his Predestination
and Mercy;</hi> and concerning this, (saith he) <hi>Hoc autem omnes patres uno consensu ex Christo &amp;

the cause of <hi>Predestination,</hi> was the foresight which God had, either of man's good works, or

<hi>wholy</hi> of his mind, partly upon the account of the observations made by his fellow <hi>Jesuite</hi> out
of <hi>Austin,</hi> before mentioned, partly upon other accounts also. Upon these and the like
Considerations, much I presume to the buisness in hand, will not be produced on either side,
from the Fathers that wrote before the Rise of the <hi>Pelagian Heresy.</hi> And if any one of the
parties at this day litigant about the Doctrines of the Grace of God, should give that advise,

bread that our <hi>heavenly Father</hi> hath so plentifully provided for all that live in his family, or
any way belong to his house, let us look onward to them that follow, of whose Truth and
Honesty we have more assurance.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Genuine</hi> piece that presents it selfe unto us, on the Roll of Antiquity, is that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Clemen's,</hi> which in the name of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> he wrote to the <hi>divided</hi> Church
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which being abundantly testified to of old, to the great contentment of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, was published, here at <hi>Oxford</hi> some few yeares since; A writing full of <hi>antient
simplicity,</hi> humility, &amp; Zeal. As to our present business much I confesse cannot be pleaded from
hence, beyond a negative impeachment, of that great and false clamour which our <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
have raised, of the consent of the primitive Christians with them in their by paths, and
and waies of errour. It is true, treating of a Subject <hi>diverse</hi> from any of those heads of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
about which our contests are, it is not to be expected that he should any where <hi>plainly,
directly,</hi> &amp; evidenty deliver his judgment unto them. This therfore I shall only say, that in that
whole Epistle, there is not one <hi>word, iota,</hi> or <hi>sillable</hi> that gives countenance to the <hi>tenent</hi>
of our adversaries, in the matter of the <hi>Saints perseverance:</hi> but that on the contrary, there are
sundry expressions, asserting such a foundation of the Doctrine we maintain, as will with good
strength inferre the Truth of it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. Setting forth the virtues of the <hi>Corinthiaus</hi> before
they fell into the schisme that occasioned his Epistle, he minds them that: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
That God hath a <hi>certain number of Elect</hi> to be saved, and for whose salvation by his Mercy
the Church is to contend with him, is a principle wholy inconsistent with those, on which the
doctrine of the <hi>Saints Apostacy</hi> is bottom'd. Corresponding hereunto is that passage of his
concerning the will of God, <hi>p.</hi> 12: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. A mere consideration of this passage causeth me to <hi>recal</hi> what
but now was spoken, as though the Testimonie given to the Truth, in this Epistle, was not so
cleare as might be desired. The words now repeated, containe the very <hi>Thesis</hi> contended for. It
is the beloved of God (or his Chosen) whom he will have made partakers of saving Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
&amp; <hi>hereunto he establisheth them</hi> (for with that word is the defect in the sentence to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed)
<hi>by, or with the Almighty will:</hi> because he will have his beloved partakers of saving
Repentance, and the benefits thereof, he confirmes and establishes them in it, with his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
or Soveraigne will. The inconsistency, and irreconcileableness of this assertion, with
the doctrine of these <hi>Saints Apostacy,</hi> the Learned Reader needs not any Assistance to manifest
to him. Answerably hereunto he saith of God. <gap reason="foreign">

on him, but also suffer for him,</hi> and on that account of very great and high esteem among the
Christians of that Age wherein he lived, and sundry others following, so no great Question
can be made but that he wrote toward the end of his pilgrimage, when he was on his way to
<pb facs="tcp:59070:11"/>
be offered up through the holy Spirit by the <hi>mouths of wild beasts</hi> to Jesus Christ, that he
wrote sundry Epistles to sundry Churches, that were of cheifest note and name in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
about. The concurrent Testimony of the Antients in this matter of fact, will give as
good Assurance as in this kind we are capable of: <hi>Eusebius</hi> reckons them up in order, so
doth <hi>Hierome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After them frequent mention is made of them by others, &amp; special <hi>sayings</hi> in them are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed:
And whereas it is urged by some, that there is no mention of those Epistles before
the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> before which time, it is as evident as if it were written with the beams of
the sun, that many false and supposititious writings had been imposed on, and were received
by many in the Church, (as the story of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Tecla</hi> is mentioned and rejected by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull:
de Baptis: Hermae Pastor</hi> by others) it is answered that they were mentioned by <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
some good while before, <hi>Lib. 5. cap.</hi> 28. saith he. <hi>Quemadmodum quidam de nostris dixit, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Martyrium in Deum adjudicatus ad bestias; quoniam frumentum sum Christi &amp; per dentes
bestiarum moler ut mundus panis Dei inveniar.</hi> Which words to the <hi>substance</hi> of them are
found in these Epistles: though some say nothing is here intimated of any Epistles or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
but of a speech that might passe among the Christians by Tradition, such as they had
many among themselves, even of our Saviours, some whereof are mentioned by <hi>Grotius</hi> on
these words of <hi>Paul,</hi> remember that word of Christ that <hi>it is more blessed to give then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
What probabilitie or ground for conviction there is in these or the like Observations,
and Answers is left to the judgement of all. This is certain that the first mentioning of them
in Antiquities is to be clearely received, (and that perhaps with more then the bare word of
him, that recites and approves of the Epistles of Jesus Christ to <hi>Abgarus</hi> the King of the
(<hi>Edessens</hi>) or of <hi>him</hi> that reckons <hi>Seneca</hi> among the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> writers, upon the <hi>account of
his Epistles to Paul</hi>) or the following Testimonies, which are heaped up in abundance by some
who think (but falsely) that they have a peculiar interest enwrapped in the Epistles, now
extant, will be of very small weight or value.</p>
            <p>For my part I am perswaded, with that kind of perswasion wherein in things of no greater
moment I am content to acquiesce, that he did write 7. Epistles, and that much of what he
so wrote is preserved in those that are now extant, concerning which the contests of learned
men have drawne deep and run high in these latter daies, though little to the advantage of
the most that have laboured in that cause, as shall be manifested in the processe of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

Gramaticum appellaret</hi>) for his tearming him a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> yet indeed of him, (such was the
hard entertainment he found on all hands) it is by many supposed that he was <hi>illecebris ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductus</hi>
(and they stick not to name the bait he was caught withall) wrought over in a manner
to destroy the faith of that, which he had before set up and established.</p>
            <p>For the thing it selfe affirmed by <hi>the Doctor,</hi> I cannot enough admire with what <hi>oscitancy</hi> or
contempt, he considers his Readers (of which manner of proceeding this is very far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only instance) that he should confidently impose such things upon them. He that
hath written so much about <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and doth so triumph in his Authority, ought doubtless
<pb facs="tcp:59070:11"/>
to have considered those concernments of his Author which are obvious to every ordinary
enquirer: <hi>Vedelius</hi> his Edition of <hi>Ignatius</hi> at <hi>Geneva</hi> came forth with his notes in the yeare
1623 long before either <hi>Salmasius,</hi> or <hi>Biondellus</hi> had written any thing about the supposititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of these Epistles: in the <hi>Apologic</hi> for <hi>Ignatius</hi> whereto prefixed, he is forced to labour
and sweat in the Answer of one, whom he delervedly stiles <hi>Virum Doctissimum;</hi> arguing (not
contemptibly) that <hi>Ignatius</hi> never wrote any such Epistles, and that all those which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about in his name, were false and counterfeit.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the Doctor had taken caution of one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>à Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevensibus
istis Typographis praeter fraisdes, &amp; fucos, &amp; praestigias non est quod quicquam expecte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
(Montacu: Appar: lib. 5. Sect: 46. pag:</hi> 19.) and so thought not fit to look into any thing
that comes from them.</p>
            <p>Especially may this be supposed to have some influence upon him, considering the
gentle censure added in the next words by that <hi>Reverend Father of his Church</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

what I pray is the reason of his Episcopal censure? That he should deale with poor <hi>Vedelius</hi>
in that language wherewith no men of his <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> were wont to deale with
preaching Ministers at their visitations? Why this poor man in that passage which you have in
the Epistle to the Magnesians (in that Edition: <hi>p:</hi> 56.) where treating of the Antient Fathers
expectations of the coming of Christ, retaines the common reading of, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A little thing would provoke the indignation of a <hi>Prelate</hi> against any thing that came

            </p>
            <p>I say I would suppose, that this might divert our <hi>Doctor</hi> from casting his eye upon <hi>Vedelius,</hi>
whose defensative would have informed him that these Epistles had been opposed as false and
councerfeit, before ever <hi>Salmasius,</hi> or <hi>Blondellus</hi> had taken them into consideration; but that
I finding him sometimes insisting on that <hi>Geneva</hi> Edition.</p>
            <p>For whereas <hi>Cap: 2. Sect:</hi> 2: he tells you that he intends to abide only upon the Edition of
<hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> in Greek, published from the Archives of the <hi>Library</hi> of <hi>Lawrence de Medices,</hi>
and the Latin Edition published by Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> out of our Library here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet <hi>cap.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, plainly intimating a comparative <hi>Noveltie,</hi> in that
order to others in the Churches, and fearing (as well he might) that his translation of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
into, <hi>the ordination of a young man,</hi> would scarce be received by the men of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
(for surely he never supposed, that he should impose on any other, by such gross fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
he prefers the <hi>Vedelian Edition</hi> (where these words are not so used) before it: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
us that <hi>sic legendum</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Geneva Edition) suadet tota Epistolae series.</hi> Now
this truly is marvelous to me (if the Doctor consulteth Authors any farther, then meerly to
serve his present turne) how he could ever advise with that Edition of <hi>Vedelius,</hi> and yet so
confidently affirme, that <hi>Salmasius</hi> and <hi>Blondellus</hi> were the first that rejected these Epistles,
as feigned and counterfeited.</p>
            <p>But yet a little farther I the first Edition of these Epistles in <hi>Latine</hi> was <hi>Augustae Vindeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,
an:</hi> 1529: in <hi>Greek</hi> at <hi>Basil</hi> 1566: Before which time I suppose the Doctor expects not,
that any opposition should be made to them, considering the heaps of filth &amp; dung, that until
about that time, were owned for the off-spring of the Antient Fathers.</p>
            <p>Upon their first appearing in the world what is the entertainment they receive? One who
was dead before either the <hi>Doctor,</hi> or either of his <hi>Antagonists</hi> were borne, aud whose Renown
among the people of God, will live when they are all dead, gives them this welcome into the
world: <hi>Ignatium quod obtendunt, si velint quicquam habere momenti; probent Apostolos legem tulis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

<hi>Additions</hi> and <hi>Detractions</hi> from what they were when first written, as will render them not

have fallen into the hands of such unworthy Impostors as have filled the latter ages with

            <p>And indeed the foysted passages in many places are so evident, yea shameful, that no man

the very garbidge of that beast. Into what hands also these Epistles have fallen by the way,

Doctor takes no notice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>style</hi> of these Epistles doth not a little weaken the credit of them, being <hi>turgent, swelling</hi>
with uncouth words, and phrases, affected manner and wayes of expression, new compositions
of words, multiplying <hi>Titles of honour</hi> to men, exceedingly remote and distant from the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and simplicity of the first writers among the Christians, as is evident by comparing these
with the Epistles of <hi>Clement</hi> before mentioned, that of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Viena</hi> in that same Author, and others. Instances for the confirmation of this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are multiplied by <hi>Blondellus:</hi> my designed work will not allow me to insist on particulars.
In many good words this charge is waved, by affirming that the Author of these Epistles was
an <hi>Assyrian,</hi> and near to <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> and that in the Scriptures there are snndry words of as
hard a composition, as these used by him: <hi>Ham: disser: 2. cap</hi> 3. And as he saies, from this kind
of writing an Argument of sufficient validity may be drawne to evince him to be the Author
of these Epistles. <hi>Hierome</hi> was of an other mind speaking of <hi>Didymus. Imperitus</hi> (saith he) <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone
est, &amp; non scientia, Apostolicum virum ex ipso sermone exprimens, tam sensuum nomine, quam
simplicitate verborum.</hi> But seeing <hi>Ignatius</hi> was a <hi>Syrian,</hi> and near to <hi>Martyrdome</hi> (though he
writes his Epistles from <hi>Troas,</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which without doubt were not in his way to <hi>Rome</hi>
from <hi>Antioch:</hi> &amp; yet every where he saith he is going to <hi>Rome: ad Ephes:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
which in the close he affirmes he wrote from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> whither he was had to his
Martyrdome) what is it to any man, what style he used in his writings, what swelling titles
he gave to any, or words he made use of. Who shall call those writings (especially <hi>Ignatius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Syrian</hi>) into question.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some farther Question may here arise, (&amp; which hath by sundry been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
started) about the use of divers <hi>Latine</hi> words in those Epistles, wich doubtless cannot be
handsomely laid on the same account of their Author being a <hi>Syrian,</hi> and <hi>nigh to martyrdome,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are usually instanced in: words to whose use no <hi>Roman cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
observations, Orders, nor rules of Goverment,</hi> do administer the least occasion. Of these the
<hi>Doctor</hi> tells you, he wonders only that in so many Epistles, <hi>there are no more of this kind:</hi> And
why so? The <hi>Epistles</hi> are not so large a Volume; a very few hours will serve to read them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and yet I am perswaded that in all that compass of reading, in the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> which
our Doctor ownes, he cannot give so many instances of words <hi>barbarous</hi> to their language, no
way occasioned by the meanes before mentioned, as have been given in these <hi>Epistles.</hi> But he
wonders <hi>there are no more,</hi> and <hi>some wonder that all are not of his mind.</hi> But he farther informes
us, <hi>that a diligent Reader of the Scripture, may observe many more Latine words in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then are used in these Epistles;</hi> and for a proof of his diligence and observation, reckons
up <hi>out of the end of Passor's Lexicon</hi> sundry words of that kind, made use of by the Sacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
I feare unto some men, this will scarce be an <hi>Apologie</hi> prevalent, to the dismission of these
Epistles, from under the Censure of being at least fowly Corrupted. Of the whole collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of words of that sort made by <hi>Passor,</hi> among which are those especially cull'd out by our
<hi>Doctor</hi> to Confirme his observations, there is scarce <hi>one,</hi> but either it is expressive of some <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Office, Custome, mony order,</hi> or the like: words of which nature pass as <hi>proper names</hi> (as one
of those mentioned by the Doctor is, and no otherwise used in the new Testament) from one
Country and language to an other, or are indeed of <hi>a pure Greek Original,</hi> or at least were in
common use in that Age; neither of which can be spoken of the words above mentioned, used
in the Epistles: which were never used by any before or after them, nor is there any occasion
imaginable why they should: <hi>Parvas habent spes Epistolae, si tales habent:</hi> I would indeed gladly
see a faire, candid, &amp; ingenious defensative of the <hi>Style</hi> &amp; <hi>manner of writing</hi> used in those <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
departing so eminently from any thing that was customary in the writings of the men
of those daies, or is regular for men of any generation, in Repetitions, affected compositions,
<hi>Barbarismes, Rhyming expressions,</hi> and the like; for truly notwithstanding any thing that
hitherto I have been able to obtaine for help in this kind, I am enforced to encline to <hi>Vedelius</hi>
his answers, to all the particular Instances given of this nature; this, and that place is <hi>corrupted,</hi>
this is from <hi>Clemen's Constitutions,</hi> this from this or that Tradition: which also would much
<pb facs="tcp:59070:13"/>
better free those Epistles from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, us'd in the sense whereunto it was applyed by the
<hi>Valentinians</hi> long after the death of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> then any other Apologie, I have as yet seen, for
the securing of its abode in them.</p>
            <p>It is not a little burdensome to the thought of sober and learned men, to consider how
<hi>frequently, causlesly,</hi> absurdly in the midst of discourses quite of another nature, and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the Author of those Epistles (or some body for him) break in upon the Commendation
of Church Officers <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> exalting them with titles of honour to the greatest
Potentates on earth and compareing them to God the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son;</hi> where as none of the
<hi>Sacred writers</hi> that went before him, nor any of those good and holy men who (as is supposed)
followed after him do hold the least communion or society with him. <gap reason="foreign">

of this passage intended to make of a <hi>Bishop</hi> well I know not: but thus he speaks of him

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus indeed some
would have it, who to help the matter, have further framed such an <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> as was
never thought on by any in the dayes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as shall afterwards be made evident. And
in the same Epistle this is somewhat uncouth and strange. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Whether the Lord Christ hath bound any such burden upon the
shoulders of the Saints, I much question; nor can I tell what to make of the comparison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God the <hi>Father,</hi> and the Bishop, Christ, and the rest of the Church; the whole sentence
in word and matter, being most remote from the least Countenance from the Sacred writings
<hi>Epist: ad Philadel:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

(well aimed however) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Epistle to the
<hi>Church at Smyrna</hi> is full of such stuff, inserted without any occasion, order, coherence or any
colour to induce us to believe that it is part of the Epistle as first written. One passage I may
not omit. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (in the language of our Saviour repudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

How well this suits the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the Reader will easily discerne. <hi>Caesar</hi> or the <hi>King</hi> is upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
thrust behind the Bishop, who is said to be <hi>Consecrated to God for the salvation of the
World:</hi> him he is exhorted to obey; and in express opposition to the Holy Ghost, the Bishop's
name is thrust in between God and the King, as in away of preheminence above the latter:
and to doe any thing without the Bishop is made a farre greater crime then to rise up against
the <hi>King.</hi> As this seemes scarce to be the language of one, going upon an Acculation
to appeare before the <hi>Emperour,</hi> so I am certaine, it is most remote from the likeness of any
thing, that in this affaire we are instructed in from the Scripture. Plainly this language is the
same with that of the false Impostor <hi>Pseudo-Clemens</hi> in his pretended <hi>Apostolical Constitutions.</hi>
At this rate, or somewhat beyond it have you him ranting <hi>Lib. 2, cap.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">

Spirit, every way worthy of, and becoming the great and holy personage, whose they
are esteemed, so there is evidently a mixture of the working of that worldly and carnal Spirit,
which in his dayes, was not so let loose as in after times. For what is there in the Scripture,
what is in the genuine <hi>Epistle of Clêmen's,</hi> that gives countenance to those descriptions of
Episcopacy, Bishops, and the subjection to them, that are in those Epistles (as now we have
them) So insisted on? What titles, are given to Bishops? What Soveraignty, Power, Rule, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is ascribed to them? Is there any thing of the like Nature in the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?
In <hi>Clemens,</hi> the <hi>Epistle of Polycarpus</hi> &amp;c. Or any unquestionable legitimate off-spring
of any of the first Worthies of Christianity? Whence have they their three orders of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Presbyters, and Deacons, upon the distinct observation of which so much weight is
laid? Is there any one <hi>word, iota, title,</hi> or <hi>syllable,</hi> in the whole book of God giving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to any such distinctions? <hi>Eph. 4. 8. We have Pastors and Teachers.</hi> Rom: 12. 7.8.
<hi>Him that teacheth, him that exhorteth, him that ruleth, and him that sheweth mercy,</hi> Philip. 1. 1.

&amp;c. <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> (as in the Church at <hi>Philippi</hi>) this man knowes:
but the <hi>third order</hi> he is utterly unacquainted withal. And that the Difference of this man's
expressions, concerning <hi>Church Rulers</hi> from those in the Epistle under consideration, may
the better <hi>appear;</hi> and his asserting of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be one and the same, may the
more clearly be evidenced, I shall transcribe one other Passage from him, whose length I hope
will be execused from the usefulness of it, to the Parpose in hand. <hi>Pag.</hi> 57. 58. <gap reason="foreign">

(for so it seemes was the manner of the
Church in his dayes, that their officers were appointed by the consent of the whole Church) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And sundry other discoveries are there, in that Epistle of the like nature: It is
not my designe, nor purpose to insist upon the parity of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or rather the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity
of office denoted, by sundry Appellations from these and the like places: this work is
done to the full by <hi>Blondellus,</hi> that our labour in this kind, (were that the purpose in hand,)
is prevented. He that thinkes the Arguments of that Learned man to this purpose are indeed
<pb facs="tcp:59070:14"/>
answered throughly, and removed by <hi>D. H.</hi> in his <hi>fourth dissertation,</hi> where he proposes them
to Consideration, may one day thinke it needful, to be Able to distinguish between words
and things. That <hi>Clemens</hi> ownes in a Church but two sorts of Officers, the first whereof he
calls sometimes <hi>Bishops,</hi> sometimes <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the other <hi>Deacons,</hi> the Doctour himselfe
doth not deny.</p>
            <p>That in the Judgment of <hi>Clemens</hi> no more were instituted in the Church is no less evident.
And this carries the conviction of it's truth so clearely with it; that <hi>Lombard</hi> himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>hos solos ministrorum duos ordines Ecclesiam primitvam habuisse, &amp; de his solis praeceptum
Apostoli nos habere. Lib. 4. Sen. D. 24. Lib. 3. ext.</hi> It seemes moreover that those Bishops and
Deacons in those dayes (as was observed) were appointed to the office, by and with <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the People,</hi> or whole body of the Church: no less do those words import, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
Our <hi>Doctour</hi> indeed renders these words, <hi>applaudente aus congratulante Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiâ

to <hi>Consent</hi> (as it is also used in the Scripture for the most part. <hi>Act: 8. 1. 1 Cor</hi> 7. 12) to a thing

Apostolici,</hi> men with Apostolical or extraordinary power, when they are only the <hi>choice
men</hi> of the Church, where such a constitution of Officers is had, that are intended because it
is our <hi>Doctours</hi> purpose to have the words so rendred. <hi>Ex jussu Dei &amp; Approbatione,</hi> as
though any particular command or opprobation of God were intimated, for the constitution
of the Bishops and Deacons mentioned, beyond the institution of the Lord Jesus Christ,
that Elders should be ordained in every Church, because this would seeme to be exclusive
wholly of the consent of the people, as any way needful or required to their constitution:
which yet as it is practically false, no such thing being mentioned by <hi>Clemens,</hi> who recoutneth
the way and meanes, whereby Officers were continued in the Church even after the decease
of the Apostles, and those first ordained by them to that holy employment, so also is it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentatively
weake and Unconcluding. God appointed, designed <hi>Saul</hi> to be <hi>King,</hi> approving
of his so being, and yet he would have the people come together to chuse him. So also was
it in the case of <hi>David.</hi> Though the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the name &amp; the authority of God, appointed
the <hi>Deacons</hi> of the Church at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> yet they would have the whole Church <hi>look out
among themselves the men to be appointed.</hi> And that the ordaining of the Elders was with the
peoples Election <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. It will ere long be manifested, that neither our <hi>Doctour</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Associates have as yet disproved. This <hi>poore thing the people,</hi> being the <hi>peculiar</hi> people
of Christ, the <hi>heritage</hi> of God and <hi>Holy Temple</hi> unto him &amp;c. Will one day be found to be
an other manner of thing, then many of our great Doctours have snpposed. But he informes
us <hi>Cap. 4. Sect</hi> 3. From that Testimony which we cited before, that the Apostles in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment

               <hi>i: e:</hi> Saith he <hi>Revelationibus edoctos esse, quibus demum haec dignitas communicanda esset;</hi>
that is, that they appointed those, whom God revealed to them in extraordinary manner to be
so ordained, and this is the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and why so? The holy Ghost
orders concerning the appointment of Deacons <gap reason="foreign">

Where yet after the <hi>peoples Election,</hi> and the Apostles <hi>Approbation,</hi> and the trial of both, one
that was chosen is supposed, to have proved none of the best. And yet of him, and them, are
the Apostles said by <hi>Clemens</hi> that they did, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Clemens,</hi> speaking of them who occasioned the division, and schisme in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
or them about whose exaltation into office, or dejection from it that sad difference
fell out, he gives them this advice. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>the multitude,</hi> or <hi>the people</hi> were not such poore inconsiderable things as they are reported to
be, when he advises them <hi>to stop and stay the sedition, by yeelding obedience to the things by them
appointed and commanded.</hi> If it were in it selfe evill, disorderly, and not according to the mind
of Christ, that the people should order and appoint things in the Church, it had been simply
evill for <hi>Clemens,</hi> to have advised any to yeeld obedience unto things by them so appointed.

Our <hi>Doctours</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> having stuft their imaginations with the shape, and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>But <hi>Section</hi> the sixth, the <hi>Doctour</hi> comes closer, and gives his Reason why this Testimony
of <hi>Clement</hi> is not of any efficacy to the purpose in hand, saith He! <hi>At quis (sodes) à fidelibus
de Episcopatu (ut vis) contra ipsos ab Apostolis constitutos Episcopos contendentibus; quis à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo
contra principem suum tumultus ciente; quis verbis ad retundendum seditionem ad plebem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis,
argumenta ad Authoritatem populo adjudicandum principi derogandum duci posse existimavit?</hi>
Though many words follow in the <hi>next Section,</hi> yet this is <hi>all of Answer</hi> that is given to this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnal
Testimony of <hi>Clement's.</hi> I know the <hi>Doctour</hi> for the most part meets, not only with <hi>favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Readers,</hi> but also <hi>partial Admirers;</hi> or else certainly his Exclamation would scarce pass
for an invincible <hi>Argument,</hi> nor such <hi>Rhetorical</hi> diversions as this, be esteemed solid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.
There is not by <hi>Blondellus</hi> any Argument taken from the <hi>faithful's</hi> tumultuating against
the <hi>Bishops</hi> (that <hi>if appointed by the Apostles</hi> which is thrust in, taken for the persons of those
<hi>Bishops,</hi> is against the express Testimony of <hi>Clemens</hi> in this Epistle) nor from the peoples
seditiously rebelling against their Prince, nor from any word spoken to the People to represse
their sedition; neither was any thing of this nature urged in the least by <hi>Blondellus:</hi> nor is
there any colour given to such a collection from any thing in the words cited from the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
or the context of them. It is the advise of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to the persons (whether
already in office, or aspiring thereunto) about whom the contention, and division was in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that is insisted on. It is not the words nor plea of them who were in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
there is not any reprehension given to the body of the Church, the multitude or people
who are supposed to tumultuate, to quiet them, but a direction given (as was said) by the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> to the persons that occasioned the difference, how to behave themselves so,
that a timely issue might be put to the division of the Church. To this end are they advised
to observe the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>orders, precepts, decrees,</hi> or <hi>appointments</hi> of the <hi>multitude,</hi> as (from
<hi>Acts</hi> the fifteenth) the <hi>body of the Church</hi> is called. It is not, that they should yeild to their
tumultuating, but to yeild obedience to their orderly precepts. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
are by him approved; &amp; had it not been lawful for them, with the <hi>Presbyters</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the
Affaires of the Church, <hi>Clemens</hi> writing this Epistle to the whole Church, could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have led them into a greater snare.</p>
            <p>It is a sad thing to consider the pittiful entanglements, and snares that some men runne into,
who will undertake to make good, what they have once engaged for, let what will come
against them.</p>
            <p>To returne then; It is evident, that in the time of <hi>Clement,</hi> there were but two sorts of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in the Church, <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> whereas the <hi>Epistles of Ignatius</hi> do precisely in
every place where any mention is made of them, as there is upon occasions, and upon none
at all, insist on three Orders distinct, in <hi>name,</hi> and <hi>things.</hi> With <hi>Clement</hi> it is not so. Those
whom he calls <hi>Bishops</hi> in one place, the very same persons he immediatly calls <hi>Presbyters</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Example of <hi>Paul.</hi> Act: 20. 28. And Titus. 1. 5. 7.) And plainly asserts <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be
the office of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
<hi>viz:</hi> Because they were in no
danger to be cast from their <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> And whereas the fault which he reproves in the
Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> is their division, and want of due subjection to their spiritual Governours,
according to the order, which Christ hath <hi>appointed in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<pb facs="tcp:59070:15"/>
plainly that those Governours were the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And in all places throughout the whole Epistle, writing (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
to that particular <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> the Saints dwelling there, <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the order &amp; fellowship of the Ghospel,</hi> where he treates of those things, he still intimates a
<hi>plurality of Presbyters</hi> in the Church (as there may, nay there ought to be in every <hi>single
congregation, Act:</hi> 20. 28.) without the least intimation of any <hi>singular Person,</hi> promoted
upon any account whatever above his fellowes. So in the Advice given to the persons who
occasioned the division before mentioned; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Had there been a <hi>singular Bishop</hi> at Corinth, much more a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi>
such as our <hi>Doctour</hi> speakes him to have been, it had been impossible that he should be thus
passed by in silence.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctour</hi> gives you a double answer to this observation, with the several parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I doubt not but that he makes himselfe merry, if he can suppose that any men are so wedded
to his dictates, as to give them entertainment: for indeed they are plainly <hi>iocular.</hi> But learned
men must have leave sometimes to exercise their fancies, and to sport themselves with their
own imaginations.</p>
            <p>1 Then, for the mention that is made of many <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to
whom <hi>Clement</hi> in the name of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> exhorts to give all <hi>due respect, honour, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
He tells you that by the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> all the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Achaia</hi> are meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
The Epistle is directed only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any other Church or Churches. The difference it is written about, was occasioned by
<hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> persons in that Church only: it is that Church alone that is exhorted to order, and
due subjection to their <hi>Elders.</hi> From the beginning to the end of the Epistle, there is not
one word, <hi>apex,</hi> or <hi>tittle</hi> to intimate the designation of it, to any <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> beyond
the single Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> or that they had any concernment in the difference spoken to.
The Fabrick of after Ages lies so close to the <hi>Doctour's imagination;</hi> that there is no entrance
for the true frame of the Primitive Church of Christ: and therefore every thing must be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and apportioned to the conceit of such an Episcopacy as he hath entertained. Whereas he
ought to crop off, both <hi>head,</hi> &amp; <hi>heeles</hi> of his own imagination, and the Episcopacy of the latter
dayes, which he too dearly affects, he chooseth rather to stretch, &amp; <hi>torture</hi> the antient <hi>goverment</hi>
of the Church, that it may seem to answer the frame presently contended for. But let us a little
attend to the <hi>Doctor's</hi> learned arguments; whereby he endeavours to make good his assertion.</p>
            <p>1 He tels you that <hi>Corinth</hi> was the chief Citty of <hi>Achaia:</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> (in a <hi>political</hi>

upon such tearmes.</p>
            <p>Yea but he adds, <hi>Sect:</hi> 5: That <hi>Paul wrote his Epistle not only to the Church of Corinth, but
also to all the Churches of Achaia, therefore Clement did so also:</hi> At first view this Argument
seemes not very conclusive, yea appeares indeed very ridiculous: the inforcement of it which
ensues may perhaps give new life and vigour to it: How then is it proved that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote not

thinks what a fly this is in his pot of Ointment, nor how undecent with all impartial men,
such Apologies, subservient to a frame of spirit in bondage to a man's own Esteem and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
appear to be: but let this pass: and let the Saints that <hi>call upon the name of Jesus Christ

God for the use not only of all the Saints in the whole world, at that time wherein it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but of all those who were to believe in any part or place of the world to the end
thereof; although the assertion of it be not built on any tolerable conjecture, but may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with the same facility wherewith it is tendred; what now will hence ensue? Why hence
it followes that <hi>Clement</hi> also wrote his Epistle to all the <hi>Churches in Achaia.</hi> Very good? <hi>Paul</hi>
writing an Epistle entituled cheifly to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> expresly and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> directs it to the <hi>Saints</hi>
or <hi>Churches of Achaia,</hi> yea to all <hi>that call upon the name of God in every place,</hi> so that his Epistle
being of Catholick concernment, is not to be confined to the Church of Corinth only, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
most of the particular things mentioned in that Epistle related only to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church; Therefore, <hi>Clement</hi> directing his Epistle to the <hi>Church of Corinth</hi> only, not once
mentioning nor insinuating an intention of extending it to any other, handling in it, only the
peculiar concernment of that Church, &amp; a difference about <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two persons</hi> therein, must be
supposed to have written to all the Churches of <hi>Achaia.</hi> And if such Arguments as these, will
not prove <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be of Apostolical constitution, what will prevaile with men so to
esteem it? <hi>Si Pergama dextra defendi possent, etiam hâc defensa fuissent.</hi> And this is the cause of
naming <hi>many Elders,</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> in one Church: For my part I suppose the <hi>Doctour</hi> might

He might (I say) with more shew of probability have abode by this observation, then to have
rambled over all <hi>Greece,</hi> to relieve himselfe against his Adversaries. But yet neither would
this suffice. What use may, or will be made of this concession shall else where be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.
But the <hi>Doctour</hi> hath yet another Answer to this multiplication of <hi>Elders,</hi> and the
mention of them with <hi>Deacons,</hi> with the eminent <hi>identity</hi> that is between them, and <hi>Bishops</hi>
through the whole Epistle, the same persons being unquestionably intended in respect of the
same office, by both these appellations Now this second Answer is founded upon the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the former: (a goodly foundation!) namely, that the Epistle under consideration was
written and sent not to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> only, but to all the Churches of <hi>Achaia,</hi> of
which <hi>Corinth</hi> was the <hi>Metropolitan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this second answer is, that <hi>the Elders or Presbyters here mentioned, were properly those
whom he calls Bishops, Diocesans:</hi> men of a <hi>third rank</hi> and order above <hi>Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>
in the Church-Administrations and goverment. And for those who are properly called <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
there were then none in the Church, to give colour to this miserable evasion, <hi>Disser:</hi>
4. <hi>chap.</hi> 10 11: <hi>He</hi> discourseth about the goverment and ordering of Church affaires by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
and <hi>Deacons,</hi> In some Churches that were small, not yet formed or compleated, nor come
to perfection at the first planting of them: how well this is accomodated to the Church of
<hi>Corinth</hi> which <hi>Clement</hi> calls, <gap reason="foreign">

Church, being confessedly great, numerous; furnished with great and large gifts, &amp;
abilties is seen with <hi>halfe</hi> an eye. How ill also this shift is accommodated to helpe in the case
for whose service it was first invented, is no less evident. It was to save the sword of <hi>Phil:</hi> 1. 1.
From the throat of the Episcopacy he contendeth for; That Epistle is directed to the Saints,
or <hi>Church at Philippi,</hi> with the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Two things do here trouble our <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi>

degree at least from that height whereto he would exalt it. For the first of these, he tells
you that <hi>Philippi</hi> was the <hi>Metropolitan Church</hi> of the Province of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that the rest
of the Churches, which had every one their <hi>several Bishops (Diocesan</hi> we must suppose) were
all comprised in the mentioning of <hi>Philippi:</hi> so that though the Epistle be precisely directed
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet the <hi>Bishops</hi> that were with them, must be supposed to be <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
of the whole Province of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> because the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> was the <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi>
The whole country must have been supposed to be converted (and who tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> knowes any
thing of <hi>Antiquity</hi> will dispute that) and so divided with Diocesan's, as England of late was:
the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> so beeing at <hi>Philippi:</hi> but how came it then to pass, that here is mention
made of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> only, without any one word of a <hi>third</hi> order, or ranke of men
distinct from them called <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders?</hi> To this he Answers, 2ly, That when the
<hi>Church</hi> was first planted, before any great number were converted, or any fit to be made
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> there was only those two orders instituted <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> so that this Church
at <hi>Philippi</hi> seemes to have been a <hi>Metropolitical Infant.</hi> The truth is if ever the <hi>Doctour</hi> be put
upon reconciling the Contradictions of his answers one to another, not only in this, but almost
in every particular he deales withall (an entanglement which he is thrown into, by his bold
and groundless conjectures) he will find it to be as endless, as fruitless: but it is not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
business to interpose in his quarrels, either with <hi>himselfe,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery.</hi> As to the matter
under consideration, I desire only to be resolved in these few Queries.</p>
            <p>1 If there were in the times of <hi>Clement</hi> no <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the <hi>Churches,</hi> not in so great and
flourishing a Church, as that of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and if all the places in the Scripture, where there is
mention of <hi>Elders,</hi> do precisely intend <hi>Bishops,</hi> in a distinction from them who are only
<hi>Deacons,</hi> and not <hi>Bishops</hi> also, as he asserts, when, by whom, by what Authority, were <hi>Elders,</hi>
who are only so <hi>inferior to Bishops,</hi> peculiarly so termed, instituted and appointed in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
And how it comes to pass that there is such express mention made of the Office of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi>
and the continuance of it, none at all of <hi>Elders,</hi> who are acknowledged to be <hi>superiour</hi>
to them, and on whole shoulders in all their own Churches, lies the great weight and burden
of all Ecclesiastical Administration. As we say of <hi>their Bishops,</hi> so shall we of any <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
not instituted and oppointed by the Authority of Jesus Christ in the Church, let them <hi>go to
the place from whence they came.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 I desire the <hi>Doctour</hi> to informe me, in what sense he would have me to understand him:
<hi>Disser. 2. cap.</hi> 29. 21, 22: where he disputes that those words of <hi>Hierom. Antequàm studia in
Religione fierent, &amp; diceretur in populis, Ego sum Pauli, ego Cephae, communi Presbyterorum
consensu ecclesiae gubernabantur,</hi> are to be understood of the times of the Apostles, when the
first Schisme was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when it seemes that neither then, nor a good while
after, there was any such thing as <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor in any other Church
as we can hear of: As also to tell us whether all those <hi>Presbyters,</hi> were <hi>Bishops</hi> properly so
called, distinct from <hi>Elders</hi> who are only so, out of whom one man is chosen to be a <hi>Bishop
properly</hi> so called. To these enquiries I shall only adde.</p>
            <p>3ly, That whereas in the Scripture, we find clearly but of <hi>two sorts</hi> of Church-Officers
mentioned, as also in <hi>this Epistle of Clement;</hi> the third that was afterward introduced, be it
what it will, or fall on whom it will, that we oppose. This (saith the <hi>Doctour</hi>) is that of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
give us the Churches instituted according to the word of Christ, give us in every
<hi>Church, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> (rather then we will quarrel give <hi>us a Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi>)
let those <hi>Bishops</hi> attend the particular flock, <hi>over which they are appointed,</hi> preaching the word
and administring the holy ordinances of the Gospel, in and to their own flock: And I dare
undertake for all the Contenders for <hi>Presbytery</hi> in this nation, and much more for the <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
that there shall be an end of this quarrel; that they will not strive with the <hi>Doctour,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
any living, for the introduction of any third sort, of persons (though they should be called
<hi>Presbyters</hi>) into Church Office and goverment. Only this I must adde, that the Scripture more
frequently termes this second sort of men <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then it doth <hi>Bishops,</hi> and that
word having been appropriated to a <hi>third sort</hi> peculiarly, we desire leave of the <hi>Doctour</hi> and
his associates, if we also most frequently call them so, no waies declining the other Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Bishops,</hi> so that it be applyed to signify the <hi>second,</hi> and not <hi>third</hi> ranke of men: But of
this whole business, with the nature, constitution, and frame of the first Churches; and the
sad mistakes, that men have by their own prejudices been ingaged into, in this delineation
of them, a fuller opportunity (if God will) may eare long, be afforded.</p>
            <p>To returne then to our <hi>Ignatius!</hi> even upon this consideration of the difference, that is
between the <hi>Epistles</hi> ascribed to him, and the writings of <hi>one of the same time with him,</hi> or not
<pb facs="tcp:59070:17"/>
long before him, as to their language, and expression about Church order and Officers, it is
evident that there hath been ill-favour'd tampering with them, by them who thought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
themselves of his Authority, for the asserting of that, which never came into his mind.</p>
            <p>As I intimated before, I have not insisted on <hi>any</hi> of those things, nor do on them <hi>altogether,</hi>
with the <hi>like</hi> that may be added, as a sufficient foundation for the total rejection of those <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi>
which go under the name of <hi>sgnatius.</hi> There is in some of them, a sweet &amp; gratious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Faith, Love, Holiness</hi> zeale for God; becomming so excellent, &amp; holy <hi>a witness</hi> of Christ
as he was, evidently breathing and working. Neither is there any need at all, that for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> concerning the non-institution of any <hi>Church officer</hi> what ever, relating
to more Churches in his Office, or any other Church, then <hi>a single particular Congregation,</hi>
that we should so reject them. For although many passages, usually insisted on, and carefully
collected by <hi>D. H:</hi> for the proof of such an <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> to have been received by them of old
as is now contended for, are exceedingly remote from the <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of the Expressions,
of those things, used by the <hi>Divine</hi> Writers, with them also that followed after, both before
as hath been manifested, and some while after the dayes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as might be further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evinced, and are thrust into the <hi>series</hi> of the discourse with such an incoherent Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
as proclaimes an <hi>Interpolation</hi> being some of them also, very ridiculous, &amp; so foolishly
<hi>Hyperbolical,</hi> that they fall very little short of <hi>Blasphemies,</hi> yet there are Expressions in all,
or most of them, that will abundantly manifest that He who was their Authour (who ever he
was) never dreamt of any such fabrick of <hi>Church-Order</hi> as in after ages was insensibly received.
Men who are ful of their own apprehensions begotten in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they fancy to imagine that they see the <hi>face</hi> &amp; all the <hi>lineaments</hi> thereof, when upon due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
it will be easily discovered, that there is not indeed the least resemblance, between what
they <hi>find in,</hi> and what they bring to the <hi>Authors,</hi> in and of whom they make their enquiry;

(to instance among many in that Abomination) a folly, destructive to whatever is in
us, as being living Creatures, Men, or Christians, or what ever by sense, Reason, or Religion,
we are furnished with all, offering violence to us in what we <hi>heare, in what we see with our eyes,

a peice of <hi>red Cloth,</hi> or of those who first adore their gods, and then correct them; do yet upon
the discovery of any Expressions among the Antients, which they now make use of, quite to
another End, and purpose, then they did who first ventured upon them, having minds filled
with their own Abominations, do presently cry out, and triumph, as if they had found the
whole <hi>far dell of the mass,</hi> in it's perfect <hi>dress,</hi> and their <hi>breaden God</hi> in the middest of it. It is
no otherwise in the case of <hi>Episcopacy:</hi> men of these latter Generations, from what they saw
in <hi>present being,</hi> and that usefulness of it to all their desires and <hi>interests,</hi> having entertained
thoughts of love to it, and delight in it, searching <hi>Antiquity,</hi> not to instruct them in the truth,
but to establish their prejudicate Opinion received by <hi>Tradition from their Fathers,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult

if that appeare to be such as I have mentioned; I presume the <hi>Doctour</hi> himselfe will confess,
that his witnesses speak not one word to his business, for whose confirmation he doth produce
them. Nor</p>
            <p>2ly, Shall I insist upon the degeneration of the <hi>Institutions,</hi> and <hi>Appointments</hi> of
Jesus Christ, concerning Church Administrations in the mannagement of the succeeding
Churches, as principled, and spirited by the operative and efficacious <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
and advantaged by the Accommodation of Ecclesiastical affayres to the civil distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Alotments of the <hi>political</hi> state of things in those dayes, nor</p>
            <p>3 Insist much farther, on the exceeding dissimilitude, and inconformity that is between
the Expressions concerning Church-Officers, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aires in these <hi>Epistles</hi> (whence ever they
come) and those in the writings of unquestionable credit immediatly before, and after them,
as also the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er silence of the Scripture in those things, wherewith they so abound. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Clemens,</hi> of which mention was made before, was written for the composing, and quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a division and distemper that was fallen out in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Of the cause
of that distention that then miserably rent that congregation, he informs us in that complaint,
that some (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) were wrongfully cast from the ministry, by the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
&amp; he tells you, that these were good honest men, &amp; faithful in the discharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for saith he, <gap reason="foreign">

though they were unblamable both in their conversation, &amp; ministry, yet they removed
them from their office; To reprove this evill, to convince them of the sinfulness of it, to reduce
them to a right understanding of their duty, &amp; order, <hi>walking in the fellowship of the gospel,</hi> what
course doth he proceed in? what arguments doth he use? He minds them of <hi>one God, one Christ,
one body, one faith,</hi> tells them that <hi>Wicked men alone use such waies &amp; practises:</hi> bids them read the
Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> formerly written to them, upon occasion of another division, and to be subject
to their own Elders: &amp; all of them leave off contending quietly doing the things which the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
or <hi>the body of the Church delivered, &amp; commanded.</hi> Now had this Person writing on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
using all sorts of Arguments, Artificial, or inartificial for his purpose, been baptized into
the opinion &amp; esteem of a single <hi>Episcopacy</hi> superintendent, whose Exaltation seemes to be the
design of much which is said in the <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the sense wherin his words are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, would yet never once so much as bid them be subject to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that <hi>Resemblance
of God the Father,</hi> supplying of the place of Christ, nor told them how terrible a thing it was, to
disobey him, nor pawned <hi>his soule for theirs,</hi> that should submit to him, that all that obeyed
him were safe, all that disobeyed him, were <hi>rebellious, cursed,</hi> and <hi>seperated</hi> from God. What
<hi>Apologie</hi> can be made for the weakness, and Ignorance of that holy <hi>Martyr,</hi> if we shall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:59070:18"/>
him to have had Apprehensions like those in these Epistles of that sacred Order, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
those all-conquering Reasons, which they would have supplied him with all, to his
purpose in hand, and pitching on Arguments every way less cogent and useful. But I say, I
shall not insist on any such things as these, but only,</p>
            <p>4 I say that there is not in any of the <hi>Doctor's excerpta</hi> from those Epistles, nor in any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in them, any mention or the least intimation of any <hi>Church</hi> whereunto any <hi>Bishop</hi> was
related, but such an one, as whose members met <hi>altogether in one place,</hi> and with their <hi>Bishop</hi>
disposed, and ordered the affaires of the Church. Such was that whereunto the holy <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
was related; such were those neighbouring Churches, that sent Bishops, and Elders to that
Church; And when the <hi>Doctour</hi> proves the contrary, <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo:</hi> From the
Churches and their state and Constitution, is the state and Condition of their Officers,
and their Relation to them to be taken. Let that be manifested to be such from the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Jesus Christ by his Apostles, <hi>or de facto</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation
of <hi>Ecclesiastical Affaires occasionally,</hi> or by choyce, to the <hi>civil</hi> constitution of
Citties, and Provinces in those dayes, as would, or possibly could beare, a rural <hi>Diocesan me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro-political
Hierarchie,</hi> and this controversy will be at end; When this is by any attempted
to be demonstrated, I desire it may not be with such sentences as that urged by our <hi>Doctour,</hi>
from <hi>Epist: ad Ephes: <gap reason="foreign">

The expression in it concerning Christ being unsound, unscriptural,
concerning <hi>Bishops</hi> unintelligible, or ridiculous: But it may be said, what need we any more
writing, what need wee any truer proof, or Testimony? The <hi>Learned Doctour</hi> in his <hi>Disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
Disser: 4. cap:</hi> 5: hath abundantly discharged this worke, and proved the <hi>seaven Bishops</hi>
of the <hi>seven Churches</hi> mentioned <hi>Revel:</hi> 2. 3: to have been <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> or <hi>Arch-Bishops:</hi>
so that no just cause remaines, why we should farther contend.</p>
            <p>Let then the Reader pardon this my utmost Excursion in this digression, to whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

            <p>Dissert: 4. cap. 5. <hi>The</hi> Doctour <hi>tells us that,</hi> septem Ecclesiarum Angeli, non tantum Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi

            <p>The <hi>Doctour</hi> in this Chapter commences <hi>per saltum,</hi> and taking it for granted that
he hath proved <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> sufficiently before, though he hath scarce spoken any one
word to that purpose in his whole book, (for to prove one superintending in a Church
by the name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> others acting in some kind of <hi>Subordination</hi> to him, by the
name of <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> upon the Account of what hath been offered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the state of the Churches in those, dayes, will no way reach to the maintenance
of this presumption) he sacrifices his paines to the <hi>Metropolitical Archi-Episcopacy dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
which as we must suppose, is so clearly founded in Scripture and Antiquity, that they
are as blind as <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Moles,</hi> who cannot see the ground and foundation of it.</p>
            <p>But first, be it taken for granted, that the <hi>Angells</hi> of the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> are taken for the
<hi>Governours</hi> of those <hi>Churches,</hi> then that each Angel be an <hi>Individual Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to
which he did belong. 2 Be it also granted that they were <hi>Bishops</hi> of the most eminent
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> in that province, or Romane political distribution of those countries, in
the management of the Goverment of them, I say, <hi>Bishops of such Churches,</hi> not <hi>urbium <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
(as the <hi>Doctour</hi> termes them) what advance is made by all this to the Asserration of A <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political
Archi-episcopacy,</hi> I cannot as yet discover. That they were ordinary Officers of <hi>Christ's</hi>
institution, relating in their Office, and ordinary discharge of it, not only to the particular
Churches wherein they were placed, but to many Churches also, no less committed to their
charge, then these wherein they did reside, the <hi>Officers, Rulers, Governours</hi> of which Churches,
depended on them, not only as to their <hi>advise,</hi> and <hi>counsel:</hi> but as to their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
holding their place, and employment from them, is some part of that, which in this
undertaking is incumbent on our Doctour to make good, if he will not be supposed to pre,
varicate in the cause in hand; To this end he informes us, <hi>Sect: secundâ,</hi> that in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there is in sundry places, mention made of <hi>Churches in the plural number;</hi> as <hi>Gal: 1. 21.
1 Thes: 2: 14. Acts 9 31. Acts 15. 41. 1. Cor: 16. 1. Gal: 1. 2. Revel.</hi> 1. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some times, of <hi>Church</hi>
only in the <hi>singular number;</hi> as <hi>Acts 8. 1, 15, 4. 22. Acts 11. 26. Rom: 16. 1. 1 Cor: 1. 2. 2 Cor.
1. 1. 1 Thes: 1. 1. Revel: 2. 1. Revel: 2. 8. Revel:</hi> 2. 12, 18. Now this is an Observation, which as
we are not at all beholding to the <hi>Doctour</hi> for it, no more I suppose will there be found to be
<pb facs="tcp:59070:18"/>
to it, when the reason of it shall be a little weighed and considered. The summe is, that
the name <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>singular</hi> number, is never used, but when it relates to the
single congregation, in or of one City, or Towne. That of <hi>Churches</hi> respecting the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Congregations</hi> that were gathered in any <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>Province;</hi> manifest
then is it from hence, that there is in the new Testament, no Church of one <hi>denomination</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a single congregation; And where there are more, they are alwaies called <hi>Churches;</hi>
how evidently this is destructive to any <hi>Diocesan,</hi> or <hi>Metropolitical</hi> Officer, who hath no
Church left him thereby, of Christ's Institution to be related to, an other opportunity will
manifest. For the present let us see what use our <hi>Doctour</hi> makes of this observation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect:</hi> 3. Sayes he <hi>Judaea</hi> and the rest of the places where Churches are mentioned, are
the names of <hi>Provinces, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> contradistinguntur.</hi> But if
the <hi>Doctour</hi> takes these words in an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> sense, he beggs that which will upon such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
termes, never be granted him; If no more be intended but that <hi>Judaea, Galatia,</hi> and
the like names of Countryes, were <hi>Provinces</hi> wherein were many <hi>Churches; Smyrna, Ephesus,</hi>
of <hi>Townes</hi> and <hi>Citties,</hi> wherein there was but one. We grant it with him:</p>

of <hi>honour, extent</hi> of <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> Ecclesiastical subjection to, or exemption from one another,

was still the most prevalent and cogent argument in their brawles: the most notable brush,
that in all Antiquity we find given to the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who sported himselfe in
those <hi>gatherings together of the waters of people, &amp; multitudes, and nations and tongues,</hi> or the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

being fixt at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> making it become <hi>new Rome,</hi> so that the Bishop of the Church
there was to enjoy equal priviledge, with him whose lot was fallen in the old <hi>Emperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
but our <hi>Doctour</hi> addes;</p>

               <hi>Sect: 5. Illud ex Judaeorum exemplari transcripsisse Apostoli videntur: cum Mosaicâ id

               </hi> But</p>
            <p>1 The <hi>Doctour</hi> I presume knowes before this, that those with whom he hath to do, will
never give him the thing in question upon his begging, or request. That which alone falls
in under our consideration and enquiry is, whether the Apostles instituted any such <hi>model</hi> of
<hi>Church-Order</hi> and Goverment, as is by the <hi>Doctour</hi> contended for; to this he tells you, that
the Apostles seem to have done it, from the patterne of <hi>Mosaical institutions in the Churche
of the Jewes;</hi> But, Doctour, the Queston is not, with <hi>what respect</hi> they did it, but whether they
<hi>did it at all or no;</hi> this the Doctour thought good to let alone uncil another time, if we would
not grant him upon his petition, that so they did.</p>
            <p>2 This then is the Doctours second argument for his <hi>Dioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>san,</hi> and <hi>Metropolitan Prelates.</hi>
His first was, from the example of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in their civil Administration and Rule, this
second from the example of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Not to divert into the handling of the <hi>Church</hi> and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
state of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as appointed of God, nor that dissonancy that is between the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of <hi>civil Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Evangelical administrations;</hi> this is the summe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
reasoning in his 5, 6, 7, and 8 <hi>Sections. God in the Church and among the people of the Jewes,
chose out one City, to place his name there, making it the place where all the Types &amp; ceremonies which
he had appointed for the discovery, and shadowing forth of the Lord Jesus Christ, were visibly and
gloriously to be managed, acted, and held forth (sundry of them being such, as whose Typicalness
would have been destroyed by their multiplication)</hi> and principally on this account, making
that <hi>place</hi> or City (which was first <hi>Shilo) the seat of the kingdome, or habitation of the cheif
Ruler for the administration of Justice, who appointed Judges in all the land, for the good and peace
of the people:</hi> therefore the Churches of Jesus Christ, dispersed over the face of the whol world,
freed from Obligations to <hi>Cities,</hi> or <hi>Mountaines,</hi> walking before God, in, and with a pure and
spiritual worship, having no one Reason of that former institution, in common with the
Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> must be cast into the same mould and figure: I hope without offence I
may take leave to deny the Consequence, and what more I have to say to this Argument I
shall yet deferre.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Doctour</hi> proceeds to prove, that indeed the Apostles did dispose of the Churches
in this <hi>frame</hi> and order, according to the patterne of the civil goverment of the <hi>Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
and that instituted of God among the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The ninth <hi>Section,</hi> wherin he attempts the

ut &amp; ipsa Antiochia ad Hierosolymas, primariam tam latae (ut ex Philone pradiximus) provinciae
Metropolin pertinebat, &amp; ad eam ad dirimendam litem istam se conferebat.</p>
            <p>This being all that the <hi>Doctour</hi> hath to produce from the Scripture to his purpose in hand,
I have transcribed it at large; for this being removed, all that follows, will fall of it's own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>1
Then the dependance on, and subordination of lesser Citties, to the greater, is asserted
<pb facs="tcp:59070:19"/>
as an <hi>Apostolical institution;</hi> Now because I suppose the Doctour will not assert, nor doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a civil dependance, and subordination of <hi>Cities, as such,</hi> among them selves, nor will a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
as to Counsel, advice, assistance, and the like supplies which in their mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
the lesser Churches might receive from the greater and more eminent, serve
his turne: but an <hi>Ecclesiastical dependance</hi> and subordination, such as whereby many particular
Churches, with <hi>Inferiour Officers</hi> residing in them, and with them, depended on, and were
in subjection unto some one person of a superiour order, commonly residing in some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
City, and many of these Governours of a superiour order in the greater Cities were in
such subordination unto some one of <hi>high degree,</hi> termed a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and all this by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical</hi>
institution is that which he aymeth at, which being a most gallant adventure, in a <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
generation, we shall doubtless find him quitting himselfe like a man in his undertaking.</p>
            <p>2 Then he tells you <hi>that the question about Mosaical Rites, and necessity of their observation,
was referred to Jerusalem by the single Church of Antioch.</hi> But how does the Doctour make
good this first step, which yet if he could, would do him no good at all? It is true, that <hi>Paul</hi>
was now come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> ch: 14, 26: also that he was <hi>brought on his way by the Church,</hi> chap:
15. 3: but yet that the Brethren who were taught the Doctrine contested about, <hi>v.</hi> 1: were only
of the <hi>Church of Antioch</hi> (when it is most certaine from the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,
Colossians, Romanes,</hi> &amp; others, that great disturbance was raised farre and wide, in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> obout this controversy) nothing is offered. It seems indeed that their
disputes grew to the greatest height at <hi>Antioch,</hi> whether <hi>Brethren</hi> from other parts and
Churches did also come, whilest <hi>Barnabas and Paul</hi> abode there, but that <hi>that single Church</hi>
referred the determining of that controversy, to them at <hi>Jerusulem, exclusively</hi> to others, the
<hi>Doctour</hi> proves not. And it is most evident, from the returne of the Answer sent by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> v: 23: that the reference was from all the <hi>Churches of the Gentiles,</hi> yea
and all the scattered brethren, perhaps as yet not brought into Church Order, not only at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
but also throughout <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> It is then granted what he next observes, <hi>viz:</hi>
that in the Answer returned from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with them at <hi>Antioch,</hi> those in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
are joyned; the reason of it being manifest, namely their trouble about the same Controversy
being no less then theirs at <hi>Antioch.</hi> It is also granted, that as <hi>Paul passed through the Cities,</hi>
that he delivered them the <hi>decrees to keep,</hi> that were ordained, by the Apostles and Elders, ch:
16. 4: and that not only to the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which he left, <hi>c:</hi> 15. 41: but also
to those throughout <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and the <hi>Regions of Galatia</hi> v: 6. What now followes out of all
this? What? but that <hi>Antioch</hi> by <hi>Apostolical institution was the Metropolitan See of all the
Churches of Syria and Cilicia.</hi> Good <hi>Doctour</hi> do not be angry, but tell us how this may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Why doubtless it was so: <hi>as Antioch belonged to the Metropolitan Church</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as
he told us out of <hi>Philo</hi> (who was excellently acquainted with Apostolical institutions.) What
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> was to the whole Church, and Nation of the Jewes, whilest the name of God was
fixed there, we know; But what was the primitive estate of the Churches of Jesus Christ made
of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tyed neither to City, or Mountaine, I must be pardoned, if I cannot find
the <hi>Doctour</hi> making any tender of manifesting or declaring. The reasons of referring this
controversy unto a determination at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> acquaints us with, <hi>Acts</hi> 15: 2.
That we have no need of this <hi>Metro-political figment,</hi> to informe us in it. And now; if we will
not, not only submit to <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishops: but also reverence the grave <hi>Metro-Politans,</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon such cleare <hi>Apostolical institution;</hi> It is fit that all the world should count us
the arrantest <hi>Schismaticks</hi> that ever lived since <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> his time. The summe then of
this doubty Argument for the <hi>Apostolical institution of Metropolitans</hi> (that none might ever
more dare to call <hi>Diocesians</hi> into question hereafter) Is this; <hi>Paul who was converted</hi> about the
3 or 4th yeare of <hi>Caligula,</hi> 5, or 6 yeares after the <hi>Ascention</hi> of Christ, having with great success
for 3 yeares preached the Gospel, went up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> upon the Persecution
rais'd against him at <hi>Damascus</hi> Act: 9 22: whence returning to his work, he went first to <hi>Tarsus,</hi>
Act. 9. 30: thence to <hi>Antioch:</hi> where he abode <hi>one whole yeare.</hi> Act: 11. 25. 26: &amp; was then sent
to Jerusalem with the collections for the Saints about the 4th year of <hi>Claudius, Ver.</hi> 30: thence
returning againe to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he was sent out by the command of the Holy Ghost more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
&amp; peculiarly, then formerly, for the <hi>conversion of the gentiles,</hi> Act: 13. 1, 2, 3: in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
in the space of <hi>a yeare,</hi> or two, he <hi>preached,</hi> &amp; <hi>gathered Churches</hi> (whereof express menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made) at <hi>Salamis</hi> Act 13. 5: in the <hi>Isle of Paphosv.</hi> 6: at <hi>Perga in Pamphilia</hi> 13: <hi>at Antioch in
Pisidia.</hi> 14: at <hi>Iconium</hi> chap: 14. 1: at <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Derbe.</hi> v: 6: and at <hi>Perga,</hi> 26: in all these places
gathering some Believers to Christ, whom before they returned to <hi>Antioch</hi> he visited all over,
the second time, and setled <hi>Elders in the several congregations,</hi> chap: 14. 21, 22, 23: in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb facs="tcp:59070:20"/>
and travel for the propagation of the Gospel, he seemes in all places to have been follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almost at the heeles, by the professing <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who imposed the necessity of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Mosaical ceremonies</hi> upon his new Converts: for instantly upon his returne
to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where during his absence, probably they had much prevailed, he falls into
<hi>dispute with them,</hi> cap: 15. v. 1: and that he was not concerned in this controversy, only
upon the Account of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> himselfe informes us, <hi>Gal:</hi> 2. 4: affirming
that the false Brethren, which caused those disputes &amp; dissentions, crept in to <hi>spy out his liberty,</hi>
in his <hi>preaching the Gospel among the Gentiles,</hi> 2. v: that is in the places before mentioned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a great part of <hi>Asia.</hi> For the appeasing of this difference, and the establishing of the soules
of the disciples which were grieviously perplexed, with the imposition of the <hi>Mosaical yoake,</hi> It
is determined that the case should be resolved by the Apostles, <hi>Act:</hi> 15. 2: partly because of
their Authority in all the Churches, wherein those who contended with <hi>Paul</hi> would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to acquiesce, &amp; partly because those <hi>Judaizing Teachers,</hi> pretended the commission of the
Apostles for the Doctrine they preached, as is evident from the disclaimure made by them, of
any such commission or command, v: 24. Upon <hi>Paul's</hi> returne from the Assembly <hi>at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
wherein the great controversy about <hi>Jewish Ceremonies</hi> was stated, and determined, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had in the first place delivered the decree, and Apostolical salutation by <hi>Epistle</hi> to the
Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> he goes with them also to the Churches in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> expressed
in the letter by name, as also to those in <hi>Pamphilia, Pisidia, Derbe, Lystra, Iconium &amp;c.</hi> chap: 16.
v: 1, 2, 3, 4: and all the Churches which he had gathred and planted in his travells through
<hi>Asia,</hi> whereunto he was commanded by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Act: 13. 1. 2. Things being thus stated,
it necessarily followes, that the Apostles had instituted <hi>Diocesan</hi> and <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Bishops.
For though the Churches were so small, and thin, and few in number, that 7 yeares after
this, may we believe our Doctour, the Apostles had not instituted or appointed any <hi>Elders or
Presbyters in them.</hi> viz: when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> which was when he was
Prisoner in <hi>Rome,</hi> as appeares, <hi>cap:</hi> 1, 7, 13, 14: <hi>chap:</hi> 4, 22: about the third yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> yet
that he had fully built and setled the <hi>Hierarchical</hi> fabrick contended for, who once dares
question?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Audacia-</l>
               <l>Creditur à multis fiducia.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But if this will not do, yet <hi>Ignatius</hi> hits the nayle on the head, and is ready at hand to
make good, whatsoever the <hi>Doctour</hi> will have him say, and his Testimonie takes up the sense
of the 2 next <hi>following Sections,</hi> whereof the first is as followes.</p>
            <p>Hinc dicti Ignatianiratio constat in Epistolâ ad Romanos, ubi ille antiochiae Episcopus se <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

            <p>But yet I feare the <hi>Doctour</hi> will find he hath need of other weapons, and other manner of
Assistance to make good the cause he hath undertaken. The words of <hi>Ignatius</hi> in that Epistle
to the <hi>Romans</hi> are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
Because he recommends to them that particular Church in <hi>Syria,</hi> which by his imprisonment
was deprived of it's Pastor, therefore without doubt he was a <hi>Metropolitical Arch-Bishop:
Tytere tu patulae &amp;c:</hi> But the <hi>Doctour</hi> is resolved to carry his cause, and therefore
being forsaken of all fair and honest meanes, from whence he might hope for assistance or
successe, he tryes (as <hi>Saul</hi> the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi>) the counterfeit, spurious <hi>Title,</hi> of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Epistle to the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> to see if that will speak any comfortable words, for his relief
or no. And to make sure worke, he causes this gentleman so to speak, as if he intended to make
us believe that <hi>Syria was in Antioch,</hi> not <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> as in some remote parts of the world,
they say they enquire whether <hi>London</hi> be in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Londan.</hi> What other
sense can be made of the words as by the <hi>Doctour</hi> transcribed? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>To the Church of God dwelling in Syria which is in Antioch:</hi> now if this be so, I
shall confess it is possible we may be in more errours then one, and that we much want the
Learned <hi>Doctour's</hi> assistance for our information; the words themselves as they are used by
the worshipful writer of that Epistle will scarce furnish us with this learned and rare notion,
they are at length. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (for so he first opens his mouth with a lye) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
What is here more expressed, then that the latter passage, <hi>in Antioch,</hi> is restrictive
of what went &amp; before was spoken of it's residence in <hi>Syria,</hi> with reference to the name of
<hi>Christian,</hi> first given to the Disciples in that place, I know not: and therefore it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb facs="tcp:59070:20"/>
that the <hi>Apostles</hi> instituted <hi>Metropolitan Arch-Bishops <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to make all sure the learned <hi>Doctour</hi> will not so give over: But Sect: 11, he adds that
the <hi>Epigraphe of the Epistle to the Romans, grants him the whole case</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

            </p>
            <p>Although I have spent some time in the consideration of mens conjectures of those <hi>subur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicarian
Churches,</hi> that (as is pretended) are here pointed to, and the rise of the <hi>Bishop of Rom's
jurisdiction</hi> over those Churches, in a correspondency to the civil goverment of the <hi>Prefect</hi> of
the City, yet so great a Critick in the Greek tongue as <hi>Casaubon. Exerc: 16. ad An:</hi> 150:
having professed that expression: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>unintelligible,</hi> I
shall not contend about it. For the presidency mentioned of the Church in, or at <hi>Rome,</hi> that it
was a presidency of <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> and not only an <hi>eminency of faith and holinesse</hi> that is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Doctour thinks it not incumbent on him to prove: those with whom he hath to do,
are of another mind: although by this time some Alteration might be attempted, yea there
was, as else where shall be shewed: and so much for <hi>Ignatius</hi> his <hi>Archi-Episcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The example of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is urged in the next place in these words: <hi>idem de Alexandriâ,
de quâ Eusebius. Marcum <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Ecclesias (in plurali)

suscepisse Annianum, Neronis anno octavo idem Eusebius affirmat: quibus patet primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Alexandriae &amp; Patriarchalem cathedram fixam esse, ad quam reliquae provinciae illius ecclesiae
à Marco plantatae, ut ad metropoliticam suam pertinebant;</hi> doubtless. for 1 There is not any
passage in any ancient <hi>Author,</hi> more clearly discovering the uncertainty of many things in
Antiquity, then this pointed to by the Doctour in <hi>Eusebius.</hi> For first, the sending of <hi>Mark
the Evangelist</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his preaching there at <hi>Alexandria</hi> what he had written in <hi>the
Gospel,</hi> is but a <hi>report. Men said so,</hi> but what ground they had for their saying so, he relates not.
And yet we know what a foundation of many Assertions by following Writers, this Rumor
or report is made to be. 2 In the very next words the Authour affirmes and insists long
upon it in the next Chapter that <hi>Philo's book, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> was written concerning the
Christians converted <hi>by Mark's</hi> preaching at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when it is notoriously known that
it treateth of the <hi>Essens,</hi> a Sect among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> amongst whole observances many things
were vaine, superstitious, and foolish; unworthy to be once applauded as the practise of any
<hi>Christian</hi> in those dayes: that same <hi>Philo,</hi> as far as can be gathred living and dying in the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Religion,</hi> having been employed by them with an <hi>Apology</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> in the daies of <hi>Caligula.</hi>
But 3. Suppose that <hi>Marke</hi> were at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and preached the Gospel there, which
is not improbable, and planted sundry Churches in that great and populous City of <hi>Jewes</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that as an <hi>Evangelist</hi> the care of those Churches was upon him, in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner, nay, and adde farther that after his death, as <hi>Hierome</hi> assures us, the <hi>Elders</hi>
and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of those <hi>Churches,</hi> chose out one among themselves to <hi>Praeside</hi> in their convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
&amp; meetings; If I say all this be supposed, what will ensue? why then it is manifest that
there was fixed at <hi>Alexandria</hi> a <hi>Patriarchal Chaire,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Metro-political</hi> Church, according to
the <hi>Appointment</hi> of Jesus Chirst by his Apostles, <hi>Si hoc non sit probationum satis, nescio quid sit sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
If some few congregations live together in love, and communion, and the fellowship of the
Gospel in a City, he is stark blind that sees not that to be an <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> See. The reason is
as cleare as his in the <hi>Comedian,</hi> for the freedome of his <hi>Wife. Sy: utinam Phrygiam uxorem
meam unâ mecum videam liberam</hi> Dem: <hi>Optimam mulierem quidem. Sy: Et quidem nepoti
tuo, hujus filio, hodiè, primam mammam dedit haec.</hi> Dem: <hi>herclè, verô, serio, siquidem primam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
hand dubium quin emitti Aequam siet. Mic: ob eam rem?</hi> Dem: <hi>ob eam:</hi> and there is an end of
the contest. The Doctour indeed hath sundry other Sections added to these foregoing, which
as they concerne times more remote from those who first received the <hi>Apostolical institutions,</hi>
so I must ingeniously profess that I cannot see any thing, wheron to fasten a <hi>suspition of a
proof,</hi> so far as to call it into examination, and therefore I shall absolve the Reader from
the penalty of this Digression.</p>
            <p>The truth is when I first named <hi>Ignatius</hi> for a witness in the cause I am pleading for, I lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

            <p>He seemes (in the first place) to speak sufficiently clearly, to the death of Christ for his
<hi>Church,</hi> for <hi>Believers,</hi> in a peculiar manner, which is one considerable bottome, and foundation

<hi>Chaffe,</hi> the <hi>Wheat</hi> abides, and the <hi>rooted Tree</hi> is not cast down. Those fall away, who indeed

within the compass of that span of time, which our adversaries, without proof, without shame,
claime to be theirs. One Principal foundation of our Doctrine, is the bestowing of the holy
Ghost upon Believers by Jesus Christ. Where he is so bestowed, there say we he abides: for he
is given them for that end. <hi>viz: to abide with them for ever.</hi> Now concerning him <hi>Basil</hi> tells us,

            <p>As I sayd, we have the summe of Mr. <hi>Goodwin's Book</hi> in this declaration of the Judgment of
the <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> so also in particular the state of the Controversy about the <hi>perseverance</hi>
of the Saints as then it was debated; &amp; I doubt not but the <hi>learned Reader</hi> will easily perceive
it to be no other, then that which is now agitated between me &amp; Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi> The controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
indeed in the matter between <hi>Austin</hi> and the <hi>Pelagians</hi> was reduced to 3 heads 1. As to the
<hi>Foundation of it,</hi> which <hi>Austin</hi> concluded to be the <hi>decree of Predestination,</hi> which they denyed:
the <hi>Impulsive Cause</hi> of it, he proved to be the Free grace of God, &amp; <hi>the measure or quality of
that Grace</hi> to be such, as that whoever received it, did persevere, it being perseverance which
was given, both which they denyed: about the <hi>kind of faith,</hi> which <hi>Temporary</hi> professours
might have, and fall from it, which were never elected, there was between them no Contest
at all. Of his Judgment then, there were these two main heads which he laboured to confirme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That perseverance is a gift of God, and that no man either did, or could persevere in Faith and
obedience upon the strength of any grace received,</hi> (much less of his own Ability, stirred up and
promoted by such considerations, as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> makes the ground and bottome of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
of all that so do) <hi>but that the whole was from his Grace.</hi> Subservient to this, he
maintained, that <hi>no one Temptation whatsoever, could be overcome but by some Act of Grace,</hi>
and that therfore perseverance must needs be a work thereof, it being an abiding in Faith and
obedience, notwithstanding, and against Temptation. To this is that of his on <hi>Joh: Hom.</hi> 53;
<pb facs="tcp:59070:23"/>
               <hi>quosdam nimia voluntatis suoe fiducia extulit in superbiam, &amp; quosdam nimia volunta tis sua dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidentia
dejecit in negligentiam: Illi dicunt quid rogamus Deum ne vincamur tentatione quod in
nostrâ est potestate? Isti dicunt, at quid conamur bene vivere, quod in Dei est Potestate? ô Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
ô Pater qui es in Coelis, ne nos infer as in quamlibet istarum Tentationum, sed libera nos à
malo. Audiamus Dominum dicentem, rogavi pro Te Petre, ne fides deficiat tuae; ne sic existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memus
fidem nostram esse in Libero Arbitrio ut Divino non egeat adjutorio. &amp;c.</hi> That, with
both of these sorts of men, the way and work of the Grace of God, is at this day perverted,
and obscured, is so known to all, that it needs no Exemplification. Some require no more
to the Conquest of Temptations, but men's own <hi>rational consideration</hi> of their Eternal state
and condition, with the tendency of That, whereto they are tempted: Others <hi>turning the
Grace of God into wantonness,</hi> &amp; supinely casting away all heedful regard of walking with God,
being enslaved to their lusts and corruptions, under a pretence of God's working <hi>all in all.</hi>
The latter denying themselves to be men, the former to be men corrupted; And in plaine
terms the <hi>Milevitane Councel</hi> tells us, <hi>si quis finxerit ideò Gratiam esse necessariam ad vitanda
peccata, quia facit hominem cognoscere peccata, &amp; discernere inter Peccata, &amp; non peccata, quá Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretione
per gratiam habitâ, per liberum Arbitrium potest vitare; is procùl, &amp;c.</hi> The light of Grace
to discerne the state of things, the nature of sinne, and to consider these aright, the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
allowed, which is all the Bottome of that perseverance of Saints, which we have offered by
<hi>Mr. Goodwin:</hi> but upon that supplie of these meanes, to abide and persevere in faith, to fly
and avoid sinne, is a thing of our own performance.</p>

the matter, &amp; manner of the thing in hand, is fully delivered: <hi>in hoc loco miseriarum, ubi tentatio

glorietur, per hoc de ipsa perseverantiâ Boni noluit Deus Sanctos suos in viribus suis, sed in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

Spiritu Sancto accenditur voluntas eorum, ut ideò possint quia sic volunt, ideò sic velint, quia
Deus operatur ut velint. Nam si tantâ infirmitate hujus vitae ipsis relinquetur voluntas sua, ut
in Adjutorio Dei, fine quo perseverare non possent, manerent si vellent, ne Deus in eis operaretur ut
velint, inter tot, &amp; tantas tentationes, infirmitate suâ succumberet voluntas, &amp; ideò persever are non
possent, quia deficientes infirmitate voluntatis non vellent, aut non ita vellent, ut possent. Subven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est igitur infirmitati voluntatis humanae, ut divinâ gratiâ indeclinabiliter, &amp; insuper abilitaèr
ageretur, &amp; ideò quamvis infirma non tamen deficiat:</hi> It is not possible that any one should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
his sense more clearly, to the whole of our present Contest, than this holy and learned
man hath done, in the words now repeated from him: <hi>A gift</hi> of God he asserts it to be, (and
not an Act or course of our own, whereto we are prompted by certaine <hi>Considerations,</hi> and
assisted with such outward meanes as are also added to us) to the real production of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
by the efficiency of the Grace of God. And for the manner of this work, it is faith he,
by the effectual working, the Actual will of perseverance (in the continuance of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
in a Dispensation of Grace, different from, and beyond what was given to him, who
had a Power of Persevering <hi>if he would;</hi> but received not the will thereof. Now to <hi>Adam's</hi>
Perseverance there was nothing wanting, but his <hi>wills confirmation</hi> in obedience and his Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:59070:23"/>
doing so. Power he had <hi>within,</hi> and meanes <hi>without</hi> abundantly sufficient, for that end
in their kind. This then He asserts to be given to the Saints, and to be the work of God
in them; even their <hi>Actual Perseverance.</hi> Without this he also manifesteth that such is the
infirmity of our wills, and such the Power of our Temptations (that what meanes so ever may
be supplyed and left to their Power, or what man-like rational considerations whatever man
may engage his thoughts into) that it is impossible any should persevere to the end: which
<hi>Bradwardine</hi> more confirmes, <hi>De Caus: Dei Lib: 2. Cap. 8. Coroll: Omne quod est naturale, &amp;
non est per se Tale, si manere debeat immutatum, oportet quòd innitatur continuè ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

quare quilibet justus Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the holy man (<hi>Austin</hi> I meane) concludes, that this work of God being wrought in
a man, his will is indeclinably and inseperably fixed so to obedience, as not to fall off from
God. This is the foundation that He layes of the Doctrine of the <hi>Perseverance of Saints:</hi>
That it is a Gift of God, and that such a Gift, as he effectually, and Actually works in him
on whom he doth bestow it.</p>
            <p>A Foundation that will by no meanes regularly beare the <hi>hay &amp; stubble,</hi> wherewith men think
to build up a Doctrine of perseverance: making it a fruit that may, or may not be brought
forth, from our own use of the meanes allowed for that end &amp; purpose. And indeed the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Perseverance of the Saints in that way, is as bad, if not a worse and more fearful
opposition to, and slighting of the Grace of God, as the denyal of it, in the way they oppose:
By the latter they oppose the Grace of God, by the former, set up the Power and strength of
their own will. Thus far <hi>Austin</hi> is clearly engaged with us; <hi>that perseverance is a Gift of God,
that it is given by him to every one that doth persevere: that every one to whom it is given, is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably
confirmed in Grace, and shall infallibly persevere to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that earnest, and long Contest, which that learned Doctor insists upon, to prove Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
to be the Gift of God (for which he hath sufficient ground from that of the Apostle,
1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1. 7, 8: <hi>that ye come behind in no Gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus &amp;c.</hi>) two
things he especially aimed at: first, an opposing of <hi>such a Perseverance,</hi> as should not be the fruit
&amp; work of the Grace of God in us: but the work and Effect of our own endeavours, upon a
supply of such meanes, motives, perswasions, &amp; considerations as we are, or may be furnished
withal. Secondly, that it is so given and bestowed, as that on whomsoever it is bestowed, he
certainly hath it, that is, <hi>he doth certainly Persevere.</hi> As it was <hi>Heresy</hi> to that holy man, to
deny <hi>Perseverance</hi> to be the Gift of God, so it was ridiculous to him, to say that that <hi>Gift</hi>

on whom it was bestowed, a <hi>will to Persevere,</hi> and on that account <hi>Perseverance it selfe</hi> (an

he had not only the consent of all the sound, and Orthodox Doctours in his time, as was
before manifested; but he is followed also by the <hi>School men</hi> of all ages, and not forsaken by

of the Doctrine of this learned man, which hath given occasion to some, to pretend
his consent in opposition to that, which most evidently He not only delivered, but confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
There are in <hi>Austine,</hi> and those that either joyned with him, or followed immediately
after him, (notwithstanding the Doctrine formerly insisted on, that <hi>Actual perseverance is a
Gift of God,</hi> and that <hi>it flowes from Predestination as an Effect thereof, and is bestowed on all Elect
Believers, infallibly preserving them unto the end:</hi> (wherein they assert, and strongly prove, the
whole of what we maintaine) sundry Expressions commonly urged by the Adversaries of the
truth in hand, granting many who were Saints, believing and Regenerate, to fall away and
perish for ever: I need not instance in any of their sayings to this purpose: the Reader knowes
where to find them gathered to his hand, in <hi>Vossius, Grotius,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> from them. The
seeming contradiction that is amongst themselves in the delivery of this doctrine, will easily
admit of a Reconciliation, may they be allowed the common courtesy of being Interpreters
of their own meaning. What weight in those dayes was layd upon the Participation of the
<hi>Sacramental</hi> figures of Grace, and what expressions are commonly used concerning them who
had obtained that Priviledge is known to all. Hence all <hi>baptised</hi> persons continuing in the
Profession of the Faith, and Communion of the Church, they called, counted, esteemed tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regenerate, and justified, and spake so of them: Such as these they constantly affirme, might
fall away into everlasting destruction: but yet what their judgment was, concerning their
present state indeed, even then when they so termed them <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and <hi>Believers,</hi> in respect
to the Sacraments of those Graces, <hi>Austine</hi> in sundry places clearly delivers his thoughts,
to the undeceiving of all that are willing to be free: This he especially handles in his book

nature and causes of <hi>holyness, grace,</hi> and <hi>walking with God</hi> that they would be found, not to be
truly, and really in that state and condition, that they were esteemed to be in; of which they
thought this a sufficient Demonstration, even because they <hi>did not persevere:</hi> which undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
on the other hand (with the testimonies foregoing, and the like inumerable that might
be produced) evinces, that their constant judgment was, that all who are truly, really, and in
the sight of God believers, ingrafted into Christ, and adopted into his family, should certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Persevere:</hi> and that all the passages usually cited out of this holy and learned man, to
perswade us that he ever cast an eye towards the Doctrine of the Apostacy of the Saints, may
particularly be refer'd to this head, and manifested that they do not at all concerne those,
whom he esteemed <hi>Saints indeed;</hi> which is cleere from the consideration of what hath been
insisted on. Thus far <hi>He,</hi> of whom what were the thoughts of the Church of God in the
dayes wherein he lived, hath been declared: <hi>He</hi> who hath been esteemed amongst the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical

Grace of God, then all that went before him, or any that have followed after him, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne

            <p>Of those that lived after the days of the forementioned, (I meane all of them but the last)
that I may not cloy the Reader, I shall not mention any, until the business of Divinity,
and the profession of it, was taken up by the <hi>School-men</hi> and <hi>Canonists,</hi> who from a mixture
of Divine and Homane principles, framed the whole body of it anew, and gave it over
into the possession of the present <hi>Romish Church,</hi> moulded for the most part to the worldly
carnal Interests of them on whom they had their Dependency, in their several generations.</p>
            <p>But yet as there was none of those, but one way or other, was eminently conducing to the
carrying on of the mystery of Iniquity, by depraving, perverting, and corrupting one Truth
or other of the Gospel, so all of them did not in all Things equally corrupt their waies, but
gave some Testimony more or less to some Truths, as they received them from those that
went before them; so fell it out in the matter of the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> and the <hi>Corruption of the
Nature of man:</hi> though some of them laboured to corrode, and corrupt the ancient received
Doctrine thereof, so some againe contended with all their might in their way, and by their
Arguments to defend it; as is evident in the Instance of <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> crying out to God, and
<hi>Man</hi> to help in the Cause of God against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in his Dayes, in particular complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>great Master</hi> of their Divinity. So that notwithstanding all their Corruptions,
these ensuing Principles pass currantly among the most eminent of Them, as to the Doctrine
under consideration, which continue in credit with many of their <hi>Sophistical</hi> Successours to
this Day.</p>
            <p>1 That <hi>Perseverance is a grace of God,</hi> bestowed according to <hi>Predestination,</hi> or <hi>Election,</hi>
on men; that is, that God gives it to Believers, that are <hi>Predestinated,</hi> and <hi>Elected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 That on whomsoever the <hi>Grace of Perseverance</hi> is bestowed, they do <hi>Persevere</hi> to the
end; and it is impossible in some sense, that they should otherwise Doe.</p>
            <p>3 That none who are not predestinate, what grace soever they may be made partakers of
in this world, shall constantly continue to the end.</p>
            <p>4 That no Believer can by his own strength or power (incited, or stirred up, by what <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
or rational considerations so ever) Persevere</hi> in the Faith; the Grace of Perseverance being
a gift of God: <hi>It</hi> is true; that their Judgments being perverted by sundry other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Principles, <hi>about the Nature, and Efficacy of Sacraments,</hi> with their <hi>Conveyance</hi> of
Grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and out of Ignorance of the Righteousness of God, and the Real work
of Regeneration, they generally maintaine (though <hi>Bradwardine</hi> punctually exprest himselfe
to be of another mind) that many Persons, not Predestinate, may come to believe, yet fall
away and perish.</p>
            <p>Now the Truth is, it is properly no part of the Controversy under consideration, whether,
or how far, and in what sense, men by Reason of the Profession, &amp; Participation of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with the work, &amp; effect of common Grace upon them, may be sayd to be True Believers;
but the whole, upon the matter, of what we plead for is comprised in the Assertions now ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to them; which that it is done upon sufficient grounds, will be manifest by calling in some
few, of the most eminent of Them, to speak in their own words, what their thoughts were in
this matter.</p>
            <p>To bring them in, I desire that one who (though none of Them) was eminent in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
for a mixture of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> in those dayes wherin they had their eminent rise

This <hi>Profound Learned Doctour</hi> proposes this <hi>Thesis</hi> to be confirmed in the following Chapter:

following he disputes out of the Scriptures, and Antient writers abundantly cited to his
purpose, that there is <hi>no possibility of the Perseverance of any Believer in the faith to the end, upon
such Helpes, considerations, and Advantages</hi> as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> proposeth, as the only meanes
thereof. <hi>That Perseverance it selfe is a gift of God,</hi> without which gift, and Grace, none can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe;
the and <hi>specialty</hi> of that Grace, he expresseth in the <hi>Corollary</hi> wherewith he closeth the
Chapter: which is, <hi>quod nullus viator, solius liberi Arbitrii, vel Gratiae Viribus, aut amborum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim,
sine alio Dei Auxilio speciali, potest persever are per aliquod Tempus omnino.</hi> Further as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
the efficacy of special grace, in, and for every good work whatever: His Arguments
and Testimonies I shall not need to recite; they are at hand to those who desire to consult
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the vindication of the former</hi> Thesis, <hi>Chap. 9. 10. Chap. 11: he proposeth further this
proposition, to a right understanding of the Doctrine of Perseverance.</hi> Quod perseverantia
non est aliquod Donum Dei creatum, à Charitate, &amp; Gratiâ realiter differens: <hi>And the Corollary
wherewith he shuts up that disputation is,</hi> quòd Nomen Perseverantiae nullam rem absolutam
essentialiter significat, sed accidentaliter, &amp; relativè; Charitatem videlicet, sive justitiam cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu

            <p>After this, knowing well what Conclusion would easily be inferred from these principles,
<hi>viz: That Perseverance is not really distinct from Faith and Love, that it as such a Grace, and
Gift of God that who ever it's bestowed upon shall certainly persevere;</hi> namely, that every one who
hath received True Grace, Faith and Love, shall certainly persevere: He objects that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and plainly grants it to be so indeed, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. And to make the matter more cleare,
<hi>chap.</hi> 13: he disputes; that, <hi>Auxilium sine quo nullus perseverat, &amp; per quod quilibet perseverat,
est Spiritus Sanctus, Divina bonitas, &amp; voluntas.</hi> Every Cause of bringing sinful man to God,
is called by them <hi>Auxilium:</hi> in these three, <hi>Spiritus Sanctus, Divina Bonitas, &amp; Voluntas,</hi>
he comprizeth the cheif Causes of Perseverance, as I have also done in the ensuing Treatise.
By [<hi>Divina Voluntas</hi>] he intends God's eternal, and Immutable decree, as he manifests, <hi>cap.</hi>
8.9: whither he sends his Reader. His, <hi>Divina Bonitas,</hi> is that <hi>free Grace,</hi> whereby God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and justifies us as his. <hi>Spirtus Sanctus,</hi> is <hi>Sanctification;</hi> So that he affirmes the <hi>perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of the Saints to consist in the stability of their <hi>Acceptation with God,</hi> and continuance of
their <hi>Sanctification from him,</hi> upon the account of his <hi>unchangeable purposes and Decrees,</hi> which
is the summe of what we contend for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is part of the Doctrine, concerning the Grace of God, and his soveraingty over
the wills of men, which</hi> Bradwardine <hi>in his dayes cryed out so earnestly for the Defence of

            <p>With this earnestness above 300 years agoe did this <hi>profoundly</hi> learned man press the <hi>Popes</hi>
to a determination of these Controversyes, against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and their Successours in his
Schooles. The same suit hath ever since been continued by very many Learned men, (in every
Age,) of the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> crying out for the <hi>Papal</hi> definitive Sentence
against the <hi>Pelagian</hi> errours crept into their Church; especially hath this <hi>out-cry</hi> with suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
been renewed by the <hi>Dominican Fryars,</hi> ever since the <hi>Jesuites</hi> have so cunningly guilded
over that <hi>Pelagian</hi> Poyson, &amp; set it out, as the best, &amp; most wholsome food for the <hi>Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and her children. Yea with such earnestnes hath this been in the last Age pursued, by
Agents in the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> that (a Congregation <hi>de Auxiliis</hi> being purposely appointed) it
was generally supposed one while, that they would have prevailed in their suit, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:59070:26"/>
a <hi>definitive Sentence</hi> on their side, against their Adversaries. But through the just Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God, upon a <hi>pack</hi> of bloudy persecuting Idolaters, giving them up more and more
to the <hi>Beliefe of Lyes,</hi> contrary almost to the expectation of all men, This very yeare 1653
<hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the tenth, who now weares the <hi>Triple Crowne</hi> conjured by the subtilty, and
dreadful interest of the <hi>Jesuites</hi> in all nations, that as yet <hi>wonder after him,</hi> by a Solemne
Bull, or Papal Consistorian Determination, in the Case of <hi>Jansenius Bishop of Ypress,</hi> hath
turned the Scales upon his first Suppliants, and Cast the Cause on the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Side. But of
that whole business elsewhere.</p>
            <p>I shall not perplex the Reader, with the <hi>Horrid names,</hi> of <hi>Trombet, Holcot, Bricot, Sychet,
Tartaret, Brulifer,</hi> nor with their <hi>more Horrid</hi> termes and expressions. Let the one <hi>Angelical
Doctor</hi> answer for the rest of his Companions.</p>
            <p>That this man then (one of the great Masters of the Crew) abode by the Principles of
him before insisted on, may quickly be made evident by some few instances clearing his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
herein:</p>
            <p>This in the first place he every where insists on; that <hi>no Habitual grace received, no improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that can be made of it, by the utmost ability, diligence, and the most rays'd Considerations
of the best of men, will cause any one certainly to Persevere, without the peculiar preservation of
God.</hi> Of this he gives his Reason: <hi>Lib. 3. Contrà Gent: Ca: 155. Illud quod Naturâ sua est
Variabile, ad hoc, quod figatur in uno, indiget Auxilio alicujus moventis immobilis; sed liberum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium

And will not this man think you, who in his gropings after Light, when darkness covered
the Face of the Earth, and thick darkness was upon the Inhabitants thereof, with this his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
(of the impotency of the best of the Saints for <hi>Perseverance,</hi> upon the Account of any
Grace received, because of the perpetual powerful rebellion of <hi>indwelling Lust,</hi> and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and that all that do persevere, are <hi>preserved by the power of God unto salvation</hi>) rise in
Judgment against Those who in our Dayes, wherin the Sun of Righteousness is risen with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
under his wings, do ascribe a sufficiency unto men in themselves upon the bottome of
their <hi>Rational Considerations,</hi> to abide with God, or Persevere to the end?</p>
            <p>And this assertion of the <hi>Angelical Doctour</hi> is notably confirmed by <hi>Didacus Alvarez</hi> in
his Vindication of it from the exception of <hi>Medina,</hi> that <hi>we make use of habits when we will, &amp;
if men will make use of their Habitual Grace, they may persevere, without relation to any After
Grace of God:</hi> saith he: <hi>Respondetur, Habitibus quidem Nos uticùm volumus, sed ut velimus illis
uti, praerequiritur Motio Dei efficax, praemovens Liberum Arbitrium, ut utatur Habitu ad operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
&amp; operetur bonum, praesertim quando Habitus sunt supernaturales; quia cùm pertineant ad
superiorem Ordinem, habent specialem Rationem, propter quam potentia merè naturalis non utitur
eisdem Habitibus, nisi speciali Dei Auxilio moveatur: Alvar: de Aux: Lib. 10. Disput.</hi> 100.
Though received Graces are reckoned by him as <hi>supernatural Habits,</hi> yet such as we act not
by, nor with, but from new supplies from God.</p>
            <p>Having layd down this Principle, <hi>Thomas</hi> proceeds to manifest, that there is <hi>a special Grace
of Perseverance,</hi> bestowed by God on some, and that on whomsoever it is bestowed, they
<hi>certainly, and infallibly, persevere to the end: p: p: Quaest:</hi> 109: <hi>A: 10 C:</hi> and <hi>contrà Gent: Lib.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he proves this Assertion from <hi>P: 6. 1 Pet: 5: 10. Psal:</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59070:26"/>
But to spare the Reader, I shall give you this man's judgment, together with one of his Followers,
who hath had the happiness to cleare his Masters minde, above any that have undertaken the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his Doctrine, in that part now controverted in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; therein I shall manifest
(what I formerly proposed) what <hi>Beamings,</hi> and <hi>Irradiations</hi> of this Truth, do yet glide through that
gross darkness, which is spread upon the face of the <hi>Romish Synagogue</hi> (referring what I have further
to adde on this head, to the account which God assisting I shall ere long give of the present <hi>Jansenian
Controversies,</hi> in my Considerations on Mr. <hi>Biddles</hi> Catechismes, a taske by authority lately imposed on
me.) This is <hi>Didacus Alvarez</hi> whose 10th Book <hi>de Auxiliis</hi> treats peculiarly of this Subject of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
In the entrance of his disputation he layes down the same Principles with the <hi>Former,</hi> concerning
the necessity of the Peculiar Grace of Perseverance to this end that any one may persevere. <hi>Disput:</hi> 103.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Disp:</hi> 108 He further manifests, that this <hi>gift, or Grace of Perseverance,</hi> does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on any <hi>Conditions</hi> in us, or any Cooperation of our wills. His position he layes down
in these words: <hi>Donum perseverantiae, in ratione Doni perseverantiae, &amp; efficacia illius, nullo modo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendet

                  </expan> ab efficaci, &amp; absoluto Decreto
Voluntatis ejus, qui pro suâ misericordiâ tribuit illud Donum cui vult.</hi> In the further proof of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
he manifests by clear Testimonies that the Contrary Doctrine hereunto, was that of the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi>
and <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> which <hi>Austine</hi> opposed in sundry Treatises. And in all the Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he further confirmes it, he still presses the absurdity of making the Promise of God concerning
Perseverance <hi>Conditional,</hi> and so suspending it on any thing, in and by us to be performed. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all the Acts whereby we persevere, flowing <hi>according to him</hi> from the Grace of perseverance, it
cannot but be absurd to make the Efficient Cause in it's <hi>Efficiency, and operation,</hi> to depend upon it's <hi>own
effect:</hi> This also is with him <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> that the Grace of perseverance should be given to any, and he
not persevere; or be promised, and yet not given: yet withal he grants in his following <hi>Conclusions,</hi> that
our wills <hi>secundarily,</hi> and in <hi>dependency,</hi> do cooperate in our Perseverance.</p>
            <p>The second Principle this <hi>learned School-man</hi> insists on, is, that this gift of perseverance <hi>is peculiar to
the Elect, or praedestinate:</hi> Disput: 104. 1. Con: <hi>Donum perseverantiae est proprium Praedstinaterum, ut nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li

as is pendent in the ayre, and <hi>expectant</hi> of men's good final Deportment; but that which is
the <hi>eternal, free fountaine of all that grace, whereof in time by Jesus Christ we are made Partakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the pursuit of this proposition, he further proves at large, that the persverance given to the
Saints in Christ, is not a supplement of <hi>Helps,</hi> and <hi>advantages,</hi> whereby they <hi>may preserve it if they will;</hi>
but such as causes them, on whom it is bestowed <hi>certainly,</hi> &amp; <hi>actually</hi> so to do: and that in it's efficacy,
and operation, it cannot depend on any <hi>free cooperation</hi> of our wills, all the <hi>Good</hi> Acts tending to
our perseverance, being fruits of that Grace which is bestowed on us, according to the absolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
Decree of the will of God.</p>
            <p>This indeed is common with this Authour and the Rest of his associates (the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

to grant, that many may be, &amp; are <hi>Regenerate,</hi> &amp; made True Believers, who are not predestinate, &amp; that
these cannot persevere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor shall eventually be saved. Certaine it is, that there is not any Truth, which
that Generation of men do receive, &amp; admit, but more or less it suffers in their Hands, from that gross
ignorance of the <hi>free Grace of God in Jesus Crhist,</hi> the power whereof they are practically under: what
the poor <hi>Vassailes,</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> will do, upon the late Bull of their <hi>Holy Father</hi> casting them in sundry
maine Concernements of their Quarrel, with their Adversaries, is uncertaine; otherwise setting aside
some such deviations, as the above mentioned, (whereunto they are enforced, by their Ignorance of
the <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> with is in Jesus Christ,) there is so much of Antient Candid Truth in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> preserved, and asserted in the writings of the <hi>Dominican
Fryers,</hi> as will rise up (as I sayd before) in Judgment against those of our Dayes, who enjoying greater
Light, &amp; Advantages, do yet close in with those and are long since <hi>Cursed Enemies</hi> of the grace of God.</p>

the light of this glorious Truth prevailed, for an Acknowledgment of it: The first of these is
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whose disputes to this purpose, being full, and large, and the Authour in allmens hands,
I shall not transcribe his assertions, &amp; arguments; but only referre the Reader to his <hi>l. 2. de Grat. &amp; l. Ar.

upon the whole of this Matter, <hi>Lib. 11. de perpetuitat: vel Amis: Grat: Cap. 2. Sect.</hi> 6. saith he: <hi>de praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natis

he hath briefly comprized the summe of that, which is by us contended for.</p>
            <p>It was in my Thoughts in the last place to have added the concurrent witness of all the <hi>reformed
Churches,</hi> which that of the most eminent Divines, which have written in the defence of their Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but this Trouble, upon second considerations, I shall spare the <hi>Reader</hi> &amp; my selfe: for, as many other
reasons lye against the Prosecuting of this Designe, so especially the <hi>uselesness</hi> of spending-Time, and
paines, for the demonstration of a thing of so evident a truth, prevailes with me to desist; Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Indeavours of <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> to wrest the words of some of the most antient Writers, who
laboured in the first Reformation of the Churches; I presume no unprejudiced Person in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
acquainted with the <hi>systeme</hi> of <hi>that Doctrine,</hi> which with so much paines, diligence, piety, and
Learning, they promoted in the world, with the clearness of their Judgments, in going forth to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
compass of their Principles which they received, and their constancy to themselves, in asserting
of the Truthes they embraced, owned by their Friends and Adversaries, until such time as <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi>
discovered their selfe Contradictions, will scarce be moved once to question their Judgments by the
<hi>Excerpta</hi> of <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi> Cap: 15: of his Treatise: so that of this discourse this is the Issue.</p>
            <p>There remaines only that I give a brief account of some concernments of the ensuing Treatise, and
dismisse the Reader from any further Attendance in the <hi>Porch,</hi> or entrance thereof.</p>
            <p>The Title of the book speakes of the Aime and Method of it; the Confutation of <hi>Mr. Goodwin</hi>
was but secundarily in my eye; and the best way for that I judged to consist, in a full Scriptural Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Truth he opposed. That I cheifly intended, and therein I hope the pious Reader, may
through the Grace of God, meet with satisfaction. In my undertaking to affirme the Truth of what I
assert, the Thing it selfe first, and then the manifestation of it, was in my Consideration: for the thing
it selfe, my arguing hath been to discover the Nature of it, it's principles, and causes, it's relation to
the <hi>Good will</hi> of the Father, the <hi>mediations</hi> of the Son and <hi>dispensation</hi> of the Holy Ghost to the Saints
thereupon; it's use and tendency, in, and unto that <hi>fellowship with the Father and the Son,</hi> whereunto
we are called and admitted.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>manner of it's Revelation,</hi> the proper <hi>seates</hi> of it in the Book of God, the <hi>occasion</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
thereof, in several seasons, the <hi>Significant Expressions</hi> wherein it is set forth, and the receiving of
it by them, to whom it was revealed, have been diligently remarked.</p>
            <p>In those parts of the Discourse, which tend to the vindication of the Arguments from Scripture,
whereby the Truth pleaded for is confirmed, of the usefulness of the thing it selfe contended about &amp;c.
I have been I hope Careful to keep my Discourse from degenerating into <hi>Jangling,</hi> and <hi>strife of
words</hi> (the usual Issue of <hi>Polemical</hi> writings) being not altogether <hi>Ignorant of the devices of Satan,</hi> and
the usual carnal Attendencies of such proceedings: The weight of the Truth in hand, The Common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of all the Saints, in their walking with God therein, sense of my own duty, &amp; the near approach of
the Account which I must make of the ministration to me Committed, have given bounds and limits
to my whole discourse, as to the manner of handling the Truth therein asserted. Writing in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
language of the Nation,</hi> about the <hi>Common possession of the Saints,</hi> the meanest and weakest as well
as the wisest and the most learned, labouring in the workes of Christ and his Gospel, I durst not hide
the understanding of what I aim'd at, by mingling the plaine doctrine of the Scripture, with <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Notions, expressions of Arts,</hi> or any pretended ornaments of wit, or fancy; because I <hi>Feare God</hi> For
the more <hi>sublime</hi> Consideration of Things, and such a <hi>way</hi> of their Delivery, as depending upon the
acknowledg'd reception of sundry Arts and sciences, which the Generality of Christians neither are,
nor need to be acquainted withal; <hi>Scholars</hi> may communicate their Thoughts and Apprehensions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and among Themselves, and that upon the stage of the world, in that language, whereunto they have
consented, for, &amp; to that end &amp; purpose: That I have carefully abstayned from <hi>Personal reflections,</hi> scoffes,
Undervaluations, applications of <hi>Stories,</hi> and old sayings, to the provocation of the Spirit of them with
whom I have to do, I think not at all prayse worthy; because that upon a review of some passages in the
treatise (now irrecoverable) I feare I have scarce been so careful, as I am sure it was my duty to have been.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>1. The various thoughts of men concerning the Doctrine proposed to consideration.
2. The great concernment of it (how ever stated) on all hands confessed.
3. Some speciall causes pressing to the present handling of it. 4. The fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Back-sliding of many in these daies. 5: The great offence given, and
taken thereby: with the provision made for its removeall. 6: The nature of
that offence and temptation thence arising considered. 7: Answer to some
Arguings of Mr G. c: 9. §. 8, 9, 10, 11. from thence against the truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
The use of trialls and shakings: Grounds of believers assurance that
they are so. 8. The same farther argued and debated. 9: Of the Testimony
of a mans owne conscience concerning his uprightnesse, and what is required
thereunto. 10. 1 Ioh: 3. 7. considered: of the rule of selfe-judging, with
principles of settlement for true Believers, notwithstanding the Apostasies of
eminent Professors. (2) 11. Corrupt teachings rendring the handling of
this Doctrine necessary: its enemies of old and of late. 12: The particular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
of Mr G. proposed to consideration. 13: An entrance into the
stating of the Question. 14. 15. The termes of the Question explained: of
Holinesse in its severall acceptations. Created holinesse, Originall or Adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.
Compleate or Inchoate. Typicall by dedications, Reall by purification.
16. Holinesse Evangelicall, either so indeed, or by estimation. 17. Reall
Holinesse, partiall or universall. 18, 19. The partakers of the first or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Believers, not true Believers: maintained against Mr G. Ground of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
professors to be true believers. 20. Mat. 7. 20. Considered, what is the rule
of judging men therein given. 21, 22. What knowledge of the Faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
is to be obtained. 23: What is meant by Perseverance: How in Scripture
it is expressed. 24. The grounds of it pointed at. 25: What is intended by
falling away: whether it be possible the Spirit of Grace may be lost: or 26, 27,
28: The habit of it, and how. 29, 30: The state of the Controversy as laid
downe by Mr G. 31: The vanity thereof discovered. 32, 33, 34: His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about Believers falling away examined: what principles and meanes of
Perseverance he grants to them. 35: The enemies of our Perseverance: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
sin in particular considered: 36: No possibility of preservation upon
Mr G grounds, demonstrated. 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42: The meanes and waies
of the Saints preservation in Faith, asserted by Mr G: at large examined,
weighed &amp; found light: 43: The Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance, &amp; way
of teaching it cleard from Isa: 4: 44, 45: That Chapter opened. 47, 48, 49: The
43 verse particularly insisted on and discussed. 50: The whole state and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod

               <hi>back-sliding,</hi> and falling from <hi>high</hi> and glorious pitches

what of others, to spirituall wickednesses and abominations: it is seldome
that we see a <hi>Professor</hi> to hold out in the Glory of his Profession to the end.
I shall not now discourse of the particular causes hereof, with the temptations
and advantages of Satan, that seem to be peculiar to this season, but only
thus take notice of the thing it selfe, as that which presseth for, and rendreth
the consideration of the doctrine proposed not only seasonable but necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59070:28"/>
That this is a stumbling block in the way of them, that seeke to walke
with God,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> I suppose that none of them will deny. It was so of old and it will
so continue untill the end. And therefore our Saviour predicting and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of the like season, <hi>Mathew</hi> 24. Foretelling that <hi>Many should be
deceived, ver. 11. That Iniquity should abound, and the love of many wax cold,
v.</hi> 12. that is, visibly and scandalously to the contempt and seeming
disadvantage of the Gospell, adds as a preservative consolation, to his own
chosen select ones, who might be shaken in their comforts &amp; confidence to see
so many that walked in the House of God and took sweet counsell together
with them to fall headlong to destruction, that the <hi>Elect shall not be seduced;</hi> Let
the <hi>attempts</hi> of <hi>Seducers</hi> be what they will, and their <hi>Advantages</hi> never so
many, or their successes never so great, <hi>they</hi> shall be preserved; the <hi>House</hi> upon
the <hi>Rocke</hi> shall not be cast downe; Against the <hi>Church</hi> built on Christ the
<hi>Gates of Hell shall not prevaile.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> mentioning the <hi>Apostacy</hi> of <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who seeme to have beene teachers of some eminency and
<hi>Starrs</hi> of some considerable magnitude in the Firmament of the Church, with
the eversion of the <hi>Faith of some</hi> who attended unto their abominations,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 17, 18. Least any disconsolation should surprize believers in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to their owne condition, as though that should be lubricous, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and such as might end in destruction and their Faith in an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
he immediately adds that effectuall cordiall, for the reviving &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
of their confidence and comfort, <hi>v. 19. Neverthelesse</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this Apostasy of eminent professors yet) <hi>The foundation of God
standeth sure, the Lord knoweth who are his;</hi> Those who are built upon the
<hi>foundation</hi> of his unchangeable purpose and love, shall not be prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.
<hi>John</hi> likewise doth the same; for having told his <hi>little Children,</hi>
that there were many <hi>Antichrists</hi> abroad in the world, and they for the most
part <hi>Apostates,</hi> he adds in the first Epist: second Chap: verse the 19. <hi>They went
out from us because they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would no
doubt have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest
that they were not all of us.</hi> He lets the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know that by their being <hi>Apostates,</hi> they
had prooved themselves to have beene but <hi>Hypocrits;</hi> and therefore believers
<hi>dwelling in safety</hi> was no way prejudiced by their backsliding. The like <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
now calls for the like <hi>Application,</hi> &amp; the same <hi>disease</hi> for the same preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or <hi>remedy;</hi> That no <hi>sound</hi> persons may be shaken, because <hi>unhealthy</hi>
ones are shattered, that those may not tremble who are built on the Rock,
because those are cast downe who are built on the sand, is one part of my
ayme and intendment in handling this doctrine. And therefore I shall as
little dabble in the waters of strife or insist upon it in way of controversy as
the importunity of the adversary &amp; that truth which we are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for, will permit. One Scripture in its own plainesse &amp; simplicity, will be
of more use for the end I aime at, then <hi>twenty Scholasticall Arguments</hi> pressed
with never somuch accuratenesse and subtility.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Temptation</hi> then this is,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> and hath been of old to the Saints, disposed of
by the manifold wisdome of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 20.</note> to stir them up to <hi>take heed least they fall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 12.</note>
to put them upon trying and examining,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> whether <hi>Christ be in them or no,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note>
and also to make out to those Fountains of establishment in his <hi>eternall Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
and <hi>Gratious Promises,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 2. 24, 25.</note> wherein their refreshments and reserves under
such temptations do lye.<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 22.</note> And yet though our doctrine inforces us to conclude<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note>
all such never to be sound believers in that peculiar notion and sence
of that expression which shall instantly be declared,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 17.</note> who <hi>totally</hi> and finally
<hi>apostatize</hi> and fall off from the wayes of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> yet is it excedingly remote
from being any true ground of <hi>shaking</hi> the Faith of those,<note place="margin">Hab. 3. 17. 18.</note> who truly believe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59070:29"/>
any farther then <hi>shaking</hi> is usefull for the right and thorough performance
of that great Gospell duty of <hi>tryall and selfe examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> indeed contends,<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> 
               <hi>Chapter 9. Sect. 8, 9, 10, 11. Pag.</hi> 108, 109,
110:) <hi>that if we judge all such as fall away to perdition never to have been true
Believers</hi> (that is with such a Faith as bespeakes them to enjoy union with
Christ and acceptance with God,) <hi>it will administer a thousand Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
concerning the soundnesse of a mans owne Faith whether that be sound or
no; and so it will be indifferent as to consolation, whether true believers may fall
away or no, seeing it is altogether uncertaine whether a man hath any of that true
Faith which cannot perish.</hi> But</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> God who hath promised to make <hi>all things worke together for
good to them that love him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> in his infinite Love and Wisdome is pleased
to exercise them with great variety,<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 6, 7.</note> both <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to themselves and others,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 17.</note> for the accomplishing towards them all the<note place="margin">ch. 54. 7. 8, 9.</note>
               <hi>good pleasure of his goodnesse</hi> &amp; carrying them on in that holy humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note>
frame,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 13.</note> which is needfull for the receiving from him those gratious sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12.</note>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 5.</note>
without which it is impossible they should be preserved.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1. 11.</note> To this end
are they often exposed to <hi>winnowings</hi> of feirce winds and <hi>shakings</hi> by more
dreadfull blasts,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 25, 28, 29.</note> then any breathes in this consideration of the <hi>Apostatizing</hi>
of professours though of Eminency.<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 15. &amp; 66. 2.</note> Not that God is delighted with their
<hi>fears &amp; jelousies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6.</note> which yet he knows under such dispensations they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with all,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> but with the tryall and exercise of their Graces whereunto he
calls them; that's his Glory,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 24, 25.</note> where in his soule is delighted. It is no singular
thing for the Saints of God to bee exercised with a <hi>thousand fears &amp; jealousies</hi>
and through them to grow to great establishment;<note place="margin">Amos. 9. 9.</note> If indeed they were such
as were unconquerable,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note> such as did not worke together for their good,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 11, 12, 13.</note> such
as must needs be <hi>endlesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 14.</note> all meanes of satisfaction and establishment beeing
rescinded by the causes of them,<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 14, 15, 16. &amp; 63. 9.</note> then were there weight in this exception: but
neither the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9. 5.</note> not the experience of the Saints of God do give the
least hint to such an assertion.<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 7.</note> It is denied that the fall of the most <hi>glorious Hypocrites</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
an efficacious engine in the hands of the adversary,<note place="margin">Rom 8. 38.</note> to ingenerate any
other feares and Jealousies, or to expose them to any other <hi>shakings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> then
what are common to them in other temptations of daily incursion, which
God doth constantly make way for them to escape; It is true indeed, that if
true believers had no other foundation of their perswasion that they <hi>are so,</hi>
but what occurres <hi>visibly</hi> to the observation of men in the outward <hi>conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that yet afterward fall totally away, the Apostasie of such (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the generall assurance they have, that those who are <hi>borne of God
cannot, shall not sinne unto deaths,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> seeing their own interest in that estate and
condition may be clouded, (at least for a season) and their consolation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
depending interrupted) might occasion thoughts in them of very sad
consideration: but whilest besides all the beams &amp; raies that ever issued from
<hi>a falling starre,</hi> all the leaves and blossomes with abortive fruit, that ever
grew on an <hi>unrooted tree,</hi> all the goodly turrets and ornaments of the <hi>fairest
house</hi> that ever was built on the sand,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7, 8.</note> there are moreover <hi>three that beare
witness in Heaven, the Father, Sonne, and Spirit; and three that beare witness
on Earth, the Water, Bloud, and Spirit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 20, 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> whilst there is a <hi>teaching, anoynting,</hi>
and assuring <hi>earnest,</hi> a firme <hi>sealing to the day of redemption,</hi> a knowledge <hi>that
we are passed from death to life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 21, 22.</note> the temptation arising from the Apostasie of
Hypocrites is neither so potent nor unconquerable,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 5.</note> but that by the grace of
him through <hi>whom we can doe all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 14.</note> it may be very well dealt withall.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 30.</note>
This I say,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> supposing the ordinary presence and operation of the spirit of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59070:29"/>
grace, in the hearts of believers, with such shines of Gods countenance upon
them, as, they usually enjoy. Let these be interrupted, or turned aside, and
there is not the least blast or breath, that proceeds from the mouth of the
weakest enemy,<note place="margin">Psal 30. 6, 7.</note> they have to deale withall, but is sufficient to cast <hi>them downe
from the excellency</hi> of their joy and consolation.</p>
            <p>The evidence of this truth is such,<note place="margin">§ 8.</note> that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is forced to say<note n="*" place="margin">Verè fidelit uti pro tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re praesenti de fidei &amp; consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae suae inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritate certus esse potest, ita &amp; de salute sui &amp; de sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiferâ Dei erga ipsum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolentiâ pro illo tempore certus esse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test &amp; debet.</note> 
               <hi>Farre
be it from me to deny but that a man may very possibly attaine unto a very strong
and potent assurance, and that upon grounds every way sufficiently warrantable
and good, that his faith is sound and saving:</hi> Cap: 9. Sect: 9. but unto this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:
he puts in a double exception.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there is not one true believer of an hundred, yea of many thousands,
who hath any such assurance of his Faith as is built upon solid and pregnant foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>I must (by his leave) enter my dissent hereunto, and as we have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our respectiue apprehensions so neither the one, nor the other prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in the cause. Setting aside causes of <hi>desertion,</hi> great temptations, and
tryalls, I hope through the <hi>riches</hi> of the grace, and <hi>tenderness</hi> of the love of
their father,<note place="margin">Act. Synod. p. 182. decl. sent. Thes. 7.</note> the condition is otherwise then is apprehended by <hi>M. Goodwin</hi>
with the generality of the Family of God. The reasons given by him of his
thoughts to the contrary, doe not sway me from my hopes, or byas my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
apprehensions in the least; His reasons are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because though the testimony of a mans heart and conscience touching his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
uprightness towards God, or the soundness of any thing that is saving in him, be
comfortable and chearing, yet seldome are these properties built upon such founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are sufficient to warrant them; at least upon such whose sufficiency in
that kind is duely apprehended. For the testimony of the conscience of a man touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing which is spiritually and excellently good, is of no such value, unlesse
it be first excellently inlightned with the knowledge, nature, proprieties and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that on which it testifieth; and (<hi>Secondly</hi>) be in the actuall contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consideration, or remembrance of what he knoweth in this kind. <hi>Now very few
believers in the World come up to this height and degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> There is in this reason couched a <hi>supposition</hi> which if true, would be
farre more effectuall to shake the confidence and Resolution of beleevers,
then the most serious consideration of the Apostasies of all professors, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fell from the glory of their profession from the beginning of the World;
and that is, that there is no <hi>other pregnant foundation of Assurance, but the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a mans own heart, and conscience, touching his uprightness towards God,
and therefore before any can attaine that assurance upon abiding foundations
they must be excellently inlightened in the nature, properties, and condition of that
which their consciences testifie unto; (as true faith and uprightnesse of heart) and
be cleare in the disputes and Questions about them, being in the actuall contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them when they give their Testimony.</hi> I no way doubt but many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of believers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note> whose apprehensions of the <hi>nature, properties,</hi> and <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of things,<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 5.</note> as they are in themselves, are low, weake, and confused; yet
hauing received the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> bearing <hi>witness with their spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that
they are the Children of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and having the Testimony in themselves,</hi> have been
taken up into as high a degree of <hi>comforting and cheering assurance,</hi> and that
upon the most infallible foundation Imaginable,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 6.</note> (<hi>for the spirit witnesseth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the spirit is truth</hi>) as ever, the most <hi>seraphically</hi> illuminated person in
the World, attained unto. Yea in the very graces themselves of <hi>Faith</hi> and
uprightnesse of heart, there is such a <hi>seale</hi> and stamp impressing the image of
God upon the soule, as without any reflex act, or actuall contemplation of
those graces themselves, have an influence into the establishment of the soules
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59070:30"/>
of men, in whom they are, unto a quiet comfortable assured repose of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon the love and faithfulnesse of God: neither is the spirituall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Saints shaken,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 25.</note> much lesse <hi>cast to the ground,</hi> by their conflicting
with feares,<note place="margin">Math. 16. 18.</note> scruples, and doubtfull apprehensions; seeing in all these conflicts,
they have the pledge of the <hi>faithfulness</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 77. 10.</note> that they <hi>shall be more then
conquerours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 9.</note> Though they are <hi>exercised</hi> by them,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 23, 24.</note> they are not <hi>dejected</hi> with
them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> nor deprived of that comforting assurance and joy which they have in
believing.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 37.</note> But yet suppose, that this be the condition practically of many
Saints of God, &amp; that they never attaine to the state of the primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> to whose <hi>joy and consolation</hi> in believing the Holy Ghost so plentifully
witnesseth, nor doe live up to that full rate of plenty, which their <hi>Father</hi> hath
provided for them in his <hi>Family,</hi> and <hi>sworne that he is abundantly willing, they
should enjoy and make use of;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17, 18.</note> what will hence follow as to the businesse in
hand, I professe I know not. Must that little evidence which they have of
their acceptance with God, be therefore necessarily built upon such <hi>bottomes</hi>
(or rather <hi>topps</hi>) as are visible to them in hypocrites, so that upon their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
they must needs not only <hi>trye and examine themselves,</hi> but conclude to
their disadvantage and disconsolation, that they have no true faith? <hi>Credat
Apella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> 
               <hi>the comfortablenesse he tells us of the testimony of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
concerning his uprightnesse with God,</hi> depends mainly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
upon his uniforme and regular walking with God; now this being by the
neglects of the Saints often interupted with many staines of unworthinesse, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
it selfe must needs be often suspended: now true believers finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
outgon in wayes of obedience by them, that <hi>impenitently Apostatize,</hi> if
from hence they must conclude them Hypocrites, they have no evidence left for the
soundnesse of their owne Faith, which their consciences beare Testimony unto, upon
the fruitfullnesse of it, which is inferiour by many degrees to that of them who
yet finally fall away. <hi>This is the substance of one long Section pag. 109,
110. But</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, here is the same supposall included as formerly, <hi>that the only Evidence
of a true Faith and acceptance with God, is the testimony of a mans conscience
concerning his regular &amp; upright walking with God;</hi> For, an obstruction in this
being supposed, his comfort and consolation is thought to vanish; but that
the Scripture builds up our assurance on other foundations is evident, and
the Saints acknowledge it, as hath been before delivered; Nor</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, doth the Testimony of a mans owne conscience as it hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
into his consolation, depend solely (nor doth Mr <hi>Goodwin affirme it
so to doe</hi>) on the <hi>constant regularity</hi> of his walking with God.<note place="margin">Job. 35. 10.</note> It will also wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
what former experience it hath had of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 77. 5, 6. 7.</note> calling to mind its <hi>song in
the night,</hi> all the tokens and <hi>pledges</hi> of its fathers love, all the gracious <hi>visits</hi>
of the holy and blessed Spirit of grace,<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 28, 29, 30.</note> all the imbracements of Christ, all that
intimacy and communion it hath formerly been admitted unto,<note place="margin">Canti. 3. 1, 2. &amp; 5. 4, 5.</note> the healing
and recovery it hath had of <hi>wounds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 42. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> and from <hi>back-slidings,</hi> with all the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
intercourse it ever had with God,<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 7. &amp; 14. 2. 8.</note> to confirme and strengthen it selfe in
the <hi>beginning of its confidence</hi> to the end. And</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in the testimony that it doth give from <hi>its walking with God,</hi> and
the <hi>fruits of Righteousnesse,</hi> it is very farre and remote from giving it <hi>only</hi> or
<hi>chiefly,</hi>

is lodged in depths not to be fathom'd by any of the Sons of Men:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 12.</note> There is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59070:30"/>
no comparison to be instituted between the obedience and fruites of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
in others, whereby a believer makes a judgement of them, and <hi>that</hi> in
himselfe from whence the testimony mentioned doth flow: that of <hi>other men</hi>
being their visibly <hi>practicall conversation,</hi> his being the <hi>hidden habituall frame
of his heart</hi> and spirit in his waies and actings; so that though through the
fallings of them, he should be occasioned to <hi>question</hi> his own faith, as to <hi>triall</hi>

doth righteousnesse is righteous,</hi> is produced, and two things argued from
thence, First, that the caveat (<hi>be not deceived</hi>) plainly intimates, <hi>that true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
may very possibly be deceived in the estimate of a righteous man, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
that this is spoken of a man judging himselfe, and that emphatically and
exclusively, he and he only is to be judged a righteous man.</hi> I say,</p>
            <p>1. That though I grant the first,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> that we may very <hi>easily be,</hi> and often are
<hi>deceived</hi> in our estimate of righteous persons, yet I doe not conceive the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be inforced from that expression, (<hi>let no man deceive you</hi>) the Holy
Ghost using it frequently, or what is <hi>equivalent</hi> thereunto, not so much to
caution men in a <hi>dubious</hi> thing, wherein possibly they may be mistaken, as in
a way of detestation, scorne, and rejection of what is opposite to that which he
is urging upon his Saints, which he presseth as a thing of the greatest evidence
and cleernesse, as 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6. 9. chap: 15. 32. <hi>Gal:</hi> 6. 7. neither is any thing
more intended in this expression of the Apostle, then in that of 1 <hi>Cor: 6. 9. be
not deceived, no unrighteous person shall inherit the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> so here,
no person not giving himselfe up to the pursuit of righteousnesse in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
drift and scope of his life, (cases extraordinary and particular acts, being
alway in such rules excepted) is, or is to be accounted a <hi>righteous man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly also it may be granted, (though the intendment of the place
leads us another way) that this is so farre a Rule of <hi>selfe judging,</hi> that he, whose
frame and disposition suits it not, or is opposite unto it, cannot keep up the
power or vigor of any other comfortable evidence of his state and condition;
But that it should be so farre extended, as to make the only <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>pregnant
foundation</hi> that any man hath of assurance and consolation, to arise and flow
from the Testimony of his own conscience, concerning his own regular walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in waies of Righteousness, (seeing persons that <hi>walk in darkness and have
no light</hi> are called <hi>to stay themselves on God, Isai:</hi> 50. 10. and <hi>when both heart
&amp; flesh faileth, yet God is the strength of the heart, Psal:</hi> 73. 6.) is no way cleare in
it selfe, and is not by M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> afforded the least contribution of assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
for its confirmation. To returne then from this digression: a <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
we acknowledge, and an offence to be given to the Saints by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
of Professors: yet not such, but as the Lord hath in Scripture made gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
provision against their suffering by it, or under it, so it leaves them not
without sufficient testimony of their own acceptance with God, and sincerity
in walking with him. This then was the state of old, thus it is in the daies
wherein we live.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>practice</hi> and waies of some,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> so the <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>teachings</hi> of others,
have an eminent tendance unto offence and scandall. Indeed ever since the

it, and corrupt it: The first serious attempt for the <hi>totall intercision</hi> of the

by the most considerable Adversaries of this Truth (especially not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

handling not only the <hi>main</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it selfe, but all the <hi>concernments</hi>

shall breifly <hi>State</hi> the Doctrine under consideration, that the difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it may appeare. Indeed it seemes strange to me among other things, that
he of whom mention was lastly made, who hath liberally dispended so great
a Treasure, of Paines, Reading, and Eloquence, for the subverting of the
Truth, whose explanation and defence we have undertaken; did not yet
once attempt fairely to fixe the State of the difference about it, but in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tumultuary manner, fell in with prejudices swelling over all bounds and
limits of ordinary reasoning,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> Rhetoricall amplifications upon a doctrine not
attempted to be brought forth and explayned, that it might be weighed
in the Ballance, as in it selfe it is. Whereas there may be many Reasons, of
such a proceeding, it may well be questioned whether any of them be candid
&amp; commendable. Certainly the advantages thence taken for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59070:31"/>
of many Sophisticall Reasons and pretended Arguments are obvious to
every one that shall but peruse his ensuing discourse.</p>
            <p>Although the <hi>Substance</hi> of this Doctrine hath been by sundry delivered,<note place="margin">§ 14.</note>
yet least the termes, wherein it is usually done, may seeme to be somewhat too
Generall, and some advantages of the Truth, which in it selfe it hath, to have
been omitted, I shall breifely state the whole matter under those Termes,
wherein it is usually received.</p>
            <p>The title of it is,<note place="margin">§ 15.</note> the PERSEVERANCE OF SAINTS; A short
discovery of whom we meane by <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> whereof we speake, and
what by <hi>Perseverance,</hi> which is Affirmed of them, will state the whole for the
Judgement of the Reader. God only is essentially holy, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 3. losh. 24. 19.</note>
the <hi>only holy One.</hi> In his Holynesse as in his Beeing, and all his Glorious
Attributes,<note place="margin">Revel. 15. 4.</note> there is an actuall permanency or samenesse. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in him is subject to the least shaddow of change:<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> not his Truth,
not his Faithfullnesse,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 4. Isa. 40. 38.</note> not his Holinesse; all principles, causes, and
reasons of alteration stand at no lesse infinite distance from him,<note place="margin">Ch. 41. 4.</note> then not
being.<note place="margin">Ch. 43. 10.</note> His Properties are the same with himselfe and are spoken of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Ch. 44. 6. Ch. 48. 12.</note>
as well as of his nature. His <hi>Eternall Power</hi> is mentioned by the Apostle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Reve. 1. 4, 17.</note> So is his Holinesse Eternall, Immutable. Of this we may have use
afterwards;<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6. Iam. 1. 18.</note> for the present I treat not of it. The Holinesse of all Creatures
is <hi>Accidentall</hi> and <hi>Created;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 29.</note> to some it is <hi>innate</hi> or Originall, as to the <hi>Angels,</hi>

               <hi>Adam</hi> had originall holinesse and lost it; so had many Angells, <hi>who kept

               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25. Ezek. 36. 26, 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>may be taken away, nowithstanding the seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
engagement</hi> of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. From what proportion or Analogy this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth flow,<note place="margin">Isa. 4. 3, 4. Rom. 6. 4, 5. 6</note> is not intimated: The grace <hi>Adam</hi> was endowed with, was
intrusted with himselfe,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> and <hi>his own keeping, in a covenant of Workes:</hi> that of
the Saints since the fall, is purchased for them, laid up in their head, dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a covenant of grace; whose eminent distinction from the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the permanency and abidingness of the fruits of it. But of this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
To others, <hi>adventitious</hi> and added, as to all that have contracted any
qualities contrary to that <hi>Originall Holinesse,</hi> wherewith at first they were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as have done all the sonnes of men, <hi>who have sinned and come short of the
glory of God.</hi> Now the Holiness of these is either <hi>compleate,</hi> as it is with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of just men made perfect: or <hi>inchoate,</hi> and begunne only, as with the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of Sanctified ones, in this life. The certain <hi>Perseverance</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> in
their present condition being not directly opposed by <hi>any,</hi> though the
foundation of it be attempted by <hi>some,</hi> we have no need as yet to engage in
the defence of it. These latter are said to be <hi>sanctified</hi> or <hi>holy</hi> two waies: upon
the twofold account of the use of the word in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. For (first) some <hi>Persons,</hi> as well as <hi>Things,</hi> are said to be <hi>holy,</hi> especially in the
old Testament, and in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> almost constantly using the
termes of <hi>Sanctifying</hi> and <hi>Sanctifyed</hi> in a legall or Temple signification, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto their being <hi>separated</hi> from the residue of men, with relation to
God and his worship;<note place="margin">Exod. 28. 36, 38.</note> or being consecrated, and dedicated peculiarly to the
performance of any part of his will,<note place="margin">Levit. 5. 15. Ezek. 22. 8.</note> or distinct injoyment of any portion of
his mercy:<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 11.</note> thus the <hi>Arke</hi> was said to be <hi>holy,</hi> and the <hi>Altar holy,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> was
<hi>holy</hi> and all the utensils of it,<note place="margin">ch. 10. 10. Ioh. 17. 19.</note> with the vestments of its officers. So the
whole people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were said to be <hi>holy:</hi> the particular respects of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
Worship, Separation, Law, Mercy,</hi> &amp; the like, upon which this denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Holinesse</hi> and Saintship was given unto them, &amp; did depend, are
known to all: yea persons <hi>Inherently</hi> uncleane, and personally notoriously
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59070:32"/>
wicked, in respect of their designement to some outward work, which by
them God will bring about are said to be sanctified: distinguishing gifts,
with designation to some distinct employment, is a bottome for this Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
though their gifts may be recalled, and the employment taken from
them. <hi>Isai</hi> 13. 3. We confesse <hi>Perseverance,</hi> not to be a proper and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>adjunct</hi> of this <hi>subject,</hi> nor to belong unto such persons as such: though
they may have a right to it, it is upon another account: yet in the pursuit of
this businesse, it will appeare that many of our adversaries Arguments, smite
these men only, and prove that <hi>Such</hi> as they, may be totally rejected of God
which none ever denied.</p>

some labour with all their strength,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1. Act. Synod. Dec. sent. Art. 5. p: 266, 267. &amp;c:</note> to make true believers, that so they
may cast the stumbling-block of their Apostacy in the way of the Saints of

no Advocates: let them goe to their owne place according to the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the Arguments leuyed against them from <hi>Heb. 6. 4. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. And other
places.</p>
            <p>Moreover of those,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> who are said to believe, and to be holy <hi>really,</hi> and
in the Truth of the thing it selfe; there are two sorts. First such as having
received sundry common gifts and Graces of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4. 1 Sam. 10. 10. 2 Pet. 2. 20. 1 King. 21. 27. 2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> as <hi>Illumination</hi> of
the Mind, <hi>Change</hi> of affections, and thence <hi>Amendment</hi> of life, with
<hi>sorrom of the World, legall Repentance, temporary Faith</hi> and the like, which are
all <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Reall</hi> in their kind, do thereby become <hi>Vessells</hi> in the great house
of God,<note place="margin">Math. 17. 3, 4. Math. 13. 20. Marke 6. 20. 2 Kings 10. 16.</note> being changed as to their use, though not in their Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueing
<hi>Stone,</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> still, though hewed and turned to the serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Vessels, and on that account are frequently termed Saints &amp; believers.
On such as these their is a <hi>lower</hi> (and in some a <hi>subordinate</hi>) work of the Spirit

Forts of the opposers of this truth: some men are truly ready to think, that
they never had experience of the nature of true Faith, or Holinesse, who can
suppose it to consist in such like common gifts, and Graces, as are ascribed to
this sort of men. Yet, as was said before, if these may not passe for Saints, if
our Adversaries cannot proove these to be <hi>true Believers</hi> in the strictest notion
and sence of that terme or expression, <hi>actum est,</hi> the very subject about
which they contend is taken away: such as these alone are concerned in the

the Gospell, the name of <hi>Believers,</hi> and being <hi>Regenerate</hi> (that is, as to the
participation of the outward <hi>Symbol</hi> thereof) whom yet they expressely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from them, whose Faith was the Fruit of their <hi>Eternall Election,</hi>

               <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> Goodwin <hi>tells us Cap. 9. Sect. 7. pag.</hi> 107, 108. That if
there be any persons under Heaven, who may upon sufficient grounds, and justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the word of God, be judged true believers, many of the Apostates we speake
of, were to be judged such, all the visible lineaments of a true faith, wherein their
faces,<note place="margin">Adde hos de quibus hic agimus, non vulgares &amp; plebeios, sed antesignanos &amp; eximios ac eminentes fuisse.</note> as farre as the eye of man is able to pierce, they lived Godly, righteously and
soberly in this present World: doth any true believer act zealously for his God? So
did they: is any true believer fruitfull in good workes? they were such: yea there is
found in those we now speake of, not only such things upon the sight and knowledge
whereof in men, we ought to judge them true believers, * but even such things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which we ought to reverence and honour, as lovely and Majestick chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of God and holinesse,<note place="margin">Rem. Ac. Syn. p. 267.</note> therefore it is but too importune a pretence in men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them to have been true believers.</p>
            <p>If the proofe of the first <hi>confident</hi> assertion concerning the grounds of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such as afterwards have <hi>apostatized,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ans.</note> to be true believers, were called into
question, I suppose it would prove one instance, how much easier it is <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to affirme</hi> any thing, then soundly to <hi>confirme it.</hi> And perhaps it will
be found to appeare, that in the most, if not all of those <hi>glorious apostates</hi>
of whom he speakes,<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 34, 35, 36.</note> if they were throughly traced and strictly eyed, even in
those things which are exposed to the view of men, for any season or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
<note place="margin">Job. 27. 9, 10. 2 Kings. 10. 29.</note> such warpings and flawes might be discovered, in <hi>positives,</hi> or <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
as are incompatible with truth of grace. But if this be granted, that
they have all the <hi>visible lineaments of a true faith in their faces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31. Titus. 1. 16.</note> as farre as the
eye of man is able to judge, and therefore men were bound to esteeme them
for true believers, doth it therefore follow, that they were such indeed? This
at once instates all secret hypocrites in the ancient and present Churches of
Christ, into a condition of sanctification and justification, which the Lord
knowes they were, and are remote from. Shall the <hi>esteeme</hi> of men <hi>translate
them from death to life,</hi> and really alter the state wherein they are? What ever
honour then and esteeme we may give to the <hi>characters of holinesse and faith
instamped,</hi> or rather painted on them, as tis <hi>meet for us</hi> to judge well of all,
who professing the Lord Christ, walke in our view in any measure sutable to
that profession, and with <hi>Jonadab</hi> to honour <hi>Jehu,</hi> in his fits and hasty passions
of zeale, yet this (alas) is no <hi>evidence</hi> unto them, nor <hi>discovery</hi> of the thing
it selfe, that they are in a state of faith and holinesse. To say, that we may
not be bound to judge any to be believers, and Godly, unlesse they are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and in the thing it selfe, is either to exalt poore wormes into the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59070:33"/>
throne of God, and to make them <hi>searchers of the hearts and tryers of the reynes
of others,</hi> who are so often in the darke to themselves, and never in this life
sufficiently acquainted with their owne <hi>inward chambers:</hi> or else at once to
cut off and destroy all communion of Saints, by rendring it impossible for us
to attaine satisfaction, who are so indeed, so farre as to walke with them upon
that account,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 9.</note> in <hi>Love without dissimulation.</hi> Doubtlesse the Disciples of Christ
were bound to receive them for Believers, of whom it is said, that they <hi>did
beleive,</hi> because of their profession so to doe, &amp; that with some hazard &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<note place="margin">loh. 2. 23, 24.</note> though he who <hi>knew what was in man,</hi> would not trust himself with them,
because the <hi>roote</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> was not in them.</p>
            <p>I suppose I shall not need to put my selfe to the labour to proove, or evince
this Ground of our charitable procedure,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> in our thoughts of men professing
the wayes of God, though their hearts are not upright with him; But, sayes
Mr <hi>Goodwin, To say that whilst they stood, men were indeed bound to judge
them Believers: but by their declining, they discover themselves not to have been
the men, is but to begge the Question, and that upon very ill termes to obtain
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> I finde not in this <hi>Answer</hi> to that <hi>Objection (But they had the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of true Believers and therefore we were bound to judge them so,</hi>) that, this
did not <hi>at all proove them to be so,</hi> any <hi>begging</hi> of the <hi>Question,</hi> but rather a fair
Answer given to their importune Request,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 7.</note> that the <hi>appearance of the face, as
farre as the eyes of men can peirce,</hi> must needs conclude them in the eyes of
God to answer that <hi>Appearance</hi> in the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>hidden man</hi> of the
heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Mr</hi> Goodwin <hi>further pursues his designe in hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> 
               <hi>from the words of
our Saviour</hi> Mat. 7. 20. By their fruit yee shall know them: if <hi>faith he,</hi> this rule
be Authenticall, we doe not only stand bound by the law of Charity, but by the law
of Righteousnesse or district Judgment it selfe, to judge the persons, we speake of,
true Believers; whilst they adorne the Gospell with such fruits of Righteousnesse,
as were mentioned; for our Saviour doth not say; by their fruits yee shall have
grounds to conceive or conjecture them such or such, or to judge them in charity such
or such, but <hi>ye shall know</hi> them; now what a man knowes, he is not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
or to judge in a way of Charity to be that which he knoweth it to be, but
positively to judge and conclude of it accordingly. If then it be possible for men by
any such fruits, workes, or expressions, to know true Believers, the persons we speake
of, may be known to have been such.</p>
            <p>Though the words of our Saviour principally lye on the other <hi>side of the way,</hi>
giving a Rule for <hi>a condemnatory Judgment</hi> of men,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> whose evill Fruits declare
the Root to be no better; wherein we cannot well be deceived, <hi>the workes of
the flesh being manifest,</hi> and he that worketh wickednesse openly, and brings
forth the effects of sinne visibly,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 19.</note> in a course, as <hi>a Tree doth its fruit,</hi> may
safely be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> whatsoever pretence in words he makes, to be a false cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Hypocrite; yet by the way of <hi>Analogie</hi> and proportion, it is a <hi>Rule</hi> also,
whereby our Saviour will have us make a Judgement of those Professors
and <hi>Teachers,</hi> with whom we have to do, as to our Reception and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. He bids his Disciples tast, &amp; try the Fruit that such <hi>persons beare,</hi>
and acording to that, (not any specious pretences they make, or innocent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
which for a season they shew themselves in) let their Estimation of
them be; Yea but, sayes Mr <hi>Goodwin, we doe not only stand bound by the Law of
Charity, but by the Law of a Righteous and strict Judgment it selfe to judge such
persons Believers.</hi> This distinction between <hi>the Law of Charity,</hi> and the <hi>Law
of a Righteous Judgment,</hi> I understand not. Though Charity be the
principle exerted eminently in such dijudications of men, yet doubtlesse
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59070:33"/>
it proceeds by the rules of <hi>Righteous Judgment;</hi> When we speake of the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Charity,</hi> we intend not a loose conjecture, much lesse a Judgment
<hi>contradistinct</hi> from that which is Righteous; but a Righteous and strict Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to the exactest rules whatsoever, that we have to Judge by,
free from <hi>evill surmises,</hi> and such like vices of the minde, as are opposed to the
<hi>grace of Love.</hi> By saying it is of <hi>Charity,</hi> we are not absolved fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most exact
procedure (according to the Rules of judging given unto us) but only bound
up from indulging to any <hi>Fnvy, Malice,</hi> or such like <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> which
are opposite to <hi>Charity,</hi> in the subject wherein it is: <hi>Charity</hi> in this assertion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
only a gracious qualification in the subject, and not any condescension
from the Rule: and therefore I something wonder, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> should
make a Judgment of <hi>Charity</hi> (as afterwards) a meere conjecture, and allow
beyond it a Righteous and strict Judgement, which amounts to knowledg.</p>
            <p>It is true our Saviour tells us,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that by their fruits we shall know them;</hi> But
what knowledge is it that he intendeth? is it <hi>a certain knowledge</hi> by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of it? or an <hi>infallible assurance</hi> by revelation? I am confident M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
will not say it is either of these, but only such a perswasion, as is the result
of our thoughts concerning them, upon the profession they make, &amp; the works
they doe, upon which we may (according to the minde of Christ, who bare
with them whom he knew to be no Believers, having taken on them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the faith) know how to demeane our selves towards them: so farre
we may know them by their fruits and judge of them; other knowledge our
Saviour intendeth not, nor I believe does M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> pretend unto. Now
notwithstanding all this, even on this account, and by this rule, it is very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
yea very easy, and <hi>practically</hi> proved true in all places, and at all times,
that we may <hi>judge,</hi> yea so farre <hi>know,</hi> men to be, or not to be <hi>seducers</hi> by their
fruits, as to be able to order aright our demeanour towards them, according
to the will of Christ, and yet be mistaken, (though not in the performance
of our duty in walking regularly according to the lines drawne out for our
paths) in the persons concerning whom our judgement is; the knowledge of
them being neither by <hi>demonstration,</hi> nor from revelation, such as <hi>cui non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
subesse falsum,</hi> we may be deceived.</p>
            <p>The Saints then or believers,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> of whom alone our discourse is, may be
briefely delineated by these few considerable concernements of their Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>1.
That whereas <hi>by nature they are children of wrath as well as others,</hi> and
<hi>dead in trespasses and sinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28, 29.</note> that faith and holinesse which they are in due
time invested withall, whereby they are made <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from all others whatever, is an effect and fruit of, and flowes
from God's eternall purpose concerning their <hi>salvation</hi> or <hi>election:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 4. Eph. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> their faith
being as to the manner of its bestowing peculiarly of the operation of God,
and as to its distinction from every other gift, that upon any account what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is so called,<note place="margin">Tit 1, 1.</note> in respect of its <hi>fountaine</hi> termed, <hi>The faith of Gods elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For the manner of their obtaining of this pretious faith, it is by Gods
giving to them that holy Spirit of his,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1. Rom. 8. 11.</note> whereby he raised Jesus from the dead, to raise them from their death in sinne,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19, 20. &amp; 2. 1, 5, 5, 8, 10.</note> to quicken them unto newnesse of
life, endowing them with a new life, with a Spirituall gracious supernaturall
habit, spreading it selfe upon their whole soules, making them new creatures
throughout (in respect of parts) investing them with an abiding principle,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 17. &amp; 12. 33.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a naturall genuine fountaine of all those Spirituall acts,<note place="margin">Galat. 2. 20. 1 Ioh. 5. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 17. 1 Thes. 5. 25. Gal. 5122, 23. 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Eph. 2. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Philip. 12. v. 13.</note> workes and duties,

3. That the holy and blessed Spirit, which effectually and powerfully
workes this change in them,<note place="margin">Ioh.4. 16, 26. &amp; 15. 26. &amp; 16. 7, 8, 9. Rom. 8. 10, 11.</note>
is bestowed upon them as a fruit of the purchase
and intercession of Jesus Christ, to dwell in them, and abide in them for ever:
upon the account of which inhabitation of the Spirit of Christ in them, they
have <hi>union</hi> with him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19. Rom. 5. 5. 1 Ioh. 4. 4, 13.</note>

            </p>
            <p>4. By all which as to their actuall state and condition, they are really

after the name of God.</p>
            <p>These alone are they, of whom we treat; of whose state and condition <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi>
is an inseparable adjunct: wherein and in what particulars they are
differenced <hi>from,</hi> and advanced <hi>above</hi> the most glorious Professors whatever,
who are lyable and obnoxious to an utter and everlasting separation from
God, shall be afterwards at large insisted upon: And though M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
hath thought good to affirme, that that description which we have <hi>Heb:</hi> 6, of
such (as is supposed) may be Apostates, is one of the highest and most eminent,
that is made of believers in the whole Scripture; I shall not doubt but to make
it evident, that the <hi>Excellency</hi> of all the expressions there used, being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and laid together, doth yet come short of the meanest and lowest thing
that is spoken of those, concerning whom we treat; as shall be manifest, when
through Gods assistance we arrive unto that part of this contest.</p>
            <p>That the other <hi>terme</hi> (to wit) <hi>Perseverance</hi> may be more briefely explicated,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note>
I shall take the shortest path. For <hi>Perseverance</hi> in generall, he came neere the
nature of it, who said it was <hi>in ratione bene fundatâ stabilis ac perpetua permansio.</hi>
The words and termes, whereby it is expressed in Scripture, will afterwards

and the like, are some of those expressions whereby the holy Ghost holds forth
that doctrine which we have in hand,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 1. Phil. 1. 6. Ephes. 1. 13, 14.</note> which is usually called the <hi>Perseverance
of Saints,</hi> regarding principally their abiding with God, through Christ in
faith and obedience, which yet is but one part of this truth.</p>
            <p>The reasons &amp; causes investing this proposition,<note place="margin">4. 39.</note> that <hi>Saints,</hi> such as we have
described,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Phil. 1. 6.</note> shall so <hi>Persevere,</hi> with a necessity of consequence, and on which the
truth of it doth depend,<note place="margin">1 Thes: 5. 24.</note> both negatively considered, and positively, with the
limitation of Perseverance,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12.</note> what it directly asserts, what not, with what fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">1 Pet: 1. 2, 3, 4.</note> backsliding, &amp; declensions on the one hand, and other, it is consistent, and
what is destructive of the nature and being of it,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 19, 27. &amp;c.</note> the difference of it, as to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

effect in them that persevere, not in the least prejudicing their liberty, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing

And hereon depends much of the life and vigor of the Doctrine we have
in hand: it being oftner in the Scripture held forth in its fountaines, and
springs and causes, then in the thing it selfe, as will upon examination ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>

believers may come utterly to <hi>loose this holy spirit,</hi> &amp; to be made <hi>naked</hi> of the
<hi>habit</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>new nature</hi> bestowed on them. That and that only whereunto
this effect is ascribed is <hi>sinne.</hi> Now there are two wayes whereby sinne may
be supposed to produce such effects in reference to the Soules of Believers.
1. <hi>Efficiently</hi> by a reaction in the same subject, as frequent acts of Vice will
debilitate and overthrow an acquired habit whereunto it is opposite. 2. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously,</hi>
by provoking the Lord to take them away, in a way of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for of all punishment sinne is the morally procuring cause. Let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
consider which of those wayes it may probably be supposed that sinne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles
the spirit, and habit of grace from the soules of Believers.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>the spirit of grace</hi> which dwells in them, it cannot with the least co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of reason be supposed, that <hi>sinne</hi> should have a naturall <hi>efficient reaction</hi>
against the spirit which is a voluntary indweller in the hearts of his, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
grieved and provoked by it,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 30. Heb: 3. 10, 11. Isa. 63: 10.</note> but that is in a <hi>morall</hi> way in respect of its
demerit; but that it should have a naturall efficiency by the way of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against it, as <hi>Intemperance</hi> against the <hi>Mediocrity</hi> which it opposeth, is a
madnesse to imagine.</p>
            <p>The habit of Grace wherewith such believers are indued,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> is <hi>infused:</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by a frequency of Acts in themselves: the root is made good and then
the fruit, and the work of God. It is <hi>a new Creation</hi> planted in them by the
<hi>exceeding greatnesse of his Power, as he wrought in Christ when he raised him from
the dead,</hi> which he also <hi>strengthens with all might, and all power to the end.</hi> Is it
now supposed, or can it rationally be so, that vitious acts, acts of sinne, should
have in the soule a <hi>naturall efficiency</hi> for the expelling of an <hi>infused habit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Ephes. 1. 19. Col. 1. 11.</note> and
that implanted upon the soule by the <hi>exceeding greatnesse of the power of God?</hi>
That it should be done by any one, or two acts is impossible: to suppose that a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59070:35"/>
man, in whom there is an habit set on by so mighty an impression as, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
mentions, to act constantly contrary thereunto, is to think what we will,
without troubling our selves to consider how it may be brought about.
Farther, whilest this Principle, life, and habit of Grace is thus consuming, doth
their God and Father look on and suffer it to decay, and their spirituall man
to pine away day by day,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 23. Col. 2. 19.</note> giving them <hi>no new supplies,</hi> nor <hi>increasing them with
the increase of Gods</hi> hath he no pitty towards a <hi>dying</hi> child?<note place="margin">Eph: 4. 16. 1 Thes: 3. 12.</note> or can he not help
him? doth he, of whom it is said that <hi>he is faithfull,</hi> and that he will not suffer
<hi>us to be tempted above what we are able,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil: 1. 6. 1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>but with</hi> the very <hi>temptation will make
way for us to escape,</hi> let loose such floodgates of Temptations upon them, as he
knows his grace will not be able to stand before, but will be consumed and
expelled by it? what also shall we suppose are the thoughts of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a <hi>withering member,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb, 2. 17, 18. 3. 15. 7. 25.</note> a <hi>dying brother,</hi> a <hi>perishing child,</hi> a <hi>wandring sheep?</hi>
where is his <hi>zeale</hi> and his <hi>tender mercies,</hi> and the sounding of his bowells? are
they restrained?<note place="margin">Isa: 40. 11. &amp; 63. 8.</note> Will he not lay hold of his strength, and stirre up his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
to save a poore sinking creature?<note place="margin">Ezek: 34. 4, 12.</note> Also <hi>He that is in us is greater then he
that is in the world;</hi> and will he suffer himselfe to be wrought out of his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and not stirre up his strength to keep possession of the dwelling place
which he had chosen? So that neither in the nature of the thing it selfe, nor in
respect of him, with whom we have to doe, doth this seem possible.</p>
            <p>But secondly,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> Sinne procureth by the way of merit, the taking away of the
Spirit, and removeall of the Habit graciously bestowed; Believers deserve by
sinne, that God should take his Spirit from them, and the Grace that he hath
bestowed on them: They doe so indeed, it cannot be denied: but will the
Lord deale so with them?<note place="margin">Isa: 48. 9.</note> Will he <hi>judge his house</hi> with such <hi>fler and vengeance?</hi>
Is that the way of a Father with his Children? untill he hath taken away his
Spirit and grace? although they are <hi>Rebellious Children,</hi> yet they are <hi>his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
still: and is this the way of a tender Father to cut the throats of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when it is in his power to mend them? The casting of a wicked man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell, is not a punishment to be compared to this: the losse of Gods presence
is the worst of Hell. How infinitely, must they needs be more sensible of it
who have once enjoyed it,<note place="margin">Isa: 49. 15, 16 Isa: 66. 13.</note> then those who were strangers to it from their
wombe? Certainly the Lord bears another Testimony concerning his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to his Sonnes and Daughters,<note place="margin">Ierem: 2. 14. Hos. 2. 14. &amp;c.</note> then that we should entertaine such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
thoughts of him. He <hi>chastises</hi> his Children indeed, but he doth not <hi>kill
them;</hi> he <hi>corrects</hi> them with rodds, but his <hi>Kindnesse</hi> he takes not from them:
notwithstanding of the attempt made by the Remonstrants in their <hi>Synodalia,</hi>
I may say that I have not as yet met with any tolerable extrication of those
difficulties: more to this purpose will afterwards be insisted on.</p>
            <p>3. That which we intend, when we mention the Perseverance of Saints,
is their continuance to the end in the condition of Saintship, whereunto they
are called. Now in the state of Saintship, there are two things concurring,
1. That Holinesse which they receive from God, and 2. That Favour which
they have with God, being justified freely by his grace, through the blood of
Christ: and their continuance in this condition to the end of their lives, both
to their reall Holinesse, and gracious Acceptance, is the <hi>Perseverance</hi> whereof
we must treat. The one respecting the reall estate, the other their relative,
of which more particularly afterwards.</p>
            <p>And this is a briefe delineation of the Doctrine,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> which, the Lord assisting,
shall be explained, confirmed, and vindicated in the insuing discourse, which
being first set forth as a meere Skeleton, its <hi>Symetry</hi> and <hi>Complexion,</hi> Its
<hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Comelinesse,</hi> Its <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigor, Excellency</hi> and <hi>Vsefulnesse</hi> will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59070:35"/>
in the description of the severall parts and branches of it, be more fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.</p>
            <p>Now
because Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> though he was not pleased to fixe any orderly
state of the Question under debate; (a course he hath also thought good
to take in handling those <hi>other Heads</hi> of the Doctrine of the Gospell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath chosen to walke (for the maine with the <hi>Arminians</hi>) in Paths
of difference from the Reformed Churches) yet having scatterd up and
downe his Treatise, what his conceptions are of the Doctrine he doth oppose,
as also what he asserts in the place &amp; roome thereof, and Upon what Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
I shall briefly call, what he hath so delivered, both on the one hand, &amp;
on the other, to an account: to make the clearer way for the proofe of the
Truth, which indeed we own, and for the discovery of that which is brought
forth to contest for Acceptance with it, upon the score of Truth and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First
then,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 30.</note> 
               <hi>for the Doctrine of the</hi> Saints Perseverance, <hi>how it stands stated
in Mr</hi> Goodwins <hi>thoughts, and what he would have other men apprehend
thereof, may from sundry places in his Booke, especially</hi> Cap. 9. <hi>be collected,
and thus summarily presented.</hi> It is (<hi>saith he</hi> Cap. 9. Sect. 3.) a promising unto
men, and that with height of assurance, under what loosnesse or vile practises so
ever, exemption and freedome from punishment: <hi>so</hi> Sect. 4. It is in vaine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
or presse men unto the use of such meanes, in any kinde which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
displeasing to them, seeing they are ascertained and secured before hand that
they shal not fail of the end however, whether they use such means or no: a lushous, &amp;
Fulsome conceit (Sect. 5.) intoxicating the flesh, with a perswasion, that it hath Goods
layed up for the daies of Eternity; A notion comfortable and betideing peace to the
flesh (Sect. 15.) in administring unto it certaine hope, that it shall however escape
the wrath and vengeance which is to come, yea though it disporteth it selfe in all
manner of loosnesse, and licentiousnesse in the meane time. A presumption it is
that men (Sect. 18.) may or shall injoy the love of God and Salvation it selfe, under
practises of all manner of sinne and wickednesse. Representing God (Sect. 20.) as
a God, in whose sight he is Good that doth evill: promising his love, favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
as well unto doggs returning to their vomit, or to swine wallowing (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their washing) in the mire (<hi>that is to</hi> Apostates <hi>which that believers shall
not be, is indeed the Doctrine he opposeth</hi>) as unto Lambs aud sheepe.
A Doctrine whereby' tis possible for me certainly to know, that how loosly, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely,
how debauchedly soever I should behave my selfe, yet God will love me, as
he doth the holdest and most righteous man under Heaven.</p>
            <p>With these and the like Expressions doth Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> adorne and Gilde
over that Doctrine, which he hath chosen to oppose: with these <hi>Garlands</hi> &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
doth he surround the Head of the Sacrifice, which he intends instantly
to slay, that so it may fall an undeplored <hi>Victim,</hi> if not seasonably rescued
from the hands of this sacred Officer. Neither through his whole <hi>Treatise,</hi> do
I find it delivered in any other sence, or held out under any other notion
to his Reader: The Course here he hath taken in this case, and the paths he
walkes in towards his Adversaries, seeme to be no other, then that which was
traced out by the <hi>Bishops</hi> at <hi>Constance,</hi> when they caused Divells to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the <hi>Cap</hi> they put on the Head of <hi>Huss,</hi> before they cast him into the
fire; I do somthing doubt (though I am not altogether Ignorant, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably
the <hi>Tenents</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of those, who first opposed the <hi>Papacy,</hi>
are represented and given over to posterity, by them, whose interest it was
to have them thought such, as they gave them out to be) whether ever any
man, that undertooke to publish his <hi>Conceptions</hi> to the world, about any
opinion, or parcell of Truth, debated amongst Professors of the Gospell of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59070:36"/>
Christ, did ever so dismember, disfigure, defile, wrest, and pervert that which
he opposed, as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath done the <hi>Doctrine of Perseverance</hi> which he
hath undertaken to destroy; Me thinks a man should not be much delighted
in casting filth and dung upon his Adversary, before he begin to graple with
him; In one word, this being the account he gives us of it, if he be able to
name one <hi>Author, ancient</hi> or moderne, any one <hi>sober person</hi> of old, or of late,
that ever spent a pen full of Inke, or once opened his mouth in the defence
of that <hi>Perseverance of Saints,</hi> or rather profane walking of dogs and swine,
which he hath stated, not in the <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>termes,</hi> but so much as to the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or purpose here intimated by him; and it shall be accepted as a just <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensative</hi>
against the Crime, which we are inforced to charge in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and which otherwise will not easily be warded. If this be the Doctrine,
which with so great an indeavour, and a Contribution of so much <hi>Paines</hi> and
<hi>Rhetorique</hi> he seeks to oppose, I know not any that will thinke it worth while,
to interpose in this fierce contest between him and his man of straw. Neither
can it with the least colour of Truth be pretended, that these are <hi>Consequences,</hi>
which he urgeth the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he opposeth withall, and not his Apprehensions
of the <hi>Doctrine it selfe.</hi> For neither doth he in any place in his whole <hi>Treatise,</hi>
hold it out in any other shape, but is uniforme, and constant to himselfe, in
expreffing his notion of it; nor doth he indeed almost use any Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, but those that suppose this to be the true state of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversy,</hi> which
he hath proposed. But whether this indeed be the Doctrine of the <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Saints,</hi> which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> so importunately cryes out against, upon a
briefe consideration of some of the particulars mentioned, will quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
            <p>First
then,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> doth this Doctrine <hi>promise with height of Assurance, that under
what loosnesse, or vile practices soever men doe live, they shall have Exemption from
punishment?</hi> wherein I pray? in that it promiseth the Saints of God, that through
his Grace they shall be preserved from such <hi>loosenesse and evill practises,</hi> as
would expose them to Eternall punishment?<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 6.</note> Doth it teach men, <hi>that it is vain
to use the meanes of mortification because,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 31. 33. 1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>they shall certainly attaine the end, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they use the meanes or no?</hi> Or may you not as well say, that the Doctrine
you oppose is, <hi>that all men shall be saved whether they believe or no,</hi> with those
other <hi>comfortable and chearing</hi> associate doctrines you mention? Or is this
a Regular Emergency of that Doctrine which teaches,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> that there is no attaining
the <hi>End,</hi> but by the <hi>meanes,</hi> between which there is such a <hi>Concatenation</hi> by
Divine appointment, that they shall not be separated? Doth it <hi>speake peace
to the flesh, in Assurance of Blessed Immortality, though it disport it selfe in all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the meane time?</hi> Doe the Teachers of it, expresse any such thing? Doth
any such Abomination issue from their <hi>Arguings</hi> in the defence thereof?
Or doth the Doctrine which teaches Believers (Saints who have tasted of
the love, and pardoning mercy of God, and are taught to valew it infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above all the world) that such is the Love, and goodwill of God towards
them, in the Covenant of mercy in the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> that having appointed
<hi>Good works</hi> for them to walke in,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 10. 2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> for which of themselves they are <hi>insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
he will graciously continue to them such supplyes of his Spirit, and Grace,
as that they shall never depart from following after him, in wayes of Gospell
Obedience? Doth this I say incourage any of them to continue in <hi>sinne</hi> that
this <hi>Grace</hi> may abound? Or are any Doctrines of the Gospell to be measured
by the rules, and lines of the use, or abuse that the <hi>flesh</hi> is apt to make of them?
Or rather by their suitablenesse to the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> whereof the Saints are
made partakers, and servicablenesse to their carrying on to perfection in that
Attainment? Or is this an Argument of validity against an <hi>Evangelicall</hi> Truth,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59070:36"/>
that the carnall unbelieving part is apt to <hi>turne it into wantonesse?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Believers <hi>walking after the Siprit,</hi> in which frame the Truthes of God in
the Gospell are savory and sweet to them,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1, 14.</note> doe experience such attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Doctrine under consideration, as are here intimated; I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will one day finde, that he hath not a little <hi>grieved the holy
Spirit of God,</hi> by these reproaches cast upon the worke of his Grace. Further,
Doth this perswasion assure men <hi>that they shall injoy the Love &amp; Favour of God
under the practises of all manner of sinne?</hi> Or can this be wrested, by any racks
or wheeles from this Assertion, that <hi>none indeed injoy the love and favour of
God,</hi> but only they, towards whom it is effectuall to turne them from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of all manner of sinne and wickednesse; to translate them from <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
into <hi>marvelous light, and from the power of Satan into the Kingdome of Jesus
Christ;</hi> whom the <hi>Grace that appears</hi> unto them, <hi>teacheth to deny all ungodlinesse
and worldly lusts to live soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present world:</hi> whom
that <hi>Love constraines not to live vnto them selves, but unto him that dyed for them?</hi>
Doth it promise <hi>the love and favour of God to doggs turning to their vomit,
&amp; swine wallowing in their mire?</hi> when the very discriminating difference of it
from that Doctrine which advanceth it selfe into Competition with it, is, that
such <hi>returning doggs</hi> and <hi>wallowing Swine</hi> did indeed in their best estate and
Condition, never truly and properly partake of the Love and favour of God:
but notwithstanding their disgorging and washing of themselves, they were
doggs and swine still: But to what end should I longer insist on these things?
I am fully perswaded, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe cannot make roome in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to apprehend that this is indeed the true notion of the Doctrine
which he doth oppose; Something hath been spoken of it already, and more
the Lord asslisting, will be discussed in the progresse of our Discourse, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
sufficient to manifest to the consciences of men, not possest with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against the Truth, that it is quite of another nature, &amp; consistency, of
another Complexion and usefullnesse, then what is here represented; I cannot
but adde, that this way of handling Controversies in Religion, namely in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Consequences and Inferences of our owne framing, (wierdrawne with
<hi>violence</hi> and <hi>subtility</hi> from <hi>Principles</hi> farr distant from them, disowned, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed,
and disclaimed by them, on whom they are imposed) as the Judgment
of our Adversaries, loading them with all manner of reproaches, is such, as
(beeing of all men in the world most walked in by the <hi>Arminians,</hi>) I desire
not to be Competitor with any in: <hi>haud defensoribus istis &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now a little (in the next place) consider what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> gives
in for that Perswasion,<note place="margin">§ 32.</note> which in Opposition to the other before by him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played,
he contendeth with all his strength to advance; I doe not doubt but
all that are acquainted with his way of expression, (<hi>elato cothurno</hi>) will (as
they may reasonably) expect to have it brought forth <gap reason="foreign">

Yea he tells you farther</hi> (Sect. 22.) That the Saints have as good security
of their Perseverance, as he could have of his life, to whom God should grant a lease
of it for so long upon condition that he did not thrust a sword through his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,
or cast himselfe headlong downe a Tower; so that his Doctrine indulgeth to
the Saints as much assurance, as that of Perseverance; but only it grants them
not a liberty of sinning <hi>which I presume his owne Conscience told him that
neither the other doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is this inded Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Doctrine?<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> Is this all that he intends his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and proofs shall amount unto? <hi>Ad populum phaleras:</hi> strange that
when there is not so much as a <hi>probabillity</hi> or <hi>danger</hi> of falling away, yet so
many, and so Eminent Saints should so fall? How seldome is it, that we heare
of wise and sober men <hi>running into the fier, throwing</hi> themselves <hi>headlong

then the <hi>Apostacy of Saints,</hi> If these things stood upon equall tearmes of
unlikelyhood and improbability?<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> The <hi>stony field</hi> in the <hi>Parable</hi> seemes to be
every whit as large <hi>as the good ground,</hi> whose fruit abideth. That <hi>Ground</hi> in
Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> sence is true Believers; so that a moyety at least must be granted
to fall away, and never come to perfection: Doubtlesse this is not easy to be
received, that one <hi>halfe</hi> of a Company of men in succession, should constantly
from one Generation to another, fall into ruine in such a way, as wherein
there is no <hi>Danger</hi> of it, or <hi>probability</hi> that it should so come to passe. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
we should scarce dare to walke the streets, least at every steppe we be
strucken downe by sober men, voluntarily tumbling themselves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the topps
of houses, and hardly keepe our selves from being wounded with the swords
wherewith they runne themselves through. Was this inded the case with
<hi>David, Solomon, Peter?</hi> and others who totally Apostatized from the Faith?
But if it be so, if they are thus secure, whence is it, that it doth arise? what are
the Fountaines, Springs and causes of this generall Security? Is it from the
<hi>weakenesse</hi> of the <hi>Opposition,</hi> and slightnesse of all Meanes of diversion from
walking with God to the End, that they meet withall? Or is it from the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which they have, and <hi>Grace</hi> wherewith they are indued?
Or is it that God hath gracionsly <hi>undertaken</hi> to safegard them, and to preserve
them in their abiding with him, that they shall not fall away? Or is it that
Christ intercedeth for them, that their Faith faile not, but be preserved, and
their Soules with it, by the Power of God unto the End? Or from what other
Principle doth this Security of theirs arise? From what Fountain do the streams
of their Consolation Flow? Where lye the Heads of this <hi>Nilus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is not upon the <hi>first</hi> account, I suppose cannot enter into the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of any person, who ever had the least experience of walking with
God, or doth so much as <hi>assent</hi> to the letter of the Scripture. How are our
Enemies there discribed as to their <hi>Number, Nature, Power, Policy, Subtility,
Malice, Restlessenes,</hi> and <hi>Advantages?</hi> With what inimaginable and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
variety of <hi>Meanes, Temptations, Baites, Allurements, Inticements, Terrors,
Threats,</hi> doe they fight against us? Such &amp; <hi>so many</hi> are the enemies that oppose
the Saints of God in their abiding with him; so <hi>Great</hi> &amp; Effectual the Means, &amp;
weapons, wherewith they fight against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; so <hi>unwearied</hi> and watchfull are they
for the improovement of all Advantages &amp; Opportunityes for their ruine; that
upon the supposall of the Rejection of those Principles, and those meanes of
of their Preservation, which we shall finde Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to attempt, they will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59070:37"/>
be found to be so farre from a state of no <hi>danger,</hi> and <hi>litle probability</hi> of Falling,
or only under a remote Possibility of so doing, that it will appeare utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posible
for them to hold out, and abide unto the end. Had the choisest Saint
of God, with all the Grace that he hath received, but <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>many</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and that the weakest, of all them which oppose every Saint of God, even
the feeblest, to deale withall, separated from the Strength of those Principles
and Supportments, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin</hi> seeketh to cast downe, (let him lye
under continuall exhortations, to <hi>watchfulnesse,</hi> &amp; close walking with God) he
may as easily move Mountaines with his finger, or climbe to Heaven by a
Ladder, as stand before the strength of that one enemy. <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise</hi>
had no <hi>Lust</hi> within to intice him, no <hi>World</hi> under the Curse to seduce him,
yet at the first assault of Sathan, who then had no part in him, he fell quite out
of <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>I shall give one instance in one of the many enemies,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> that fight against the
welfare of our soules, and (<hi>ex hoc uno</hi>) we may guesse at the residue of its
companions. This is <hi>indwelling sinne,</hi> whose <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>policy, strength</hi> and
<hi>prevalency, neerenesse</hi> and <hi>trechery,</hi> the Scripture exceedingly setts out, and the
Saints daily feele; I shall only poynt at some particulars.</p>
            <p>First concerning its <hi>Neerenesse</hi> to us, it is indeed <hi>in us:</hi> and that not as a
thing different from us, but it cleaveth to all the faculties of our soules; it is
an Enemy <hi>borne</hi> with us,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 5.</note> 
               <hi>bred</hi> up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>with us, <hi>carried</hi> about in our bosomes; by
nature,<note place="margin">Math. 5. 29, 30.</note> our <hi>familiar friend,</hi> our <hi>guide</hi> and councellor, deare to us as our <hi>right
eye,</hi> usefull as our <hi>right hand,</hi> our wisdome, strength, &amp;c. The Apostle 7. Rom.
17:20. calleth it the <hi>sinne that dwelleth in us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 3. 15. 6.</note> it hath in us, in the faculties of
our soules, its abode and station. It doth not passe by, and away, but there it
dwelles, so as that it never goes from home, is never out of the way, when we
have any thing to doe; whence <hi>v,</hi> 21. he calls it, <hi>the evill that is present with
him.</hi> When we goe about any thing that is good or have opportunity for, or
temptation unto any thing that is evill, it is never absent; but is ready to <hi>pluck</hi>
us back, or to <hi>put</hi> us on, according as it serves its ends; it is such an Inmate,
that we can never be quit of its company, and so intimate unto us, that it
puts forth it selfe, in every acting of the <hi>ming, will,</hi> or any other faculty of the
soule. Though men would faine shake it off, yet when they <hi>would doe good,</hi>
this <hi>evill</hi> will be present with them. Then,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Its <hi>Vniversality and compasse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26. 18. 2 Cor. 6. 14. Ephes. 5. 8. Isa. 29. 18. 35. 5. 42. 7.</note> It is not straightned in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the soule: 'tis spread over the whole, all the faculties, affections. and
passions of it. That which is<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 6. Math. 6. 23. ch. 11. 79. Luk. 11. 34, 35, 36.</note> 
               <hi>borne of the flesh is flesh:</hi> tis all <hi>flesh,</hi> and nothing
but <hi>flesh;</hi> it is <hi>Darknesse</hi> in the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> keeping us at best that we <hi>know
but in part,</hi> and are still <hi>dull and slow of heart to believe;</hi> naturally we are all
Darknesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 19.</note> nothing but Darknesse, and though the Lord, <hi>shine into our mind,
to give us in some measure the knowledge of his Glory in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note>
yet we are still very <hi>darke,</hi> &amp; it is a hard work to bring in a little Light,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 8. Eph. 4. 18. Revel. 3. 17.</note> upon
the soule; especially this is seen in particular practicall things; though in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
<note place="margin">Math. 23. 16.</note> we have very cleare light and eviction, yet when we come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Acts of obedience.<note place="margin">Math. 4. 16.</note> How often doth our light grow dimme and failes us,
causing us to judge amisse of that which is before us,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 5. 2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> by the rising of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
darknesse, which is in us? It is perversenesse, stubbornnesse, obstinacy
in the <hi>Will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18. Ioh. 8. 34.</note> that carries it with violence, to disobedience and sinne. It is <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi>
upon the <hi>Affections,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> bending them to the things of the World, aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them from God;<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18. 8. 7, 8.</note> It is slipperinesse in the <hi>memory,</hi> making us like <hi>leaking
vessells,</hi>
               <note place="margin">lerem. 6. 16.</note> that the things that we heare of the Gospell, doe suddainly <hi>slip out,</hi>
when as other things abide firme in the <hi>Cells</hi> and Chambers thereof.<note place="margin">Gen: 6. 5.</note> It is
senselesnesse and errour in the <hi>Conscience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">lerem. 13. 23. Heb. 2. 1.</note> staving it off from the performance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59070:38"/>
of that duty, which in the Name and Authority of God, it is to accomplish:
and in all these, is dayly enticing, and seducing the heart to Folly, conceiving
&amp; bringing forth sinne.<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 14, 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Its <hi>Power;</hi> the Apostle calls it a <hi>Law, a Law in his members, a
Law of sinne, Rom.</hi> 7. 21, 23. Such a <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>Fights,</hi> makes warre, and <hi>leads cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
selling us under sinne:</hi> not suffering us to doe <hi>the good we would,</hi> forceing
us to the evill we would not, drawing us off from that we delight in, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us under bondage to that which we abhorre; a powerfull, unmercifull,
cruell <hi>Tyrant</hi> it is: <hi>Oh! wretched men that we are,</hi> vers. 24. There is no Saint of
God, but in the inward man doth hate sinne, every sinne more then Hell it
selfe, knowing the world of evills, that attend the least sinne; yet is there not
one of them, but this powerfull <hi>Tyrant</hi> hath compelled and forced to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as have made them a burthen to their own Soules.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly: Its <hi>Cunning, Craft, and Policy.</hi> It is called in Scripture the
<hi>Old Man,</hi> not from the <hi>weaknesse</hi> of its <hi>strength,</hi> but from the <hi>strength</hi> of its
<hi>Craft:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> Take heed, saith the Apostle, least any of you be hardened by the <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of sinne.</hi> There is abundance of <hi>deceitfulnesse</hi> in it; being ready, fit,
and prompt to beguile: lying in wayt for advantages, furnished for all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and ready to close with every temptation; yea the wayes of it
are so large &amp; various, its Wiles and Methods for deceiving so innumerable, its
fruitfulnesse in conceiving and bringing forth of sinne so abundant, its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and opportunities so many, that it is like the <hi>way of a Serpent upon a
stone,</hi> there is no tracing or finding of it out.</p>
            <p>A serious consideration of the opposition made unto our <hi>Perseverance,</hi> by
this one Enemy, which hath so much ability, and is so restlesse in its warfare,
never quiet conquering nor conquered, which can be kept out of none of
our Councells, excluded from none of our actings, is abundantly sufficient to
evince, that it is not want, or weaknesse of Enemies, which putteth Believers out
of danger of falling away.</p>
            <p>But all this perhaps will be granted: Enemies they have enough,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> and those
much more diligent and powerfull every one of them, then all we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of that now described, amounteth unto: but the <hi>meanes of Preservation,</hi>
which God affords the Saints, is that which puts them almost out of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
and gives them that Golden security mentioned, which cometh not (in
administring consolation) one steppe behind that which ariseth from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of absolute Perseverance; Let then this be a little considered, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it will allay this whole contest. Is it then, that such is the Grace that is
bestowed upon them, in respect of the <hi>Principle</hi> whence it is bestowed, (<hi>the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Love of God</hi>) and the way whereby it is for them procured (the Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding
and Intercession of Christ) with the nature of it, (being the seed of
God, which abideth and withereth not) and that such seemes to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of infused <hi>Habits,</hi> that they are not removed, but by the power, and
immediate hand of him, by whom they are bestowed? Is it from hence, that
their Assurance and security doth arise? Alas, all this is but a fiction: there is
no Faith that is the fruit of <hi>Election,</hi> Christ purchased it not for any, by his
Death: <hi>Infused Habits</hi> are not: the Grace that perisheth, and that, that abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
are the same: these things are but pretences. Is it then, that God hath
purposed from Eternity, to continue Constant in his Love towards them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>to Leave them nor Forsake them?</hi> Nay but of all things Imaginable, this is
the greatest Abomination, which if the <hi>Scriptures did any where Affirme, it were
sufficient to make a rationall considering man, to Question their Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then, hath the Lord <hi>Promised</hi> to give themsuch continued <hi>supplyes</hi> of his
Spirit &amp; Grace in Jesus Christ, as that they shall be supported against all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59070:38"/>
and preserved from all, or any such sinnes as will certainely make a
separation betweene God and their Soules? Nay there is not one such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in all the Booke of God; they are <hi>Conditionall,</hi> for the injoyment of the
good things, whereof Believers stand all their dayes upon their good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?
Is it then that the Lord Jesus, who is alwais heard of his Father, <hi>intercedes</hi>
for them, that their Faith <hi>faile not,</hi> &amp; that they may be preserved by <hi>the power
of God unto Salvation,</hi> &amp; that not only upon Condition of their Believing, but
cheefly, that they may be kept and preserved in Believing? Or is it that their
Enemies are so conquered for them, and on their behalfe, in the <hi>Death</hi> and
<hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, that they shall never have dominion over them, that
their Security doth arise? Neither the one, nor the other, nor any, nor all of
these, are the Grounds, and Foundations of their Establishment, but they are
wholy given up to the powerfull hand of some <hi>Considerations,</hi> which M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
expresseth and setteth out to the life, <hi>Cap. 9. Sect. 32, 33, 34. Pag.</hi> 174,
175.</p>
            <p>Now because the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> have always told us,<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> that God hath provided
<hi>sufficiently</hi> for the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll Hag. A. 5. Act. Synod. Decl. sent. A. 5. Thes. 2.</note> if they <hi>be not supinely wanting to
themselves in the use of them,</hi> but have not hitherto, either joyntly, or severally
(that I know of) taken the paines to discover in particular, wherein that
Sufficiency of Provision for their safety doth consist, or what the meanes are
that God offords them to this end and purpose; Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> who is a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Mystes of all their Councels, having exactly and fully layd them forth,
as a solid Foundation of his Assertion, concerning only a remote Possibility
of the Saints totall Defection, let it not seeme Tedious or Impertinent, if I
Transcribe, for the clearer Debate of it before the Reader, that whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of his, and consider it in order as it lyes. <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>it be Demanded,
what are the Meanes which God hath given so abundantly to the Saints, to make
themselves so free, so strong in inclinations to avoid things so apparantly destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the Spirituall Peace, and Salvation of their Soules, as naturally men are
to forbeare all such occasions, which are apparantly destructive to their
naturall lives, so that they need not to be any more, any whit more afraid of
loosing their Soules through their owne actings, then men are, or need to be of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
their naturall lives upon the same termes. I Answer</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> he hath given them Eyes wherewith, &amp; Light whereby Clearaly, &amp; evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to see and know, that it is not more rationall, or manlike for men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
all such acts, which they know they cannot performe, but to the present and
unavoidadle destruction of their naturall lives, then 'tis to forbeare all sinfull
Acts whatsoever, and especially such, which are apparantly destructive to their
Soules.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath not only given them the Eyes, and the Light we
speake of, wherewith, and whereby cleerely to see, &amp; vnderstand the things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested,
but hath farther indued them with a faculty of Consideration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to reflect upon, and review, and ponder, so oft as they please, what they See,
Vnderstand, and Know in this kind. Now what soever a man is capable, First, <hi>of
Seeing and Knowing: (Secondly</hi>) of Pondering and Considering, he is capable of
raising or working an inclination in himselfe towards it, answerable in Strength,
Vigour and Power, to any degree of Goodnesse, or Desireableness, which he is able to
apprehend therein: for what is an inclination towards any thing, but a propension,
and laying out of the heart and soule towards it? So that if there be worth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
sufficient in any object whatsoever to beare it; and (<hi>Secondly</hi>) if a man be
in a capacity of discovering and apprehending this good clearly; and (<hi>Thirdly</hi>)
be in a like capacity of considering this vision, certainly he is in a capacity and at
liberty to worke himselfe to what strength, or degree of desire and inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59070:39"/>
it he pleaseth, now 'tis certaine to every man, that there is more good in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from things either Eminently dangerous, or Apparantly destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to his Soule, then in forbearing things Apparantly destructive to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
being. (<hi>Secondly,</hi>) as evident it is, that every man is capable of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or comeing to the certaine knowledge of, and cleare apprehending this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of good to him in the former Good, then in the latter. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> neither is it a
thing lesse evident then either of the former, that every man is as capable of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
or reapprehending the said excess of Good as much &amp; as oft, as he pleaseth
as he is simply of apprehending it at all; which supposed as undeniably true, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
with an high hand &amp; above all contradiction, that the Saints may (and have
meanes and opportunityes faire and full for that purpose) plant inclinations or
dispositions in themselves to refraine all manner of sinnes, apparently dangerous &amp;
destructive to the safety of their Soules, fuller of energie, vigor, life, strength, power
then the naturall inclination in them, which teacheth them to refraine all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which they know must needs be accompanied with the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
beings. Therefore if they be more or so much afraid of destroying their lives vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
&amp; knowingly, (as by the casting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves into the fier, or the water or the
like) then they are of falling away through sin; the fault or reason thereof is not at
all in the Doctrine, which affirmes or informes them, that there is a possibility that
they fall away, but in themselves, and their owne voluntary negligence: they have
meanes and opportunityes (as we have prooved) in abundance to render themselves
every whit as secure, yea and more secure touching the latter, as they are, or reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
can be, concerning the former.</p>
            <p>When I first cast an eye on this Discourse of Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 38. Ans.</note> I confesse I was
surprized to as high a degree of Admiration, &amp; some other Affections also, as
by any thing I had observed in his whole Booke: as having not met (if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence I may be allowed to speake my Apprehensions) with any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
whatsoever, of so transcendent a derogation <hi>from,</hi> and direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to the overthrow of the Grace of Christ, but only in what is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
by <hi>Austin, Hilary, Pulgentius,</hi> with some others, of the disputes of <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Coelestius, Julianus,</hi> with their followers, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> of late, with
whom Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> would not be thought to have Joyned in their Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>to the Merit and Grace of Christ;</hi> As I said then before, if this should
proove in the issue to be the summe of the meanes afforded to preserve the
Saints from <hi>Apostacy and falling away</hi> into ruine, I shall be so farre from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a <hi>possibility</hi> of their defection, that I shall certainely conclude their
<hi>Perseverance to be impossible.</hi> Being fully perswaded that withall the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of strength, which the considerations mentioned are able of themselves
to afford unto them, they are no more able to meet their <hi>Adversaries</hi> who
come <hi>against them</hi> with <hi>tweuty thousand</hi> subtilties and Temptations, then a
man with a straw and a feather, is to combate with, and overcome a royall
Army; The Scripture tells us, and we thought it had been so, that we <hi>are
kept by the power of God unto Salvation,</hi> and that to this end, <hi>he putts forth the
exceeding greatnesse of his power in them that Believe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5. Ephes. 1. 17, 18. 19. 20. Col. 1. 11.</note> according to <hi>the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Workings, which wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead,</hi> whereby
he strengthens <hi>them with all might according to his Glorious Power,</hi> making
them <hi>meet partakers of the inheritance of the Saints Light;</hi> It seemes, though
there be a <hi>Glorious sound of words</hi> in these, &amp; innumerable the like Expressions
of the ingagement of the Power and faithfullnesse of God, for the <hi>safegarding
of his Saints,</hi> yet all this is but an empty noyse, and beating of the ayre: That
which is indeed materiall to this Purpose, consisting in certaine <hi>Considerations,</hi>
which rationall men may have concerning their present State, &amp; future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
But let us a little consider the Discourse it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59070:39"/>
1. First, it is all along <hi>Magnificently</hi> supposed, that there is the same Power
and Ability in a Rationall Inlightened man to Deliberate and Conclude of
things in reference unto the Practicall Condition of his <hi>Spirituall</hi> Estate,
as there is of his <hi>Naturall,</hi> and that this Ability is constantly resident with
him to make use of upon all occasions, what ever our Saviour say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>viz. That without him we can doe nothing. Joh.</hi> 15. 5.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, (to make way for that,) that such a one is able to know,<note place="margin">Ps. 119. 144. 1 Cor. 2. 14.</note>
and to desire the things of his Peace in a Sprirituall and usefull manner, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the vanity of those many seemingly fervent Prayers of the
Saints in the Scripture, that God would give them understanding in these
things, and his manifold Promises of that Grace.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, that upon such deliberations men are put into a capacity and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
or are inabled to worke themselves to what strength or degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and inclination towards that Good considered, they please, and according
as the good is, that men apprehend, (as abiding with God is the greatest
Good) such will be the strengh and the vigour and power of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
thereto.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>That they have a Law in their members, rebelling against the
Law of their minds, &amp; leading them captive under the Law of sinne,</hi> needs not to
be taken notice of.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> This <hi>sufficiency</hi> it seemes <hi>is of themselves:</hi> He was a weake
unskilfull man, who supposed that of our selves we <hi>could not think a good
thought,</hi> seeing we are such perfect Lords and Masters of all good thoughts
and actings whatever.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, the whole summe of this Discourse of the means afforded
Believers to inable them to Persevere, amounts to this, that being rationall
men, they may, First consider that some <hi>kinds of sinnes</hi> will destroy them,
and separate them from God, and that by <hi>Obedience</hi> they shall come to the
Greatest Good Imaginable, where upon it is in their Power so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to incline their hearts unto Obedience, that they shall be in no more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of departing from God, then a <hi>Wise and Rationall man</hi> is of killing or
willfully destroying himselfe: The first part whereof may be performed by
them who are no Saints; the latter not by any Saint whatsoever. And is not
this <hi>noble Provision</hi> for the Security and Assurance of the Saints, enough to
make them cast away with speed all their interest in the unchangeable <hi>purposes</hi>
Gracious and Faithfull <hi>Promises</hi> of God, <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ, <hi>Sealing</hi> of the
Spirit, and all those <hi>Sandy</hi> and triviall supports of their Faith, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they have rejoyced in. And what ever experience they have, or Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from the Word they doe recieve, of the <hi>Darkenesse,</hi> and <hi>Weakenesse</hi> of their
Minds, the <hi>stubbornesse</hi> of their Wills, with the strong inclinations that are in
them to sinne and falling away, what ever be their Oppositions from <hi>aboue</hi>
them,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 12. Heb. 12. 1. Rom. 7. 17.</note> 
               <hi>about</hi> them, <hi>within</hi> them, on the right Hand, and on the Left that they
have to wrestle withall; let them give up them selves to the hand of their
owne <hi>manlike Considerations</hi> and weighing of things, which will secure them
against all danger or <hi>Probability of falling away;</hi> For if they be but capable
(First) of seeing and knowing, (Secondly) of pondering and considering, and
that rationally, (it matters not, whether these things are Fruits of the Spirit of
Grace or no, nay 'tis cleare they must not be so) that such, and such evill
is to be avoided, and that there is so, and so Great a Good to be obtained by
continuing in obedience, they may raise and worke <hi>inclinations</hi> in themselves
answerable in strength, vigour, and power, to any degree of goodnesse, which
they apprehend, in what they see and ponder.</p>
            <p>The whole of the <hi>Ample sufficient Meanes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 40.</note> afforded by God to the
Saints to inable them to Persevere, branching it selfe into these two
heads, (First) The <hi>rationall considering</hi> what they have to doe, (Secondly)
Their <hi>vigorous Inclination</hi> of their Hearts, to act suitably and answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59070:40"/>
to their Considerations, I shall (in a word) consider them apart.</p>
            <p>1. First the Considerations mentioned, of <hi>Evill</hi> to be avoided, and <hi>Good</hi>
to be attained, (I meane that which may put men upon Creating those
strong inclinations: For such considerations may be without any such Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
as in her that cryed <hi>video meliora probo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> deteriora sequor</hi>) are either Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
and products of mens owne <hi>naturall faculties,</hi> and deduced out of the
power of them, so that, as men, they may put themselves upon them at
any time; or they are Fruits of the Spirit of his Grace, who <hi>worketh in us to
will and to doe of his owne good Pleasure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3, 4.</note> If they be the latter, I aske, seeing all
Grace is of Promise, whether hath God promised to give and continue this
Grace of <hi>selfe-consideration</hi> unto Believers or noe? If he hath, whether <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi>
or <hi>conditionally?</hi> If <hi>absolutely,</hi> then he hath promised <hi>absolutely</hi> to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
some Grace in them, which is all we desire. If <hi>Conditionally,</hi> then would
I know what that <hi>Condition</hi> is, on which God hath promised that Believers
shall so consider things mentioned? And of the <hi>Condition</hi> which shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
it may farther be enquired, whether it be any <hi>Grace</hi> of God, or only a
meer Act of the <hi>Rationall Creature</hi> as such, without any immediate Inworking
of the Will and Deed by God? Whatsoever is answered, the Question will
not goe to <hi>Rest,</hi> untill it be granted that, either it is a <hi>Grace Absolutely promised</hi>
of God, which is all we desire, or a pure Act of the <hi>Creature</hi> contra-distinct
thereunto, which Answers the first inquiry: Let it then be granted, that the
<hi>Considerations</hi> intimated are no other, but such as a Rationall man, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
to an assent to the Truth of God, may so <hi>exert</hi> and exercise, as he
pleaseth; then is here a Foundation layd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all the Ground of <hi>Perseverance</hi>
that is allowed the Saints, in their owne indeavours, as men without the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of any Grace of God; Now these <hi>Considerations,</hi> be they what they
will, must needs be beneath one <hi>single good thought,</hi> (for as for that we have
no sufficiency of our selves) yea Vanity and nothing (for without
Christ, we <hi>can doe nothing</hi>) yea evill and displeasing to God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3. Ioh. 15. 5. Gen. 8. 21.</note> as are <hi>all the
thoughts and imaginations of our Hearts,</hi> that are only such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had supposed
that no man, in the least acquainted with what it is to <hi>serve God under Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and what the worke of Saving Soules is, but had been sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of utter the insufficiency of such Rationall Considerations, flowing only
from <hi>Conviction,</hi> to be a solid Foundation of abiding with God unto the end.
If mens <hi>Houses</hi> of profession are built on such <hi>Sands</hi> as these, we need not
wonder to see them so frequently falling to the ground.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> suppose these <hi>Considerations</hi> to act their parts upon the stage rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for them, to the <hi>Greatest Applause</hi> that can be expected or desired, yet that,
which comes next upon the Theater, will, I feare, foully miscarry, and spoyle
the whole <hi>Plot of the Play:</hi> That is, <hi>mens vigorous inclination of their hearts to
the good things pondered on, to what height they please:</hi> For besides that</p>
            <p>1. First, it is liable to the same <hi>Examinations,</hi> that passed upon it's Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
before, or an inquiry from whence he comes, whether from <hi>Heaven</hi> or
<hi>Men?</hi> upon which I doubt not, but he may easily be discovered to be <hi>a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond</hi>
upon the earth, to have no <hi>Passe</hi> from Heaven, and so be rendred liable
to the <hi>Law</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, it would be inquired, whether it hath a Consistency with
the whole designe of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and therefore,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, it is utterly denied, that Men, the <hi>Best</hi> of Men, have <hi>in</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and <hi>of</hi> themselves, arising upon the account of any <hi>Considerations</hi>
whatsoever, a Power, Ability, or Strength, vigorously or at all acceptably to
God, to incline their Hearts to the performance of any thing that is spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, or in a Gospell tendency to walking with God; All the <hi>Promises</hi> of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59070:40"/>
God, all the Prayers of the Saints, all their Experience, the whole designe of
God in laying up all our stores of Strength and Grace in Christ, joyntly cry
out against it, for a counterfeit pretence. In a word, that men are able to
plant in themselves <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Dispositions</hi> to refraine all manner of
Sinne destructive to the safety of their soules, fuller of <hi>Energie,</hi> Vigor, Life,
Strength, Power, then those that are in them, to avoid things Apparantly
tending to the destruction of their naturall lives, is an Assertion as full of <hi>Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
Strength, and Vigor, Life and Poyson, for the destruction and eversion
of the Grace of God in Christ, as any can be invented.</p>
            <p>To shut up this Discourse and to proceed:<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> If these are the solid Foundations
of Peace and Consolation, which the Saints have concerning their <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
if these be the means <hi>sufficient, abundantly</hi> sufficient afforded
them, for their Preservation, that are laid in the ballance, as to the giving of
an Evangelicall Genuine Assurance, with the <hi>Decrees,</hi> and <hi>Purposes,</hi> the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Promises</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> of God, the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting</hi>
and <hi>Sealing</hi> of the spirit of Grace, I suppose we need not care, how
soone we enter the Lists with any, as to the comparing of the Doctrines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
contest, in reference to their Influence into the Obedience and Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Saints, which with it's Issue, in the close of this discourse shall God
willing be put to the triall.</p>
            <p>Now that I may lay a more cleere Foundation for what doth insue,<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> I shall
briefely deduce, not only the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it selfe, but also the <hi>Method,</hi> wherein I
shall handle it, from a portion of Scripture, in which the whole is summarily
comprized, and branched forth into suitable Heads, for the Confirmation
and vindication thereof. And this also is required to the mayne of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
being not so directly to <hi>Convince stout Gaine-sayers,</hi> in vanquishing their
<hi>Objections,</hi> as to <hi>Strengthen Weak Believers,</hi> in helping them against <hi>Temptations,</hi>
&amp; therefore shall at the entrance hold out that, whereinto their Faith must be
ultimately resolved; the Authority of God in his Word, being that <hi>Arke</hi> alone
whereon it can rest the sole of its foot. Now this is the Fourth chap. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
of which take this short account: It is a Chapter made up of Gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
given to the Church, in a Calamitous season: the <hi>Season</hi> it selfe is described,
verses 25, and 26. of the third Chapter, and the first of this; all holding out,
a distressed estate, a low condition; it is indeed Gods <hi>Method,</hi> to make out
gracious Promises to his People, when their condition seems most deplored, to
sweeten their soules with a sence of his Love, in the multitude of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
thoughts, which in distracted times, are ready to tumultuate in
them.</p>
            <p>The Foundation of all the following promises lies in the second verse,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> even
the giving out of the <hi>Branch of the Lord,</hi> and the Fruit of the earth for Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Glory, to the remnant of Israel: Who it is, who is the <hi>Branch of the
Lord,</hi> the Scripture tells us in sundry places, <hi>Isaiah 11. 1. Ier.</hi> 23. 5. &amp; 33. 15.
<hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 8. The Lord Jesus Christ, the Promise of whom is the Churches on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Supportment in every tryall or distresse, it hath to undergoe; He is this
Branch and Fruit, and he is placed in the <hi>Head</hi> here, as the great Fountain
Mercy, from whence all others doe flow: In those that follow, the <hi>Persons,</hi> to
whom those promises are made, and the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> of them are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable;
the <hi>Persons</hi> have various <hi>Appellations,</hi> and descriptions in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
They are called (First) <hi>the Escaping of Israell:</hi> v. 2. <hi>They that are left in
Sion,</hi> v. 3. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it selfe, v. 4 <hi>The Dwelling places and Assemblies of Mount
Sion.</hi> v. 5. That the same individuall Persons, are intended in all these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Appellations, is not questionable; It is but in reference to the severall
Acts of Gods dwelling with them, and outgoing of his Love and Goodwill
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59070:41"/>
both eternall, and temporall towards them, that they come under this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Names, and Descriptions. First, in respect of his Eternall Designation of
them to Life and Salvation, they are said to be <hi>written among the living, or
unto life in Jerusalem:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 12. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>their names are in the Lambs book of life, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10. 20.</note> and they are recorded in the purpose of God from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
Secondly in respect of their Deliverance, and actuall Redemption
from the bondage of death &amp; <hi>Satan,</hi> which for ever prevaile upon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of the Sonnes of Men, shadowed out by their deliverance from
the <hi>Babilonish</hi> Captivity,<note place="margin">Revel. 5. 9.</note> (pointed at in this place) they are said to be, <hi>a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25. 26.</note> 
               <hi>an Escaping, such as are Left,</hi> and <hi>Remaine in Jerusalem:</hi> From the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Lump of Man-kind,<note place="margin">Zech. 3. 2.</note> God doth by Christ, snatch a <hi>Remnant</hi> (whom he
will preserve) <hi>like a Brand out of the fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 17. 9.</note> Thirdly, in respect of their injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods Ordinances and Word,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note> and his Presence with them, therein,
they are called,<note place="margin">Psal. 48. 11, 12, 13, 14. 16. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>the Daughter of Sion, and the Dwelling places thereof.</hi> There
did God make known his Mind and Will,<note place="margin">Jerem. 50. 5.</note> and Walked with his People in
those <hi>Beauties of Holinesse;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zecl. 8. 2.</note> These are they to whom these promises are made:
the <hi>Elect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John. 12. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Redeemed</hi> and <hi>Called</hi> of God: or those who being <hi>Elected,</hi> and <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110. 3.</note> shall in their severall Generations be <hi>Called, according to his Purpose, who
worketh all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa 49. 14.</note> 
               <hi>according to the Councell of his own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Matter</hi> of these promises,<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> they may be reduced to these three
Heads. First of <hi>Justification.</hi> vers. 2. Secondly, of <hi>Sanctification</hi> v. 3, &amp; 4.
Thirdly, of <hi>Perseverance</hi> vers. 5, &amp; 6. First, of <hi>Justification,</hi> Christ is <hi>Made</hi>
to them, or Given unto them, for <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi> which how it's done, the
Holy Ghost tells us <hi>Isaiah 61 10. I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my soule
shall be joyfull in my God, for he hath cloathed me with the Garment of salvation,
he hath covered me with the Robes of Righteousnesse,</hi> saith the Church: he puts
upon poore deformed Creatures, the Glorious Robe of his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to make us Comely in his Presence, and the Presence of his Father. <hi>Zac.</hi>
13. 3, 4. Through <hi>Him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 1 20. 54. 17.</note> his being <hi>given</hi> unto us, <hi>made unto us of God Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 45. 24, 25.</note> becoming, <hi>the Lord our Righteousnesse,</hi> doe we find free acceptation, as
Beautifull and Glorious in the eyes of God.<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note> But this is not all: He doth not
only <hi>Adorne</hi> us without,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 8. 1.</note> but also <hi>Wash</hi> us within: the Apostle acquaints us,
that,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 10.</note> that was his designe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26. and therefore you have (Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
the promise of <hi>Sanctification</hi> added, verses 3, 4. v. 3. you have the thing
it selfe, they <hi>shall be called holy, Made</hi> so, called so by him, <hi>who calleth things
that are not as though they were,</hi> and by that Call, gives them to be that which
he calls them;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> he said, <hi>let there be light, and there was light.</hi> And then the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how it becomes to be so. v. 4. first setting out the <hi>Efficient</hi> cause:<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>the spirit
of Judgment and Burning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 5.</note> that is of <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and <hi>Light:</hi> &amp; (Secondly) the way
of his producing this great effect,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> 
               <hi>washing away filth,</hi> and <hi>purging away blood:</hi>
Spirituall filth and blood,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 9, 10, 11.</note> is the defilement of sinne; the Scripture to set out
it's abhomination,<note place="margin">Psal. 38. 5. 7.</note> comparing it to the things of the greatest Abhorrency to
our nature,<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 5, 6.</note> even as that is to the nature of God. And this is the second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 5, 6.</note> that in, and by,<note place="margin">Isa. 64. 6.</note> the Branch of the Lord, is here made to them, <hi>who are
written unto life in Jerusalem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 4. 5. &amp; 24. 6.</note> But now, least any should suppose that both
these are for a season only,<note place="margin">Hos: 8. 8.</note> that they are <hi>Dying</hi> priviledges, <hi>Perishing</hi> mercies,
Jewells that may be lost,<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 1.</note> so that, though the persons to whom those promises
are made,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 13. 2 Pet. 2. 22.</note> are once made <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>Comely,</hi> being in Christ freely accepted,
yet they may againe become odious in the sight of God, and be utterly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that being once <hi>Washed, Purged, Cleansed,</hi> they should yet returne to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in their mire, and so become wholly defiled and abhominable: In the
Third place, He gives a promise of <hi>Perseverance,</hi> in the two last verses, and
that expressed with <hi>Allusion</hi> to the Protection afforded unto the people of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59070:41"/>
               <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Wildernesse, <hi>by a Cloude and Pillar of fier:</hi> which as they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and Instituted signes of the presence of God, so they gave assured <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
preservation,</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> to the People in all their waies. The summe
of the whole intendment of the Holy Ghost in these two verses, seeming to
be comprized in the last words of the <hi>Fift,</hi> and they being a suitable bottome
unto the ensuing discourse, comprising as they stand in Relation to the verses
foregoing, the whole of my ayme, with the way, or method wherein it may
conveniently be delivered I shall a little insist upon them: <hi>Vpon all the glory
shall be a defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are a <hi>Gospell Promise,</hi> Expressed in <hi>Law</hi> termes, or a <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 47.</note> in Old <hi>Testament Clothes:</hi> the subject of it is, <hi>all the Glory,</hi> and the
thing Promised, is <hi>a defence over it, or uppon it.</hi> By the <hi>Glory</hi> some take the
<hi>People</hi> themselves to be intended, who are the <hi>Glory of God, Isa.</hi> 46. 13. In
whom he will be <hi>Glorifyed,</hi> and who are said to be made <hi>Glorious, v.</hi> 2. But
the <hi>Pillar of fier,</hi> and the <hi>Cloud</hi> lead us an other way. As the <hi>Protection</hi> here
Promised, must Answer the <hi>Protection</hi> given by <hi>them</hi> of olde; so the <hi>Glory</hi> here
mentioned, must answer that which was the <hi>Glory</hi> of that People, when
they had their Preservation and Direction from those <hi>Signes</hi> of the presence
of God, in the midst of them. It is very true the signe of Gods Presnce among
them it selfe, and the Protection received thereby, is sometimes called his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Ezek,</hi> 10. 10. But here it is plainely differenced from it, that being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
called a <hi>defence.</hi> That which most frequently was called <hi>the Glory</hi>
in the Ancient dispensation of God to his People, was the <hi>Arke:</hi> when this
was taken by the <hi>Philistims,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Phineas</hi> calls her sonne <hi>Johabod,</hi> and
sayes the <hi>Glory is departed from Israell 1 Sam.</hi> 4. 2. &amp; 22. Which the holy
Ghost mentions againe <hi>Psal. 78. 61. And delivered his Strength into Captivity
and his Glory into his Enemies hand.</hi> The Tabernacle, or the Tent wherein it
was placed is mentioned, <hi>v. 60. He forsooke the Tabernacle of Shiloh the Tent
which he had placed among them.</hi> And the <hi>People</hi> to whom it was given, <hi>v.</hi> 62.
<hi>He gave the People over also to the Sword.</hi> That <hi>Arke</hi> being the <hi>Glory</hi> and
<hi>Strength</hi> which went into Captivity, <hi>when he forsooke the Tabernacle, and gave
his People to the Sword.</hi> That this <hi>Arke,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Old</hi> was a Tipe of Jesus
Christ (besides the end and ayme of its Institution, with its use and place of
its abode) appears from the <hi>Mercy seat</hi> or Plate of Gold that was layd upon
it, which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is expresly said to be <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. compared with
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. It is he who is the <hi>Glory</hi> here mentioned, not considered <hi>absolutely</hi>
and in his owne <hi>Person,</hi> but as he is made <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> unto his People: as
he is made unto them <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Holynesse</hi> according to the tenor of
the Promises insisted on before;<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 25.</note> and this is indeed, <hi>all the Glory</hi> of the Elect
of God, even the presence of Christ with them, as their <hi>Justification,</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi>
their <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Holynesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matter of the Promise made in reference to his <hi>Glory</hi> and them upon
whom it doth abide,<note place="margin">§. 48.</note> Is, that they shall be a <hi>defence upon it:</hi> the word
Translated here a <hi>defence</hi> comes from a root, that is but once read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 12. Where it is rendred to <hi>cover: The Lord shall cover him all the
day long.</hi> So it properly signifyes. From a <hi>Covering,</hi> to a <hi>Protection,</hi> or a defence,
is an easy <hi>Metaphor,</hi> a covering being given for that end and purpose. And
this is the native signification of the word <hi>Protego,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 17. 8. 36. 7. 57. 1. 63. 7. 121. 5.</note> to <hi>defend by covering,</hi> as
<hi>Abimelek</hi> called <hi>Abraham the covering of Sarahs eyes,</hi> or a protection to her
<hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 16. The Allusion also of a <hi>Shade,</hi> which in Scripture is so often taken
for a <hi>defence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 30. 2. 49. 2.</note> ariseth from hence. This word it selfe is used twice more, and
in both places signifye a <hi>Bridechamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 31. 6. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Psal. 19. 6. Joell</hi> 2. 16. From the <hi>peace,
covert,</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> of such a place. The name of the <hi>Mercy seate</hi> is also of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59070:42"/>
the same root with <hi>this.</hi> In this place it is by common consent rendered, a
<hi>defence</hi> or <hi>protection,</hi> being so used, either by Allusion to that refreshment,
that the Lord Christ the great <hi>Bridegroome</hi> gives to his Bride in his <hi>Banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
House,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 4.</note> or rather in pursuit of the former similitude of the <hi>Cloude,</hi> that was
over the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the <hi>Arke,</hi> which represented the Glory of that People.
Thus this <hi>defence</hi> or <hi>covering</hi> is said to be <hi>upon,</hi> or <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Glory,</hi> as the <hi>Cloude</hi>
was <hi>over</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and as the <hi>Mercy seate</hi> lay upon the <hi>Arke.</hi> Adde only
thus much to what hath been spoken (which is also affirmed in the beginning
of the verse) <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>defence</hi> is <hi>created,</hi> or is an immediate product
of the mighty Power of God, not requiring unto it the least concurrence of
Creature Power, and the whole will manifest the intendment of the Lord
<hi>everlastingly to safegarde the Spirituall Gloryes of his Saints in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As there was before shewn,<note place="margin">§. 49.</note> there are two parts of our <hi>Spirituall Glory:</hi> the
one purely <hi>Extrinsecall,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Love</hi> and Favour of God unto us, his free
and Gracious Acceptation of us in Christ; on this part of our <hi>Glory,</hi> there is
this defence Created, it shall <hi>abide for ever it shall never be removed.</hi> His owne
Glory and Excellencies are ingaged for the preservation of this excellency
and glory of his People. This Sunne, though it may be for a while eclipsed,
yet shall never set, nor give place to an evening, that shall make long the shade
thereof: whom God once freely accepts in Christ, he will never turne away
his Love from them, nor cast them <hi>Vtterly</hi> out of his Favour. The other is
<hi>within us,</hi> and that is our <hi>Sanctification:</hi> our Portion from God by the Spirit
of Holinesse, and the fruits thereof, in our Faith, Love, and Obedience unto
him; And on this part of our <hi>Glory,</hi> there is this <hi>Defence,</hi> that this Spirit shall
never <hi>Vtterly</hi> be dislodged from that Soule, wherein he makes his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
nor resigne his habitation to the Spirit of the World, that his fruit
shall never so decay, as that the Fruits of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and the Grapes of <hi>Gomorra</hi>
should grow in their roome, nor they, wherein they are Everlastingly, Utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and wickedly grow barren, in departing from the Living God; these two
make up that <hi>Perseverance,</hi> whereof we speake: Whom God accepts in Christ,
he will continue to doe so for ever: whom he quickens to walke with him,
they shall doe it to the end. And these three things, <hi>Acceptance with God, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
from God, and a Defence upon them both,</hi> unto the end; all Free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in
Christ, are that threefold cord <hi>of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> which cannot be
broken.</p>
            <p>In the handling then of the Doctrine proposed unto consideration,<note place="margin">§ 50.</note> I shall
(the Lord assisting) shew, First, that the Love and Favour of God, as to the
free Acceptation of Believers with him in Christ, is constant, abiding, and shall
never be turned away; handling at largethe Principles, both of its being and
manifestation. Secondly, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> and grace of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which
they freely receive from him, shall never utterly be extinguished in them, but
so remaine, as that they shall abide with him for ever: the Sophisticall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of which two parts of our Doctrine, is the greatest advantage our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
have against the whole. And demonstrate Thirdly, the <hi>Reall,</hi> and
<hi>Causall</hi> influences, which this Truth hath, into the <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> of
the Saints, considered both <hi>absolutely,</hi> and <hi>compared</hi> with the Doctrine, which
is set up in competition with it: In the pursuit of which particulars, I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to Inforce and presse those places of Scripture, wherein they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
delivered, and vindicate them from all the Exceptions put in to
our inferences from them by M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Redemption Redeemed;</hi> as also
Answer all the Arguments, which he hath with much labour and industry,
collected and improved, in opposition to the Truth in hand: Take then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these few <hi>Previous</hi> observations, and I shall insist fully upon the proofe and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59070:42"/>
Demonstration of the first <hi>Position,</hi> concerning the <hi>Vnchangeablenesse of the
Love of God towards his, to whom he gives Iesus Christ, for Beauty and Glory, and
freely accepts them in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 51.</note> as to their <hi>Inherent Holinesse,</hi> the Question is not concerning <hi>Acts,</hi>
either as to their vigour,<note place="margin">Revel. 2. 5. 3. 2.</note> which may be abated, or as to their frequency, which
may be interrupted,<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 17.</note> but only as to the <hi>Spirit</hi> &amp; <hi>Habit</hi> of it which shall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:
<note place="margin">Hos. 14. 4.</note> We doe not say they cannot <hi>sinne,</hi> fall into <hi>many</hi> sinnes, <hi>great</hi> sinnes, which
the Scripture plainely affirmes of all the Saints,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 21.</note> that went before: and who
of them living doth not this day labour under the Truth of it?<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16.</note> But through
the Presence of God with them,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 9.</note> upon such Grounds and Principles, as shall
afterwards be insisted on,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 8.</note> they <hi>cannot, shall not,</hi> sinne away the Spirit and
Habit of Grace,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 2.</note> (which without a <hi>miracle</hi> cannot be done away by any <hi>one</hi>
Act,<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 38.</note> and God will not worke Miracles for the destruction of his Children,)
so as to fall into that state,<note place="margin">Isa. 64. 5, 6.</note> wherein they were, before they were Regenerate,
and of the Children of God, become Children of the Devill, tasting of the
<hi>second Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 6.</note> after they have been made Partakers of the first Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Question is not about the <hi>decay</hi> of <hi>any</hi> Grace, but the <hi>losse</hi> of
<hi>all;</hi> not about <hi>sicknesse</hi> and <hi>weakenesses,</hi> but about <hi>death</hi> it selfe; which alone
we say, they shall be preserved from. Neither doe we say, that Believers are
endowed with any such rich and plentifull Stock of Grace,<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 6.</note> as that they may
spend upon it without new supplyes all their dayes,<note place="margin">Isa. 35. 1, 2. &amp;c.</note> but grant that they stand
in continuall need of the renued communication of that Grace,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 3, 4, 5, 6. 7.</note> which hath
its abode and residence in their Soules,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 18.</note> and of that actuall Assistance, whereby
any thing that is truly and Spiritually good,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> is wrought in them. Thirdly,
whereas there is a twofold Impossibility.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> (First) that which is absolutely
and simply so in its own nature:<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 5.</note> And (Secondly) that which is so only upon
some suposition,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> we say the totall falling away of the Saints is imppossible only
in this latter sence. The unchangeable Decree and Purpose of God, his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Promises, and Oathes, the Mediation of the Lord Jesus being in the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
supposed: And Fourthly, whereas we affirme, they shall assuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
unto the end, the Certainty and Assurance intimated, is not <hi>mentis</hi> but
<hi>entis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 14, 15, 16.</note> not <hi>subjective,</hi> but <hi>objective,</hi> not alwayes in the <hi>person</hi> persevering, but
alwayes relating to the <hi>thing</hi> it selfe.<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 17.</note> Fiftly, that the three things, formerly
mentioned,<note place="margin">Cantt 5. 2, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Acceptance</hi> with God,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Holinesse</hi> from God, and the <hi>Defence</hi>
upon them both unto the end, are that threefold corde of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
which cannot be broken. This will appeare, by compare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those two eminent places together, which afterwards must more
fully be insisted on; <hi>Jerem. 31. 34, 35. Cap.</hi> 32. 38, 39, 40. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
God undertakes to be <hi>their God and that they shall be his People, Cap.</hi> 31. 31.
<hi>Cap.</hi> 32. 38. And this he manifests in three things. First, that he will <hi>Accept</hi>
them freely, give them to finde great Favour before him, in the <hi>forgivenesse
of their sinnes,</hi> for which alone he hath any quarrell with them. <hi>I will</hi> (saith
he) <hi>forgive their iniquities and remember their sinnes no more, cap:</hi> 31. 34. As 'tis
againe repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. Secondly, that they shall have <hi>sanctification</hi> and
<hi>Holinesse</hi> from him, <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts and write it in their
Hearts, cap. 31. 33. I will put my feare in their Hearts, v:</hi> 40. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 66. 67.
calls <hi>the putting his Spirit in them,</hi> who is the Author of that Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
which he doth bestow: Thirdly that in both these, there shall
be a <hi>continuance for ever, cap: 32. 40. I will not turne away from them to
doe them good, and I will put my feare in their Hearts and they shall not
depart from me;</hi> Or as <hi>v:</hi> 39: <hi>They shall feare me for ever;</hi> which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
this Covenant from the former, made with their <hi>Fathers,</hi> in
that that was <hi>broken,</hi> which this shall never be. <hi>Cap:</hi> 21: 32: This
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59070:43"/>
is the Crowning Mercy, that renders both the other glorious: As to
<hi>Acceptation</hi> he will not depart from us: as to <hi>Sanctification</hi> we shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from him.</p>

               <hi>are not consumed.</hi> These <hi>Sonnes of Jacob</hi> are <hi>the Sonnes</hi> of
the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the <hi>Israel of God,</hi> not all the seed of <hi>Jacob according to the

not be, that they should be cast of forever, and consumed. These are the

with whom is no variablenesse, nor shadow of turning: Of his owne will begat he us

For whatsoever men doe pretend, <hi>we are borne againe, not of blood nor of

distinguished from the common endowments of others: Yea but they are fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones perhaps? Such as may slourish for a season, and be but Children of
a night, like <hi>Jonas Gourde.</hi> Though God hath <hi>begotten us of his owne will,</hi> and
bestowed <hi>good &amp; perfect Guifts upon us,</hi> yet he may cast us off for ever. <hi>Doe not
erre my beloved Brethren,</hi> saith the Apostle, these things come <hi>from the Father
of Lights:</hi> God himselfe is the Fountaine of all <hi>Lights</hi> of Grace, which we have
received; and with him, <hi>there is no Variablenesse nor shadow of Turning,</hi> not
the least appearance of any change or Alteration. And if the <hi>Apostle</hi> did not

of his <hi>Love,</hi> towards those, whom he hath begotten, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
such Light and Grace upon, there were no just Reason of mentioning
that Attribute and Property there.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. The guifts and <hi>calling of God</hi> are said to be <hi>without
Repentance:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 5.</note> the guifts of his effectuall calling (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) shall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of: They are from him, with whom there is no change.</p>
            <p>The words are added by the Apostle, to give Assurance of the certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of the Purpose of God towards the <hi>Remnant</hi> of the Jewes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Election of Grace.</hi> What the principle mercies were, that were in
Gods intendment to them, and whereof by their effectuall calling they shall
be made partakers, he tells us <hi>v. 26, 27. The Deliverer or Redeemer, which comes
out of Sion,</hi> shall, according to the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> turne them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse,
the Lord taking away their sinne. Sanctification and Justification
by Christ, the two maine Branches of the New Covenant: (<hi>Ierem. 31. 42. Ierem.
32. Ezek: 36. Heb: 8. 13, 14. chap:</hi> 10. 17, 18.) doe make up the Mercy purposed
for them. The certainty of the Collation of this Mercy upon them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the interposition of any present obstruction (amongst which their
Enmity to the Gospell was most eminent, and lay ready to be objected) the
Apostle argueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Unchangeablenesse of the <hi>Love of Election,</hi> wherewith
the Lord embraced them from Eternity; <hi>as touching the Election they are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi>
and farther to manifest on that account, the fulfilling, of what he is in
the proofe and Demonstration of, <hi>viz.</hi> that though the major part of <hi>Israel
according to the flesh,</hi> were rejected, yet the <hi>Election should obtaine,</hi> and <hi>all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59070:44"/>
Israell be saved,</hi> he tells them, that that calling of God, whereby he will make
out to them those <hi>Eternally designed</hi> mercies, shall not be repented of eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that Assertion, distinguishing the grace whereof he speakes, from all
such common gifts, and such outward dispensations as might be subject
to a removall from them on whom they are bestowed: and if upon any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
or consideration imaginable, the Mercies mentioned may be taken
away, the Assertion comes very short of the proofe of that, for which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>Against this plaine expression of the Apostle,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that the gifts and calling of God,
are without repentance:</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> puts in sundry Exceptions to weaken the
Testimony it bears in this case, Cap: 8. Sect: 86. which because they have been
already sufficiently evinced of Weakenesse, Falshood, and Impertinency, by
his Learned <hi>Antagonist,</hi> I shall only take up that which he mainly insists up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and farther manifest its utter uselessenesse for the end for which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Thus then he pleads: <hi>The Gifts and Calling of God, may be said to be
without repentance, because let men continue the same persons which they were,
when the Donation or Collation of any gift was first made by God unto them, he
never changes or altereth his Dispensations towards them, unlesse it be for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or in order to their farther good, in which case he cannot be said to repent of
what he had given: but in case men shall change, and alter from what they were
when God first dealt gratiously with them, especially if they shall notoriously dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
or cast away the Principles, or divest themselves of that very qualification
on which as it were God grafted his benefit or gift; in this case though he recall his
gift, he cannot be said to repent of his giving it, because the termes on which he
gave it please him still, only the Persons to whom he gave it, and who pleased him
when he gave it them, have now rendred themselves unpleasing to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things are here Asserted: 1.<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> That if men continue the <hi>same,</hi> or in the
<hi>same state and condition</hi> wherein they were, when God bestowed his gifts and
graces upon them, then God never changeth nor altereth; his dispensations
towards them abide the same. 2. That there are certain <hi>Qualifications</hi> in
men, upon which God <hi>grafts</hi> his <hi>grace,</hi> which whilest they abide, his gifts
and graces abide upon them also, and therefore are said to be without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;

Let us a little consider both these Assertions: and First, it being evident, that it
is <hi>Spirituall grace,</hi> and Mercy, of which the Apostle speakes, as was manifested,
(for they are such as flow from the Covenant of the Redeemer <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27.) San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
&amp; Justification being particularly mentioned, let us consider what
is the condition of men when God Invests them with these Mercies, that we
may be able to instruct them how to abide in that condition, and so make
good the possession of the Grace and Mercy bestowed on them: and to keep
close to the Text, let our <hi>Instance</hi> be in the three eminent mercies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
intimated in that place: 1. <hi>Vocation, 2. Sanctification, 3. Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The
<hi>Gift and Grace of Vocation,</hi> is confessedly here intended, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
mentioned in the words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that <hi>Calling</hi> which is an effect of
the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> v. 28. consider wee then what is the <hi>state</hi> of Men, when
God first <hi>calls them,</hi> and gives them this gift and Favour, that if it seeme so
good, we may exhort them to a <hi>continuance</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>Now this Sate with the Qualifications of it,<note place="margin">Isa. 65. 1.</note> is a State, 1. of <hi>Death, Ioh.</hi> 5.
25. <hi>The Dead heare the voyce of the Sonne of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 25.</note> Christ speakes to them who
are dead,<note place="margin">Hos. 2. 23. 1 Pet. 2. 10.</note> and so <hi>they Live.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Darknesse, Acts 25. 26. God calls them out of
Darknesse into his marvelous light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 12.</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 29. a State of <hi>Ignorance and Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God, Ephes:</hi> 4. 18. The grace of <hi>Vocation or effectuall</hi> calling, finding

men in a state of <hi>Enmity to God, and Alienation from him,</hi> if they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
withall, to <hi>continue such still,</hi> this gift shall never be recalled, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the <hi>Gift and Grace of Sanctification</hi> finds men in a <hi>better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in a state,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> wherein if they abide, them that also shall abide with them for
ever. The Scripture abounds in the description of <hi>this state,</hi> that we shall not
need to haesitate about it: <hi>Ephes: 2. 1, 2. you hath he quickned, who were dead in
trespasses and sins: Quickning &amp; renewing Grace</hi> is given to persons dead in sins:
&amp; is so farre from depending, as to its Unchangeablenesse, upon their <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
in the State, wherein it finds them, that it consists in a reall change, and
translation of them from that State or Condition. The Apostle sets out this at
large, <hi>Titus 3. 3, 4, 5. wee our selves were sometimes foolish &amp;c.</hi> the State of men,
when God bestowes their <hi>Gifts</hi> upon them, is positively expressed in sundry
particulars, v: 3. the <hi>Qualifications</hi> on which this Gift or Grace is grafted (of
which M: <hi>Goodwin</hi> speaks afterwards) negatively v: 5. it is <hi>not of any work
that we have done,</hi> which is unquestionably exclusive of all those <hi>stocks</hi> of
Qualifications, which are intimated, whereon the Gifts and Graces of God
should be <hi>grafted.</hi> The gift it selfe here bestowed, <hi>is the washing of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost, saveing us through mercy from the state and
Condition before described.</hi> In briefe that the Condition wherein this Grace of
God finds the Sonnes of Men, is a state of<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 8. 27. Rom. 6. 13. Col. 2. 13.</note>

the account of these Qualifications, and continued without <hi>revocation</hi> on
condition that they abide in the same State, with the same <hi>Qualifications?</hi> Let
then men <hi>continue in sinne, that grace may abound.</hi>

Who would have thought, they had been of such reckoning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
with the Lord?</p>
            <p>And this, considering what is learnedly discoursed elsewhere may suffice, as
to the other Assertion;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note> that God gives his Gifts and Graces to <hi>Qualifications,</hi>
not to <hi>Persons.</hi> Those <hi>Qualifications</hi> are either Gifts of God, or not: if not, who
made those men, in whom they are, <hi>differ from others?</hi> if they are, on what
<hi>Qualifications,</hi> were those <hi>Qualifications</hi> bestowed? That God freely bestows
on <hi>Persons,</hi> of his own good pleasure, not Grafting on <hi>Qualifications,</hi> his Gifts
and Graces, we have Testimonies abundantly sufficient to out-ballance M.
<hi>Goodwins</hi> Assertions. <hi>Rom: 9. 18. He hath Mercy, on whom he will have Mercy:</hi>
he bestowes his Mercy and the fruits of it, not on this or that Qualification,
but on <hi>whom</hi> or <hi>what Person</hi> he will, and to <hi>them it is given, saith our Saviour,</hi>
to <hi>know the Mysteries of the Kingdome of God,</hi> but to others it is not given.
I see no <hi>stock</hi> that his gift is <hi>grafted</hi> on, but only the Persons of Gods good
will, whom he graciously designes to a Participation of it.</p>
            <p>Truth is,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> I know not any thing more directly contradictory to the whole
Discovery of the worke of Gods Grace in the Gospell, then that which is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in these Assertions of M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> neither is it any thing lesse, or more,
then that which of old was phrased, <hi>The Giving of Grace according to merit,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59070:45"/>
ascribing the primitive discriminating of persons as to Spirituall Grace, unto
selfe indeavours, casting to the ground the free distinguishing good pleasure
of God, and that Graciousnesse of every Gift of his, (I speake as to the first is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
of his love in quickning, renewing, pardoning Grace) which eminently
consists in this, that he is <hi>found of them that seeke him not,</hi> and <hi>hath Mercy
on whom he will,</hi> because <hi>so it seemed good to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to digresse farther (in the discovery of the unsatisfactorinesse of this
pretence) from the pursuit of the Argument in hand; Because Gods gifts
are not repented of, therefore doe men <hi>continue, not</hi> in the condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they find them, but wherein they place them: And all <hi>Qualifications</hi> in men
whatever, that are in the least acceptable to God, are so farre from being
<hi>stocks</hi> whereon God <hi>grafts</hi> his Gifts and Graces, that they are Plants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which he plants in whomsoever he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>Yea the <hi>Tree</hi> is made good before <hi>it beare any good fruit,</hi> and the <hi>Branch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into the True Olive, before it receive the sap, or juyce, of any one good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
The summe of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Answer amounts to <hi>this;</hi> let men be
stedfast in a good condition, and Gods Gifts shall stedfastly abide with them,
if they change, they also shal be revoked: which is <hi>directly</hi> opposite to the plain
intendment of the place, <hi>viz.</hi> That the stedfastnesse of men, depends upon the
irrevocablenesse of Gods Grace, and not <hi>è contra:</hi> there is not, in his sense, the
least intimation in these words, of the <hi>permanency</hi> of any Gift or Grace of God
with any one, on whom it is bestowed, for a <hi>Day,</hi> an <hi>Houre,</hi> or a <hi>Moment;</hi> but
notwithstanding this Testimony of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> they may be given one
houre, and taken away the next, they may flourish in a man in the <hi>morning,
and in the evening be cut downe, dried up, and withered:</hi> this is not to <hi>Answer</hi>
the Arguings of men, but positively to <hi>deny</hi> what God affirms. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
God gives not his gifts to men (I mean those mentioned) because
they <hi>please him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 31. 32.</note> but because it <hi>pleaseth him so to doe:</hi> he does not take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
because they <hi>displease</hi> him, but gives them so to abide with them, that
they shall never <hi>displease him,</hi> to the height of such a provocation. Neither
are the Gifts of God otherwise to be repented of, then by taking them from
the Persons, on whom they are bestowed: But this heape being removed, we
may proceede.</p>
            <p>Farthermore then,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> in sundry places doth the Lord propose this for the <hi>Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of his, and to assure them, that there shall never be an everlasting sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
between him and them; which shall be further cleared by particular
instances; Things or Truthes proposed for Consolation, are of all others most
clearely exalted above exception: without which, they were no way sutable
(considering the promptnesse of our unbelieving hearts to rise up against the
worke of Gods Grace and Mercy) to compasse the end for which they are
proposed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isaiah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> 40. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest O Israell,
my way is hid from the Lord and my Judgment is passed over from my God? hast
thou not knowen, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching
of his Vnderstanding. He giveth power to the faint, &amp; to them that have no might,
he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
shall utterly faile, but they that wait upon the Lord, shall renue their strength,
they shall mount up with wings as as Eagles, they shall runne and not be weary, they
shall walke and not faint. v. 27. Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> make a double complaint,
both parts of it manifesting some feare, or dread of Separation from God: for
though in <hi>Generall</hi> it could not be so, yet in <hi>particular,</hi> Believers under
<hi>Temptation,</hi> may question their owne condition, with their right unto, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59070:45"/>
interest in all the things, whereby their state and Glory is safegarded. <hi>My way</hi>
(say they) <hi>is hid from the Lord:</hi> The Lord takes no more notice, sets his
heart no more upon <hi>my way,</hi> my walking, but lets me goe and passe on as a
stranger to him: And farther, <hi>My judgement is passed over from my God:</hi> Mine
enemies prevaile, perhaps Lusts, and Corruptions are strong, and God doth
not appeare in my behalfe: <hi>Judgment</hi> is not executed on them, and what will
be the issue of this my sad estate? What the Lord proposeth and holdeth
out unto them for their Establishment in this condition, and to assure them
that what they feared should not come upon them, he ushers in by an
effectuall expostulation, <hi>v. 27. Hast thou not heard? Hast not thou been taught
it by the Saints that went before thee? Hast thou not knowne? Hast thou not
found it true by experience?</hi> What it is he would have them take notice of,
and which he so Pathetically insinuates into their understandings and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for their establishment, is an Exurgency of that Description of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which he gives <hi>v.</hi> 28. (1.) From his <hi>Eternity,</hi> he is the <hi>Everlasting God:</hi>
(2.) From his <hi>Power,</hi> he is the <hi>Creator of the ends of the Earth:</hi> (3.) From
<hi>Vnchangeablenesse,</hi> he <hi>fainteth not, he waxeth not weary,</hi> and therfore there is
no reason, he should relinquish or give over any designe that he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
especially considering that he layes all his purposes in that, whereby
he describes himselfe in the last place, even his <hi>Wisdome, there is no end of his
Vnderstanding.</hi> He establisheth (I say) their Faith upon this fourefold descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himselfe, or Revelation of these foure <hi>Attributes</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for the effecting of that, which he incourageth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to expect. Who is it ô
<hi>Jacob,</hi> with whom thou hast to doe, that thou shouldest feare or complain that
thou art rejected? He is <hi>Eternall, Almighty, Vnchangeable, Infinitely Wise,</hi> &amp; if he
be ingaged in any way of doing thee good, who can turne him aside, that he
should not accomplish all his pleasure towards thee? He will worke, who
shall let him? It must be either want of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and fore sight to lay a
designe, or want of <hi>Power</hi> to execute it, that exposeth any one to variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in any undertaking. Therefore that they may see how unlikely, how
impossible a thing it is, that their <hi>wayes should be hid from the Lord,</hi> and <hi>their
judgment passed over from their God,</hi> he accquaints them, who and what he
is, who hath undertaken to the contrary; but alasse! They are poore faint
Creatures, they have <hi>no might, no strength</hi> to walke with God; <hi>Vnstable
as water, they cannot excell:</hi> It is impossible they should hold out in the way
wherein they are ingaged, unto the end. To obviate or remove such fears,
and misgiving thoughts, he lets them know, <hi>v.</hi> 29. That though they have, or
may have many decayes (for they often <hi>faint</hi> they often <hi>faile,</hi> wherof we
have Examples and Complaints in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> made lively by our owne
<hi>experience</hi>) yet from him they shall have supplyes, to preserve them from that
which they feare: He is Eternall, Almighty, Unchangeable and infinitely
Wise, he will give out <hi>Power,</hi> &amp; increase <hi>Strength,</hi> when they <hi>Faint</hi> &amp; (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
have no might at all; The Lord doth not propose himselfe under all
these considerations, to let them know what he is in himselfe, only, but also
that he will expert and act sutably to these Properties, in dealing with them,
and making out supplyes unto them, notwithstanding all their misgiving
thoughts, which arise from the consideration of their owne <hi>faintings</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<hi>want of might;</hi> Though in themselves they are weake and faint, yet their
springs are in him, and their supplyes from him, who is such as he hath here
described himselfe to be. Hereupon also he anticipates an Objection, by
way of Concession, <hi>v. 30. Even the youth shall faint and be weary, and the young
men shall utterly faile.</hi> Men that seeme to have a great stock of strength and
Ability, may yet faile and perish utterly: An objection which, as I formerly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59070:46"/>
observed, these daies have given great force unto: We see many, who seem
to have the vigor of youth, and the strength of young men, in the wayes of
God, that have fainted in their course, and utterly failed; they began to
runne well, but lay downe almost at the entrance; and be it so, saith the Lord,
it shall so come to passe indeed: many that goe out in their own strength, shall
so fall and come to nothing: But what is that to thee, <hi>O Jacob, my chosen, thou
that waitest upon the Lord?</hi> v. 31. The unchangeable God will so make out
strength to thee, that thou shalt never utterly faint, nor give over, but abide
<hi>flying, running, walking,</hi> with <hi>speed, strength,</hi> and <hi>stedfastnesse,</hi> unto the end.
That expression, <hi>they that wayt upon the Lord,</hi> is a <hi>Description</hi> of the Persons,
to whom the Promise is made, and not a <hi>condition</hi> of the Promise it selfe. It
is not, <hi>if they waite upon the Lord,</hi> but, <hi>they that waite on the Lord:</hi> if it were a
Condition of this Promise, there were nothing promised; it is only said, <hi>if they
wait on the Lord, they shall waite on the Lord:</hi> But of the vanity of such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalls
I shall speak afterwards.</p>
            <p>A Scripture of the like importance you have <hi>Isaiah</hi> 44.<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
verses, <hi>Yet now heare O Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen: thus
saith the Lord, that made thee, and framed thee from the wombe, which will help
thee; feare not O Jacob my servant, Iessurun whom I have chosen, for I will pour
water upon him that is thirsty, and stoods upon the dry ground, and I will put my
Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon their off-spring, and they shall spring up
as among the grasse, as Willowes by the water courses: One shall say, I am the Lords,
and another shall call himselfe by the name of Iacob, and another shall subscribe
with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himselfe by the name of Israel, thus
saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, I am the
first, and I am the last, besides mee there is no God, &amp;c.</hi> I shall not need to insist
long on the opening of these words: the generall designe of them, is to give
<hi>Consolation</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> unto Israel, from the <hi>Eternity, Vnchangeablenesse,</hi>
and <hi>Absolutenesse</hi> of God: with some peculiar references, to the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who is described, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8.) with the titles, for the substance
of them, whereby the Lord here holds out his own Excellency. I shall only
observe some few things from the words, for the Illustration of the Truth,
we have in hand, contained in them. The State and Condition wherein <hi>Iacob,
Israell, Iessurun,</hi> (severall titles upon severall accounts given to Believers)
are described to be, is two fold; <hi>First,</hi> of <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Disconsolation,</hi> as 'tis inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in the redoubled Prohibition of that frame in them: v. 2. <hi>feare not,</hi> and
v. 8. <hi>feare ye not, neither be afraid:</hi> some temptation of farther distance or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from God, (the only thing to be feared) was fallen upon them.
This they are frequently exercised withall; 'tis the greatest, and most pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
temptation, whereunto they are lyable and exposed; To conclude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some Believers, in <hi>Hypothes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> may, under temptation, feare their own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from God, therefore Believers in <hi>Thesi,</hi> may be forsaken, yea that
unlesse <hi>this</hi> be true, the <hi>other</hi> could not befall them, may passe for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men, who are unacquainted with that variety of Temptations, spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
motions, and commotions, which Believers are exercised withall. This I
say is the <hi>First</hi> part of that State, wherein they are supposed to be: a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the greatest difficulty in the World, for the receiving of Satisfaction;
<hi>Secondly,</hi> of <hi>Barrennesse, Vnprofitablenesse,</hi> and withering, which seems and
that justly, to be the cause of their feare: v. 3. <hi>They are as the thirsty and dry
ground,</hi> parched in it selfe, fruitlesse to its owners, <hi>withering</hi> in their owne
Soules, and bringing forth no fruit to God. A sad condition on both hands;
<hi>within</hi> they find <hi>decayes,</hi> they find no active principles of bringing forth fruit
unto God: and <hi>without</hi> desertion, fears at least, that they are forsaken; upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59070:46"/>
this ye have the foundation that the Lord layes for the refreshment of their
spirits in this condition, and reducing of them into an established Assurance
of the continuance of his love; and that is his free gratious <hi>Election,</hi> and
choosing of them; <hi>thou art Jacob whom I have chosen.</hi> (vers: 1. <hi>Iesurun whom I
have chosen:</hi> even from Eternity, <hi>when he appointed the antient people, and the
things that are comming and shall come,</hi> v. 7. When he purposed mercy for
the Fathers of old, whom long since he had brought upon that account unto
himselfe: This is the foundation of doing them good, <hi>which standeth sure,</hi> as
the Apostle makes use of it to the same purpose: 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2. 19. This <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
being laid v. 3. he gives them a <hi>twofold promise,</hi> suited to the double
state wherein they were: (First) for the removall of their <hi>drought and barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi>
he will give them <hi>waters,</hi> and floods, for the taking of it away: which in
the following words, he interpreteth of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as likewise doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 39. He is the great Soule Refresher, in him are all our springs.
Saith the Lord then, feare not you Poore thirsty Soules, you shall have him
as a Flood, in great abundance untill all his Fruits be brought forth in you.
(<hi>Secondly</hi>) For the removall of the other evill, or Feares of desertion and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
off,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note> he minds them of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>blessing of their off-spring,</hi> of
them and their seed, according to his promise, when he undertook to be their
God; and then (<hi>Fourthly,</hi>) there is a <hi>two fold</hi> Issue of Gods thus dealing with
them. First, Of <hi>reall Fruitfulnesse,</hi> v. 4. <hi>They shall be as grasse</hi> under perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
showres, which cannot possibly wither and decay, or drie away, <hi>and as
trees planted by the rivers of water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 1. 3, 4.</note> that bring forth fruit in their season, whose
leafe does not wither. Secondly, Of <hi>Zealous Profession,</hi> and owning of God,
with the ingagement of their hearts and hands unto him, which you have in
v. 5. Every one for himselfe shall give up himselfe to the Lord, in the most
solemne ingagement, and professed subjection that is possible; They shall
<hi>say,</hi> and <hi>subscribe,</hi> and <hi>Surname</hi> themselves, by names and termes of Faith and
obedience, to follow the Lord in the Faith of <hi>Jacob</hi> or <hi>Israell</hi> in the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the promises which were made to him. But now what <hi>Assurance</hi> is
there, that this happy beginning shall be carried on to perfection, that this
kindnesse of God to them, shall abide to the <hi>End,</hi> and that there shall not be
a separation between him and his <hi>chosen</hi> Israel. In the Faith hereof the Lord
confirmes them, by that Revelation which he makes of himselfe and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
<hi>verses</hi> 6, 7, 8. First, In his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> he is the <hi>King.</hi> What shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him, hath not he power to dispose of all things? He is the Lord and
<hi>King,</hi> he will work, and who shall let him? But hath he kindnesse and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
to carry him out hereunto? therefore 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, He is their <hi>Redeemer:</hi> &amp; doe
but consider, what he doth for the glory of that Title, and what the Work
of Redemption stood him in, and yee will not feare, as to this, not be afraid;
And all this hee (Thirdly) Closeth with his <hi>Eternity,</hi> and <hi>Vnchangeablenesse,
he is the First and the Last, and besides him there is none other:</hi> the <hi>First</hi> that
chose them from <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the <hi>Last</hi> that will preserve them to the <hi>End;</hi>
and still the same, he altereth not. I shall not adde more instances in this
kind, that the Lord often establisheth, his Saints in the Assurance of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse
of his Love towards them, from the <hi>Immutability</hi> of his own
nature, is very evident; Thence comparing himselfe and his Love with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mother, and her love, he affirmes, that hers may be altered, but his shall
admit of no <hi>variablenesse nor shadow of turning, Isai:</hi> 49. v. 14. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>To wind up this Discourse,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> the sum of this first part, of our first Scripturall
demonstration of the Truth under Debate, amounts to this Argument; That
which God affirmes, shall be certainely and infallibly fulfilled upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Immutability</hi> of his own nature, and incourageth men to expect
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59070:47"/>
it, as <hi>certainely</hi> to be fulfilled, as he is <hi>Vnchangeable;</hi> that shall infallibly not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all oppositions and difficulties, be wrought &amp; perfected; now that
such, and so surely bottomed, is the Continuance of the Love of God unto
his Saints, and so would he have them to expect &amp;c. hath been proved by
an induction of many particular instances, wherein those ingagements from
the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, are fully expressed.</p>
            <p>One of these Testimonies,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> even that mentioned in the first place: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6.
from whence this Argument doth arise, is proposed to be considered, and
answered by Mr <hi>Goodwin, Cap. 10. Sect. 40, 41. Pag.</hi> 205, 206, 207. A briefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall
of his Exceptions to our inference fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, will leave the whole to its
native vigour, &amp; the truth therein contained to its own stedfastnes in the hand
and power of that Demonstration. Thus then he proposeth that place of the
Prophet, and our Argument from thence, whereunto he shapes his Answer:
<hi>For the words of Mal: I am the Lord, I change not; from which it is wont to be
argued, that when God once Loves a person, he never ceaseth to love him, because
this must needs argue a changeablenesse in him, in respect of his Affection: and
consequently the Saints cannot fall away sinally from his Grace,</hi> (so he.)—</p>
            <p>It is an easy thing so to frame the Argument of an Adversary,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
more to the weakening of it, in its proposeing then in the <hi>Answer</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
given there unto; and that it is no strange thing with Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
to make use of this Advantage in his Disputations in this Booke, is discerned,
and complayned of by all not ingaged in the same contest with himselfe;
that he hath dealt noe otherwise with us in the place under Consideration,
the insuing Observations will clearely manifest.</p>
            <p>(First) all the strength,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will allow to this <hi>Argument,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from a naked consideration of the Immutability of God, as 'tis an essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Property of his nature: when our Arguing is from his ingagement to us, by,
and on the account of that <hi>Property;</hi> that God will doe such and such a
thing, because he is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> though he shall not at all manifest any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his will to lay forth his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> for the accomplishment of it,
is an inference, all whose strength is vaine presumption But when God
hath ingaged himselfe for the <hi>Performance</hi> of any thing, thence to conclude
to the certaine accomplishment of it, from his power, whereby he is able to
doe it, is a deduction, that Faith will readily close withall. So the <hi>Apostle</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us of the reimplanting of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> upon this account; <hi>God</hi> (saith he)
<hi>is able to plant them in againe, having promised so to doe. Rom.</hi> 11. 23. There
are two considerations, upon which the <hi>Vnchangeablenesse</hi> of God, hath a
more effectuall influence into the continuance of his Love to his Saints, then
the meere objected thought of it, will lead us to an acquaintance withall.</p>
            <p>1. God <hi>Proposeth</hi> his <hi>Immutability</hi> to the Faith of the Saints,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> for their
establishment &amp; consolation, in this very case of the stability of his Love unto
them: we dare not draw conclusions in reference to our selves, from any
Property of God, but only upon the account of the Revelation, which he
hath made thereof unto us, for that end and purpose: But this being done,
we have a sure anchor firme and stedfast, to fix us against all blasts of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or opposition whatsoever; When God proposes his Immutability or
Unchangeablenesse, to assure us of the continuance of his Love unto us, if
we might truly aprehend, yea &amp; ought so to doe, that his Unchangeablenesse
may be preserved, and himselfe vindicated from the least shadow of Turning,
though he should change his Mind, Thoughts, Love, Purposes concerning
us every day, what conclusion for consolation could possibly arise from such
Proposalls of Gods Immutability unto us? Yea would it not rather appeare
to be a way suited to the delusion of poore Soules, that when they shall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59070:47"/>
think they have a solid Pillar, no lesse then an Essentiall Property of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God to rest upon, they shall finde themselves leaning on a Cloud, or
Shadow, or on a <hi>broken Reed,</hi> that will runne into their hands, insteed of yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them the least supportment. God deales not thus with his Saints: His
discoveries of himselfe in Christ, for the Establishment of the Hearts of his, are
not such <hi>Flints,</hi> as from whence the most skilfull, and exercised Faith cannot
expect one drop of <hi>Consolation.</hi> Whatsoever of his Name he holds out to the
Sonnes of men, it will be a <hi>strong Tower, and place of Refuge</hi> and safety to
them, that flye unto it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Consideration of that Love in its continuance, wherein the
Lord settles and puts out of doubt the Soules of his, by the ingagement of his
<hi>Vnchangeablenesse,</hi> or the calling of them to the Consideration of that Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in him, from whom that Love doth flow, adds strength also to the way
of arguing we insist upon. Were the Love of God to his nothing but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his Approbation of such and such things, annext to the Law and
Rule of Obedience, it might stand firme like a <hi>Pillar</hi> in a <hi>River,</hi> though the
water be not thereby caused to stand still one moment, but only touch it, and
so passe on; there were some colour of Exception to be layd against it: And
this is indeed the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in this whole <hi>Controversy,</hi> that
he acknowledgeth no other Love of God to Believers, but what lyes in the
outward Approbation of what is good, and mens doing it: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
there is no more Love in God to one, then another; to the choicest
Saint, then to the most profligate Villain in the world: nay it is not any <hi>Love</hi>
at all, properly so called, being no internall vitall Act of Gods will, the seat
of his Love; but an externall Declaration of the issue of our Obedience. The
declaration of Gods Will, that he approoves Faith and Obedience, is no more
Love to <hi>Peter,</hi> then it is to <hi>Judas.</hi> But let now the Love of God to Believers
be considered, as it is in it selfe, as a <hi>vitall Act</hi> of his will, willing if (I may
so speake) good things to them; as the Immanent purpose of his Will, &amp; also
joyned with an Acceptation of them in the Effects of his <hi>Grace, Favour,</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> in Jesus Christ, and it will be quickly evidenced, how an Alteration
therein will entrench upon the Immutability of God, both as to his Essence
and Attributes and Decrees.</p>
            <p>Having thus reinforced our Argument from this place of Scripture,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
unto it those considerations, which being its maine strength, it was
maymed, and deprived of by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his proposall thereof, I shall
briefly consider the Answers, that by him are suggested thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus then he proceedeth;</hi> By the Tenour of this Arguing it will as well follow
that in case God should at any time withdraw his Love, and his Favour from a
Nation, or body of a People, which he sometimes Favoured, or Loved, he should be
changed: But that no such change of dispensation as this towards one, or the
same People or Nation, argueth any change at all in God, at least any such change,
which he disclaimeth, as incompetent to him, is evident from those instances
without number recorded in Scripture, of such different dispensations of his, towards
sundry Nations, and more especially towards the Iewes, to whom somtimes he gives
Peace, somtimes consumes them with Warrs, sometimes he makes them the Head,
and sometimes again the Tayle of the Nations round about them.</p>
            <p>The Love and favour of God to a Nation or People,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> here brought into the
lists of Comparison with the peculiar Love of God to his Saints, which he
Secures them of, upon the account of his <hi>Immutability,</hi> is either the outward
Dispensation of Good things to them, called his <hi>Love,</hi> because it expresseth
and holds out a fountaine of Goodnesse, from whence it flowes, or it is an
Eternall act of Gods will towards them, of the same nature with the Love
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59070:48"/>
to his owne formerly described. If it be taken in the first sence, as apparantly
it is intended, and so made out from the instance of Gods dealing with the
<hi>Iewes</hi> in outward Blessings, and Punishments, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth playnely
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) fall into a thing quite of another nature, insteed of that,
which was first proposed. (<hi>Amphora cùm caepit Institui cur urceus exit?</hi>) There
is a wide difference betweene <hi>outward Providentiall Dispensations,</hi> and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Purposes and acts of Grace and Good will; To deale in the instance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on by Mr <hi>Goodwin:</hi> there being frequent mention in the Scripture (as
afterwards shall be fully declared) of a difference &amp; distinction in, and of that
People,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4, 5.</note> (<hi>for they are not all Israel, that are of Israel</hi>) the whole lump &amp; body of
them being the People of God, in respect of separation from the rest of the
world, &amp; dedication to his Worship &amp; externall profession yet a <hi>Remnant</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a <hi>hidden</hi> Remnant, being his People upon the account of <hi>Eternall designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and actuall Acceptation into Love and Favour in Jesus Christ: there
must needs be also a twofold Dispensation of God, and his will, in reference
to that People: The First <hi>Common &amp; Generall,</hi> towards the whole body of
them in outward Ordinances and Providentiall Exercises of Goodnesse or
Justice: In this there was Great variety, as to the Latter part, comprehending
only externall Effects, or products of the Power of God; in which regard he
can pull downe what he hath set up, and set up what he hath pulled downe,
without the least shadow of turning: These various Dispensations working
Uniformely towards the accomplishment of his Unchangeable Purpose;
And this is all that Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Exceptions reach too: Even a change in
the outward dispensation of Providence, which none ever denied, being that
which may, nay is done for the bringing about and accomplishment (in a
way sutable to the advancement of his Glory) of his unchangeable Purpose.
What proportion there is to be argued from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> betweene the generall effects of
various Dispensations, and that peculiar Love, and Grace of the Covenant
thereof, wherein God assures his Saints of their Stability upon the account
of his own Unchangeablenes I know not: Because he may remove his Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
from a fruitlesse, Faithlesse People, and give them up to desolation,
may he therfore take his holy Spirit from them that Believe? For whilst that
continues the root of the matter is in them. So that (Secondly) there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Dispensation of Grace, exerted towards those peculiar ones, whom he
owneth and receiveth as above mentioned; wherein there are such ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Purpose, Decrees</hi> and Will of God, as that the streame of them
cannot be forced back, without as Great an Alteration &amp; change in God, as the
thoughts of the heart of the meanest worme in the world, are lyable unto;
And on this the Lord asserts the stedfastnesse of his Love to them, in the
midst of the changes of outward Dispensations towards the body of that
People, wherein also their <hi>Externall</hi> concernments were wrapt up, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
22. But this will afterwards be more fully cleared. The Substance of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
amounts only to thus much; there are changes wrought in the workes
which outwardly are of God, as to generall and common administrations;
therefore also are his Eternall purposes of Spirituall Grace lyable to the like
Alterations. Whereas Mr <hi>Godwin</hi> sayes that this will not import any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in God, at least any such alteration as is incompetent to him; I know not
of any shadow of alteration, that may be ascribed to him, without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and most substantiall derogation from his Glory, that you can ingage
into.</p>
            <p>And this farther clears,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> what is farther excepted, to the end of the <hi>Sect.</hi> 40.
in these words; <hi>Therefore neither the Vnchangeablenesse, nor Changeablenesse of
God are to be estimated, or measured, either by any variety, or uniformity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59070:48"/>
towards one and the same Object; and consequently, for him to express
himselfe, as this day, towards a Person, Man or Woman, as if he intended to save
them, or that he really intended to save them, and should on the morrow, as the
alteration in the interim may be, or how ever may be supposed in these Persons,
expresse himselfe to the contrary, as that he verily intends to destroy them, would
not argue or imply the least Alteration in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> such Dispensations of God, as are morally declarative of what God
approves, of what he rejects, not ingagements of any particular inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
or purpose of his Will, or such as are meerely outward Acts of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
may in great variety be subservient to the accomplishment of his Purpose,
&amp; may undergoe (the first, in respect of the Object; the latter, of the Works
themselves) many alterations, without prejudice to the Immutability of God.
The first in themselves, are everlastingly unchangeable; God alwaies <hi>approves
the Obedience of his Creatures,</hi> according to that Light and knowledge, which
he is pleased to communicate unto them: and alway condemnes, disallowes
their Rebellions; yet the same Persons may doe sometimes what he approves,
and sometimes what he condemnes, without the least shadow of change in
God. Whilest they thus change, his Purposes concerning them, and what he
will doe to them, and for them, are unchangeable, as is his <hi>Law</hi> concerning
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill.</hi> For the latter, take an instance in the case of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> God
purposeth the destruction of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and suites his Dispensations in great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
and with many changes, for the bringing about, and accomplishing of
that his unchangeable Purpose; he <hi>Plagues</hi> him, and <hi>Frees</hi> him, he <hi>Frees</hi> him,
and <hi>Plagues</hi> him <hi>againe:</hi> all these things doe not in the least proove any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in God, being all various effects of his Power, suited to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of an unchangeable Purpose. So in respect of Persons, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to bring, (through Christ,) infallibly to himselfe, how various are his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations
both Temporall and Spirituall? He <hi>Afflicts</hi> them, and <hi>Relieves</hi>
them, sends them <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkenesse, Strength</hi> and <hi>Weakenesse, Forsakes</hi>
and <hi>Appears</hi> to them againe, without the least alteration in his thoughts, and
purposes towards them: all these things, by his infinite Wisdome, working
together for their good. But now, if by <hi>Dispensation,</hi> you understand and
comprehend also, the thoughts and Purposes of God towards any, for the
bringing of them to such and such an end, if these be altered, and the Lord
doth change them continually, I know no reason, why a poore Worme of the
Earth may not lay an equall claime (<hi>absit Blasphemia</hi>) to Immutability and
Unchangeablenesse, with him who Asserts it, as his Essentiall Property, and
Prerogative, whereby he distinguisheth himselfe from all Creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>There is also an Ambiguity in that expression,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> that <hi>God expresseth himselfe
this day towards a Man or Woman, that he really intends to save them, and on the
morrow expresseth himselfe to the contrary:</hi> If our Author intends only Gods
Morall approbation of Duties and Performances, as was said before, with the
Conditionall approbation of Persons, with respect to them, there being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
no Declaration of any Intention, or Purpose of God properly so called,
the instance is not in the least looking toward the businesse, we have in hand.
But if withall, he intend the Purposes and Intentions of the will of God, as
those termes <hi>really intend,</hi> and <hi>verily intend</hi> doe import; I know not what to
call or account <hi>Alteration</hi> and <hi>Change,</hi> if this be not; surely if a man, like our
selves, doe <hi>really</hi> intend one thing one day, and <hi>verily</hi> intend the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
the next day, we may make bold to think and say, he is Changeable; &amp;
what Apology will be found, on such a supposall, for the Immutability of
God, doth not fall within the compasse of my narrow apprehension; neither
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59070:49"/>
is that <hi>Parentheticall</hi> Expression of a change, imagined in the Persons, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom Gods intentions are, any Plea for his Changeablenesse upon this
supposall: For he either foresaw that change in them, or he did not; if he did
not, where is his Prescience? Yea where is his Deity? If he did; to what
end did he really and verily intend and purpose to doe so, and so, for a man,
when at the same instant, he knew the man would so behave himselfe, as he
should never accomplish any such intention towards him. We should be wary,
how we ascribe such Lubricous thoughts to Wormes of the Earth, like our
selves; <hi>But if a man sinne against the Lord, who shall plead for him?</hi> If one
should really and verily intend or purpose, to give a man bread to eat to
morrow, who he knows infallibly will be put to death to night, such a one
will not perhaps be counted Changeable, but he will sCarce scape being estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a Changeling. Yet it seems it must be granted, that God verily intends,
and really, to doe so, and so for men, if they be in such and such a condition,
which he verily and really knowes they will not be in: But suppose all this
might be granted, what is it at all to the Argument in hand, concerning the
Lords ingaging his Immutability to his Saints, to secure them from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the account thereof? Either prove that God doth change, which
he saith he doth not, or that the Saints may perish, though he change
not, which he affirmes they cannot; or you speake not to the businesse in
hand.</p>
            <p>The 41.<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Section</hi> containes a discourse, too long to be transcribed, unlesse
it were more to the <hi>purpose</hi> in hand, then it is. I shall therefore briefely give
the Reader a tast of some <hi>Paralogismes,</hi> that runne from one end of it, to the
other, and then in particular rowle away every stone, that seemes to be of any
weight, for the detaining <hi>captive</hi> the Truth, in whose vindication we are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
First, from the beginning to the ending of the whole Discourse, the thing
in question, is immodestly <hi>begged,</hi> and many inferences made upon a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
that <hi>Believers may become Impenitent Apostates,</hi> which being the sole thing
under debate, ought not it selfe to be taken as granted, and so made a proofe
of it selfe. It is by us Asserted, that those who are once freely <hi>accepted</hi> of God
in Christ, shall not be so forsaken, as to become impenitent <hi>Apostates:</hi> and
that upon the account of the <hi>Immutability of God,</hi> which he hath ingaged to
give Assurance thereof. To evince the falsity of this, it is much pressed, that if
they become <hi>impenitent Apostates,</hi> God, without the least shadow of muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
may cast them off, and condemne them; which is a kind of reasoning,
that will scarce conclude to the Understanding of an intelligent Reader: &amp; yet
this sandy Foundation is thought sufficient, to beare up many Rhetoricall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
concerning the Changeablenesse of God, in respect of sundry of
his Attributes, if he should not destroy such Impenitent Apostates, as 'tis
splendidly supposed, Believers may be; (<hi>ô Famâ ingens, ingentior armis Vir Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jane</hi>)
This way of Disputing will scarce succeed you, in this great underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Scene</hi> of this discourse,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> is a grosse confounding of Gods <hi>Legall</hi>
or <hi>Morall</hi> Approbation of duties, and Conditionall of Persons, in reference to
them, (which is not <hi>Love</hi> properly so called, but a meere Declaration of Gods
approving the thing, which he Commands and Requires) with the will of
Gods Purpose and Intention, and actuall Acceptation of the Persons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in Jesus Christ, suited thereunto; Hence are all the comparisons used
between <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>Judge,</hi> in his <hi>Love,</hi> and the expresse deniall, that Gods
Love is fixt on any <hi>Materially,</hi> that is on the Persons of any (for that is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendment
of it) but only <hi>Formally,</hi> in reference to their <hi>Qualifications.</hi> Hence
also is that Instance, againe and insisted on in this and the former <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59070:49"/>
of the Love of God to the <hi>fallen Angells,</hi> whilest they stood in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
Their Obedience no doubt (if any they actually yeilded) fell under
the <hi>Approbation</hi> of God; but that it was the purpose and intention of God, to
continue and preserve them in that Obedience, cannot be asserted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ascribing to him more palpable mutability, then can fall upon a wise
and knowing man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the Discourse of this <hi>Section</hi> hath a contribution of strength, such
as it is, from a squaring of the Love of God, unto the <hi>sweet nature and Loving
disposition of men,</hi> which is perhaps no lesse grosse <hi>Anthropomorphisme,</hi> then
they were guilty of, who assigned him a <hi>Body and Countenance</hi> like to ours;
And upon these three stilts, whereof the first is called <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> and the third <hi>Fallacia non causae pro caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> is this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
advanced.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to transcribe,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> and follow the Progresse of this Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
the Observation of the <hi>Fallacies</hi> before mentioned, will helpe the
meanest capacity to unravell the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of the whole; The close only of it
may seeme to deserve more particular consideration: so then it prooceedeth.
<hi>The Vnchangeablenesse assumed by God himselfe, unto himselfe, in the worke in
hand, I am the Lord I change not, is, I conceive, that which is found in him
in respect of his Decrees; the reason is, because it is assigned by him as the reason
why they were not utterly destroyed: I am the Lord, I change not; therefore yee
Sonnes of Jacob are not consumed; In the beginning of the Chapter, he did declare
unto them his purpose and Decree of sending his only begotten Sonne, whom he
there calls the Messenger of the Covenant unto them. He predicteth, v. 3, 4. The
happy fruit or consequence of that his sending, in reference to their Nation and
Posterity. To the Vnchangeablenesse of this his Decree he assignes the Patience, which
he had for a long time exercised towards them under their great and continued
provocations; whereby he implyes, that if he could have been turned out of the way
of his Decree concerning the sending of his Sonne unto them in their Posterity, they
would have done it by the greatnesse of their sinnes; but in so much as this his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
or himselfe in this his Decree, was Vnchangeable, and it must have been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
in case they had been all destroyed (For the Decree was for the sending to their
Nation, and Posterity) hence, saith he, it comes to passe, that though your sins other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
abundantly have deserved it, yet I have spared you from a totall ruine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in these two last Scripture Arguments, there is every whit as much, or rather
more against, then for the common Doctrine of Perseverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Vnchangeablenesse</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> which is mentioned in this <hi>Text,</hi> hath
Relation to the Decrees of God, is granted; whatever then God Purposeth
or Decreeth, is put upon a certainty of <hi>Accomplishment,</hi> upon the account
of his Unchangeablenesse: There may be some use hereafter made of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
where (I suppose) the Evasions that will be used about the <hi>Objects</hi>
of those Decrees, &amp; their <hi>Conditionality,</hi> will scarce wave the force of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
from it. For the present, though I willingly imbrace the Assertion, yet I
cannot assent to the Analysis of that place of Scripture, which is introduced as
the Reason of it. The designe of the Lord in that place, hath beene before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered:
That the <hi>Consolation</hi> here intended, is only this, that whereas God
purposed to send the Lord Christ to the Nation of the Jewes, which he would
certainly fulfill and accomplish, and therefore did not, nor could not utterly
destroy them, will scarcely be evinced to the Judgement of any one, who
shall consider the businesse in hand with so much liberty of Spirit, as to cast
an eye upon the Scripture it selfe: That after the rehearsall of the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of sending his Sonne into the flesh to that People, he distinguisheth them
into his Chosen ones, and those rejected; his Remnant, and the refuse of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59070:50"/>
               <hi>Nation,</hi> being the maine Body thereof; threatning destruction to the <hi>latter,</hi> but
ingaging himselfe into a way of Mercy and Love towards the <hi>former,</hi> hath
been declared. To assure the last of his Continuance in these thoughts, &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of his Good will towards them, he minds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Unchangeablenes in
all such Purposes, &amp; particularly, incourages them to rest upon it, in respect of
his Love towards themselves. That God intended to administer Consolation
to his Saints in the Expression insisted on, is not, cannot be denyed; now what
Consolation could redound to them in particular from hence, that the whole
<hi>Nation</hi> should not utterly be rooted out, because God purposed to send his
Sonne to their Posterity; notwithstanding this, any individuall Person that
shall fly to the <hi>Horns</hi> of this Altar for refuge, that shall lay hold on this Promise
for succour, may perish everlastingly. There is scarce any place of Scripture
where there is a more evident Distinction asserted between the <hi>Jewes</hi> who
were so <hi>outwardly</hi> only, and in the flesh, and those who were <hi>inwardly</hi> also
and in the Circumcision of the heart, then in this and the following Chapter:
Their severall Portions are also clearely proportioned out to them in sundry
particulars. Even this Promise of sending the <hi>Messiah</hi> respected not the
whole Nation, and doubtlesse was only subservient to the Consolation of
them, whose Blessednesse consisted in being distinguished from others; but
let the <hi>Context</hi> be viewed, and the determination left to the Spirit of Truth in
in the heart of him that reads.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it appeare to me,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> how the Decree of God concerning
the sending of his Sonne into the world, can be asserted as absolutely Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
upon that Principle formerly layd downe, and insisted on by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
He sends him into the World to <hi>Dye,</hi> neither is any concernement of
his Mediation so often affirmed to fall under the will and Purpose of God as
his Death,<note place="margin">Socin. Prael. Theol. cap. 10.</note> But concerning this Mr <hi>G.</hi> disputes out of <hi>Socinus</hi> for a possibility of
a contrary Event, and that the whole Councell of God might have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
by the Good will and intention of Christ,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> though actually he had not
Dyed. If then the purpose of God concerning Christ, as to that great, and
and eminent part of his intendment therein, might have been frustrat, and
was lyable to alteration, what Reason can be rendred, wherefore that might
not upon some Considerations (which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is able, if need were, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent)
have been the Issue of the whole Decree? And what then becomes of
the <hi>Collaterall</hi> Consolation, which from the Immutability of that Decree is
here asserted. Now this being the only Witnesse, and Testimony in the first
part of our Scripturall Demonstration of the Truth in hand, whereunto any
<hi>Exception</hi> is put in, and the Exceptions against it being in such a frame and
composure, as manifest the whole to be a Combination of <hi>Beggers</hi> and <hi>Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
whose pleas are inconsistent with themselves, as it doth now appeare
upon the <hi>Examination</hi> of them apart; it is evident, that, as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath
little ground or incouragement for that Conclusion he makes of this <hi>Section,</hi> so
that the light breaking forth from a <hi>Constellation</hi> of this, and other <hi>Texts</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
is sufficient to lead us into an Acknowledgment, and Imbracement
of the <hi>Truth</hi> contended for.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>1. The Immutability of the Purposes of God proposed for a second Demonstration of the Truth in
hand. 2. Somewhat of the nature and properties of the Purposes of God: The object of them. 3.
Purposes how Acts of Gods Understanding &amp; Will. The only foundation of the futurition of all
things. 4. The Purposes of God Absolute. Continuance of Divine Love towards Believers purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
5. Purposes of God farther considered, and their nature explained 6. Their Independency &amp;
absolutenesse evinced. 7, 8. Prooved from Isa: 46. 9, 10, 11. Psal. 33. 9, 10, 11. Heb. 6. 17, 18. &amp;c.
those places explained. 9, 10. The same Truth by sundry Reasons and Arguments farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
11. Purposes in God, of the continuance of his Love and Favour to Believers, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by an Induction of Instances out of Scripture: the first from Rom. 8. 28. proposed. And
12, 13, 14. Farther cleared and improved: M. G. dealing with our Argument from hence, and
our Exposition of this place, considered. His exposition of that place proposed and discussed.
The designe of the Apostle consented on: the fountain of the Accomplishment of the good
things mentioned, omitted by Mr G. In what sense God intends to make all things work together
for good to them that Love him. 15. Of Gods fore-knowledge. Of the sense and use of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, also of Scisco, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Scripture
every where taken for Fore-knowledge or Pre-determination, no where for Pre-approbation, of
pre-approving, or Pre-approbation here insisted on by Mr G. its inconsistency with the sense of the
Apostles discourse manifested. 16. The progresse of Mr G. exposition of this place considered. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men Love God antecedently to his Predestination and their effectuall calling: to preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
and to preordinate different. 17. No assurance granted of the consolation professed to
be intended: The great uncertainty of the dependance of the Acts of Gods Grace mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
on one another: the efficacy of every one of them resolved finally into the wills of men.
18. Whether calling according to Gods purpose, supposeth a saving answer given to that call:
The affirmative proved, and exceptions given thereto removed. 19. What Obstructions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
called may lay in their owne way to justification. The iniquity of imposing Conditions and
supposalls on the Purpose of God, not in the least intimated by himselfe. 20. The whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
designe of the Apostle everted, by the interposition of Cases and Conditions by
M.G. 21. M. G. first attempt to prove the Decrees of God to be conditionall considered:
1 Sam. 2. 3. to that end produced. 22. I Sam. 2. 30. farth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r considered, and its unsutablenesse to
illustrate Rom. 8. 32, 33 prooved: interpretation of Scripture by comparing of places agreeing
neither in designe, word, nor matter, rejected. The places iusisted on proved not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell,
by sundry particular instances. Some observations from the words rejected. 23. What act
of God intended in those words to Eli, I said indeed: no purpose or decree of God in them decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Any such purpose as to the house of Eli by sundry Arguments disproved. 24. No purpose
of God in the words insisted on farther manifested. They are expressive of the Promise or Law
concerning the Priesthood Numb. 25. 11, 12, 13. 25. More especially relating unto Exod. 28.
43. and Ch. 29. 9. The import of that Promise, Law, or Statute, cleared: the example of Jonas
Preaching, and Gods commands to Abraham and Pharaoh. 26. The universall disproportion
betweene the Texts compared by Mr G. both as to matter and expression farther manifested.
27. Instances or cases of Saul and Paul to prove conditionall Purposes in God considered. 28.
Conditionall purposes argued from conditionall threatnings: the weaknesse of that Argument: the
nature of Divine threatnings: what Will of God, or what of the Will of God is declared by
them: no proportion between Eternall purpose, sand Temporall threatnings: the issue of the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of our Argument from the foregoing exceptions. 29. M.G's indeavour to main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aine
his Exposition of the place under consideration: the Text perverted. 30. Severall evasions of
M. G. from the force of this Argument considered 31. His Arguments to prove no certain or
infallible connexion betweene Calling, Justifification, and Glorification, weighed and answered.
His first from the scope of the Chapter, and the use of Exhorrations; the Question begged. 32. His
Second from examples of Persons called, and not justified: The Question argued, begged; no
proofe insisted on, but the interposition of his own Hypothesis. How we are called irresistibly
and in what sense. Whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arrs of Wickednesse and Unbeliefe may be laid in the way of Gods
effectuall call. 33. Mr G. demurre to another consideration of the Text, removed. 34, 35. The
Argument in hand freed from other objections and concluded 36. Jer. 31. 3. Explained
and improved for the confirmation of the Truth under Demonstration. 37. 2 Tim. 2. 19. ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the Truth from thence confirmed. 38. The foregoing Exposition and Argument vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
and confirmed. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. The same matter at large pursued 44. loh 6. 38,
39, 40. explained, and the Argument in hand from thence confirmed. 45. M. G. Exceptions to
our arguing from this place removed. 16. The same matter farther pursued. 47, 48. The
Exposition and Argument insisted on fully vindicated and established. 49. Math. 24. 24. ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and improved. 50. The severalls of that Text more particularly handled. 51. Farther
Observations for the clearing the mind of the Holy Ghost in this place, 52. The same farther
insisted on and vindicated. 53. M. G. Exceptions at large discussed and removed. 55. Ephes
1. 3, 4, 5. 2 Thess. 2. 13, 14. opened. 56. The close of the second Argument from the Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

            <p>I shall not enter upon the consideration of the <hi>Nature,</hi>

the <hi>Purposes</hi> of God, as to an expresse handling of them, but only a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
that <hi>Property,</hi> and <hi>Concernement</hi> of them, whereon the strength of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
we aime at, doth in some measure depend. Many needlesse, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Questions</hi> have been, by the Serpentine witts of men, moved and agitated
concerning them: wherein perhaps our Author hath not been outgon by
many, as will be judged by those, who have weighed his Discourses concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, with his distinctions of <hi>Desires, Intentions, Purposes</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> in
God; But this is not the businesse we have in hand; for what concerneth <hi>that,</hi>
that which ensueth, may suffice; God himselfe being an Infinite Pure Act,
those Acts of his Will and Wisdome, which are Eternall and Immanent, are
not distinguished from his Nature and Being, but only in respect of the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and habitude, which they beare unto some thing to be produced out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
from him. The Objects of them all are such things, as might <hi>not</hi> be.
Gods Purposes are not concerning any thing, that is in it selfe absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
He doth not purpose that he <hi>will be Wise, Holy, Infinitely Good, Just:</hi>
all these things, that are of absolute necessity, come not within the compasse
of his Purposes. Of things that <hi>might not be,</hi> are his Decrees and intentions;
they are, of all the Products of his Power, all that outwardly he hath done,
doth, or will doe to Eternity. All these things to the <hi>falling of a haire,</hi> or the
<hi>withering of a Grasse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 28, 29, 30.</note> hath he determined from of old; now this divine <hi>Fore-appoyntment</hi>
of all things,<note place="margin">Luk 12. 6, 7.</note> the Scripture assignes some times to the Knowledge

there intimated: and the determination of things to be done is referred to
the <hi>Counsell</hi> of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 28. which denotes an Act of his Wisdome and
Understanding, and yet withall, it is <hi>the Counsell of his Will, Eph.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>I know that all things originally owe their <hi>Futurition</hi> to a free act of the

<note place="margin">Isa. 14. 24. 19. 12. 23. 9.</note> translates them out of that state of <hi>Possibility,</hi> and (being Objects of

whereby he <hi>Intuitively</hi> beholdeth all things,<note place="margin">Jerem. 51. 29.</note> that might be produced by the

               <note place="margin">Rom 8. 28. 9. 11, 19.</note> making

               <note place="margin">Ps. 139. 11, 12.</note> or <hi>Science of Vision</hi> as it is called. But
yet the Scripture expresseth (as before) that <hi>Act</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 28.</note> whereby he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the <hi>Beings, Issues,</hi>

of his infinite <hi>Wisdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> in all his Purposes. Further, as to
the way of expressing these things to our manner of apprehension, there
are held out <hi>Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Purposes</hi> of God, distinctly suited to all <hi>Beings,
Operations,</hi> and <hi>Events,</hi> yet in God himselfe they are not multiplyed. As all
things are <hi>present</hi> to him in one most simple, and single Act of his Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
so with one individuall Act of his Will he determines concening all,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59070:51"/>
but yet in reference to the things, that are disposed of, we may call them the
<hi>Purposes</hi> of God: And these are the <hi>Eternall</hi> Springs of Gods <hi>Actuall</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which being (<hi>Ratio ordinis ad fine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>) the disposing of all things to their Ends
in an appointed manner and order in exact correspondence unto them; these
<hi>Purposes</hi> themselves must be the Infinitely Wise, Eternall, Immanent Acts of his
<hi>Will,</hi> appointing and determining all Things, Beings, and Opperations, kinds of
Beings, manners of Opperations free necessary, contingent as to their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
and Event, into an Immediate tendency unto the exaltation of his
Glory: Or as the Apostle calles them the <hi>Counsell of his Will, according where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he effectually worketh all things. Ephes</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>Our consideration of these Purposes of God being only in reference
to the Businesse which we have in hand,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> I shall doe these two things.</p>
            <p>1. First manifest, that they are all of them <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Immutable:</hi> wherein
I shall be briefe, not going out to the Compasse of the Controversy therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
as I intimated before. My intendment lyes another way.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly shew, that God hath Purposed the <hi>continuance of his Love
to his Saints,</hi> to bring them infallibly to himselfe, and that this Purpose of
God in particular, is <hi>Vnchangeable;</hi> which is the second part of the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Abiding with God in the Grace of <hi>Acceptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Purposes of God,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> I meane (as I said before) the Eternall Acts of his
Will concerning all things that outwardly are of him, which are the Rule (if
I may so speake) of all his following Operations. All externall temporary
Products of his Power universally answering those internall Acts of his Will.
The Judgment of those who make these <hi>Decrees</hi> or <hi>Purposes</hi> of God, (for I shall
constantly use these words promiscuously, as being purely of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
as relating unto God) to be in themselves Essentiall to him, and his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Nature or Understanding and Will may be safely closed withall. They
are in God as was sayd, but one: There is not a reall multiplication of any thing
but <hi>Subsistence</hi> in the Deity. To us these lye under a double Consideration.
First <hi>Simply</hi> as they are in God, and so it is impossible they should be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
from his <hi>Infinite Wisdome and Will,</hi> whereby he determineth of any
thing. Secondly in respect of the <hi>Habitude</hi> and Relation which they beare
to the things Determined, which the <hi>Wisdome and Will</hi> of God might <hi>not</hi>
have had. In the first sence, as was said, they can be nothing but the very nature
of God: The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>velle</hi> of God his <hi>Internall willing</hi> of any thing that is either <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
or <hi>Increated;</hi> for those Termes distribute the whole nature of beings. <hi>Created</hi>
they are not, for they are <hi>Eternall;</hi> (that no new immanent Act can possibly be
ascribed to God, hath full well of late been demonstrated.) Farther If they are
<hi>Created,</hi> then God <hi>willed</hi> that they should be Created; for he Created only what
he will: If so, was he <hi>willing</hi> they should be <hi>Created</hi> or no? If he were, then
a progresse will be given infinitely, for the Question will arise up to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If <hi>Increated</hi> then doubtlesse they are God himselfe for he onely is so. 'Tis
impossible that a <hi>Creature</hi> should be increated. Againe, Gods very <hi>willing</hi> of
things is the cause of all things, and therefore must needs be <hi>Omnipotent,</hi>
and God himselfe: that <hi>Voluntas Dei</hi> is <hi>Causa rerum,</hi> is taken for <hi>granted</hi> and
may be <hi>prooved</hi> from <hi>Psa.</hi> 115. 3. Which the Apostle ascribes <hi>Omnipotency</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Rom. 9. 19. Who hath resisted his Will?</hi> Doubtlesse it is the Property of God
alone to be the <hi>Cause</hi> of all things and to be <hi>Almighty</hi> in his so being; but
hereof at present no more. On this supposall, the <hi>Immutability</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of God, would plainely be coincident with the <hi>Immutability</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before handled.</p>
            <p>It is then of the <hi>Decrees and Purposes</hi> of God, with respect to the matter
about which they are, whereof I speake, in which regard also they are <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59070:52"/>
and Immutable,</hi> not that they worke any essentiall Change in the <hi>Things
themselves,</hi> concerning which they are, making that to be <hi>Immutable</hi> from
thence, which in its owne Nature is <hi>Mutable,</hi> but only that themselves
as Acts of the Infinite Wisdome and Will of God, are not lyable to, nor sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on any Condition whatever <hi>forreigne</hi> to themselves, nor subject to
change or Alteration (whence floweth an infallible certainty of actuall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
in reference to the things Decreed or Purposed, be their owne
nature what it will, or their next causes in themselves never so undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to their Production) whereof I treat. That the determining <hi>Purposes</hi>
or <hi>Decrees</hi> of Gods will concerning any thing, or things, by him to be <hi>done,</hi>
or <hi>effected,</hi> do not depend as to their Accomplishment, on any conditions, that
may be supposed in, or about the things themselves, whereof they are, and
therefore are <hi>Vnchangeable</hi> and shall certainely be brought forth unto the
appointed Issue,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25. 1 Cor. 26, 27, 28.</note> is that, which we are to prove. Knowing for whose sakes,
and for what <hi>End</hi> this labour was undertaken, I shall choose to lay the whole
proofe of this <hi>Assertion</hi> upon plaine <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 5. 2 Tim. 2. 10.</note> rather then mixe my

               <hi>Isa.</hi> 46: 9, 10, 11. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> speakes expressly to our purpose;<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the
End from the beginning, and from ancient times, the things that are not yet done,
saying my Counsell shall stand, and I will doe all my pleasure, calling a ravenous
Bird from the East, the man that executes my counsell from a far Country: Yea I
have spoken it, I will also bring it to passe; I have purposed it, I will also doe it.
v.</hi> 19. The Lord asserts his owne <hi>Deity</hi> and Eternall Being, in opposition to
all false Gods and Idols, whom he threatens to destroy. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Of this he
gives them a threefold Demonstration.</p>
            <p>First, from his <hi>Patience</hi> or <hi>fore-Knowledge, there is none like me, declaring
the end from the beginning and from ancient times, the things that are not yet
done;</hi> In this am I infinitely discriminated from all the pretended <hi>Deityes</hi> of
the Nations: All <hi>things</hi> from the <hi>Beginning</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> are naked before me,
and I have declared them by my <hi>Prophets,</hi> even things that are <hi>future</hi> and
contingent in themselves; soe are the things that I now speake of, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Babylon</hi> by the <hi>Medes &amp; Persians,</hi> a thing to be carried on through
innumerable contingencies, and yet as I have seen it, so have I told it, and
my counsell concerning it shall certainely be executed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by his <hi>Power</hi> in using what Instruments he pleaseth for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of his <hi>Purposes</hi> and bringing about his own designes; <hi>calling a ravenous
Bird from the East:</hi> One that at first, when he went against <hi>Babylon,</hi> thought of
of nothing lesse, then Executing the Counsell of God, but was wholly bent
upon satisfying his owne <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> not knowing then in the least
by whom he was <hi>Anoynted</hi> &amp; <hi>Sanctifyed</hi> for the Accomplishment of his Will.
All the <hi>thoughts</hi> of this heart, all his <hi>Consultations</hi> &amp; <hi>Actions,</hi> all his <hi>Progresses</hi> &amp;
<hi>Diversions,</hi> his <hi>Successe</hi> in his great and dreadfull undertaking to breake in
pieces that <hi>Hammer of the whole Earth,</hi> with all the <hi>free</hi> deliberations and
contingencies, wherwith his long Warre was attended, which were as <hi>many,
strong,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 50. 51.</note> and <hi>various,</hi> as the nature of things is <hi>capable</hi> to receive, were not only
in every individuall Act,<note place="margin">Isa. 44. 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> with its minutest circumstances, by him <hi>foreseene,</hi> and
<hi>much also fore told,</hi> but also managed in the hand of his <hi>Power</hi> in a regular
subservience to that <hi>call,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 45. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> which he so gave that <hi>Raveinous Bird,</hi> for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of his Purpose and Pleasure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the <hi>Immutability</hi> of his <hi>Purposes</hi> which can never be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor altered; <hi>My Counsell shall stand, and I will doe all my Pleasure, I have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59070:52"/>
Purposed it, and I will also doe it.</hi> The <hi>Standing,</hi> or Fixednesse and Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geablenesse
of his <hi>Counsell</hi> he manifests by the accomplishment of the things,
which therein he had determined: Neither is there any <hi>Salve</hi> for his <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability</hi>
in his Counsell, should it otherwise fall out. And if we may take
his owne Testimony of himselfe, what he <hi>Purposeth,</hi> that he <hi>doth:</hi> And in
the Actuall fulfilling, and the bringing about of things themselves Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and as Purposed, without any possibility of diversion from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and intended, is their Stability, and Unchangeablenesse in them manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
An <hi>Imaginary Immutability</hi> in God's Purposes, which may consist and
be preserved under their utter <hi>Frustration,</hi> as to the fulfilling of the things
themselves, under which they are, the Scripture knowes not, neither can
Reason conceive. Now this <hi>Vnchangeablenesse</hi> of his Purposes, the Lord
brings as one Demonstration of his <hi>Deity,</hi> and those who make them lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>Alteration</hi> upon any Account, or supposition whatsoever, doe depresse
him what in them lyes, into the number of such <hi>Dungehill</hi> Gods, as he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
to famish, and destroy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psa. 33. 9, 10, 11. He spake and it was done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> 
               <hi>he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the Counsell of the Heathen to nought, he maketh the devices of
the People of none effect. The Councell of the Lord stands for ever, the thoughts of
his Heart to all Generations.</hi> The Production and Establishment of all things,
in that order wherein they are, are by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> ascribed to the <hi>Will,</hi> and
<hi>power</hi> of God: By his Word, and Command, they not only <hi>are,</hi> but <hi>Stand</hi>
fast;<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> being fixt in that <hi>Order</hi> by him appointed: both the <hi>Making, Fixing,</hi> and
<hi>Sustaining</hi> of all things,<note place="margin">Revel. 4. 11.</note> is <hi>by the VVord of his Power.</hi> As the first relates to their
<hi>Being,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> which they have from Creation, so the other to the <hi>order</hi> in subsistence
and Operation,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 23. 4. 28.</note> which relates to his Actuall Providence. Herein they <hi>Stand
fast.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 50. 20.</note> Themselves with their severall and respective relations, dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 11.</note> influences, circumstances, suited to that Nature, and Being,
which was bestowed on them by his Word in their Creation, are set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in an exact correspondency to his <hi>Purposes</hi> (of which afterwards) not to
be shaken or removed. Men have their <hi>Devices and Counsells,</hi> also, they are free
Agents, and worke by Counsell, and Advice; and therfore God hath not set
all things so <hi>fast,</hi> as to overturne and overbeare them, in their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and undertakings. Saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> they <hi>Imagine and Devise</hi> indeed,
but their <hi>Counsell</hi> is of <hi>nought,</hi> and their <hi>Devices are of none effect, but the
Counsell of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Counsell,</hi> &amp; Purposes of the Lord, are set in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the <hi>Counsell,</hi> and Purposes of men, as to <hi>Alteration, Change,</hi> and
<hi>Frustration</hi> in respect of the Actuall Accomplishment of the things about
which they are. Their Counsells are so, and so: But the <hi>Counsell of the Lord
shall stand;</hi> he that shall cast <hi>v.</hi> 11. into the 10. and say <hi>The Counsell of the Lord
that comes to nought, and the thoughts of his heart are of none effect,</hi> let him
make what pretences he will, or flowrishes that he can, or display what sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posalls
and conditions he pleaseth, he will scarcely be able to keepe the field
against him, who will contend with him about his Prerogative and Glory.
And this Antithesis between the <hi>Counsells</hi> of men, and the <hi>Purposes</hi> of God
upon the Account of <hi>Vnchangeablenesse,</hi> is againe confirmed <hi>Prov. 19. 21. There
are many devices in a mans heart, neverthelesse the Counsell of the Lord that shall
stand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 8. 9, 10.</note> Herein is the difference betweene the <hi>Devices of men,</hi> and the <hi>Councell
of God;</hi> men have many Devices to try what they can doe: If one way take
not,<note place="margin">Iob. 8. 9.</note> they will attempt an other (<hi>hâc non successit, aliâ aggrediemur viâ</hi>) and are
alwayes disappointed,<note place="margin">Iob. 11. 12.</note> but only in <hi>that,</hi> wherein they fall in with the Will of
God.<note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 7. 9. 12.</note> The <hi>Shallownesse</hi> of their <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> the Shortnesse of their <hi>Foresight,</hi>
the <hi>Weakenesse</hi> of their <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Changeablenesse</hi> of their <hi>Minds,</hi> the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59070:53"/>
of all the meanes they use, puts them upon <hi>many</hi> Devices, and often
to no purpose. But for him, who is <hi>Infinite</hi> in Wisdome and Power, to whom
all things are <hi>present,</hi> and to whom nothing can fall out <hi>Vnexpected,</hi> yea what
he hath not himselfe <hi>Determined;</hi> unto whom all <hi>Emergencyes</hi> are but the Issue
of his owne good Pleasure, who proportions out what <hi>efficacy</hi> he pleaseth
unto the meanes he useth, his <hi>Counsells,</hi> his <hi>Purposes,</hi> his <hi>Decrees shall stand,</hi>
being (as <hi>Job</hi> telles us) as <hi>Montaines of Brasse.</hi> By this he differenceth himselfe
from all others,<note place="margin">Isa. 44. 7. 25. 26.</note> Idols and men, as also by his certaine foreknowledge of what
shall come to passe, and be accomplished upon those Purposes of his. Hence
the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. acquaints us, that his <hi>Promise</hi> and his <hi>Oath,</hi> those two
Immutable things, doe but declare (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the <hi>Vnchangeablenesse
of his Counsell,</hi> which God is <hi>abundantly willing</hi> to manifest, though men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
unwilling to receive it. <hi>Job</hi> determines this businesse in the 23. <hi>Ch.
v. 13, 14. He is of one minde, and who can turne him? What his soule desireth,
even that he doth; for he performeth the thing, that is appointed for me. Desires</hi>
are the least and faintest kind of Purposes, in Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> Distinctions. Yet
the certaine accomplishment of them, as they are ascribed unto God, is
here asserted by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Were the confirmation of the matter of our present Discourse,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> my designe in
hand; I could farther confirme it, by inlarging these ensuing Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. First, from the <hi>Immutability of God;</hi> the least questioning whereof
falls foule on all the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature, which requireth a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent
affection of all the Internall, and Eternall Acts of his Mind and
Will.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, from his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> in making and executing all his Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
which will not admit of any such mixture of Consults or Cooperations of
others, as should render his thoughts lyable to Alteration. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 34, 35, 36.
The Lord in his Purposes is considered as the great Former of all things, who
having his clay in the hand of his Almighty power, ordaines every parcell to
what kind of vessell, and to what use he pleaseth; hence the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the consideration of them, and the distinguishing Grace flowing from
them, with that admiration, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Oh the depth! &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, from their <hi>Eternity,</hi> which exempts them from all shadow of
change, and lifts them up above all those sphears, that either from <hi>within,</hi> and
their owne nature, or from <hi>without,</hi> by the impression of others, are exposed
to turning; that which is <hi>Eternall,</hi> is also <hi>Immutable. Acts 15. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, from the <hi>Absolutenesse,</hi> and <hi>Independency</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> whereof
they are the Acts and Emanations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. whatever hath
any influence upon that, as to <hi>Move</hi> it, <hi>Cause</hi> it, <hi>Change</hi> it, must be <hi>Before</hi> it,
<hi>Above</hi> it, <hi>Better</hi> then it, as every cause is, then its effect, as such. This Will of
his, as was said, is the fountain of all beings, to which free and independent
Act all Creatures owe their being and subsistence, their operations and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thereof, their whole difference from those Worlds of beings, which his
Power can produce, but yet shall lye bound up to Eternity, in their nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and possibility, upon the account of his good Pleasure. Into this doth
our Saviour resolve the disposall of himselfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 42. and of all others,
<hi>Math:</hi> 11. 25, 26, 27. certainly men in their wrangling Disputes and Contests
about it, have scarce seriously considered, with whom they have to doe:
<hi>shall the thing formed say to him, that formed it, why hast thou made nice
thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Fiftly,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> from the <hi>Ingagement</hi> of his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all his Purposes and Designes, as is emphatically expressed, <hi>Isa:</hi> 14.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59070:53"/>
24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Surely the Lord of Hosts hath Sworne, saying, surely as I have
thought, so shall it come to passe, and as I have purposed, it shall stand, that I will
breake the Assyrian in my land: This is the purpose of God, that is purposed upon the
whole Earth, and this is the hand, that is stretched out upon all the Nations; for the
Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disanull it? And his hand is stretched
out, and who shall turne it back?</hi> The Lord doth not only Assert the certain
Accomplishment of all his Purposes, but also to prevent, and obviate the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe</hi>
of them, who were concerned in their fulfilling, he manifests upon
what account it is, that they shall certainly be brought to passe; and that is
by the <hi>stretching out of his hand,</hi> or exalting of his mighty Power, for the doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: so that if there be a fayling therein, it must be through the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that <hi>Hand</hi> of his so <hi>stretched</hi> out, in that it could not reach the end
aymed at. A Worme will put forth its <hi>Strength</hi> for the fullfilling of that,
whereunto is is inclined: and the Sonnes of men will draw out all their Power
for the compassing of their designes: if there be Wisdome in the laying of
them, and foresight of Emergencyes, they alter not, nor turne aside to the
right hand, or to the left, in the pursuit of them: And shall the Infinitely Wise,
Holy, and Righteous thoughts, and Designes of God, not have his Power
engaged for their accomplishment? His Infinite Wisdome, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
are at the foundation of them: they are the Counsells of his Will.
<hi>Ephes. 7. 11. who hath known his minde</hi> (in them?) saith the Apostle, and <hi>who hath
been his Counsellour?</hi> though no creature can see the paths, wherein he walks,
nor apprehend the reason of the waies, he is delighted in; yet this he lets us
know for the satisfying of our hearts, and teaching of our inquiries, that
his owne Infinite Wisdome is in them all: I cannot but feare sometimes, that
men have <hi>darkned counsell without knowledge</hi> in curious contests about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
&amp; Purposes of God, as though they were to be measured by our rule &amp;
line, and as though by searching we could <hi>find out the Almighty to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
But he is Wise in heart; he that contendeth with him let him Instruct
him. Adde, that this Wisdome in his Counsell is attended with infallible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of all, that will fall in by the way, or in the <hi>course</hi> of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Purposes; and you will quickly see, that there can be no possible
intervenience upon the account whereof the Lord should not ingage his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power for their accomplishment; <hi>He is of one minde, and who can turne
him? he will worke, and who shall let him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Sixtly, by demonstrating the <hi>Vnreasonablnesse, Folly,</hi> and <hi>Impossibility,</hi> of
suspending the Acts, and Purposes of the Will of God, upon any actings of the
Creatures whatsoever: seeing it cannot be done without subjecting Eternity
to time, the <hi>first</hi> Cause to the <hi>second,</hi> the Creator to the Creature, the Lord
to the Servant; disturbing the whole order of Beings and Operations in the
world.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, by the removeall of all <hi>Possible,</hi> or <hi>Imaginary</hi> Causes of Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and change: which will all be resolved into <hi>impotency</hi> in one kind, or
other. Every <hi>Alteration</hi> being confessedly an <hi>imperfection,</hi> it cannot follow
but from want and weaknesse, Upon the Issue of which Discourse, if it might
be perused, these Corollaries would insue;</p>
            <p>1. First, <hi>Conditionall</hi> Promises, and Threatnings, are not declarative of
Gods <hi>Purposes</hi> concerning Persons, but of his <hi>Morall</hi> Approbation or Rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Things.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, There is a wide difference betweene the Change of what is
<hi>Conditionally pronounced,</hi> as to the things themselves, and the change of what
is <hi>Determinately willed:</hi> the certainty of whose event is proportioned to the
Immutable Acts of the Will of God it selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59070:54"/>
3. Thirdly, That no Purpose of God is <hi>Conditionall,</hi> though the <hi>things
themselves,</hi> concerning which his Purposes are, are often times conditionalls
one of another.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, That conditionall Purposes concerning <hi>Perseverance,</hi> are
either <hi>Impossible,</hi> implying contradictions, or <hi>Ludicrous,</hi> even to an unfitnes for
a Stage. But of these and such like, as they occasionally fall in, in the insuing
Discourse.</p>
            <p>This foundation being laid,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> I come to what was <hi>Secondly</hi> proposed, namely,
to manifest <hi>by an Induction of particular Instances,</hi> the ingagement of these <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and Immutable Purposes</hi> of God, as to the Preservation of the Saints in
his Favour to the End: and whatsoever is by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> excepted, as to the
former Doctrine of the Decrees and Purposes of God, in that part of his
Treatise, which falls under our consideration, shall in the vindication of the
respective places of Scripture to be insisted on, be discussed.</p>
            <p>The First <hi>particular Instance,</hi> that I shall propose, is, that Eminent place
of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. where you have the Truth in hand meted out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, <hi>full measure, shaken together, and running over.</hi> It doth not hang by the
side of his discourse, nor is left to be gathered, and concluded from other
Principles, and Assertions couched therein; but is the maine of the <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
drift,</hi> and Designe; it being proposed by him, to make good, upon unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
Grounds, the Assurance he gives Believers, <hi>That all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Good to them that love God, to them that are Called according to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:</hi>
the reason whereof he farther addes in the following words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>For whom
he did fore-know, he also did Predestinate to be conformable to the Image of his
Sonne, that he might be the first borne among many Brethren: moreover whom he
did Predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified,
&amp; whom he justified, them he also Glorified.</hi> What the <hi>Good</hi> aimed at, is, for which
all things shall worke together, and wherein it doth consist, he manifests in
the Conclusion of the Argument produced to prove his first Assertion <hi>v.</hi> 35.
36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>Who shall separate us from the Love of God in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> of them that <hi>love God,</hi> consists in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, and his Love: saith then the Apostle, God will so certainly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all things, that they shall be preserved in that injoyment of it, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
in this life they are already admitted, and borne out through all oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to that perfect fruition thereof, which they ayme at; and this is so unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
that the very things, which seeme to lye in the way of such an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
and event, shall <hi>work together,</hi> through the Wisdome, and Love of
God to that end. To make good this Consolation, the <hi>Apostle</hi> layes downe two
Grounds or Principles, from whence the Truth of it doth undeniably follow:
the one, taken from the <hi>Description</hi> of the <hi>Persons,</hi> concerning whom he makes
it; and the other, from the <hi>Acts of Gods Grace,</hi> and their respective <hi>concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in reference to those Persons.</p>
            <p>The Persons,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> he tells you, are those, who are <hi>called according to the Purpose
of God:</hi> That their calling here mentioned, is the <hi>Effectuall call</hi> of God,
which is answered, by Faith and Obedience, because it consists in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
of them on the Persons so called, taking away the <hi>Heart of stone</hi> and
giving a <hi>Heart of flesh,</hi> is not only manifest from that place, which afterwards
receives in the <hi>Golden Chaine</hi> of Divine Graces betweene <hi>Predestination</hi> and
<hi>Justification,</hi> whereby the one hath infallible influencies into the other; but
also from that precious description which is given of the same Persons, <hi>viz.
that they Love God,</hi> which certainely is an Issue and fruit of Effectuall Calling,
as shall afterwards be further Argued. For to that Issue are things driven in
this Controversy, that proofs thereof are become needfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59070:54"/>
The Purpose according to which these persons are called, is none other
then that, which the Apostle, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 11. termes the <hi>Purpose of God according to
Election, cap.</hi> 11. 5. The <hi>Election of Grace,</hi> as also the <hi>fore-Knowledge</hi> and
Foundation of God, as will in the Progresse of our Discourse be made far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appeare, although I know not, that this is as yet questioned; The <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi>
of this Purpose of God, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. 11, 12. The Apostle demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
from its Independency in any <hi>thing</hi> in them, or <hi>respect</hi> of them, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whom it is, it being <hi>Eternall,</hi> and expresly safegarded against apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that might arise, of any causall or occasionall influence from any thing
in them given thereunto, they lying under this Condition <hi>alone</hi> unto God, as
Persons that had <hi>done neither good nor evill.</hi> And this also the Apostle further
pursues from the <hi>Soveraignity, Absolutenesse,</hi> and <hi>Vnchangeablenesse</hi> of the Will
of God: But these things are of another Consideration.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Vnchangeable Purpose and Election</hi> being the fountaine, from
whence the effectuall Calling of Believers doth flow, the preservation of them
to the End designed the <hi>Glory</hi> whereunto they are Chosen, by those Acts of
Grace and Love, whereby they are prepared thereunto, hath coincidence of
<hi>Infallibillity,</hi> as to the end aymed at, with the Purpose it selfe; nor is it lyable
to the least exception, but what may be raised from the <hi>Mutability</hi> and
<hi>Changeablenesse</hi> of God in his Purposes, and Decrees. Hence in the following
<hi>verse</hi> upon the account of the <hi>Stability, and Immutability</hi> of this Purpose of
God, the utmost, and most remote Ende in reference to the good thereby
designed unto Believers, though having its present subsistence only in that
Purpose of God, and Infalible Concatenation of meanes thereunto condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
is mentioned as a thing actually acomplished, <hi>v.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>Herein also lyes the <hi>Apostles</hi> second Eviction of <hi>Consolation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> formerly layd
downe, even in the <hi>indissoluble Concatenation</hi> of those Acts of <hi>Grace, Love,</hi>
and Favour, whereby the Persons of Gods Purpose, or the remnant, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Election of Grace, shall be infallibly carried on in their <hi>present</hi>
injoyment, and unto the full fruition of the Love of Christ. If we may take
him upon his word (and he speakes in the name and Authority of God) those
whom he doth <hi>fore-Know,</hi> or fixes his thoughts peculiarly upon, from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
(for the terme <hi>these,</hi> is evidently discriminated: &amp; the <hi>Act</hi> must needs be
<hi>Eternall,</hi> which in order of Nature is previous unto Predestination, or the
appointment to the end by meanes designed,) those I say he doth <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,</hi>
and appoint in the Immutable Purpose of his Will, to be <hi>conformed
unto the Image of his Sonne,</hi> as in afflictions, so in Grace and Glory;</p>
            <p>To fancy a <hi>suspension</hi> of these Acts of Grace, (some whereof are Eternall)
upon conditionalls, and they not intimated in the least in the Text, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things themselves, or the <hi>End</hi> intended, casting
the Accomplishment and bringing about of the designes of God Proposed,
as his, for our <hi>Consolation,</hi> upon the certaine lubricity of the Wills of men,
and thereupon to propose an intercision of them, as to their Concattenation,
and Dependance, that they should not have a certaine <hi>Influence</hi> on the
one hand, <hi>descending;</hi> nor an Unchangeable <hi>dependance,</hi> on the other
<hi>Ascending;</hi> may easily be made appeare, to be so plaine an opposition to the
ayme and designe of the Apostle, as tis possibly capable of; But because these
things are really insisted on by Mr <hi>Goodwin.</hi> I shall choose rather to remove
them, as with much Rhetorick, and not without some Sophistry they are
by him pressed, then further anticipate them, by arguments of the Text it
selfe, of their invalidity and nullity.</p>
            <p>The discussion of our <hi>Argument</hi> from this place of Scripture, he enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Chap. 10. <hi>Sect. 42. pag.</hi> 207. and pursues it, being much in angled with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59070:55"/>
what himselfe is pleased to draw forth as the strength of it, unto <hi>Sect.</hi> 52.
pag. 219.</p>
            <p>Now though Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not at all mentioned any <hi>Analysis</hi> of the
place insisted on, for the making out of the Truth we believe to be intended
in it, nor ever once shewed his Reader the face of our Argument from hence,
but only drawn something of it forth, in such divided parcells, as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
himselfe able to blurre and obscure; yet to make it evident, that he
hath not prevailed to foyle that part of the strength of Truth (his Adversary)
which he <hi>voluntarily</hi> chose to grapple withall, I shall consider that whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and manifest the nullity of his <hi>Exceptions</hi> unto this <hi>Testimony</hi> given in
by the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the Truth we have in hand.</p>
            <p>To obtaine his end,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> undertaketh these two things,</p>
            <p>1. First, to give in an <hi>Exposition</hi> of the place of Scripture insisted on,
whence no such conclusion as that, which he opposeth (saith he) can be
drawne.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, to give in <hi>Exceptions</hi> to our Interpretation of it, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
thereupon by us deduced. The first in these words.</p>
            <p>For the scope of the Apostle, in the sequell of this passage, is clearely
this, as the particle <hi>for</hi> in the beginning of vers. 29. plainly sheweth, to prove and
make good that Assertion of his v. 28. that all things work together for Good, to
those that love God: to prove this, he sheweth by what Method, and degrees of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations
God will bring it so to passe. Whom he fore-knowes (<hi>saith he</hi>) that is,
pre-approves, (the word Knowledge frequently in Scripture importing Approbation)
as he must needs doe those that love him, these he Predestinates to be conformed to
the Image of his Sonne: and therefore as all things, even his deepest sufferings,
wrought together for Good unto him; so must they needs doe unto those, who are
Predestinated, or Preordinated by God to a Conformity with him; To give you yet,
saith our Apostle, a farther and more particular account, how God in the secret of
his Counsells, hath laid things in order to the bringing of them unto an actuall
conformity with the Image of his Sonne, to wit, in Glory, whom he Predestinated
thereunto, (who are such as love him, and thereupon are approved by him) you are
to understand, that whom he hath so Predestinated, he hath also Called, (that is)
hath Purposed or Decreed to Call to the knowledge of his Sonne, or of his Gospell,
(<hi>that is</hi>) to afford a more plaine and effectuall discovery of him unto them, then
unto others, whom he hath not so Predestinated: By the way, this Call doth not
necessarily suppose a Saving Answer given unto it by the Called, no whit more,
then the Calling mentioned Mat. 20. 16. Mat: 22. 14. It only supposeth a reall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on Gods part, to make it very sufficient to procure such an Answer to it, from
those that are Called: The Apostle advanceth toward his proposed end, and addeth:
Those whom he Calls, them he also Justified (<hi>that is</hi>) according to our last expesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word <hi>Called,</hi> he hath Purposed or Decreed to Justify: to wit, in case
the Called obstruct him not in his way, or by their unbeliefe render not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
uncapable of Justification: The clause following is likewise to be understood
with the like proviso as this; Whom he hath Justified, them he also Glorified, that
is, hath Purposed or Decreed to save, in case they retaine the Grace of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
confirmed upon them to the end.</p>
            <p>First:<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> Let it be granted, that the designe of the Apostle is to make good
that Assertion,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> 
               <hi>All things shall work together for Good, to them that love God,</hi>
and the Consolation for Believers, which thence he holds forth unto them;
yet he doth not only shew by what <hi>Method, Degrees,</hi> or Stepps, God will
bring it to passe, but also, as the Fountaine of all that ensues, layes downe the
unalterable Purpose of God concerning that End, which is attended <hi>in,</hi> and
accomplisht <hi>by</hi> all those Stepps or Degrees of his effectuall Grace after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59070:55"/>
This Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> passeth over, as not to be wrested into any tolerable
conformity with that sence (if there be any sence in the whole of what he insists
upon for the sence of this place) which he intends to rack and presse the
words unto. To save <hi>stumbling at the Threshold,</hi> (which is <hi>malum omen</hi>) he
leaps at once over the consideration of this Purpose and Designe of God, as
aiming at a certain end, without the least touch upon it. Farther that God
will bring it to passe, that <hi>all things shall work together for Good to them that
love him,</hi> is not intended by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> as though it should infallibly be <hi>so</hi>
indeed, but only that God will so <hi>way-lay</hi> them, with some Advantages, that it
<hi>may</hi> be so, as well as otherwise. What Consolation Believers may receive
from this whole Discourse of the Apostle, intended properly to administer it
unto them, as it lies under the Glosse ensuing, shall be discovered in our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Consideration of it: Thus then he makes it out.</p>
            <p>Whom he fore-Knowes,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> that is Preapprooves (the word Knowledge in Scripture
frequently importing Approbation) as he mmst needs doe those that Love him,
them he Predestinates.</p>
            <p>1. (First) that to <hi>Know</hi> is sometimes taken in Scripture for to <hi>Approove,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ans.</note>
may be granted: But that the word here used must therefore signifie to <hi>Preap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove,</hi>
is an assertion, which I dare not pretend to so much <hi>foreknowledge</hi> as to
think that any one besides himselfe will approove. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> (I doubt not)
knowes full well that <hi>Prepositions</hi> in <hi>Greeke</hi> Compositions doe often restraine
simple verbs formerly at liberty for other uses, to one precise signification.

               </gap> or the <hi>Remnant</hi> which among the
obstinate and unbelieving Jewes, were under his everlasting purpose of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est the word to signify Preapprobation: <hi>Des. Sent. Art.</hi> 1. The
whole contest and designe of the Apostle, the termes of <hi>Remnant</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi>
whereby the same thing is afterward expressed, undeniably forcing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59070:56"/>
per acceptation of the word. Not only the originall sence, and <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the word,</hi> but also the constant use of it in the Scripture, leads us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Interpretation here pinned upon it.</p>
            <p>Further, what is the meaning of <hi>Preapprooving?</hi> Gods <hi>Approoving</hi> of any
Person, as to their Persons, is his free and Gracious Acceptation of them in
Christ. His <hi>Preapprooving</hi> of them in Answer hereunto, must be his Eternall
Gracious Acceptation of them in Christ; But is this Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Doth God accept any in Christ antecedently to their <hi>Predestination,
Calling,</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> (for they are all consequentiall to this act of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation</hi>)?
This then is that which is affirmed: <hi>God approoves and accepts of
men in Christ; thereupon he Predestinates, Calls, and Justifies them.</hi> But what
need all these, if they be Antecedently accepted? I should have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that this <hi>fore-Knowledge</hi> should have been resolved rather into a <hi>middle,
or Conditionate Prescience,</hi> then into this <hi>Preapprobation,</hi> but that our Great
Masters were pleased (in the place newly cited) though without any attempt of
proofe, to carry it another way. That God should <hi>approve of, love, accept</hi> persons
antecedently to their Predestination, Vocation, &amp; Justification, is doubtlesse
not suitable to Mr <hi>Goowin's</hi> Principles. But that they should <hi>love God also,</hi>
before they fall under these Acts of his Grace, is not only openly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious
to the Truth, but also to it selfe. The phrase here of <hi>Loving God</hi>
is confessedly a description of Believers: Now to suppose men <hi>Believers,</hi> that is
to answer the <hi>Call</hi> of God, antecedently to his <hi>Call,</hi> will scarce be salved from
a flat contradiction, with any reserved Considerations, that may be invented.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Solid Foundation</hi> being laid,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> he proceeds; <hi>Those who thus love him, and
he approves of them, he Predestinates to be conformed to the Image of his Sonne.</hi>
It is true, the Apostle speaks <hi>of</hi> them, and <hi>to</hi> them that Love the Lord; but
doth not (in the least) suppose them, as such, to be the Objects of the Acts of his
Soveraigne Grace after mentioned. If God <hi>Call</hi> none, but those that <hi>Love</hi>
him Antecedently to his Call, that <hi>Grace</hi> of his must eternally rest in his own
bosome, without the least exercise of it, towards any of the Sonnes of Men.
It is those persons indeed, who in the processe of the Work of Gods Grace
towards them, are brought to <hi>love him,</hi> that are thus <hi>Predestinated</hi> and <hi>Called:</hi>
but they are so dealt withall, not upon the Account or Consideration of their
Love of God (which is not only in order <hi>consequentiall</hi> to some of them, but
the proper <hi>Effect</hi> and product of them) but upon the Account of the Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
Purpose of God, appoynting them to Salvation; which I doubt not but
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> studiously and purposely omitted to insist upon, knowing its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
inconsistency with the Conclusion, (and yet not able to wave it, had it
been once brought under consideration) which from the Words he aimeth to
extract. As then, to make mens Loving of God to be antecedent to the <hi>Grace
of Vocation,</hi> is an expresse contradiction in it selfe; so to make it, or the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of it, to be previous unto Predestination, is an insinuation of a
grosse <hi>Pelagian figment,</hi> giving rise and spring to Gods Eternall Predestination,
not in his owne <hi>Soveraigne Will,</hi> but the selfe-differencing Wills of men: <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet
anguis</hi> also in the adding <hi>grasse</hi> of that <hi>exegeticall</hi> terme, (<hi>Preordinated)
Predestinated, that is Preordinated;</hi> Though the word being considered in the
Language, whereof it is, seemes not to give occasion to any suspicion, yet the
change of it from <hi>Preordained</hi> into <hi>Preordinated,</hi> is not to be supposed to be
for nothing, in him who is expert at these Weapons. To ordaine, is either
<hi>ordinare ut aliquid fiat,</hi> or <hi>ordinem in factis statuere;</hi> or according to <hi>some, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum
disponere ad finem:</hi> to Preordaine, is of necessity, precisely tyed up to
the first sence: to <hi>Preordinate,</hi> I feare, in Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> sence, is but to Predispose
men by some good inclinations in themselves: and men <hi>Preordinated,</hi> are but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59070:56"/>
men so <hi>predisposed;</hi> which is the usuall Glosse, that men of this perswasion put
upon <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48.</p>
            <p>Thus farre then we have carried on the sence affixed to these words,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> if it
may so be called, which is evidently contradictious in it selfe, and in no one
particular suited to the minde of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, <hi>To give you yet, saith our Apostle, a farther and more particular
Account, how God in the secret of his Counsell, hath belaid things in order &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This expression (<hi>God hath belaid things in order to the Salvation of them that
love him,</hi>) is the <hi>whole</hi> of the Assurance here given by the Apostle, to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
formerly layd downe for the Consolation of Believers: and this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Analogie</hi> and Proportion of our Authors Faith, amounts only
thus farre: you that Love God, if you continue so to doe, you will fall under
his <hi>Predestination;</hi> and if you abide under that, he will <hi>call</hi> you, so as that you
may farther <hi>obey</hi> him, or you may not: if you doe <hi>obey</hi> him, and believe upon
his Call (having lov'd him before) he will <hi>Justify</hi> you; not with that Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which is <hi>finall,</hi> of which you may come short; but with <hi>initiall</hi> Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which if you continue in, and walke up unto, <hi>Solvite curas</hi> when you
are dead in your graves: This is called <hi>Gods belaying of things in his secret
Counsell,</hi> whereby the totall Accomplishment of the first ingagement is cut
off from the Root of Gods Purposes, and Branches of his effectuall Grace in
the pursuit thereof, and grafted upon the <hi>wild Olive</hi> of the Will of man, that
never did, nor never will beare any wholsome fruit of it selfe to Eternity.
What is afterward added, of the <hi>Qualification</hi> of those whom God <hi>Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi>
being an intrusion of another false <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> for the Confirmation of
an Assertion of the same <hi>alloy,</hi> is not of my present consideration; But he adds:
<hi>ye are to understand, that whom he hath Predestinated, he hath also Called, hath
purposed or Decreed to Call, to the Knowledge of his Sonne, or his Gospell, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How he hath Predestinated them, is not expressed; but being so Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated,
God purposes to Call them; that is <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>only them;</hi> for it is
an uniforme proceeding of God towards all, whom he attempts to bring to
himselfe, which is here described; That is, when men <hi>Love</hi> him, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of him, and are there-upon <hi>Preordinated</hi> to Conformity with Christ,
then he Decrees to call them, or, as the <hi>Calling</hi> here mentioned is described,
(that ye may not mistake, as though any internall effectuall work of Grace
were hereby intended, but only an outward morall perswasion, by a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Object they should imbrace) he gives a more plaine and effectuall
Discovery of Christ to them, then to any others. Doubtlesse 'tis evident to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one, that (besides the great Confusion, whereunto the proceedings of
God in bringing sinners to himselfe, or belaying, their coming with some kind
entertainments, are cast into,) the whole work of Salvation is resolved
into the Wills of Men, and insteed of an <hi>Effectuall, Operative,</hi> Unchangeable
Purpose of God, nothing is left on his part, but a morall Approbation of
what is well done, and a proposing of other desirable things unto men, upon
the Account of former worthy carriages. And this is no small part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of our Author in this undertaking.</p>
            <p>That God decrees to <hi>call</hi> them,<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 7.</note> and only them, who <hi>love</hi> him,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 6.</note> and upon that

1. (First) by Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> Confession here is as yet no great Advance
made toward the proofe of the Assertion layd downe in the Entrance, and for
the Confirmation whereof this <hi>Series,</hi> and <hi>Concatenation</hi> of Divine Graces is
insisted on. Though men <hi>Love God,</hi> are <hi>Predestinated,</hi> and accepted, yet when
it comes to <hi>Calling,</hi> they may stop there and perish everlastingly: for <hi>many
are called, but few are chosen;</hi> They are indeed <hi>be-layd</hi> by a Calling, but they
may misse the place of its Residence, or refuse to accept of its entertainment,
and passe on to ruine. But</p>
            <p>2. (Secondly) They are so called, as upon the account thereof to be
Justified For whom he <hi>Calls,</hi> he <hi>Justifies. Yea in case they obay:</hi> But this is the
Interpretation of the <hi>new</hi> Apostle, not the <hi>old;</hi> neither hath the <hi>Text</hi> any such
supposition, nor will the <hi>Context</hi> beare it, nor can the <hi>designe</hi> of the Apostle
consist with it, nor any more consolation be squeezed from this place upon
the accompt of it, then of milk from a flint in the Rocke of stone. Neither</p>
            <p>3. (Thirdly) doth the calling here mentioned, hold any <hi>Analogie</hi> with
that of <hi>the many that are called, but not chosen,</hi> pointed at in the second place
instanced in; being indeed the <hi>Effectuall, calling</hi> of the <hi>few</hi> who are chosen.
For as our Saviour in those places of <hi>Mathew,</hi> mentioned two sorts of Persons,
some that have a generall <hi>Call</hi> but are not Chosen: and others, that being
Chosen, are therfore distinguished from the former, as to their Vocation; so
<hi>Paul</hi> here tels yee, that the Calling he insists on, is the peculiar <hi>Call of God
according to his Purpose</hi> (the same Purpose intimated by our Saviour)
which being suited of God to the carrying on and accomplishing of that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his, must be effectuall, unlesse he through <hi>Mutability,</hi> and <hi>Impotency</hi>
come short of accomplishing the designe of his Will and Wisdome.</p>
            <p>Neither is this Salved by what followes <hi>that it is the Intention of God, to
make this call sufficient for the end purposed:</hi> Yea this part of the <hi>Wallet</hi> is most
filled with <hi>folly</hi> and falshood. For as generall Purposes of giving meanes for
an End, with an intention to bring that end about, that <hi>may</hi> or <hi>may not</hi> attaine
it, are most remote from God, and being supposed, are destructive to all his
holy and blessed Atributes, and Perfections, as hath been shewn: So the thing
it selfe, of <hi>sufficient</hi> Grace of Vocation, which is not <hi>Effectuall,</hi> is a grosse fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not whilst this world continues, by M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to be made Good: The
most of his Arguments being importunate sugestions of his owne false <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi>
and Conceptions. But he goes on,</p>
            <p>The Apostle advanceth towards his proposed end,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> and adds, those whom he called,
them he also Justified, or decreed to Justifie, in case the called obstruct him
not in his way, or by their unbeliefe render not themselves uncapable of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That exception (<hi>in case they obstruct him not</hi>) is a <hi>Clew,</hi> to lead us
into all the corners of of this <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> and a key to the whole designe in
hand. Such a supposall it is, as not only enervates the whole Discourse of the
Apostle, and frustrats his designe, but also opens a dore for the Questioning
of the <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of any <hi>Purpose,</hi> or <hi>Promise</hi> of God what ever; and in
one word, rejects the whole Efficacy of the Grace of the Gospell, as a thing
of nought. What <hi>strength</hi> is there in the Discourse and arguing of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
from the Purpose, and insuing <hi>Series</hi> of Gods Grace, to proove that all
things <hi>Should work together for good to them that Love God,</hi> if the whole issue
and Event of things mentioned to that end, depend not on the efficacy or
effectuall Influences of those Acts of God, one upon an other, and all upon
the end; they being all and every one of them, Jointly, and severally suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the wills of the Persons themselves, concerning whom they are,
(which yet here is concealed and intimated in the least?) How doth it proove
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59070:57"/>
at all, that they shall never be <hi>separated from the Love of Christ,</hi> that they shall
be made conformable to him in Glory, notwithstanding all opposition, upon
the account of the dispensation of Gods Eternall and Actuall Love towards
them, when the whole of <hi>their</hi> usefulnesse to the End proposed, is resolved
ultimately into themselves and their endeavours; and not into any purpose or
Act of God? Such as is the foundation, such is the strength of the whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Inferences can have no more strength, then the Principle from whence
they are deduced; If a man should tell another, that if he will goe a Journy
of a hundred miles, at each twenty miles end, he shall meet with such and such
refreshments: all the consolation he can receive upon the account of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
provided for him, is proportioned only to the thoughts he hath of his
own strength for the performance of that Journy.</p>
            <p>Farther, If in such Expressions of the Purposed Workes of God, we may
put <hi>Cases,</hi> and trust in what supposalls we think good, where there is not the
least <hi>Jot, Title,</hi> or <hi>Syllable</hi> of them in the Text, nor any roome for them,
without destroying, not only the designe and meaning of the place, but the
very sence of it; why may not we doe so in other undertakings of God, the
certainty of whose Event, depends upon his Purpose and Promise only? For
instance, The <hi>Resurrection of the Dead;</hi> may we not say God will raise up the
dead in Christ, <hi>in case there be any necessity that their bodies should be glorified?</hi>
What is it also that remaines of praise to the Glorious grace of God? This is
all he effects by it: in case men obstruct him not in his way, it doth good.
God calls men to Faith and Obedience: in case they obstruct not his way,
it shall doe them good; But how doe they obstruct his way? By Unbeliefe,
and Disobedience: take them away, and Gods calling shall be effectuall to
them: that is, <hi>in case</hi> they <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi> Gods <hi>Calling</hi> shall be effectuall to
cause them to Believe and Obey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cases</hi> then foisted into the Apostles discourse,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> in the close of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the place (if I may so call it) namely, that God will justify
the Called, in <hi>case they obstruct</hi> not his way; and will glorify them whom he
hath justified, <hi>in case they continue</hi> and abide in the state of Justification, are
<hi>First,</hi> thrust in without Ground, Warrant, or Colour of Advantage, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
given by any thing in the Text, or Context: and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> are destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the whole designe of the Holy Ghost in the place whereinto they
are intruded: injurious to the Truth of the Assertion intended to be made
good, that <hi>all things shall work together for Good,</hi> proposed upon the account
of the unchangeable purpose of God, and infallible Connexion of the Acts
of his Love and Grace in the Pursuit thereof: and resolve the promised work
and designed event, wholly into the uncertaine lubricous wills of men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Assurance given, not only to be lyable to just Exceptions, but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to faile, and be falsified in respect of thousands: and, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> render
the whole dispensation of the Grace of God to Lackey after the Wills of
Men, and wholly to depend upon them, Giving in thereby (as was said) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Presumptions, that the word, for whose Confirmation all these
Acts of Gods Grace are mentioned and insisted on, shall never be made good
nor established.</p>
            <p>Take then in few words the sence and scope of this place, as 'tis held out
in the Exposition given of it by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and wee will then proceed to
consider his Confirmations of the said Exposition; <hi>Oh you that Love God, many
Afflictions, Temptations, and Oppositions ye shall meet withall, but be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
all shall work together for your Good, for God hath appoynted you to be like
his Sonne, and you may triumph in every Condition on this account; for if yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Act of his speciall Grace towards you, Love him, he Approves you, and then
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59070:58"/>
he Predestinates you:</hi> (what that is I know not) <hi>then it is in your power to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to love him, or to doe otherwise: if ye abide not, then ye perish; if ye abide, he
will call you: and when he doth so, either ye may obey him, or ye may not; if you
doe not, all things shall work together for your hurt, and ye will be like the Devill:
if you doe, then he will justify you, and then if you abide with him, as perhaps ye
may, perhaps ye may not, he will finally Justify you; and then all shall be well.</hi> This
being the substance of the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of this place here given, let us now
consider how 'tis confirmed.</p>
            <p>That,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> which in his own termes he undertaketh to Demonstrate, &amp; to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
from all Objections in his ensuing Discourse, he thus expresseth, pag. 209.
Sect: 43. <hi>These Decrees or purposed Acts of God here specified, are to be understood
in their successive dependencies, with such a condition or proviso respectively, as
those mentioned; and not absolutely, peremptorily, or without Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The imposing of Conditions and Provisoes, upon the Decrees and
Purposes of God, of which himselfe gives not the least intimation, and the
suspending them, as to their Execution, on those conditions so invented and
imposed, at the first view reflects so evidently on the Will, Wisdome, Power,
Pre-science, and Unchangeablenesse of God, who hath <hi>said, his Purposes shall
stand, and he will doe all his Pleasure,</hi> especially when the Interruption of them
doth frustrate the whole designe and aime of God in the mentioning of those
Decrees and Purposes of his; that there will be need of Demonstrations
written with the Beames of the Sunne, to inforce men, tender, and regardfull
of the Honour and Glory of God, to close with any in such an undertaking;
let us then consider what is produced to this end, &amp; try if it will hold weight
in the ballance of the Sanctuary. This, saith he, appears, First,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By the like Phrase or manner of expression, frequent in the Scripture else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
I meane, when such Purposes or Decrees of God, the respective Execution
whereof, are suspended upon such and such conditions, are notwithstanding sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and positively, without any mention of Condition, expressed and asserted.</hi>
Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith; I said indeed that thy House, and the
House of thy Father shall walke before mee, (<hi>meaning in the Office and Dignity
of the Priesthood</hi>) for ever. But now saith the Lord, be it farre from me; I said
indeed, that is, <hi>I verily Purposed or Decreed, or I Promised; it comes much to one;
When God made the Promise and so declared his Promise accordingly, that</hi> Eli <hi>and
his Fathers house should walke before him for ever, he expressed no condition, as
required to the Execution or performance of it, yet here it plainly appears, that
there was a condition understood; In the same kind of Dialect Samuel speaks to
Saul;</hi> Thou hast done foolishly, thou hast not kept the Commandment of
the Lord thy God; for now the Lord had established thy Kingdome upon Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
for ever; but now thy Kingdome shall not continue: <hi>the Lord had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
that is, he verily purposed, or decreed to establish it for ever, to wit, in
case his posterity had walked obediently with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have the strength (as will be manifest in the progresse of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
of what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> to make good his former strange Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Whether it will amount to a necessary proofe or no, may appeare upon
these ensuing Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First:</hi> The Reason intimated, being taken neither from the Text under
debate, nor the Context, nor any other place, where any concernement of
the Doctrine therein contained, is touched, or pointed at, there being also no
Coincidence of phrase or expression in the one place and the other here
compared: I cannot but admire by what <hi>Rules of Interpretation</hi> M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
doth proceed, to make one of these places <hi>exegeticall</hi> of the other. Though
this way of Arguing hath been mainly, and almost solely insisted on of late,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59070:58"/>
by the <hi>Socinians, viz.</hi> Such a word is in another place used to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or in another sence, therefore this cannot be the necessary sence of it
in <hi>this:</hi> yet it is not only confuted over and over, as irrationall, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
but generally exploded, as an Invention suited only to shake all Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
whatever in matters of Faith, and Revelation. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
goes not so farre, (or rather he goes farther, because his instance goes
not so farre) there being no likelinesse, much lesse samenesse of Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in those Texts, which he produces to weaken the obvious, and literally
exposed sence of the other insisted on therewith. To wave the force of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from the words of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> (seeing nothing in the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the place will give in any assistance thereunto.) First,</p>
            <p>1. This <hi>Thesis</hi> is introduced. <hi>The Purposes, and Decrees of God</hi> (confessedly
ingaged in the place in hand) <hi>are, as to their respective Executions, suspended
on conditions in men.</hi> An Assertion destructive to the Power-Goodnesse, Grace,
Righteousnesse, Faithfulnesse, Wisdome, Unchangeablenesse, Providence,
and Soveraignty of God, as might be demonstrated, did it now lye in our
way. To prove that this must needs be so, and that that Rule must take place,
in the mention that is made of the Purpose &amp; Decrees of God, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.)
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. is produced, being a Denunciation of Gods judgments upon the
House of <hi>Eli,</hi> for their unworthy walking in the honour of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi>
whereunto they were by him advanced and called, and which they were
intrusted withall, expressely upon condition of their <hi>obedience;</hi> Let us then a
little consider the Correspondency, that is between the places compared for
their mutuall illustration.</p>
            <p>1. (First,) in the <hi>one,</hi> there is expresse mention of the Purpose of God,
and that his Eternall Purpose: in the other, only a Promise expressly Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
in the giving, of it, amounting to no more then a <hi>Law,</hi> without the least
intimation of any Purpose or Decree.</p>
            <p>2. (Secondly,) The <hi>one</hi> incompasseth the whole designe of the Grace of
the Gospell; the <hi>other</hi> mention not any speciall Grace at all.</p>
            <p>3. (Thirdly,) the <hi>one</hi> is wholy <hi>expressive</hi> of the Acts of God, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
therein; the <hi>other declarative</hi> of the Duty of man, with the issue there
upon depending. This then is the strength of this Argument. God approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Obedience of a man tels him, that upon the Continuance of that
Obedience in him, and his, he will continue them an Office in his service; (a
temporall mercy, which might be injoyed without the least saving Grace) and
which upon his Disobedience, he threatneth to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: (both Promise &amp;
threatning being declarative of his approbation of obedience, &amp; his annexing
the Preisthood thereunto, in that family) therefore God intending the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Elect Believers, affirming that <hi>all things shall work together for their good,</hi>
upon this Account, that he hath Eternally Purposed to preserve them in his
Love, and to bring them to him selfe by such Effectuall Acts of his Grace, as
whose Immutable dependance one upon the other, &amp; all upon his owne Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
cannot be interrupted, and therefore <hi>such,</hi> as shall infallibly produce and
worke in them all the obedience, which for the end proposed he requires. His
Purposes I say thus mentioned, must be of the same Import with the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Will in the other place spoken of; If such a Confounding of the
<hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Denuntiations,</hi> Absolute Purposes, and Conditionall Promises,
Spirituall things with Temporall, &amp; the Generall Administration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace in Christ, with Speciall Providentiall Dispensations may be
allowed, there is no man needs to despaire of prooving any thing he hath a
minde to assert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59070:59"/>
3. (Thirdly) there are two things, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> insists upon to make
good his arguing from this place.</p>
            <p>First, that these words (<hi>I said indeed</hi>) hold out the reall Purpose and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that in the Promise mentioned, there was no Condition expressed,
or required to the Execution, or Performance of it.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>First</hi> he intends, that God did really Purpose and Decree from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that <hi>Eli</hi> and his House should hold the Preisthood for ever: By the
<hi>Second,</hi> that no condition was expressed, neither in termes, or necessarily
implyed in the thing it selfe, which is of the same import.</p>
            <p>If neither of these now should prove <hi>true,</hi> what little <hi>advance</hi> hath M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
made for the weakning of the plaine intendment of the words in the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consideration, or for the confirmation of his own glosse and interposed
<hi>conditionals,</hi> either by this, or the following instances, that are of the same kind
will plainly appeare. Now that these words (<hi>I said indeed</hi>) are not declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of an Eternall Decree and Purpose of God, concerning the futurition and
event of what is asserted to be the object of that Decree, the Continuance
of the Priesthood in the house of <hi>Eli,</hi> may be evidenced, as from the generall
nature of the things themselves, so from the particular explanation of the Act
of God, whereunto this expression (<hi>I said indeed</hi>) doth relate.</p>
            <p>1. First,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> from the Generall nature of the thing it selfe, may this be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.
To what hath been formerly spoken, I shall adde only some few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
being not willing to insist long, on that which is but collaterall to
my present designe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First</hi> then, when God Decreed and Purposed this, (if so be he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, as it is said he did) he either foresaw what would be the issue of it, or
he did not? If he did not? where is his infinite Wisdome &amp; Understanding?
If we may not be allowed to say his fore-knowledge? How are all his works
<hi>known to him from the foundation of the World? How doth he declare the End
from the Beginning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15. 18. Isa.</note> 
               <hi>and the things that are yet to come?</hi> Distinguishing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from all false gods on this account? If he did fore-see the Event, that it
would not be so; Why did he <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Purpose</hi> it should be so? Doth this
become the infinite Wisdome of God to Purpose and Decree from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that that shall come to passe, which he knowes will never come to passe?
Can any such Resolution fall upon the Sonnes of men, to whom God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to continue the use of that little sparke of Reason, wherewith they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued?
If you say, God purposed it should continue, in case their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hindered it not; I aske againe, did God fore-see the Disobedience that
would so hinder it, or did he not? If he did not, the same difficulties will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
which formerly I mentioned. If he did, then God decreed and purposed
that the Priesthood should continue in the House of <hi>Eli,</hi> if they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from that disobedience, which he saw and knew full well they would
runne into. (<hi>Cui sint?</hi>)</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if God did thus Purpose and Decree, he was able to bring it
about, and accomplish his designe by waies agreeable to his Goodnesse, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Righteousnesse, or he was not. If he was not, where is <hi>his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi>
who is not able to fullfill his Righteous Designes and Purposes, in waye,
corresponding to that state of Agents &amp; things, which he hath allotted them?
How can it be said of him, <hi>he will worke, and none shall let him?</hi> That God
ingageth his Power, for the Accomplishment of his Purposes was shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
If he were able to accomplish it, why did he not doe it, but suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be frustrated of his end? Is it suitable to the Soveraigne Will and
Wisdome of God, eternally to purpose and Decree that, which by meanes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59070:59"/>
agreeable to his Holinesse and Goodnesse, he is able to bring to passe, and yet
not to doe it, but to faile and come short of his Holy and Gracious intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Obedience of the House of <hi>Eli,</hi> on which the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the pretended Decree is suspended, was such, as either they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of themselves to performe, or they were not? To say they were, is to
exclude the necessary Assistance of the Grace of God, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
hath not in termes declared himselfe to doe, not are we as yet arrived at that
height, though a considerable progresse hath been made. If they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe it, without the Assistance of the Spirit, and Concurrence of the
Grace of God: did the Lord purpose to give them that Assistance, working
in them both <hi>to will, and to doe of his own good pleasure?</hi> or did he not? If he did
so purpose, why did the not doe it? If he did not purpose to doe it, to what
end did he Decree, that that should come to passe, which he knew could not
come to passe, without his doing <hi>that,</hi> which he was resolved never to doe?
It is all one, as if a man knew that another were shut up in a prison, from
whence it was impossible that any body, but himselfe, should deliver him; and
should Resolve, and Purpose to give the poore prisoner an hundred pound,
so that he would come out of prison to him, and resolve withall never to
bring him out.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, God from Eternity <hi>fore-saw,</hi> that the Priesthood should not
be continued to the House of <hi>Eli:</hi> therefore he did not from Eternity Purpose
and Decree, that it should. To know that a thing shall not be, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
that it shall be, is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rather beseeming an halfe frantik Creature,
then the infinitely Wise Creator. Againe, upon what account did God Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,
that it should not be so? Can the futurition of Contingent Events be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in the Issue into any thing but Gods Soveraigne Determination? God
therefore did not Determine and Purpose, that it should be so; because he
Determined, and Purposed, that it should not be so. Whatsoever he doth in
time, that he purposed, to doe from Eternity; Now in time he remooved the
Priesthood from the House of <hi>Eli,</hi> therefore he Eternally Purposed, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
so to do; which surely leaves no place for a contrary Purpose, and
Decree, (not so much as <hi>Conditionall</hi>) that it should so continue for ever.
The truth is, the mystery of this Abomination lyes in those things, which lye
not in my way now to handle. A <hi>disjunctive Decree, a middle Science, Creature
Dependency</hi> are Father, Mother, and Nurse of the Assertion wee oppose,
whose monstrous Deformity, and desperate Rebellion against the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
of God, I may (the Lord assisting) hereafter more fully Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
            <p>But you will say;<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> doth not the Lord planely hold out a Purpose, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
in these words, <hi>I said in deed?</hi> Did he say it? Will you assigne Hypocrisy
to him, and doubling with the sonnes of men?</p>
            <p>I say then secondly; that the expression here used holds out no intention
nor Purpose of God, (as to the Futurition and Event of the thing it selfe)
that the Priesthood should continue in the House of <hi>Eli,</hi> but only his Purpose
and Intention that Obedience and the Priesthood should goe together.
There is a <hi>Connexion</hi> of things, not an <hi>Intendment</hi> or Purpose of Events, in
the words intimated. The latter cannot be ascribed to God, without the
charge of as formall Mutability as the poorest Creature is liable to. Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
indeed tells yee, <hi>Sect. 43. pag. 209. That the Purpose of God it selfe
considered, as an act, or conception of the minde of God, dependeth not on any
Condition what soever, and all Gods Purposes, and Decrees without exception, are
in such respect absolute, and independent:</hi> How weake and unable this is to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59070:60"/>
free the Lord from a charge of <hi>Changeablenesse</hi> upon his supposalls, needs little
paines to demonstrate. The Conceptions of the minds of the Sonnes of men
&amp; their Purposes, as such, are as absolutely free &amp; inconditionall, as the nature
of a Creature will admit: only the Execution of our Purposes and resolves
is suspended upon the Intervention of other things, which render them all
Conditionall; And this it seemes is the state with God himselfe; although in
the Scripture he most frequently distinguisheth himselfe from the Sonnes of
men, on this acompt, that they purpose at the greatest rate of uncertainty
imaginable, as to the accomplishment of their thoughts, and therefore are
frequently disappointed; but his <hi>Purposes and his Counsells stand for ever.</hi>
so <hi>Psa.</hi> 33. 10, 11. The expression then here (I said) relates plainly to the in
vestiture of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his seed in the Priesthood. There was a twofold ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made to the House of <hi>Aaron</hi> about that office: one in <hi>Generall</hi> to him
and his Sonnes: the other in <hi>Particular,</hi> to <hi>Phinehas</hi> and his Posterity. The
latter to <hi>Phinehas</hi> is farre more expressive and significant, then the other; you
have it <hi>Numb. 25. 11, 12, 13. Phinehas the Sonne of Fleazar, the Sonne of Aaron the
Priest, hath turned my Wrath away from the Children of Israel, while he was
Zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the Children of Israel in
my Jealousy: wherefore say I, Behold, I give unto him my Covenant of peace, and he
shall have it, and his seed after him, even the Covenant of an everlasting Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
because he was Zealous for God, and made an Attonement for the Children
of Israel.</hi> Here is a Promise indeed, and no Condition in termes expressed:
But yet being made and granted upon the Condition of Obedience, which is
clearely expressed once &amp; againe, that the Continuance of it was also suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on that Condition, (as to the Glory and beauty of that office, the thing
principally intended) cannot be doubted; yea it is sufficiently expressed in
the Occasion of the Promise, and fountaine thereof. But this was not that
promise, wherein <hi>Eli's</hi> was particularly concerned. Indeed his Posterity was
rejected in order to the accomplishment of this Promise, the seed of <hi>Phinehas</hi>
returning to their dignity from whence they fell, by the interposition of the
House of <hi>Ithamar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which this Expression here peculiarly relates unto,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> is the Declaration
of the mind of God, concerning the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his posterity,
which you have <hi>Exodus 28. 43. Exodus</hi> 29. 91. where the confirming them in
their Office is called <hi>a perpetuall Statute,</hi> or <hi>a Law for ever;</hi> The signification of
the terme <hi>for ever,</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> especially, relating to <hi>Legall Institutions,</hi> is
known. Their <hi>Eternity</hi> is long since expired; that then which God here <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically</hi>
expresses, as an Act of Grace and Favour to the House of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
which <hi>Eli</hi> and his had interest in, was that <hi>Statute or Law of the Priesthood:</hi> and
his purpose and intention (not concerning the Event of things, not that it
should continue in any one branch of that Family, but) of his connexing it
with their Obedience and Faithfulnesse in that Office. It is very frequent with
God to expresse his Approbation of our <hi>duty,</hi> under termes holding out the
Event, that would be the Issue of the duty, though it never come to passe:
and his disapprobation or rejection of the Sonnes of Men, under termes that
hold out the end of that disobedience, though it be prevented, or removed.
In this latter case, he commands <hi>Jonas</hi> to cry, <hi>yet forty daies and Niniveh shall
perish;</hi> not that he purposed the destruction of <hi>Niniveh</hi> at that time, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effectually to hold out the <hi>end of their sinne,</hi> that it might be a meanes to
turne them from it, and to prevent that end, which it would otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
His purpose was to prevent, at least prorogue the ruine of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and
therefore made use of threatning them with <hi>ruine,</hi> that they might not be
<hi>ruined.</hi> To say that God <hi>purposed not the execution of his purpose,</hi> but in such
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59070:60"/>
and such cases, is a plaine Contradiction. The purpose is of Execution, and
to say, he purposed not the Execution of his Purposes, is to say plainly, he
purposed and purposed not, or he purposed not what he purposed. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the precepts given to them, are proefes
of the former: but I must not insist upon particulars.</p>
            <p>This then is all that here is intended.<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> God making a <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Statute</hi> about
the continuance of the Priesthood in the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> affirmes, that <hi>then
he said</hi> his House should walke before him for ever, that is, with Approbation
and Acceptation: for as to the right of the Priesthood, that still continued
in the House of <hi>Aaron,</hi> whilest it continued, notwithstanding the ejection of
<hi>Fli</hi> and his. Now whether there were any conditions in the promise made,
which is Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> second improvement of this instance, may appeare from
the Consideration of what hath been spoken concerning it. It is called a <hi>Law,</hi>
and <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> the <hi>Act:</hi> on that Account, what ever it were, that God here points
unto, is but a <hi>Morall</hi> legislative Act, and not a <hi>Physicall</hi> determining Act of
the Will of God; and being a <hi>Law of Priviledge</hi> in its own nature, it involves
a condition, which the Acts of Gods Will <hi>vitall and eternall,</hi> wherewith this
Law is compared, doe openly disavow.</p>
            <p>Let us now see the <hi>parallell</hi> between the two places insisted on, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of the former of them, which as it will appeare by the sequell, is
the only <hi>Buckler,</hi> wherewith Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> defends his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> from the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
force of the Argument, wherewith he hath to doe. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>one</hi>
speakes of things <hi>Spirituall,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Temporall. Secondly,</hi> The <hi>one</hi> of what
what God <hi>will</hi> doe, and the other of what he approves to be done, being
done. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The one holds out Gods Decree and Purpose concerning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
the other his Law and Statute concerning duties. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The one not
capable of interposing Conditionalls, without perverting the whole designe
of God revealed in that place; the other directly including conditions. <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
The one speaking of things themselves; the other only of the manner of a
thing. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> In the one, God holds out what he will doe for the Good of
his, upon the account of the Efficacy of his Grace; In the other, what men
are to doe, if they will be approved of him. And how one of these places can
be imagined to be suited for the illustration and interpretation of the other,
which agree neither in <hi>name,</hi> nor <hi>thing, word,</hi> nor <hi>deed, purpose,</hi> nor <hi>designe,</hi>
must be left to the judgements of those, who desire to ponder these things, and
to weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>The other instances in the Case of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 27.</note> being more <hi>heterogeneous</hi>
to the businesse in hand, then that of <hi>Eli</hi> which went before, require not any
particular help for the removall of them out of the way. Though they are
<hi>Dead,</hi> as to the end for which they are produced, I presume no true <hi>Israelite</hi>
in the pursuit of that <hi>Sheba</hi> in the Church, the <hi>Apostacy of Saints,</hi> will be retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his way, by their being <hi>cast before them.</hi> In briefe, neither the Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of obedience, and suted Rewards, as in the case of <hi>Saul;</hi> nor the necessity
of meanes subservient to the Accomplishment of purposes themselves also
falling under that purpose of him, who intends the end, and the fulfilling of
it, as in the Case of <hi>Paul,</hi> are of the least force to perswade us, that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Immanent Acts</hi> of Gods will, which he pursues by the Effectuall irresistible
Acts of his Grace, so to compasse the end, which he hath from everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately
resolved to bring about, are suspended upon imaginary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
created in the braines of men, and (notwithstanding their Evident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
with the scope of the Scripture, and designe of God therein) intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into such Texts of Scripture, as on all hands, (which will be evident in
the sequell of this Discourse) are fortified against them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59070:61"/>
Besides, in the Case of <hi>Paul,</hi> though the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the Prediction did
not in the least prejudice the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Agents, who were to be imployed
for its accomplishment, but left roome for the Exhortation of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the
endeavours of the Souldiers, yet it cutts off all possibility of a contrary event
and all supposall of a disjunctive purpose in God, upon the accompt whereof
he cannot predict the issue, or event of any thing whatsoever. But of this
more largely afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this is farther Argued by Mr</hi> Goodwin, <hi>from the purposes of God in
his threatnings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 28.</note> 
               <hi>in these words.</hi> Most frequently the purpose and Decree of God,
concerning the punishment of wicked and ungodly men, is expressed by the Holy
Ghost, absolutely and certainly, without the least mention of any condition, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
or reversion: yet from other passages of Scripture it is fully evident, that
this Decree of his is conditionall, in such a sence, which imports a non-execution of
the punishment therein declared, upon the repentance of the Persons, against whom
the Decree is. In like manner though the purpose and Decree of God, for the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of those who are called, (and so for the Glorifying of those that shall be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified)
be (in the Scripture in hand) delivered in an absolute and unconditioned
forme of words; yet is it no way necessary to supose, (the most familiar frequent,
and accustomed expression in Scripture in such cases, exempting us from any such
necessity) that therefore these Decrees must needs bring forth against all possible
interveniences whatever; so that (for example) he that is called by the Word and
Spirit, must needs be Justified, whether he truly Believe or no; and he that is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
must needs be Glorified, whether he Persevere or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God are <hi>morall</hi> Acts, not declarative,
as to Particular Persons, of Gods Eternall Purposes, but subservient to other
ends together with the Law it selfe, whereof they are a Portion; (as the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that for which men are threatned) is knowne. They are <hi>Appendixes</hi>
of the Law, and in their Relation thereunto, declare the Connexion, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Sinne and Pnnishment, <hi>such Sinnes</hi> and <hi>such</hi> Punishments.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Eternall</hi> Purposes of God concerning the workes of his
Grace, are to be measured by rule and Analogy of his <hi>Temporall</hi> Threatnings,
is an Assertion striking at the very Root of the Covenant of Grace, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the Mediation of the Lord Jesus, yea at the very being of Divine
Perfections of the nature of God himselfe. This there is indeed in all <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
declared of the absolute Purpose, and Unchangeable Decree of God,
that all impenitent sinners shall be punished, according to what in his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Righteousnesse he hath apportioned out unto such deservings, and
threatneth accordingly. In this regard there is no Condition, that doth, or
can (in the least) import a <hi>non-execution</hi> of the Punishment Decreed; Neither
do any of the Texts cited in the Margent of our Author, proove any such
thing. They all indeed positively affirme, <hi>Faithlesse, Impenitent Vnbelievers</hi>
shall be Destroyed, which no supposall whatsoever, that takes not away the
Subject of the Question, (and so alters the whole thing in Debate) can in the
least infringe. Such assertions (I say) are parts of the Law of God revealing his
will in Generall, to Punish impenitent Unbelievers, concerning which his
Purpose is absolute, Unalterable, and Stedfast.</p>
            <p>The conclusion then, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> makes, is apparently <hi>racked</hi> from
the words, by stretching them upon the unproportioned bed of other
<hi>Phrases,</hi> and Expressions wholly <hi>Hetcrogeneous</hi> to the designe in this place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
Added here are supposed <hi>Conditions</hi> in generall, not once explay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to keepe them from being exposed to that shame that is due unto them,
when their (intrusion without all order or warrant from Heaven) shall be
manifested; only wrapped up in the Clouds of <hi>possible Interveniences,</hi> when the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59070:61"/>
Acts of Gods Grace, whereby his Purposes, and Decrees are accomplished,
doe consist in the effectuall removeall of the <hi>Interveniences</hi> pretended, that so
the end aimed at in the Uuchangeable Counsell of God, may (suitably to the
determination of his Soveragin, Omnipotent, Infinite, Wise Will) be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.
Neither doth it in the least appeare, that any such <hi>Calling</hi> by the
Word and Spirit, as may leave the Persons so called in their unbeliefe,
(they being so called in the pursuit of this Purpose of God, to give them
Faith, and make them conformable to Christ) may be allowed place, or
Roome in the Haven of this Text: The like may be said of <hi>Justification,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men doe not Persevere. Yea these two supposalls are only not an open beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the thing in Contest, but a flat defying of the Apostle as to the validity
of his Demonstration, That all things shall worke together &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding then any thing that hath been objected to the contrary,
the <hi>Foundation of God mentioned in this place of Scripture stands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irme,</hi> and his
Eternall Purpose of <hi>safegarding the Saints</hi> in the Love of Christ, untill he
bring them to the injoyment of himselfe in Glory, stands cleare from the
least <hi>shaddow of Change,</hi> or suspension upon any certaine <hi>Conditionalls,</hi> which
are confidently (but not so much as speciously) obtruded upon it.</p>
            <p>The next thing undertaken by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> is to vindicate the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Glosses from such oppositions, as arise against them from the <hi>Context,</hi>
and <hi>words themselves,</hi> with the <hi>designe</hi> of the Holy Ghost therein: These
things doth <hi>He</hi> find his Exposition obnoxious unto. The exposition which <hi>He</hi>
pretends to give no strength unto, but what is forraigne on all Considerations
whatsoever of words and things, to the place it selfe: This, it seemes, is to
prophesy according to the <hi>Analogie</hi> of Faith.<note place="margin">Rom. 12: 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First then <hi>Sect.</hi> 44. To the Objection, that those who are <hi>Called</hi> are also <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,</hi>
and shall be <hi>Glorified,</hi> according to the Tenor of the <hi>series</hi> of the Acts
of the Grace of God here layd down, he Answereth, <hi>That where either the one,
or the other of these Assertions, be so or no, it must be Judged of by other Scriptures;
Certain it is by what hath bin argued concerning the frequent usage of the Scripture
in point of Expression, that it cannot be concluded or determined by the Scripture in
hand.</hi> The Sum of this <hi>Answer</hi> amounts to thus much: Although the sence op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
be cleare in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and Expression of this place of Scripture, in the
<hi>Grammaticall</hi> sence, and use of the words; though it flowes from the whole
<hi>Context,</hi> and Answers (alone) the designe, and scope of the place, which gives
not the least Countenance to the interposing of any such <hi>Conditionalls,</hi> as are
framed, to force it to speake contrary to what (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) it holds forth:
yet the mind of God in the words, is not from these things to be concluded
on; but other significations and sences, not of any word here used, not from
the laying downe of the same Doctrine in other places with the <hi>Analogie</hi> of
the Faith thereof, not from the proposing of any designe suitable to this here
expressed, but places of Scripture agreeing with this, neither in <hi>Name,</hi> nor
<hi>Thing,</hi> Expression, nor Designe, Word, nor Matter, must be found out in the
sence and meaning of this place, and be from them concluded, and our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of this place accordingly regulated. <hi>Nobis non licet &amp;c.</hi> neither hath
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> then produced any place of Scripture, nor can he <hi>parallel</hi> to this so
much as in expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though treating of any other subject or matter, that will
endure to have any fuch <hi>sence</hi> tyed to it, as that which he violently imposeth
on this place of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> And of the Sense, and Mind of God in this place,
may not safely be received and closed withall, from the proper and ordinary
<hi>fignification</hi> of the word (which is always attended unto without the least
dispute, unlesse the subject matter of any place, with the Context enforces
to the sense left usuall and naturall) with the cleare designe and scope of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59070:62"/>
Context in all the parts of it, universally correspondent unto it selfe; I know
not how, or when, or by what <hi>Rules</hi> we may have the least certainty, that
wee have attaind the knowledge of the minde of God in any one place of
Scripture whatever.</p>
            <p>What he nextly objects to himselfe,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> namely that, <hi>though there be no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
expressed, in the instances by him produced, yet there are in parallell places, by
which they are to be expounded,</hi> (but such conditions as these, are not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in any place, that answers to that which we have in hand) it being by
himselfe, (as I conceive) invented to turne us aside from the Consideration of
the irresistible efficacy of the Argument from this place, (which use he makes
of it in his first answer given to it) I owne not: and that because I am fully
assured, that in any promise whatsoever, that is indeed Conditionall, there is
no need to enquire out other Scriptures of the like import, to evince it so to
be; all and every one of them that are such, either in expresse <hi>termes,</hi> or in the
<hi>matter</hi> whereof they are, or in the <hi>Legall</hi> manner wherein they are given and
enacted, doe plainly and undeniably <hi>hold out</hi> the Conditions enquired after.
His threefold Answer to this Objection, needs not to detaine us: Passing on (I
hope) to what is more materiall and weighty; He tells us First (<hi>Sect.</hi> 44.) that
if this be so, <hi>then it must be tryed out by other Scriptures, and not by this:</hi> which
Evasion I can allow our Author to insist on, as tending to shift his hands of
this place, which I am perswaded in the Consideration of it, grew heavy on
them. But I cannot allow it to be a plea in this Contest, as not owning the
Objection which it pretends to answer. The two following Answers, being
not an actuall doing of any thing, but only faire and large promises of what
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will doe, about answering other Scriptures, and evincing the
<hi>Conditionalls</hi> intimated from such others, as he shall produce; (some, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
will think these promises no payment, especially such as having weighed
<hi>Mony</hi> formerly tendred for reall payment, have found it <hi>too light</hi>) I shall let
them lye in Expectation of their accomplishment. <hi>Rusticus expectat &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, (till Answers come to hand) Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> proffers to
proove by two Arguments,<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> (one cleare Answer had been more faire) that
these Acts of God, <hi>Calling, Justification,</hi> and so the rest, have no such <hi>Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi>
betweene them, but that the <hi>one of of them may be taken,</hi> and be put in
execution, and yet not the other, in respect of the same persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His first Reason is this:</hi> If the Apostle should frame this Series or Chaine of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Acts, with an intent to shew or teach the uninterruptiblenesse of it, in what
case, or cases soever, he should fight against his Generall, and maine scope or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
in that part of the chapter, which lyeth from v. 17. Which clearely is this,
to encourage them to constancy, and Perseverance in suffering afflictions. For to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
any such thing, as that being Called &amp; Justified, nothing could hinder them from
being Glorified, were to furnish them with a ground, on which to neglect his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
for who will be perswaded to suffer Tribulation for the otaining of that,
which they have sufficient Assurance given, that they shall obtaine, whether they
suffer such things or no: therefore certainely the Apostle did not intend here to
teach the certainty of Perseverance in those that are Justified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ans.</note> That this Argument is of such a Composition as not to operate
much in the case in hand, will easily appeare; For</p>
            <p>1. First, those expressions [<hi>in what Case or Cases soever</hi>] are foysted into the
sence, and sentence of them, whom he opposes; who affirme the Acts of Gods
Grace here mentioned to be effectually, and vertually <hi>Preventive</hi> of
those cases, and of which might possibly give any <hi>Interruption</hi> to the <hi>Series</hi> of
them.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Whatsoever is here pretended of the <hi>maine scope of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59070:62"/>
the scope of the place, we have under consideration, was granted before,
to be the making Good of that Assertion premised in the Head thereof, <hi>that
all things should work together for good to Believers,</hi> and that <hi>so</hi> to make it
Good, that upon this Demonstration of it, they might triumph with Joy and
Exultation: which it cannot be denied, but that this uninterruptible <hi>series</hi>
of Divine Acts, (not <hi>framed</hi> by the Apostle, but) <hi>revealed</hi> by the Holy Ghost,
is fitted and suited to doe.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, suppose that be the Scope of the foregoing verses; What is
there in the <hi>Theses</hi> insisted on, and the sence imbraced by us, opposite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Why to suggest any such thing to them as, <hi>that being Called, and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nothing could possibly interpose to hinder them from being Glorified,</hi> (that is
that God by his grace will preserve them from departing wilfully from him,
and will in Jesus Christ establish his Love to them for ever) <hi>was to furnish them
with a motive to neglect his exhortations:</hi> yea but this kind of Arguing we call
here <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> and it is accounted with us nothing valid; The thing
in Question, is produced as the <hi>medium</hi> to Argue by. We affirme there is no
stronger motive possible to incourage them to Perseverance, then this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
It is otherwise saith Mr <hi>Goodwin;</hi> and its being otherwise in his Opinion,
is the <hi>medium</hi> whereby he disproves not only that, but another Truth, which
he also opposeth. But he adds this Reason, <hi>for who would be perswaded to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
&amp;c.</hi> that is, it is impossible for any one industriously and carefully to use
the meanes for the Attainment of any End, if he hath Assurance of the End
by these meanes to be obtained. What need <hi>Hezekiah</hi> make use of food,
or other meanes of sustaining his life, when he was assured that he should live
<hi>fifteen years?</hi> The Perseverance of the Saints is not in the Scripture, nor by
any of those, whom Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath chosen to oppose, held out on any
such ridiculous termes, as whither they use meanes, or use them not; carry
themselves well, or wickedly miscarry themselves: but is asserted upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Gods effectuall Grace, preserving them <hi>in</hi> the use of the meanes, and
<hi>from</hi> all such miscarrages, as should make a totall separation betweene
God and their soules. So that this first Reason is but a plaine <hi>begging</hi> of those
things, which (to use is owne language) he would not <hi>digge</hi> for.</p>
            <p>But perhaps,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> although this first Argument of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> be nothing but an
importune suggestion of some <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of his owne, with an arguing from
inferences, not only <hi>Questionable</hi> but <hi>Vnquestionably</hi> false; yet if his second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
will evince the matter under Debate, he may be content to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
losse in the <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi> of the first, so that the Gold of the following
Argument doe abide. Now thus he proceedeth in these words. <hi>And lastly this
demonstrates the same thing yet farther. If God should Justifie all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whom he Calleth, and that against all barrs of wickednesse and unbeliefe,
possible to be layd in his way by those, who are Called; Then might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
and unbelieving Persons inherit the kingdome of God: the Reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
is evident: it being a knowne Truth, that the Persons Justified are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or present capacity of inheriting the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans:</hi> But <hi>Carbones pro Thesauro,</hi> if it be possible this (being of the same
nature with that which went before) is more weake and infirme, as <hi>Illogicall</hi>
and <hi>Sophisticall</hi> as <hi>it;</hi> the whole strength of it lyes in a supposall, that those
who are so <hi>Called,</hi> as here is intimated in the text <hi>called according to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God,</hi> called to answer the designe of God to make them like to Jesus
Christ, so called as to be hereupon Justified, may yet lay such barrs of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
and Unbeliefe in their owne way, when they are so Called, as not to
be Justified; when that Calling of theirs consists in the effectuall removeall
of all those <hi>barrs of Wickednesse and Vnbeleife,</hi> which might hinder their free
and Gracious Acceptation with God. That is, that they may be <hi>called Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59070:63"/>
and <hi>not Effectually;</hi> A supposall hereof, is the strength of that Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which yeilded Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> this Demonstration. His eminent way of
Arguing here in, will also be farther manifest, if you shall consider that the
very thing, which he pretends to proove, is that which he here useth for the
<hi>medium</hi> to proove it, not varied in the least. <hi>Si Pergama dextra &amp;c.</hi> But Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> fore-saw, (as it was easy for him to doe) what would be excepted
to this last Argument, to wit, that the <hi>Calling</hi> here mentioned effectually
removes those <hi>barrs of Wickednesse and Vnbeliefe,</hi> a supposall whereof is all
the strength and vigour it hath: And in that supposall there is a plaine assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the thing in Question, and a bare contradiction to that, which
from the place we proove, and confirme. Wherefore he answereth sundry
things.</p>
            <p>1. First <hi>that Judas, Demas, Simon Magus, were all called, and yet layd bars of
Wickednesse and Vnbeliefe, whereby their Justification was obstructed;</hi> and to the
reply, that they were not so Called, as those mentioned in the Text, not
Called <hi>according to Gods Purpose,</hi> with that Calling which flowes from their
Predestination to be conformed unto Christ, with that Calling which is held
out as an effectuall meane to accomplish the End of God, in causing <hi>all things
to worke together for their good:</hi> and therefore that the strength of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
lyes in the interposition of his owne Hypothesis once more, &amp; his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
requests for a grant of the thing in question, he proceeds to take away
this Exception by sundry crosse Assertions, and Interrogations. <hi>Sect. 45. 1. It
hath not been prooved</hi> (saith he) <hi>by any man, nor I believe never will be</hi> (S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> we
live not by your Faith,) <hi>that the Calling here spoken of imports any such
Act or Worke of God, whereby the called are irresistibly necessitated savingly to
believe. If it import no such thing as this, what hinders but that the persons
mentioned, might have been Called by that very kind of Calling here spoken
of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is known what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ayms at in that Expression [<hi>iresistibly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
savingly to believe</hi>] we will not contend about words: neither of the two
first termes mentioned,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> are either willingly used of us, or can be properly used
by any, in reference to the worke of Conversion or Calling. What we own in
them, relates as to the first terme (irresistibly) to the <hi>Grace</hi> of God <hi>Calling,</hi>
or Converting: and in the latter (necessitatingly) to the <hi>Event</hi> of the Call it
selfe. If by irresistibly, you intend the <hi>manner</hi> of operation of that effectuall
Grace of God, (not which conquers in a <hi>reaction,</hi> which properly may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so: but) which really, and therfore certainely (for <hi>unumquod<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan>, quod est,
dum est, necessariò est</hi>) produces its effect, not by forcing the <hi>Will,</hi> but (being as
intimate to it as it selfe) making it willing &amp;c. we owne it. And if by <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating</hi>
they understand only the event of things, that is, it is of necessity, as
to to the Event that they shall savingly Believe, who are Effectually Called
without the least straitning, or necessitating their Wills in their Conversion,
(which are still acted sutably to their native Liberty) we close with that
terme also, and affirme that the Calling here mentioned imports such an Act
of Gods Grace, as whereby they who are Called, are effectually and infallibly
brought savingly to believe, and so <hi>consequentially,</hi> that the persons whose
Wickednesse and Unbeliefe abides upon them, were never Called with this
Calling here contended about; They who are not Predestinated <hi>a parte antè,</hi>
nor Glorified <hi>a parte pòst,</hi> are not Partakers of this Calling. I must adde, that
(as yet) I have not met with any proofe of Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> Interpretation, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Exception against ours, that is not resolved into the same principle of
Craving the thing in question, producing the thing to be prooved, as its
owne Demonstration. And asserting the things prooved against him, not to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59070:63"/>
be so, because they are not so. From the designe and scope of the place, the
intendment of the Holy Ghost in it, the meaning of the words, the Relation
and Respect wherein the Acts of God mentioned, stand one to an other, the
disappointment of Gods Purpose &amp; Decree in case of any interruption of them,
or non-producing of the effects, which lead the subjects, of whom they are
spoken, from one to an other, we prove the infallible efficacy of every Act
of Gods Grace here mentioned, as to their tendency unto the end aymed at: &amp;
these he that is called to believe, may infallibly doe so. But sayes Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
this is otherwise Well let that passe. He adds secondly, <hi>Suppose it be granted,
that the Calling here spoken of is that kinde of Calling which is alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a saving Answer of Faith; yet neither doth this prove, but that even
such called ones may obstruct and prevent by Wickednesse and Vnbeliefe their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Justification and consequently their Glorification; If so; then that Chaine of
Divine Acts or Decrees here framed by the Apostle, is not indissolveable in any such
sence, which imports an Infallibility, and universall exertion or execution of the
latter, whensoever the former hath taken place:</hi> In this Answer Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
denies our conclusion, to wit, that the Chaine of Divine Acts of Grace in this
place is indissolveable which that it is, we make out and prove from the words
of the Text, the Context and scope of the place: and adds his reason; <hi>Because
they who are Justified, may lay barrs in their way from being finally so, or being
Glorified;</hi> That is, it is not so, because it is not so. For the Efficacy of the
Grace asserted, is for the removeall of the <hi>barrs</hi> intimated, or wherein may its
<hi>efficacy</hi> be supposed to consist, especially in its Relation to the end designed.
And so this place is Answered: Saith the Holy Ghost, those whom <hi>God Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
he Glorifies;</hi> perhaps not, saith Mr <hi>Goodwin;</hi> some things may fall in, or
fall out to hinder this. <hi>Eligite cui credatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were I not resolved to abstaine from the Consideration of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men, when they are <hi>Autoritatively</hi> interposed in the things of God,
I could easily manifest the fruitlesnesse of the following endeavour to prove
the <hi>effectuall Calling of Judas,</hi> by the Testimony of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr:</hi>
for neither hath the first in the place alleadged any such thing; (least of
all is it included in M. G's Marginall Annotation, excluding Compulsion, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and Violence from Vocation) and the latter in the Section pointed
to, and that following, layes downe principles sufficiently destructive to the
whole designe, whose management M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath undertaken. Neither
shall I contest about the imposing on us in this dispute, the notion of finall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
distinct from Glorification, both name, and thing being Forraigne
to the Scripture, and secretly including, (yea delivering to the advantage of
its Author) the whole Doctrine under consideration stated to his hand. If
there be a Gospell-justification in Sinners or Believers in the blood of Christ,
not finall, or that may be cut off, he hath prevailed.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> proceeds to object against himselfe,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> Sect: 46. <hi>But some it
may be will farther object against the interpretation given, and plead that the
Contexture between these two linkes of this Chaine, Predestination to a conformity
with Christ, and Calling, is simply and absolutely indissolveable, so that whoever
is so Predestinated, never failes of being called. 2. That it is altogether unlikely
that in one and the same series of Divine actions, there should not be the same
fixednesse or certainty of coherence, between all the parts.</hi> The first of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bare <hi>Thesis</hi> which he opposed, I know not how it came to be made an
Objection. I shall only adde to the latter Objection; which includes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Argument, that the Efficacy of any one Act of Gods Grace here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
as to the end proposed, depending wholly on the uninterruptible
concatenation of them all, and their effectuall prevalency and certainty, (as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59070:64"/>
to their respective Operation) of every one of them, being equall to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of the Purpose of God in and by them all; and willingly owne
it, especially finding how little is said (and yet how much labour taken) to
dresse up a pretended Answer unto it; Of this there are two parts, whereof
the first is this <hi>I Answer,</hi> saith he.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> By a demurre upon the former of these pleas, which was that the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the Predestination of God mentioned, and his Calling, is uninterrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Somewhat doubtfull to me it is, whether a person, who by meanes of the Love
of God, which is in him at present, falls under his Decree of Predestination, may
not possibly, before the time appointed by God for his Calling, be changed in that
his Affection, and consequently passe from under that Decree of Predestination,
and fall under another Decree of God opposite thereunto, and so never come to be
called.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I confesse this <hi>demurre</hi> outrunnes my understanding, <hi>Equis albis</hi>
neither can I by any meanes, overtake it, to pinne any tollerable sence upon
it; though I would allow it to be suited only to M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> principles, and
calculated for the Meridian of <hi>Arminianisme:</hi> for, who (I pray) are they, in any
sence, (in M. <hi>Goodwins</hi>) that doe so love God, as to <hi>fall under,</hi> as he speakes,
that pendulous Decree of Predestination, and to whom this promise here is
made? Are they not Believers? Are any others Predestinated in our Authors
judgement, but those who are actually so? is not the Decree of Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Gods Decree or Purpose of saving Believers by Jesus Christ? Or can any
love God to Acceptation, without Believing? If then they are Believers, can
they alter that condition before they are Called? Wee supposed that <hi>Faith had
been by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> and that it is of necessity (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature) that <hi>Calling</hi> should precede <hi>Believing.</hi> What are men called to?
Is it not to Believe? Here is then a new sort of men discovered, that believe,
and fall from Faith, Love God and forsake him, all antecedently to their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Calling. I am confident that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> may be perswaded to
withdraw this <hi>demurrer,</hi> or if not, that he will be over-ruled in it, before
the judgement seat of all unprejudiced men. It will scarcely as yet passe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
that men are <hi>borne Believers,</hi> and after such and such a time of their
continuance in that estate of beliefe, and being Predestinated thereupon, God
then <hi>Calls</hi> them. Neither doe I understand the meaning of that phrase, [<hi>never
come to be called</hi>] used by <hi>Him,</hi> who maintaines all to be called, but this is but
a <hi>demurrer.</hi> the Answer followes.</p>
            <p>For the great regard I beare unto the Authors <hi>Abilities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 34.</note> I shall not say that
his insuing Discourse doth not deserve to be transcribed, and punctually insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on: but this I may say (I hope) without offence, that it is so long &amp; tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
so remote from what it pretends unto, to wit, an <hi>Answer</hi> to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<hi>Argument,</hi> that I dare not venture upon the patience of any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
so farre, as to enter into a particular consideration of it.</p>
            <p>The summe of it is, that there is no unlikelihood in this, that, though one
part of the Chaine of Divine Graces before mentioned, cannot be dissolved
nor broken, yet another may, (notwithstanding that a dissolution of any one
of them, renders the designe of God in them all, wholly frustrate and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse)
This he proves, by proposing a new <hi>series</hi> of Divine Acts, in actuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
one upon another, some whereof may be uninterruptible, but the
other not so. He that shall but slightly view the Concatenation of Divine
Acts, here proposed by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> for the illustration of that dependance of
<hi>them,</hi> and their Efficacy, which we insist upon, will quickly finde it lyable to
some such <hi>small</hi> Exceptions, as renders it altogether uselesse, as to the end
proposed. As first,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59070:64"/>
1. That the case here proposed, and pretended to be <hi>parallell</hi> to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Consideration, is a <hi>fictitious</hi> thing, a <hi>fained Concatenation</hi> of fained
Decrees of God, being neither in any one place delivered in the Scripture,
nor to be collected from any, or all the Texts in the <hi>Bible:</hi> which course of
proceeding, if it may be <hi>Argumentative</hi> in sacred Truths, it will be an easie
and facile taske to overthrow the most Eminent and clearely delivered Heads
of Doctrine in the whole Booke of God.</p>
            <p>2. That it is a case surmised by him, suitable to his owne <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
neither true in its selfe, nor any way <hi>Analogous</hi> to that wherewith 'tis
yoked, being indeed a new way and <hi>tone</hi> of <hi>begging</hi> the thing in question.
For instance; It supposeth (without the least Attempt of proofe) (1.) <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
Decrees,</hi> or a disjunctive intendment of Events in God; it shall come to
passe, or otherwise. (2.) A <hi>middle science</hi> conditionall, as the foundation of
those disjunctive Decrees; with (3.) A <hi>futurition</hi> of things, <hi>Antecedent</hi> to
any determining Act of the Will of God; and (4.) A possibility of frustrating
(as to Event) the Designes and purposes of God; and (5.) That all <hi>medium</hi>'s
of the Accoplishment of any thing, are conditions of Gods intentions, as to
the end he aymes at; &amp; (6.) That God appoints a <hi>series</hi> of <hi>mediums</hi> for the
compassing of an End, and designes them thereunto, without any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Resolution to bring about that End; &amp; (7.) That the Acts of Gods Grace
in their Concatenation mentioned in this place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. are severally
Conditionall, because he hath invented or faigned some Decrees of God
which he sayes are so; All which, with the inferences from them, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
knowes will not advance his Reasonings at all, as to our Understandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully perswaded, that they are all Abominations of no lesse base alloy,
then the <hi>Errour</hi> it selfe, in whose defence and Patronage they are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>To our Argument then before mentioned,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> prooving an equall <hi>indissolvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse</hi>
in all the linkes of the Chaine of Divine Graces, drawne forth and
insisted on, from the equall dependance of the designe &amp; Purpose of God on
the mutuall dependance of each of them on the other, for the fullfillng of
that Purpose of his, and obtaining the End, which he professes himselfe to
intend: this is the summe of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Answer, <hi>If I can invent a series of
Decrees, and a Concatenation of Divine Acts, though indeed there be no such
thing, neither can I give any colour to it without laying downe, and taking for
granted many false and absurd supposalls; and though it be not of the same nature
with that here proposed by the Apostle,</hi> nor any where held out in the Scripture
for any such End &amp; Purpose as this is; neither can I assigne any absolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
end in this Series of mine, whose Accomplshment God ingages him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bring about; (as the Case stands in the place of Scripture under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration)
then it is meet and equitable, that laying aside all inforcements
from the Text, Context, Nature of God, the thing treated on, all compelling
us to close with another sence and Interpretation, that we regulate the
minde of the Holy Ghost herein, to the Rule, proportion, and <hi>Analogie</hi> of the
case as formerly proposed. This being the summe of that, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
calls his <hi>Answer,</hi> made naked I presume to its shame, <hi>valeat quantum valere
potest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only adde that (1.) when Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> shall make good that order
and <hi>Series</hi> of Decrees, here by him mentioned, from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or with solid
Reason from the nature of the things themselves, suitably to the Properties
of him, whose they are; And (2.) Proove that any eternall Decree of God
either as to its primitive enacting, or <hi>temporall</hi> Execution, is suspended on
any thing, not only really contingent in it selfe and its owne nature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59070:65"/>
of the immediate fountaine from whence it flowes, and nature of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
cause; but also as to its Event, in respect of any Act of the will of God,
that it may otherwise be, and so the accomplishment of that Decree left
thereupon uncertaine, and God himselfe dubiously conjecturing at the Event,
(for instance whether Christ should Dye or no, or any one be saved by him.)
and (3.) Clearely evince this notion of the Decrees and Purposes of God,
that he intends to Create Man, and then to give him such advantages, which
if he will, it shall be so with him: if otherwise, it shall be so: To send Christ, if
men doe so, or so: or not to send him, if they doe otherwise; &amp; so of the residue
of the Decrees mentioned by him; and (4.) That all events of things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
Spirituall and Temporall, have a <hi>Conditionall futurition</hi> antecedent
to any act of the Will of God. When I say he shall have proved these and
some like things to these, we shall further consider what is offered by him;
yea we will confesse that <hi>Hostis habet muros &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the many other Testimonies to the purpose in hand,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> bearing witnesse
to the same Truth, some few may yet be singled out; and in the next place
that of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 31. 3. presents it selfe unto tryall and Examination. <hi>Yea I

               </hi> Church: of the seed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of whom he
speaks: the foundation of whose blessednesse, is laid in the Eternall Love of
God; Who the persons are thus <hi>beloved,</hi> and of whom we are to interpret
these expressions of Gods good will, the Apostle manifests <hi>Rom:</hi> 11. as shall
afterwards be more fully discoursed, and cleared. He tells you, it is the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
whom God intends, of whom he saies that they <hi>obtained</hi> the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
that is by faith, according to the purport of Gods good will towards
them, though the rest were hardned; God (who adds daily to his Church
<hi>such as shall be saved, Acts</hi> 13. 48.) <hi>drawing</hi> them thereunto, upon the account
of their being so Elected. He calls them also the <hi>Remnant according to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Grace, and the People whom God did foreknow v:</hi> 1, 2. or from Eternity
designed to the participation of the Grace there spoken of, as the use of the

of <hi>Israel</hi> after the flesh, which the Lord in his Free Grace hath eternally
appointed to be his peculiar inheritance, which in their severall Generations
he drawes to himselfe with Loving Kindnesse. And this <hi>everlasting Love</hi> is
not only the fountaine, whence actuall <hi>Loving Kindnesse</hi> in drawing to God,
or bestowing Faith doth flow, (<hi>as they Believe, who are ordained to eternall
life</hi>) but also the sole Cause and Reason, upon the account whereof, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-distinction
to the Consideration of any thing in themselves, God will
exercise <hi>Loving Kindnesse</hi> towards them for ever. That which is <hi>everlasting</hi>
or <hi>eternall,</hi> is also unchangeable; Gods <hi>everlasting Love</hi> is no more liable to
mutability then himselfe; And it is an alwaies equall Ground and Motive for
Kindnesse. On what account should God alter in his actuall Kindnesse, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
towards any, if that, on the account whereof he exercises it, will not
admit of the least Alteration? He that shall give a Condition, on which this <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Love</hi> of God should be suspended, and according to the influence
whereof, upon it, it should goe forth in Kindnesse, or be interrupted; may be
allowed to boast of his discovery.</p>

Starres (it seemes) of a considerable magnitude in the visible Firmament

a Temptation of a not to be despised prevalency, and sad consequence,
(which we formerly granted to attend such eminent Apostasie) seems to have
laid hold on many weake Saints: they feared, least they also might be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
and after all their <hi>labouring,</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> in the Work of Faith, and
Patience of the Saints, come short of the <hi>marke of the high calling</hi> set before

opposition, whereunto (in those daies especially) they were exposed; Upon the
contemplation of such Apostasies or defections, they were opportune and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious

under consideration, might lead them to feare a more generall defection: for
seeing it is this with some, why may not this be the Condition of all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
and so the whole Church may cease, and come to nothing, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the Promises of <hi>building it on a Rock,</hi> and of the presence of Christ
with it to the end of the World; Nay may not his whole Kingdome on earth
on this account, possibly fall to utter ruine, and himselfe be left a <hi>Head</hi>
without members, a <hi>King</hi> without Subjects? This by Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
is the Objection, which the Apostle answereth, and removes <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi>
the words under Consideration. Cap. 14. pag. 359. 360. <hi>Seeing these fall away,
are not wee likewise in danger of falling away, and so of loosing all that we have
done and suffered in our Christian profession. To this Objection or Scruple, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Answereth in the Words in hand;</hi> So he; Thus farre then are we agreed.
About the sence of the words themselves, and their Accommodation to the
removall of the Objection or Scruple mentioned, is our difference. I know
not how M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> comes to call it an <hi>Objection</hi> or <hi>Scruple,</hi> (which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of thoughts or words, arising against that which <hi>is,</hi> in the truth of it)
seeing it is their very State and Condition indeed, and that, which they feare,
is that which they are really exposed unto, and which they ought to believe
that they are exposed to. In his Apprehension, they who make the <hi>Objection,</hi>
or whose <hi>Scruple</hi> it was, were as liable unto in his judgement, and in the same
danger of falling away, or greater, (their Temptations being increased, and
heightned by the Apostasie of others) then them that fell the day and hour
before; neither could that falling away of any be said to raise a Scruple in
them that they might do so to, if this were one part of their Creed, that all
and every man in the world might so doe.</p>
            <p>The Answer given by the Apostle,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> is no doubt suited to the <hi>Objection</hi> and
fitted to the removeall of the <hi>Scruple</hi> mentioned, which was alone to be
accomplished by an effectuall removing away the solicitious fears and cares
about the preservation of them, in whose behalfe this is produced. This
therefore the Apostle doth by an exception to the inference, which they
made, or through temptation might make upon the former considerations.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are exceptive particles, and an <hi>Induction</hi> into the exemption of some
from the condition of being in danger of falling, wherein they were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the <hi>Objection</hi> proposed. The intendment I say of the Apostle in that
exceptive plea he puts in, <hi>neverthelesse</hi> is evidently to exempt some from
the state of falling away, which might be argued against them from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of others. Neither doth he speake to the thing in hand, nor are the
particulars mentioned <hi>exceptive</hi> to the former Intimation, if his speech looke
any other way. Moreover he gives yet further the account of this Exception
he makes, including a radicall discrimination of professours, or men <hi>esteemed</hi>
to be Believers, expressing also the Principle and ground of that difference.
The differing Principle he mentioneth is, <hi>the Foundation of God that stands sure,</hi>
or the <hi>firme Foundation</hi> of God, that is established, or stands firme: This is not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59070:66"/>
worth contending about. An Expression parallell to that of the same Apostle
<hi>Rom. 9. 11. That the Purpose of God according to Election might stand;</hi> Both this
and that hold out some Eternall Act of God, differencing betweene persons,
as to their Everlasting condition. As if the Apostle had said, you see indeed
that <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> are fallen away, and that others, with whom you
sometimes walked in the Communion and outward fellowship of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
and <hi>tooke sweet Counsell together</hi> in the House of God with them, are
gone after them; yet be you (true Believers) of good Comfort: God hath
<hi>layd a Foundation</hi> (which must be some Eternall Act of his, concerning them
of whom he is about to speake: or the solemne Assertion of the Apostle, then
which you shall not easily meet with one more weighty, is neither to the
Case, nor matter in hand) which is <hi>firme</hi> and abiding, (being the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his <hi>Will,</hi> accompanied with an Act of his <hi>Wisdome</hi> and Understanding)
appointing some (as is the case of all True Believers) to be his, who shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
on that account, from the Apostasie and desertion, that you feare.
This, saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> is the fountaine and spring of the difference, which is
among them that professe the Gospell. Concerning <hi>some</hi> of them, is the
Purpose of God for their preservation: <hi>They are ordained to Eternall Life.</hi> And
herein (as was said) lyes the Concernement of all that are True Believers,
who are all his, chosen of him, given to his Sonne, and Called according to
his Purpose; with others tis not so, they are not built on that bottome, they
have no such foundation of their Profession; and it is not therefore marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
if they fall.</p>
            <p>The words then containe an Exception of True Believers from the danger
of totall Apostasie,<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> upon the account of the stable, fixed, Eternall Purpose of
God concerning their Salvation, answerable to that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30. the
place last considered. The <hi>Foundation</hi> here mentioned, is the <hi>good Pleasure</hi> of
the Will of God, which he had <hi>Purposed in him himselse,</hi> or determined to exert
towards them, for the praise of the Glory of his Grace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 9. According to
which Purpose we are <hi>Predestinated. v.</hi> 11. And he calls this <hi>Purpose</hi> the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of God,</hi> as being a <hi>groundworke,</hi> and bottome of the thing, whereof the
Apostle is treating; namely the Preservation and <hi>Perseverance</hi> of True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
those who are indeed planted into Christ, notwithstanding the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of the most Glorious Professours, who being not within the compasse of
that <hi>Purpose,</hi> nor built on that <hi>Foundation,</hi> never attaine that peculiar Grace,
which by Jesus Christ is to them administred, who have that Priviledge. And
this further appeares by the Confirmation of the certainty of this <hi>Foundation
of God,</hi> which he hath layd, manifested in the next words: <hi>It hath this seale,
the Lord knowes who are his.</hi> Whether ye will take this for a Demonstration of
the former Assertion, either <hi>a posteriori,</hi> from the peculiar Love, Favour, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
and care, which the Lord beares to <hi>them which are his,</hi> who are built
on the Foundation mentioned, whereby, in the pursuit of his Eternall Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he will certainely preserve them from perishing, <hi>knowing, owning, and
taking care of them in every Condition:</hi> or for the <hi>Prescience</hi> of God, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
his Eternall Purpose, <hi>designing</hi> them of whom he speakes, as <hi>his,</hi> (for <hi>his</hi>
they were, and he gave them unto Christ) is to me indifferent. Evident it is
that this Confirmation of the Purpose mentioned, is added to assure us of the
stability and accomplishment of it; in that none, who are built thereon, or
concerned therein, shall fall away. And herein doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> fully Answer
and remove the fore-mentioned Objection: Let men (saith he) appeare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so eminent in profession, If once they proove <hi>Apostates,</hi> they manifest
themselves to have been but <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> that is, such as never had any of the
<hi>Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> which is their <hi>peculiar,</hi> who are <hi>Ordained to Eternall Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59070:66"/>
This then, beyond all colourable Exception, is the intendment of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in the words under consideration; Though many Professors fall away,
yet you, that are true Believers, be not shaken in your confidence, for God
hath laid the foundation of your preservation in his <hi>Eternall Purpose,</hi> whereby
you are designed to Life and Salvation, and by the fruits whereof, you are
discriminated from the best of them, that fall away: only continue in the use
of meanes, <hi>let every one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ec depart from iniquity,</hi> and keepe up to that <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Holinesse,</hi> whereunto also ye are appointed and chosen. And this is the
<hi>whole</hi> of what we desire Demonstration of: neither will <hi>lesse</hi> in any measure,
answer the Objection, or remove the Scruple, at first proposed.</p>
            <p>But it seems,<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> we are all this while besides the intendment of the Apostle,
whose Resolution of the <hi>Objection</hi> mentioned, is quite of another nature, then
what we have hitherto insisted on; which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> thus represents: pag.
359. Cap. 14. Sect. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this Objection or Scruple, the Apostle (in the words now in hand) Answereth,
to this effect; that notwithstanding the falling away of men, who ever, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
soever they be, yet the Glorious Gospell, and Truth of God therein, stands and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
hath stood, firme and stedfast. Which Gospell hath the matter and substance
of this saying in it, as a seale for the establishment of those, who are upright in the
sight of God,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord knoweth, that is, takes speciall notice of, approoveth, and delighteth in
those that are his, that is, who truly Believe in him, love and serve him: yea and
farther hath this Item, tending to the same end; Let every one that calleth upon the
name of Christ, that is, makes profession of his name, depart from iniquity: so that
in this Answer to the Scruple mentioned, the Apostle intimateth by way of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that the reason, why men fall away from the Faith, is partly because they
doe not consider, what worthy respects God beareth to those, who cleave to him in
Faith, and Love: partly also because they degenerate into loose and sinfull courses,
contrary to the Law imposed by the Gospell, and consequently, that there is no such
danger of their falling away, who shall duly consider the one, and observe the other,
inserting the stability of the Truth of God, in the Gospell, by the way of Antidote
against the feares of those, that might possibly suspect it, because of the defections
of others from it: he doth but tread in his own foot steps, else where in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if we Believe not, yet he abideth faithfull, and cannot deny himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If that <hi>necessity</hi> were not <hi>voluntarily</hi> chosen, which inforceth men to
wrest and pervert the Word of God, not only to <hi>Mistaken,</hi> but strange, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth,
and inconsistent sences, their so doing might perhaps seeme not to be
altogether without colour and pretext: but when they willingly imbrace
those paths, which will undoubtedly lead them into the Briers, and contrary
to abundance of Light, and Evidence of Truth imbrace those perswasions,
which necessitate them to such courses, I know not what Cloake they have
left for their deviations. An Example of this we have before us in the words
recited: A <hi>sence</hi> is violently pinned upon the Apostles words, not only
alien, forraigne to the scope of the place, and Genuine signification of the
words themselves, but wholy unsuited for any serviceablenesse to the end, for
which the Author of this Glosse himselfe, confesseth these Expressions of the
Apostle, to be produced, and used.</p>
            <p>The summe of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Exposition of this place, is this. The <hi>Foundation</hi>
of God, is the <hi>Gospell</hi> or the Doctrine of it: its <hi>standing,</hi> or <hi>standing sure,</hi> the
certaine truth of the Gospell: the <hi>Seale</hi> mentioned, is the substance or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that saying, <hi>God knowes who are his,</hi> conteined in the Gospell; and the
Answer to the Objection or scruple, lyes in this, that the reason why men
fall from the Gospell, (which neither is, nor was the scruple, nor was it so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59070:67"/>
proposed by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>) is, because they <hi>consider not the Love that God bears
to Believers,</hi> that is, that he approoves them, whilst they are such; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
one maine part of the Gospell. So that men fall from the Gospell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they fall from the Gospell, and this must satisfie the scruple proposed.
It is an easy thing for men of Ability and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> to gild over the most
absurd and inconsistent Interpretation of Scripture, with some appearance
of significancy: though I must needs say, I know not lightly, when, nor by
whom, pretending to any sobriety, it hath been more unhappily, or <hi>unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully</hi>
attempted, them by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in this place, as upon due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
will be made further appeare. For,</p>
            <p>1. First, to grant that the <hi>Foundation</hi> of God may be said so far to be the
Gospell because his Eternall Purpose, so expressed, is therein revealed which
is the interpretation Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> proposeth; I aske</p>
            <p>1. Whether the Apostle applyes himselfe to remove the Scruple ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the minds of Believers, about their owne falling away, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Apostasie of others, and to answer the Objection arising
thereupon? This Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> grants in the <hi>Head,</hi> though in the <hi>Branches</hi> of
his Discourse, he casts in inquiries quite of another nature; as, that a Reason
is inquired after, why men fall from the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and a suspicion is supposed
to arise of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Gospell, because some fell from it: Things that
have not the least intimation in the words, or Context of the place, nor of
any such evidence for their interest in the businesse in hand, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
durst take them for ingredients in the case under consideration, when <hi>he
himselfe</hi> proposed it; so that he was inforced to foyst in this <hi>counterfeit Case,</hi>
to give some colour to the Interpretation of the words, introduced. But
yet this must not be openly owned, but intermixed with other Discourses,
to lead aside the Understanding of the Reader from bearing in minde the
true State of the Case by the Apostle proposed, and by himselfe ackowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
So that this Discourse <hi>desinit in piscem &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Case being</hi> supposed as above,<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> I aske, whither the Apostle inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Removeall of the <hi>Scruple,</hi> and Answer to the <hi>Objection,</hi> as far at least,
as the one was capable of being removed, and the other of being answered?
This (I suppose) will not be Scrupled, or Objected against, being indeed fully
granted in Stating the Occasion of the words. For wee must at least allow
the Holy Ghost to speake pertinently to what he doth propose; then,</p>
            <p>3. I further inquire, whither any thing what ever be in the least suited
to the Removeall of the <hi>Scruple</hi> and <hi>Objection</hi> proposed, but only the giving
of the <hi>Scruplers</hi> and <hi>Objectors,</hi> the best <hi>Assurance,</hi> that upon solid Grounds
and Foundations could be given, or they were in truth capeable of, that
what they feared should not come upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that, notwithstanding the
deviation of others, themselves should be preserved; and then</p>
            <p>4. Seeing that the summe of the sence of the words given by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
amounts to these two Assertions; 1. <hi>That the Doctrine of the Gospell is True
and Permanent; 2. That God approoves for the present all, who for the present
believe,</hi> supposing that there is nothing in the Gospell, teaching the <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Saints:</hi> I aske yet, whither there be any thing in this Answer of the
Apostle, (so interpreted) able to give the least satisfaction imaginable to the
Consciences, and Hearts of men making the Objection mentioned? For is
it not evident notwithstanding any thing here expressed, that they, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Believer in the world may <hi>Apostatise,</hi> and fall away into Hell? Say the
poore Believers, Such, and such fall away from the Faith: Their eminent
usefulnesse in their Profession, beyond perhaps what we are able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
of our selves, makes us feare, that this <hi>abominable defection</hi> may goe on;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59070:67"/>
&amp; swallow us up, &amp; grow upon the Church to a further desolation. The answer
is: however the Gospel is true, &amp; God bears gracious respects to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cleave
to him in love, whilst they doe so. <hi>Quaestio est de alliis, responsio de cepis.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the Apostle might have put them upon these <hi>Considerations,</hi> which Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> proposes, as of excellent use &amp; prevalency against falling away, that
they put men out of danger of it, (<hi>Cap.</hi> 9.) rather then have given them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not (in the least) tending to their satisfaction, nor any way suited to their
fears, or inquiries; no not as backed with that explanation, that they <hi>fall away
because they degenerate into loose, and sinfull courses;</hi> that is, because they fall
away. A degeneracy into loose and sinfull courses amounts surely to no
lesse.</p>
            <p>5. Againe; I would know, whether this Foundation of God be an Act of
his Will <hi>commanding,</hi> or <hi>purposing?</hi> declarative of our duty, or his intention?
If the first, then what Occasion is administred to make mention of it in this
place? Whether it were called in Question, or no? and whether the Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it conduces to the solution of the Objection proposed? Or is it in any
parallell termes expressed in any other place? Besides, seeing this <hi>Foundation
of God</hi> is in nature <hi>antecedent</hi> to the <hi>Sealing</hi> mentioned, of Gods <hi>knowing them
that are his,</hi> and the Object of the Act of Gods Will, be it what it will, being
the Persons, concerning whom that Sealing is; whether it can be any thing, but
some <hi>distinguishing Purpose</hi> of God concerning those persons, in reference to
the things spoken of? Evident then it is, from the <hi>words themselves,</hi> the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
of them, the <hi>designe,</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of the Apostle in the place, that the
Foundation of God here mentioned, is his discriminating Purpose concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some mens certain preservation unto Salvation, which is manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by that Seale of his, <hi>that he knowes them,</hi> in a peculiar distinguishing
manner; A manner of speech and Expression suited directly to what the
same Apostle useth in the same case every where, as <hi>Rom. 8. 28, 29, 30. Cap.</hi> 9.
and 11. 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>But, (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>) this is no more, then what the Apostle elsewhere
speakes, <hi>Rom: 3. 3. What if some did not believe, shall their unbeliefe make the
Faith of God of none effect?</hi> that is, <hi>shall the Vnbeliefe of men be interpreted as
any tolerable Argument, or ground, to prove that God is unfaithfull? or that he
hath no other Faith in him, then that which sometimes miscarrieth, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
not that, for which it stands ingaged? Implying that such an interpretation as
this, is unreasonable in the highest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But truly by the way, if it be so, I know not who in the <hi>lowest</hi> can quit Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> from unreasonablenesse in the <hi>highest:</hi> for doth he not contend in
this whole Discourse, that the <hi>Faith of God in his Promises,</hi> for the producing
of that, for which it stands ingaged (as when he saith to Believers, he will <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave them, nor for sake them</hi>) doth so depend on the <hi>Faith</hi> of men, as to
the Event intended, that it is very frequently by their unbeliefe, rendred of
none Effect? Is not this the spirit, that animates the whole Religion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy
of Saints? Is it not the great Contest between us, whether any unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of men may interpose to render the Faith of God of none effect, as to
the producing of the thing he promiseth? <hi>Tibi, quia intristi, exedondum
est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (2.) Let it be granted, that these two places of the Apostle are of a
parallell signification, what will it advantage the Interpretation imposed on
us? What is the <hi>Faith of God</hi> here intended? And what the unbeliefe mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
And whereunto tends the Apostles vehement interrogation? The great
contest in this Epistle concerning the Jewes, (of whom he peculiarly speaks,
v. 1, 2.) was about the Promise of God made to them, and his <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59070:68"/>
therein. Evident it was, that many of them did not Believe the Gospell; as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the Promise of God was made peculiarly to them, to <hi>Abraham</hi>
and his Seed: hence no small peplexity arose, about the Reconciliation of
these things; many perplexed thoughts ensuing on this seeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If the Gospell be indeed the way of God, what is become of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in his promises to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, they rejecting it? If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
be true and stable, what shall we say to the Doctrine of the Gospell,
which they generally disbelieve and reject? In this place the Apostle only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the inference, that the faithfulnesse of God must fall, and be of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
because the Jewes beleived not; whereof he gives a full account after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when he expresly, takes up the objection, and handles it at large,
<hi>Cap.</hi> 9, 10, 11. The summe of the Answer he there gives, as a Defensative of the
faithfullnesse of God, with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to the Infidelity of some of the Jewes,
amounts to no more, nor lesse, then what is here argued &amp; by us asserted, <hi>viz.</hi>
that notwithstanding this (their incredulity and Rejection of the Gospell)
the <hi>Foundation of God standeth sure; God knoweth who are his:</hi> that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
his Faithfullnesse wherein, (came under Debate,) was not made to all
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but to them that were Chosen according to his Purpose, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
disputes it at large beyond all possibility of Contradiction <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. As
shall afterwards be further argued, and hath in part been already discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
I verily believe never did any man produce a Testimony more to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of his owne cause both in generall, and in particular, then this
is to the Cause Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath in hand.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he advance one step further in the confirmation of the sence
imposed on the Apostles words,<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> by comparing them with the words of the
same Apostle <hi>v.</hi> 13. of the same Chapter, <hi>If we Believe not, yet he continues
Faithfull, he cannot deny himself:</hi> wherein againe, contrary to the whole drift
of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Discourse, the Faithfullnesse of God, in the Accomplishment
of his Promises, is asserted to be wholy independent upon any Qualification
whatever, in them, to whom those Promises are made. Though we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sufferings, Temptations, and Tryalls, very apt to be cast downe from
our Hope of the great Things that God hath <hi>prepared</hi> for us, and <hi>Promised</hi> to
us, yet his Purpose shall stand however, and our uubeliefe shall not in the least
cause him to withdraw, or not to goe through with his ingagement to the
utmost: The faithfullnesse of his owne nature requireth it at his hand: <hi>He
cannot deny himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What remaines <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> Wherein he labours further to give strength <hi>unto,</hi> or
rather more largely to Explicate what he formerly asserted, is built upon a
<hi>criticall</hi> Consideration of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which (without any one example
produced from any approoved Author,) we must believe to signifie a <hi>bond,</hi>
or <hi>instrument of security given between men by the way of Contract.</hi> And what
then, suppose it doe? Why then contrary to the whole scope of the place,
and constant signification of the word in the Scripture, it must be interpreted
according to the Analogy of that sence. Why so? Doth it remove any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
on the other hand? Doth it more suite the Objection for its removeall,
whereunto it is given, that we should warpe from the first, Genuine, Native
usuall signification of the word, to that which is <hi>Exotick</hi> and <hi>Metaphoricall?</hi>
Yea but we are enforced to embrace this sence, because that <hi>here is a seale set
to this Foundation, and men use not to set Seales to the foundation of a House.</hi>
And is it required that Allusions should hold in all prticulars and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
even in such as wherein their teaching property doth not consist?
The tearmes of <hi>Foundation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sealing</hi> are both figurative: neither will either
of them absolutely be squared to those things in <hi>Nature,</hi> wherein they have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59070:68"/>
their Foundation. The Purpose of God is here called his <hi>Foundation,</hi> because
of its <hi>Stability, Abidingnesse, Strength, and Vse</hi> in bearing up the whole Fabricke
of the Salvation of Believers, not in respect of its lying in, or under the
Ground, or being made of wood, or stone. And in this sence why may it not
be said to be Sealed. Spirituall Sealing holds out two things: Confirmation,
and Conforming by impression: and in them consist the cheife <hi>politicall</hi> use
of the Word, and thing, not in being a Labell annexed to a writing. And
why may not a Purpose be confirmed, or be manifested to be firme, as well
as a Contract, or Instrument in Law? Having also its <hi>conforming</hi> virtue and
Efficacy (which is the <hi>naturall</hi> effect of Sealing) to implant the Image in the
<hi>Seale,</hi> on the things impressed with it, in rendering them, concerning whom
the Purpose of God is, answerable to the Image of his Sonne (in whom the
Purpose is made) and that patterne which he hath Chosen them to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them for. What followeth to the end of this Section, is but a <hi>new
expression</hi> of what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> pretends to be the sence of this place. The
<hi>Foundation</hi> of God is the Gospell, or the Promise of God to save Believers:
the <hi>Seale</hi> is his taking notice of them to save them, and to condemne them
that Believe not: and therefore questionlesse Believers need not feare that
they shall <hi>fall away,</hi> though there be not the least intimation made of any
thing, that should give them the least comfortable or chearing security of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in Believing: only 'tis said, <hi>he that believeth shall be saved,</hi> (which yet
is not an absolute Promise of Salvation to Believers) <hi>and he that believeth
not shall be damned:</hi> which one disjunctive Proposition declarative of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
that is between the Means and the End, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> labours to make
comprehensive of all the Purposes of God concerning Believers, it being such
as wherein no one person in the world, is more concerned then another. If
the <hi>Foundation</hi> here mentioned be only God's Purpose, (or rather declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
of his Will for the Saving of Believers, and the Damning of Unbelievers,
what Consolation could be from hence administred in particular unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
laboring under the Scruple mentioned formerly, hath not as yet been
declared. Let us then proceed to further proofe of the Truth in hand,
and the vindication of some other places of Scripture whereby it is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>That which I shall next fix upon,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> is that eminent place of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37, 38,
39, 40. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me, and him that cometh to
me, I will in no wise cast out: for I came downe from Heaven, not to doe mine own
will, but the will of him that sent me; and this is the Fathers will which hath sent
me, that of all which he hath given me, I should loose nothing, but should raise it
up againe at the last day, and this is the will of him that sent mee, that every one
which seeth the Sonne, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life, and I will
raise him up at the last day.</hi> Our Saviour acquaints us with the designe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he came from heaven; it was <hi>not to doe his owne will,</hi> that is, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,
or bring about, any <hi>private</hi> purposes of his owne, distinct or different
from them of his Father, as he was Blaspheamously charged by the <hi>Jewes</hi> to
doe: but he came to doe the will of God, <hi>the Will of him that sent him.</hi> The
<hi>Will of God,</hi> which Christ came to fulfill, is sometimes taken for the <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,</hi>
which he received from the Father, for the Accomplishment of his
Will. So <hi>Heb. 10. 9. I come to doe thy Will O God:</hi> that is, to fulfill thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
as it is expressed, <hi>Psa. 40. 8. Thy Law is written in my heart;</hi> Thy Law!
all that thou requirest at my hand, as Mediator, I am ready to performe On
this account is Christ said to take on him the <hi>forme of a Servant. Phil.</hi> 2. 7. that
is, to become so indeed in the assumption of his Humane nature, that he might
doe the Will of him that sent him. For which Reason also his Father expresly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59070:69"/>
calls him his <hi>Servant Isa. 42. 1. Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in
whom my soule delighteth, I have put my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Gentiles;</hi> He is the <hi>Servant</hi> of the Father, in the Accomplishment
of that work, for which the spirit was put upon him; and <hi>v. 19. Who is blind
but my servant, or deafe as my messenger that I sent, who is blind as he that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and blind as the Lords servant.</hi> God gives him in command to fulfill his
will, which accordingly he performes to the utmost. Againe, the Will of God
is taken for his <hi>Purpose,</hi> his designe, decree, and good pleasure, for the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Accomplishment whereof, the Lord Christ came into the world: and
this appears to be the sence and importance of the Word in this place, from
the distinction which is put between the <hi>will of the Father,</hi> and any such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Will of Christ, as the Jewes thought he went about to establish; it was
some designe of his own, in opposition whereunto, he tells them, that he
came to doe the <hi>Will,</hi> that is to fulfill the <hi>Councell,</hi> Purpose, and Designe of
the Father. However, should it Principally be taken for the <hi>Command</hi> of God,
yet there is, and must needs be, an universall coincidence and onenesse in the
object of Gods Purposing, and Commanding Will in all commands given
unto Christ: because all of them shall certainely and infallibly, by him
be fulfilled, and so the thing certainely accomplished, which is commanded.
What now is this <hi>Will,</hi> Purpose, Ayme, Designe, and Command of the
Father whose Execution &amp; Accomplishment is committed to the Lord Christ,
and which he faithfully undertakes to performe, (as he was faithfull in all
things to him that appointed him) for the clearing of this let these two
things be observed. 1. Who the Persons are concerning whom this <hi>Will</hi> of
God is: and those he describes by a double <hi>Character.</hi> 1. From their <hi>Election</hi>
the Fathers giving them to him; <hi>all which he hath given me,</hi> that is, all his
<hi>Elect,</hi> as our Saviour expounds this very expression <hi>John 17. 16. Thine they
were and thou gavest them to me:</hi> Thine they were in Eternall designation,
thou having <hi>Chosen them from the Foundation of the World,</hi> and thou gavest
them to me, for actuall Redemption, to deliver them from every thing that
keepes them at distance from thee. 2. From their <hi>Faith</hi> or Believing, which
he calles, <hi>seeing the Sonne and Believing on him v.</hi> 40. The persons then here
designed, are Elect Belivers, Persons <hi>Chosen,</hi> and <hi>Called</hi> of God. What next
then is the Will of God, concerning them? This also is set out both in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and in some pariicuars; (1.) In <hi>Generall, that none of them be lost:</hi> that
by no meanes whatsoever, by no Temptation of Sathan, Deceits of sinne,
Fury of oppressiours, Weakenesse or decay of Faith, they perish and fall away
from him. This is the Will, the designe and Purpose of God; this he gives
to Jesus Christ in command for to accomplish. (2.) In particular, 1. That
they might have <hi>Eternall Life, v.</hi> 40. That they be preserved to the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Glory whereunto they are designed, 2. That they may be
<hi>raised up at the last Day,</hi> &amp; so never be lost, neither as to their being, nor well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
of these two, <hi>v. 40. Everlasting Life,</hi> is placed before the <hi>Resurrection or
raising of Believers at the last Day,</hi> plainely intimating, that the <hi>Spirituall
Life</hi> whereof in this world they are partakers, is also as to its certaine unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruptible
continuance, an <hi>Everlasting Life,</hi> that shall never be intercepted
or cut off; That then which from this Portion of Scripture I Argue is this.
God having Purposed to give <hi>Eternall Life</hi> to his Elect Believers, and that
none of them should ever be lost, and having committed the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and perfomance of this his Goodwill and Pleasure unto the Lord Jesus,
who was Faithfull unto him in all things, and indued with Power, (<hi>all
Power from above</hi>) for that end, they shall certainely be Preserved to the
end designed. The favour and Love of God, in Christ, shall never
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59070:69"/>
be turned away from them, for his <hi>Counsell shall stand and he will doe all his
Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some thing is by M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> offered to take off the strength of this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
but yet so <hi>little,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 45.</note> that had I not resolved to heare him out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
what he can say in, and unto the case in hand, it would scarse be
thought needfull, to divert to the consideration of it; This place of Scripture
he binds up in one bundle, with <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>tenne</hi> others, to the composure of one
Argument which (almost <hi>uno Halitu</hi>) he blowes away <hi>Cap. 11. Sect. 36, 37. &amp;c.
Pag. 251, 252 &amp;c.</hi> To the consideration of the Argument it selfe there by him
proposed, I am not yet arrived; the influence of this Text into it, is from
what is said of Christs Preserving Believers: my present Consideration is
cheiflly of the will and Intention of the Fathers giving them to him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:
so that I shall observe only one or two things to his <hi>Generall</hi> Answer,
and then proceed to the vindication of this <hi>Particular</hi> place we have in
hand.</p>
            <p>1. First he tels you, <hi>That the Conclusion of the former Argument, that true
Believers shall never miscarry or fall away, opposeth not his sence in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy;</hi>
whether it oppose his sence or no, must be judged, this I know, that he
hath to his utmost opposed it all this while, shewing himselfe therein very
uncurteous &amp; unkind, but why so, on what account is it, that this conclusion
which hath so much opposed, is now conceited not to oppose him? <hi>Those who
thus fall away</hi> (saith he) <hi>are noe true Believers but wicked Apostates, at the time
of their falling away.</hi> That the conclusion mentioned opposeth his sence to me
is evident; but that it is <hi>sence</hi> wherewith in this place he opposeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
is not so cleare. The Question is who fall away; not Believers but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates
faith Mr G. We say so too, in the naturall first sence of those words
who <hi>eventualitèr</hi> are Apostates, were never <hi>antecedentèr</hi> (to their Apostasie)
True Believers. But this is not your sence doubtlesse; That those who fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
in their falling away (which is the sence of that clause, <hi>at the time of
falling away</hi>) were Apostats, that is, were fallen away, before they fell away,
is neither our sence nor yours, for it is none at all. <hi>Bertius,</hi> hath one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> from the impossibility of finding a
subject to be affected with the notion of Apostasie, if true Believers be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: for Hypocrites, saith he, cannot fall away; nor can Believers saith Mr
<hi>Goodwin,</hi> but they are Apostates when they fall away; that is, it is a dead man
that dyes; or after he is dead, he dyes: after he is an Apostate he falls away.
Perhaps it would be worth our serious inquiry, to consider how Believers can
indeed possibly come to loose the Spirit of Grace which dwells in them, with
their habit of Faith and Holinesse. For our parts we contend that they have
an infussed Habit of Grace, and that wrought with a mighty Impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Minds and Hearts, (Faith being of the <hi>opperation of God,</hi> wrought by
the exceding <hi>greatnesse of his Power</hi> as he wrought in Christ when he Raised
him from the dead) Whether such an Habit can be removed, but by that
hand that bestowed it, and whether it may be made appeare, that God will
on any occasion so take it away, or hath expressed himselfe that he will so
deale with any of his Children, is I say, worthy our inquiry: But</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, he denies the Major Proposition, and saith, that, <hi>those who
are kept and preserved by Christ, may possibly miscarry;</hi> Boldly ventured! what
Want is there then, or defect in the <hi>keeper of Israel,</hi> that his flock should so
miscarry under his hand? Is it of Faithfulnesse? The Scripture tells us, he is
<hi>a faithfull High-Priest in things pertaining to God</hi> Heb. 2. 17. <hi>Faithfull to him
that appointed him, Heb.</hi> 3. 2. And that he did the whole will of God. Is it of
<hi>Tendernesse,</hi> to take care of his poore wandering ones? He is otherwise repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59070:70"/>
unto us, <hi>Heb. 2. 18. For in that he himselfe hath suffered, being tempted,
he is able to succour them, that are tempted, and</hi> (ch. 4. 15, 16.) <hi>We have not an
High-Priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was
in all poynts tempted like unto us, yet without sinne.</hi> Isa. 40. 11, 12. It is said of
him, <hi>he shall feed his flock like a sheapheard, he gathers the Lambs with his Armes,
and carries them in his bosome, and shall gently lead them that are with young.</hi>
And he quarrells with those sheapheards, who manifest not a care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
like his, towards his flock. <hi>Ezec: 34. 4 The diseased have ye not strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
neither have yee healed that which was sicke, neither have yee bound up that
which was broken, neither have yee brought againe that which was driven away,
neither have ye sought that which was lost,</hi> all which he takes upon himselfe to
performe. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. Or is it want of Power? <hi>All Power is given to him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth. Mat. 28. 8. All things are delivered to him of his Father. Mat.</hi> 11.
27. <hi>He is able to save to the utmost them, that come to God by him. Heb.</hi> 7. 25. If
he wants neither Care, nor Tendernesse, Wisdome, nor Watchfullnesse,
Love, nor Ability, Will, nor Faithfullnesse, how comes it to passe that <hi>they</hi>
miscarry, and fall away into ruine, whom he hath undertaken to keepe?
<hi>David</hi> durst fight with a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and a <hi>Beare</hi> in the defence of his <hi>Lambs;</hi> and
<hi>Jacob</hi> indured Heat and Cold, upon the account of Faithfullnesse: And shall
we think that the Shepheard of <hi>Israel,</hi> from whose being so, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
he <hi>shall want nothing, (Psa</hi> 23. 1.) who did not only fight for his Flock,
but layed downe his Life for them, will be lesse carefull of his Fathers Sheepe,
his owne Sheepe, which are required also at his hand, for his Father knowes
them, and calles them all by name?</p>
            <p>Yea but (saies Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>) it may be <hi>thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 46.</note> 
               <hi>in case themselves shall not comport
with Christ in his Act of Preserving them, with their care and diligence in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themselves.</hi> that is, Christ will surely keepe them, in case they keepe
themselves. Alas! poore Sheepe of God! If this were the case of the Flocks
of the Sonnes of men, how quickly would they be utterly destroyed? Doth
the veriest <hi>Hierling</hi> in the World deale thus with his Sheepe? keepe them, in
case they keepe them selves? Nay to what end is his keeping, if they keepe
themselves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Christ compares himselfe to the Good Shepheard, which seeketh
out, and fetcheth a wandring Sheepe from the Wildernesse, laying him on his
shoulders, and bringing it home to his Fold. How did that poore Sheepe
keep it selfe when it ranne among the Ravenous Wolves in the Wildernesse?
Yet by the Good Shepheard it was preserved; This is the Spirit, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Genius</hi> of this Doctrine. Christ keeps us, provided we keepe our selves.
We hoped <hi>it had been he who Saved Israel:</hi> that he gave us his holy Spirit to
<hi>abide</hi> with ns for ever, to <hi>Seale</hi> us up to the day of Redemption: that knowing
himselfe, and telling us, that without him <hi>we can doe nothing,</hi> he would not
suspend <hi>his doing,</hi> upon <hi>our doing</hi> so great a thing, as preserving our selves?
For let us see now, what it is, that is required in us, if we shall be preserved by
Christ: it is to <hi>comport with him in his Act of Persevering us, and to be diligent to
keepe our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is this, <hi>comporting with him</hi> in his Act of preserving us? Our <hi>comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
with Christ in any thing, is by our Believing in him, and on him: that's our
radicall Comportment, whence all other closings of Heart in obedience doe
flow; so then, Christ will preserve us in Believing, provided we continue to
Believe. But what need of his help to doe so, if antecedently thereunto so we
doe? Is not this not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but also <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not only Unscripturall, but
also Unreasonable, yea absurd and Ludicrous: This is the <hi>flinty Fountain</hi> of
all that Abundance of Consolation, which Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> doctrine doth afford.
Doubtlesse they must be Wise and Learned men (like himselfe) who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59070:70"/>
any such thing therefrom; Let him goe with it to a poore weake temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fainting Believer, and try what a Comforter he will be thought, a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
of what value he will be esteemed. Let him tell him, thou art indeed
weake in Faith, ready to decay and perish, which thou maist doe, every day,
there being neither Purpose nor Promise of God to the contrary; great Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and great Temptations hast thou to wrestle withall, but yet Christ is
loving, tender, faithfull, and in case thou continuest Believing, he will take
care thou shalt believe: That Christ will increase thy Faith, and keep it alive
by continuall influences, as from a Head into its Members, preserving thee
not only against outward Enimies, but the treacheries and deceits, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of thine own heart, of any such thing I can give thee no account. Such
Consolation a poore man may have at home at any time.</p>
            <p>Further;<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> what is that Act of Christ in Preserving them that is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
withall?<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> Wherein doth it consist?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> Is it not in his dayly continuall

What is it then to <hi>comport</hi> with this Act,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 17, 18, 19.</note> or these Acts of Chist? Can any
thing reasonable be invented,<note place="margin">2. 19.</note> wherein such comportment may be thought
to consist, but either it will be found coincident with that, whereof it is a
Condition, or appeare to be such as will crush the whole undertaking of
Christ for the Preservation of Believers into vanity and nothing? Againe, hath
Christ undertaken to Preserve us against all our Enemies,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 15.</note> or some only? If
some only, give us an Account both of them, that he doth undertake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
that we may know for what to goe to him, whereof to complaine;
and of them, that he doth not so undertake to safegard us against them, that
we may know,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note> wherein to trust to our selves? And let us see the places of
Scripture,<note place="margin">Isai. 30. 1.</note> wherein any Enemies are excepted out of this undertaking of Christ
for the safety of his? <hi>Paul</hi> goes far in an enumeration of particulars <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. If
he hath undertaken against them all, then let us know, whither it be an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that keeps us from this Comportment with Christ, or a Freind? If it be an
Enemy, (as surely every thing in us, that moves us to depart from the living
God is) hath Christ undertaken against it or no? If not, how hath he underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against them all? If he hath, how is it that it prevailes? <hi>Yea but be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
this in case we comport with him;</hi> that is, he undertakes to overcome
such an Enemy, in case there be no such Enemy. In case we be not turned aside
from comporting with him, he will destroy that Enimy that turnes us aside
from comporting with him. <hi>Egregiam verò laudem &amp; spolia ampla.</hi> Or on the
otherside, if our Enemyes prevaile not against us, he hath faithfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
that they shall not prevaile against us.</p>
            <p>Yea but (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin) No Scripture prooves that those, whom Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
must by any compulsory, necessitating Power, use their diligence in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them selves.</hi> And who I pray ever said they did? <hi>Compulsory</hi> Actings of
Grace are your own figment; so are all such <hi>necessitating Acts,</hi> which procceed
any further, then only as to the infallibillity of the Event aymed at. God
doth not compell the Wills of men,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 33.</note> when he workes in them to <hi>will.</hi> Christ
doth not compell men to Care and Dilligence,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 18.</note> when he workes in
them Holy Care and Diligence;<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 5.</note> when the Disciples prayed, <hi>Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Faith,</hi> they did not pray that they might be compelled to
Believe.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 11, 12.</note> Gods working in them, that Believe, according <hi>to the exceeding
greatnesse of his Power, strengthning them with all might, according to his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

any Compulsion or necessitation, inconsistent with the most absolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 8.</note> that a Creature is capable of. He that workes Faith in Believers, can
continue it and increase it in them, without Compulsion. And this is the
summe of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Answer to an Argument that notwithstanding all
which he hath spoken, hath yet strength enough left, to cast his whole buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
downe to the ground. What he further speakes to the particular place,
which gave occasion to this Discourse, may breifely be considered.</p>
            <p>1. He speakes something to <hi>v.</hi> 37. which I insisted not on.<note place="margin">§. 48.</note> As to the purpose

towards them, that we are very apt to hope, and believe, that he will not
loose them any more; but that he will not only not cast them out, but also
according to his Fathers appointment, that he will keep them, and preserve
them in safety, untill he bring them to glory, as is fully asserted <hi>v.</hi> 39, 40. as
hath been declared. Againe Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> tells you, <hi>it is not spoken of loosing
Believers by defection of Faith, but by Death: And to assure Believers of this,
Christ tells them, It is his Fathers Will, that he should raise them up at the last day.
Besides if any be lost by defection from Faith, this cannot be imputed to Christ, who
did his Fathers pleasure to the utmost for their preservation: but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For the perverting of <hi>v.</hi> 37. the beginning of it was left out; and for
the accomplishing of the like designes upon <hi>v.</hi> 39. 40 (which farther clears the
mind and intendment of Christ in the words,) is omitted: He tells you,<note place="margin">Math: 4. 6.</note> that it
is the Will of the Father, that every one that comes to him, that is, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
on him, have <hi>Everlasting life:</hi> What is <hi>Everlasting life</hi> in the Gospell, is
well known from <hi>Ioh:</hi> 17. 3. and unto this <hi>bestowing on them everlasting Life,</hi>
his raising of them at the last Day (as was mentioned) is a necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent:
namely, that they may be brought to the full and compleat fruition
of that life, which here in some measure they are made partakers of. Even in
the words of <hi>v:</hi> 39. that passage (<hi>I should loose nothing</hi>) extends it selfe to the
whole Compasse of our Saviours <hi>Duty,</hi> in reference to his Fathers <hi>Will,</hi> for the
safe-garding of Believers: and is it only death, and the state of dissolution of
Body and Soule, that it is the Will of God that he should deliver them from?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59070:71"/>
and the power of that, that it should not have dominion over them in the
morning? The Apostle tells us that he came to doe <hi>the will of God, whereby
we are sanctified: Heb:</hi> 10. 9, 10. it was the Will of God, that he should <hi>sanctify</hi>
us: and he tells his Father, that he had <hi>kept all his own in the World, Joh:</hi> 17.
which doubtlesse was not his raising them from the dead. If he be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of the Covenant of Grace, if the Promises of God be <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen</hi> in
him, if he be our <hi>Head, Husband,</hi> and <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> our <hi>Advocate</hi> and <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour,</hi>
our <hi>Sheapheard</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> his keeping us from being lost extends it
selfe no lesse effectually to our preservation from utter ruine in this life, then
to our raising at the last day; yea and that exceptive particle (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) includes
this preservation, as well as leads us to the addition of the other Favour and
Priviledge of being raised to Glory at the last day. In a word, this whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is added to make good that Gracious Promise of our Saviour <hi>v: 35. He
that cometh to mee, shall never hunger: and he that Believes on me, shall never
thirst;</hi> which how it can be done by a naked ingagement for the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them that come to him, and abide with him, if many doe, &amp; most of all
them that come to him, <hi>may</hi> depart from him, and fall into everlasting ruine,
needs Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> farther labour and paines to unfold. What is lastly added
concerning Christ's doeing the <hi>utmost of his Fathers Pleasure for their Custody, but
the fault is their own, who fall away,</hi> is the same inconsistent ridiculous Assertion
with that erewhile considered: with this addition, that whereas it is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Pleasure, that they be saved; Christ doth his pleasure to the utmost, and
yet saved they are not. And so much (if not too much) for the vindication of
this Testimony witnessing to the Truth that we have in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat:</hi> 24. 24. comes in the next place to be Considered,<note place="margin">§. 49.</note> (an unquestionable
Evidence to the Truth) and that voluntarily of its own accord, speaking so
plaine to the matter in hand, that it were a sinne against cleare light to refuse
to attend unto it; so farre is it from being compelled to beare the Crosse of
this service, as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> phrases the matter Cap: 10. Sect: 9. Pag: 181, 182,
183. <hi>They shall seduce, if it were possible, the very Elect: hence</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
that the deceiving or seducing of them that Believe is a thing impossible,
which is the drawing of darknesse out of light.</hi> Strange! to me it seemes so
farre from a forced inference, or a strained drawing of a Conclusion, that it is
but the conversion of the termes of the same Identicall supposition. He that
saies, <hi>they shall deceive the very Elect, if it were possible,</hi> so mighty shall be their
prevalency in seducing, seemes to mee (and would, I doubt not, doe so to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
did not their prejudices and ingagements force them to stoppe their
eares, &amp; shut their eyes) to say, that it is <hi>Impossible the Elect should be seduced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let the Place (as it deserves) be more distinctly considered; It is among
them,<note place="margin">§. 50.</note> which I referre to the head of the Purposes of God; and a <hi>Purpose</hi> of
God there is (though not expressed, yet) included in the words: The <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the seduction</hi> of some persons from the Faith, is here Asserted: Whence
doth this Impossibility arise? Not from any thing in themselves, not from
their own carefull Consideration of all the Concernments of their Condition,
the only preservative in such a season, if some (who pretend themselves skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and experienced, yea almost the only Physitians of Soules,) may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
They can never stand upon such sands, against that opposition they
shall be sure to meet withall. Our Saviour therefore intimates, whence the
Impossibility expressed doth flow, in a description of the Persons, of whom it
is affirmed, in reference to the Purpose of God concerning them. They are the
<hi>Elect;</hi> Those whom God hath chosen <hi>before the foundation of the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4. Rom. 9. 12. 11. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that
they should be holy and unblameable before him in love.</hi> His Purpose according to
<hi>Election</hi> must stand firme, and therefore the <hi>Election</hi> it selfe shall <hi>obtaine.</hi> This
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59070:72"/>
then is that, which is here affirmed; God having chosen some, or <hi>Elected</hi> them
to Life, according to the <hi>purpose which he purposed in himselfe,</hi> and faith being
bestowed on them,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 9. Phil. 1. 29.</note> they believing on the account of their being <hi>ordained to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 48.</note> it is impossible they should be seduced, so as to be thrown downe
from that state and Condition of Acceptance with God, (for the substance of
it) wherein they stand.</p>
            <p>Some few Observations will further cleare the minde of the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">§. 51.</note>
and obviate the exceptions that are put in against our receiving the words in
their plaine, proper, obvious signification; Observe then.</p>
            <p>1. Upon the intimation of the Great Power and Prevalency of Seducers,
our Saviour adds this as a matter of greate Consolation to True and Sound
Believers, that notwithstanding all this, all their attempts however advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by force or subtility, yet they shall be preserved: This the whole Context
inforceth us to receive, and our Adversaries to confesse, that at least a great
difficulty of their seduction is intimated. And it arises with no lesse Evidence,
that this difficulty is distinguishing, in respect of the Persons exposed to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction;
that some are Elect, who should be seduced, if it were possible: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
not, that may and shall be prevailed against.</p>
            <p>2. The Bottome of the Consolation in the freedome of the Persons here
spoken of, from falling under the prevailing Power of Seducers, consists in
this, that they are the <hi>Elect</hi> of God; such as in a personall Consideration are
Chosen of God from all Eternity, to be kept and preserved <hi>by his Power to
Salvation,</hi> notwithstanding any Interveniences or Oppositions, which he will
suffer to lye in their way. But (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin) These men, at least before
their Calling, are as lyable to be deceived or seduced as other men: this is their owne
Confession, and Paul saies, that they were somtimes deceived. Titus</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> An Exception doubtlesse unworthy him that makes it, who, had he
not resolved to say all, that ever had been said by any, to the businesse in
hand, would scarcely (I presume) have made use thereof; The seduction of
persons is not opposed to their <hi>Election,</hi> but their <hi>Believing.</hi> Mention is made
of their <hi>Election,</hi> to distinguish them from those other Professors, which should
be seduced: and to discover the Foundation of their stability under their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
but it is of them as <hi>Believers</hi> (in which consideration the Attempts of sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are advanced against them) that he speakes. It is not the seducing of the
<hi>Elect,</hi> as <hi>Elect;</hi> but of <hi>Believers,</hi> who are <hi>Elect,</hi> and because they are Elected,
that is denyed.</p>
            <p>3. That it is a seduction unto a totall and finall departure from Christ
and Faith in him, whose impossibility, in respect of the Election, is here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.
But (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> Cap. 10. Sect. 16. pag. 181.) <hi>This is to presume not
to Argue, or Believe: for there is not the least Ground in the word, whereon to build
such an Interpretation.</hi> But the Truth is, without any presumption or much
labour for proofe, the falsity of this Exception will quickly appeare to
any one that shall but view the Context. It is evidently such a <hi>seduction,</hi> as they
are exposed unto, and fall under, <hi>who indure not unto the end, that they may be
Saved, v.</hi> 13. And they, who are excepted upon the account mentioned, are
opposed to them, who being seduced, and their <hi>Love being made cold,</hi> and
their <hi>Iniquityes abounding,</hi> perish everlastingly. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
            <p>4. It is then a deniall of their being cast out by the power of seducers,
from their state, and condition of Believing, and Acceptation with God,
wherein they stand, that our Saviour here asserts and gives out to their conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
they shall not be seduced, that is, drawne of from that state, wherein
they are, to a state of Unregeneracy, Infidelity, and Enmity to God, so that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59070:72"/>
(as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> observes in the next place) we deny them from hence, not
only to be subject to a <hi>finall,</hi> but also to a <hi>totall</hi> seduction.</p>
            <p>5. We grant, that notwithstanding the security given, which respects the
<hi>state</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of the persons spoken of, yet they may be, and often were
seduced, and drawne aside into wayes that are not right, into errours and
false Doctrines, through the <hi>cunning sleights of men, who lay in wait to deceive,</hi>
but never into such, (as to any abode in them,) which are inconsistent with
the union with their Head, and his Life in them.</p>
            <p>The Errours and wayes whereunto they are, or may be seduced,<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> are either
such, as, though dangerous, yea in their Consequences pernicious, yet have
not such an Aspect upon the Faith of Believers, as to deny a possibility of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
&amp; holding the Head upon other accounts: I doubt not but that men for
a season may <hi>not know,</hi> may <hi>disbelieve,</hi> and deny some fundamentall Articles
of Christian Religion, and yet not be absolutely concluded not to hold the
Head by any sinew, or ligament; to have no influence of life by any other
meanes. Was it not so with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they questioned the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ, and with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who denyed the Resurrection of the
Saints? an abode, I confesse, in either of which Errours would, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of them are manifested, prove pernicious to the Soules of men.
But that they have in themselves such an absolute Repugnancy unto, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
with the Life of Christ, however considered, as that their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for a season, should be immediately <hi>exclusive</hi> thereof, I suppose
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe will not say. In this sence then, we grant that true, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
Justifying Faith may consist with the denyall of some fundamentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Christian Religion, for a season: but that any <hi>True Believer</hi> can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in such an <hi>Heresie,</hi> we deny; he having the Promise of the Spirit <hi>to lead
him into all</hi> necessary <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There are such wayes and things, as in their owne nature have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
with the Life of Christ, as the Abnegation of Christ himselfe: but
this also we affirme to be twofold, or to receive a twofold Consideration:
1. It may be <hi>resolved,</hi> upon Consideration, with the deliberate Consent of the
whole Soule: which we utterly deny, that Believers can, or shall be left unto
for a moment: or that ever any True believer was so. 2. Such as may be
squeezed out of the mouthes of men, by the surprisall of some great, dreadfull,
and horrible Temptation, without any habituall or Cordiall Assent to
any such Abomination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Disaffection to Christ, or resolute Rebellion against
him. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> fell into the Abnegation of Christ, whose Faith yet under
it <hi>did not perish,</hi> if our Saviour was heard in his Prayer for him, having an
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to that very Temptation of his, wherein he was to be tryed, and his fall
under it. In the first sence are those words of our Saviour (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 32.) to be
understood, and not in the latter. Christ was so far from denying <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Father under his Abnegation of him, that he never manifested more
Care and Tendernesse towards any Believer, then towards him in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
And this wholly removes Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Section out of our way,
without troubling of our selves to hold up that distinction of a <hi>finall</hi> deniall
of Christ, and that <hi>not finall;</hi> seeing in all probability he set it up himselfe,
that he might have the honour to cast it downe.</p>
            <p>What followes in Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> from the beginning of <hi>Sect:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 53.</note> 11. <hi>Cap:</hi> 10. to
the end of <hi>Sect:</hi> 17. is little more then a Translation of the <hi>Remonstrants So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,</hi>
in vexing this Text in their <hi>Synodalia,</hi> which he knowes full well
where to find discussed, and removed. For the sake of our English Readers,
I shall not avoid the consideration of it. I affirme then: 1. That the phrase
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here denotes the <hi>Impossibility</hi> of the Event denied. The manner of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59070:73"/>
Speech, Circumstances of the place, with the aime of our Saviour in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
exacting this sence of the words. The words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
It is the constant import of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to designe the Event of the
thing, which by what attends it, is asserted, or denyed so <hi>Gal: 2. 13. Mat: 8.
28. 15. 31. 1 Thess:</hi> 1. 8. Neither is it ever used for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. In the place by some

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is sometimes put
for it, but not on the contrary; and the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though not so used
alwaies, (though sometimes they are, as <hi>Gal:</hi> 4. 15.) do signify at least a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
impossibility, when they referre to the indeavours of men; but relating to
the prediction of an event by God himselfe, they are equivalent to an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Negation of it; That of <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 16. is urged to the contrary. <hi>Paul</hi> hoped
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be at <hi>Jerusalem at the Pentecost. If it be possible, here cannot imply an
impossibility as to the event,</hi> saies Mr G. But are these places parallell? Are all
places, where the same phrase is used, alwaies to be expounded in the same
sence? The termes here, [<hi>if it be possible</hi>] respect not the <hi>futurition</hi> of the
thing, but the uncertainty to <hi>Paul</hi> of its possibility or impossibility; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
(I say) of <hi>Paul</hi> in his conjecture, whether he should get to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
by such a time, or no; of which he was ignorant. Did our Saviour here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
about a thing, whereof he was ignorant whether it would come to
passe, or no? We say not then, that in this place, where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is expressive
of the uncertainty of him, that attempts any thing, of its Event, that it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
an impossibility of it, and so to insinuate <hi>that Paul made all hast to doe
that, which he knew was impossible for him to doe:</hi> but that the words are used
in these two places in distinct sences, according to the inclosure that is made
of them by others: But (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin) to say, that Paul might be Ignorant,
whether his being at Jerusalem by Pentecost, might be possible or no, and that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolved to make tryall of the truth herein to the utmost, is to asperse this great
Apostle with a ridiculous imputation of Ignorance.</hi> And why so I pray you? It
is true; he was a <hi>great Apostle</hi> indeed. But it was no part of his Apostolicall
furnishment, to know in what space of time he might make a Sea-voyage.
Had Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ever been at Sea, he would not have thought it <hi>ridiculous
Ignorance,</hi> for a man to be uncertain, in what space of time he might saile
from <hi>Miletus</hi> to <hi>Ptolemais. Paul</hi> had a short time to finish this voyage in. He
was at <hi>Philippi</hi> at the dayes of <hi>Vnleavened Bread,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 6. thence
he was five daies sailing to <hi>Troas v:</hi> 6. and there he abode <hi>seven daies more:</hi>
it may well be supposed, that it cost him not lesse th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n seven daies more to
come to <hi>Miletus v:</hi> 13, 14, 15. how long he tarried there is uncertaine: Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
however it is, that there was a very small space of time left to get to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
by Pentecost. <hi>Paul</hi> was one that had met, not only with Calmes, and
contrary Windes,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 25.</note> but <hi>Shipwrack</hi> also: so that he might well doubt, whether it
were possible for him to make his voyage in that space of time, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to doe it in; and this surely without the least disparagement to his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
knowledge,</hi> and wisdome. In briefe, when this phrase relates to the
Cares and desires of men, and unto any thing of their Ignorance of the Issue,
it may designe the uncertainty of the event, as in this place and that of <hi>Rom.</hi>
12. 18. But when it poynts at the event it selfe, it peremptorily designes its
accomplishment or not, according to the tendency of the Expression, which
affirmes or denies. Notwithstanding then all Evasions, the simple, direct, and
proper sence of our Saviours words, who is setting forth and aggravating the
prevalency of seducers in evill times by him then foretold, is, that it shall be
such, and so great, as that if it were not impossible upon the account of their
Election, they should prevaile against the <hi>very Elect</hi> themselves. But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59070:73"/>
6. Suppose it be granted, that the words referre to the endeavours of the
seducers in this place, yet they must needs deny their prevalency, as to the
end aimed at: It is asserted, either to be <hi>possible,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 54.</note> that the Elect should be so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
or not. If not, we have what we aime at; If it be <hi>possible,</hi> and so here
asserted, the totall of this Expression of our Saviour will be resolved into a
Conclusion, certainly most remote from his intendment. <hi>If it be possible that
the Elect may be seduced, then shall they be seduced: but it is possible (say our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,)
therefore they shall be seduced.</hi> Neither doth that which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
urgeth <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. out of the <hi>Synodalia</hi> before mentioned pag. 314, 315. at all
prove, that the words denote only a difficulty of the thing aimed at, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the earnest endeavours of seducers: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth indeed intimate their
endeavours, but withall their fruitlesnesse, as to the event. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
(as in the Example of <hi>Paul</hi>) to the thoughts of their minds, but to the
successe foretold by Christ. That <hi>Emphaticall</hi> &amp; <hi>Diacriticall</hi> Expression in the
description of them, against whom their Attempts are, (<hi>even the very Elect</hi>) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
their exemption. And if by <hi>Elect</hi> are meant simply and only Believers
as such, how comes this <hi>Emphaticall</hi> Expression and description of them to
be used, when they alone, and no other can be seduced; for those who
<hi>seeme</hi> to Believe <hi>only,</hi> cannot be said to fall from the Faith, say our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
It is true, the Professors of Christianity adhered of old, under many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
(for the greater part) with eminent Constancy, to their Profession: yet is
not any thing <hi>eminently</hi> herein held out in that saying, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
calls <hi>Proverbial in Galen:</hi> he speaking of the followers of <hi>Moses</hi> the same
as of the followers of <hi>Christ.</hi> What else followes in Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> from the same
Authors, is nothing but the pressing of (I think) one of the most absurd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that ever Learned Men made use of, in any Controversy; and yet
such as it is, wee shall meet with it, over and over, (as we have done often
already) before we arrive at the end of this discourse; and therefore to avoid
tediousnesse I shall not here insist upon it. With its mention it shall be passed
by. It is concerning the uselesnesse of meanes, and Exhortations unto the use
of them, if the End to be attained by them be irrevocably determined, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
those Exhortations are part of the meanes appointed for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the end so designed. I shall not (as I said) in this place insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: One thing only I shall observe in Sect. 17. he grants, <hi>that God is able to
determine the Wills of the Elect to the use of meanes, proper and sufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their being deceived;</hi> by this <hi>determining the Wills of the Elect to the use of
proper meanes,</hi> the Efficacy of <hi>Grace</hi> in and with Believers, to a certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of them to the end, is intended. It is the thing he opposeth, as we are
informed in the next words (<hi>he hath no where declared himselfe willing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to doe it</hi>). That by this one Assertion Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath absolved our
Doctrine from all the absurd Consequences and Guilt of I know not what
Abominations, which in various Criminations he hath charged upon it, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
upon the first view and Consideration. All that we affirme God <hi>to
doe,</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> grants that he <hi>can doe.</hi> Now if God should doe all he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
there would no Absurdity or evill, that is truly so, follow. What he can
doe, that he can Decree to doe: and this is the summe of our Doctrine, which
he hath chosen to oppose. God (wee say) hath Everlastingly Purposed to
give, and doth actually give his Holy Spirit to Believers, to put forth such an
exceeding greatnesse of. Power, as whereby in the use of meanes, they shall
certainely be preserved to Salvation; This God can doe, saies our Author.
This Concession being made by the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> in their <hi>Synodalia,</hi> Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
(I presume) thought it but duty to be as free, as his Predecessors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consented unto it also, although it be an axe laid at the root of almost all
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59070:74"/>
the Arguments he sets up against the Truth, as shall hereafter be farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.</p>
            <p>I draw now to a close of those places,<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> which (among many other omitted)
tender themselves unto the proofe of the stable, unchangeable Purpose of
God, concerning the safe-garding and preservation of Believers in his Love,
and <hi>unto</hi> Salvation. I shall mention one or two more, and close this second
Scripturall Demonstration of the Truth in hand. The first is that eminent
place of <hi>Ephes. 1. 3, 4, 5. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who hath blessed us with all spirituall blessings in heavenly places in Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the World, that we
should be holy, and without blame before him in Love; having Predestinated us
unto the adoption of Children by Jesus Christ to himselfe, according to the good
pleasure of his will:</hi> verse 3. the Apostle summarily blesseth God for all the
spirituall mercies, which in Jesus Christ he blesseth his Saints withall; of all
which <hi>v.</hi> 4. he discovereth the fountaine and spring, which is his free choosing
of them before <hi>the foundation of the World;</hi> That an Eternall Act of the Will of
God is hereby designed, is beyond dispute: and it is that foundation of God,
on which the whole of the building mentioned and pourtraid in the following
verse is laid. All the Grace and Favour of God towards his Saints, in their
Justification, Adoption, and Glory, all the fruits of the Spirit, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
in Faith and Sanctification, flow from this one fountaine: and these the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
describes at large in the verses following. The ayme of God in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
and unchangeable Act of his Will (he tells us) is, that we should be
unblameable before him in Love. Certainly cursed Apostats, backsliders in
Heart, in whom <hi>his soule takes no pleasure,</hi> are very farre from being unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
before God in Love. Those that are within the compasse of this Purpose
of God, must be preserved unto that State and Condition, which God aimes
to bring them unto, by all the fruit and issues of that Purpose of his, which
was pointed at before. A Scripture of the like importance unto that before
named, is 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 13, 14. God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
through Sanctification of the Spirit, and beliefe of the Truth, whereunto he
calls you by our Gospel, to the obtaining of the Glory of the Lord Jesus;</hi> The same
fountaine of all spirituall and eternall mercy, with that mentioned in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, is here also expressed, and that is Gods choosing of us by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Act, or Designing us to the end intended, by a Free, Eternall, Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
Purpose of his Will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The end aimed at by the Lord in that Purpose, is here more
clearely set downe, in a twofold Expression. 1. Of <hi>Salvation</hi> v: 13. <hi>He hath
chosen us to Salvation:</hi> that's the thing which he aimed to accomplish for
them, and the End he intended to bring them to, in his choosing of them, and
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> v: 14. The <hi>Glory of the Lord Jesus:</hi> or the obtaining a portion in that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which Christ purchased and procured for them, with their being with him,
to behold his Glory. And 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> You have the <hi>meanes,</hi> whereby God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bring about, and accomplish this his designe and Purpose, whereof
there are three most eminent Acts expressed. 1. <hi>Vocation,</hi> or their calling by
the Gospel <hi>v: 14. 2. Sanctification</hi> v: 13. (<hi>through the Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>)
And 3. <hi>Justification,</hi> which they receive by <hi>beliefe of the Truth.</hi> Thus
much then is wrapt up in this Text; God having in his Unchangeable Purpose
fore-appointed his to Salvation and Glory, certainly to be obtained through
the effectuall working of the Spirit, &amp; free justification in the Blood of Christ,
it cannot be, but that they shall be preserved unto the enjoyment of what
they are so designed unto.</p>
            <p>To summe up what hath been spoken from these Purposes of God,<note place="margin">§ 56.</note> to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59070:74"/>
the Establishment of the Truth we have in hand. Those, whom God hath
purposed by effectuall meanes to preserve to the enjoyment of Eternall Life
and Glory in his Favour and Acceptation, can never so fall from his Love, or
be so cast out of his Grace, as to come short of the end designed, or ever be
totally rejected of God. The Truth of this proposition depends upon what
hath been said, and may farther be insisted on, concerning the unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse,
and Absolutenesse of the Eternall Purposes of God, the Glory whereof
men shall never be able Sacrilegiously to robbe him of. Thence the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, concerning all true Believers, and truly sanctified persons, are these
Purposes of God, that they shall be so preserved to such ends &amp;c. as hath been
abundantly proved by an induction of particular instances, and therefore it
is impossible they should ever be so cast out of the Favour of God, as not to be
infallibly preserved to the End. Which is our Second Demonstration of the
Truth in hand.</p>

from his former observations weighed: 1. The Promise made to the body of the People
of the Jewes Typically only: 2. An Exposition borrowed of Socinus Rejected: 3. The Promise
not appropriated to the time of the Captivity: and the disadvantage ensuing to M. G. cause up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such an Exposition. 12. The place insisted on compared with Ezek. 11. 17, 18, 19, 20. That

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving shewn the <hi>Vnchangeable Stability</hi> of the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God towards his Saints,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> from the <hi>Immutability</hi> of his
own <hi>Nature</hi> and Purposes, manifested by an Induction of sundry
paricular Instances from eminent places of Scripture, wherein
both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> are held out as the foundation of
what we affirme: I proceed to further cleare &amp; demonstrate the same impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59070:75"/>
Truth from the first way of <hi>Declaration,</hi> whereby God hath assured them
that it shall be to them according to the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the Purposes insisted on;
and that is his <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace. The <hi>Principium essendi</hi> of this Truth (if I
may so say) is in the <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Purposes</hi> of God: the <hi>Principium Cognoscendi</hi>
in his <hi>Covenant,</hi> Promise, and Oath, which also adde much to the reall Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it, the Truth and Faithfullnesse of God in them, being thereby pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
engaged therein.</p>
            <p>It is not in my Purpose to handle the <hi>Nature of the Covenant of Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> but
only breifely to looke into it, so farre as it hath Influence into the Truth in
hand: The Covenant of Grace then, as it enwraps the Unchangeable Love
and Favour of God, towards those, who are taken into the bond thereof, is
that which lyeth under our present Consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The other great branch
of it, (upon the account of the same Faithfullnesse of God) communicating
permanency of <hi>Perseverance</hi> in it selfe, unto the Saints, securing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
with God, shall (the Lord assisting) more peculiarly be explained,
when we arrive to the head of our Discourse: unlesse enough to that purpose
may fall in occasionally in the progresse of this businesse.</p>
            <p>For our present purpose,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the producing and vindicating of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Texts
of Scripture,</hi> being unavoidably expressive towards the end aimed at, shall
suffice.</p>
            <p>The first of those is <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will establish my Covenant between me and
thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an Everlasting Covenant, to
be a God unto thee and thy seed after thee.</hi> This is that, which God engageth
himselfe unto in this <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> that he will for everlasting be a God
to him, and his Faithfull Seed. Though the externall <hi>Administration</hi> of the
Covenant was given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Carnall Seed, yet the effectuall
dispensation of the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> is peculiar to them only, who are
the Children of the Promise, the Remnant of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to Election,
with all, that in all Nations were to be Blessed in him, and in his Seed Christ
Jesus.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 22, 23, 30.</note> 
               <hi>Ishmael</hi> though Circumcised was to be put out, and not to be <hi>here with
Isaak;</hi> nor to abide in the <hi>House for ever,</hi> as the Sonne of the Promise was:
Now the Apostle tells you, looke what Blessings Faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> received
by vertue of this Promise, the same doe all Believers receive. <hi>Gal. 3. 9. We
which are of the Faith, are Blessed with Faithfull Abraham:</hi> which he prooves
(in the words foregoing) from <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. because all Nations were to be Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in him. What Blessing then was it, that was here made over to <hi>Abraham?</hi>
All the Blessings, that from God are conveighed in &amp; by his Seed Jesus Christ,
(in whom both he and we are Blessed) are enwrapped therein. What they are
the Apostle tells you <hi>Ephes. 1. 3. They are all Spirituall Blessings:</hi> If <hi>Perseverance,</hi>
if the Continuance of the Love and Favour of God towards us, be a Spirituall
Blessing, both <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his <hi>Seed,</hi> all Faithfull ones throughout the
world, are Blessed with it in Jesus Christ: and if Gods continuing to be a God,
to them <hi>for ever,</hi> will inforce this Blessing, (being but the same thing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expression) it is here likewise asserted.</p>
            <p>It is importunately excepted,<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> that though God undertake to be our God
in an <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> and upon that account to Blesse us with the whole
Blessing, that is convayed by the Promised Seed; yet if we abide not with him,
if we forsake him, he will also cease to be our God, and cease to Blesse us
with the Blessing, which on others in Jesus Christ he will bestow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If there be a necessity to smite this Evasion so often as we shall meet
with it, it must be cut into an hundred pieces. For the present I shall only
observe two evills it is attended withall. First, it takes no notice that God,
who hath undertaken to be a God unto us, hath with the like <hi>Truth, Power,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59070:75"/>
and <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> undertaken, that we shall abide to be his People. So is his
Love in his Covenant expressed by its Efficacy to this end and Purpose.
<hi>Deut. 50. 6. And the Lord thy God will also Circumcise thy Heart and the Heart
of thy Seed, to Love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart and with all thy Soule,
that thou maist live.</hi> Secondly, it denyes the continuance of the Love of God
to us, to the End, to be any part of the <hi>Blessings, wherewith we are blessed in
Jesus Christ:</hi> For if it be, it could no more be suspended on any Condition in
us, then the Glorification of Believers that abide so to the end.</p>
            <p>This then is enwrapped in this Promise of the Covenant unto the Elect,
with whom it is Established; God will be a God to them for ever, and that
to Blesse them with all the Blessings, which he communicates in and by the
Lord Jesus Christ the <hi>promised seed.</hi> The contiuuance of his Favour to the
End, is to us (unquestionably) a Spirituall Blessing; if any one be otherwise
minded, I shall not presse to share with him in his Apprehension: And if so, it
is in Christ, and shall certainely be enjoyed by them, to whom God is a God
in Covenant. He that can suppose, that he shall prevaile with the Saints of
God to believe it will make for their <hi>Consolation</hi> to apprehend, that there is
no ingagement in his Covenant assuring them of the continuance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God unto them, to the End of their Pilgrimage, hath no reason to
doubt or question the Issue of any thing, he shall undertake to perswade
men unto. Doubtlesse he will find it very difficult with them, who in time of
<hi>Spirituall Straights</hi> &amp; pressures, have closed with this ingagement of God in
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> &amp; have had experience of its bearing them through all perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ityes,
and entanglements, when the Waves of temptation were ready to goe
over their Soules. Certainely <hi>David</hi> was in another perswasion, when upon a
view of all the difficulties he had passed through, and his house was to meet
withall, he concludes 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 5. This is all my desire and all my Salvation, that
God hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things &amp; sure.</hi> The
Covenant from whence he had his <hi>sure Mercyes,</hi> not Changeable, not Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not liable to failings, as the temporall Prosperity of his House was, was
that he rejoyced in.</p>
            <p>I shall close this with two Observations.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> it <hi>may</hi> doubtlesse, and on serious Consideration <hi>will</hi> seeme strange
to any one, acquainted in the least measure with God and his Faithfullnesse,
that in a Covenant established in the Blood of Christ he should freely promise
to his, that he would <hi>be a God unto them,</hi> that is, that he would abide with
them in the Power, Goodnesse, Righteousnesse, and Faithfullnesse of a God,
that he would be an Allsufficient God to them for ever, when he might with
an Almighty facility prevent it, and so answer and fullfill his Ingagement to
to the utmost, he should yet suffer them to become such <hi>Villains and Devills in
Wickednesse,</hi> that it should be utterly impossible for him in the Blood of his
Sonne, and the riches of his Grace, to Continue a God unto them: this I say
seemeth strange to me, and not to be received without casting the greatest
reproach imaginable, on the Goodnesse, Faithfullnesse, and Righteousnesse
of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if this Promise be not absolute, Immutable, Unchangeable, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
on any thing in us, it is Impossible that any one should pleade it
with the Lord but only upon the account of the sence that he hath of his own
accomplishment of the <hi>Condition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 26. Isa. 8. 17. Isa. 50. 10.</note> on which the Promise doth depend; I can
almost suppose that the whole <hi>Generation of Believers</hi> will rise up against this
Assertion to remove it out of their way of walking with God. This I know,
that most of them, who any time have <hi>walked in darknesse and have had no
Light,</hi> will reprove it to the Faces of them that mainetaine it, and professe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59070:76"/>
that God hath witnessed the contrary truth to their hearts. Are we in the
<hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> left to our owne Hearts, Wayes, and Walkings? Is it not
differenced from that which is abolished? Is it not the great distinguishing
<hi>Character</hi> of it,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> that all the Promises of it are stable, &amp; shall certainely be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in Jesus Christ?<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 22. &amp; 8. 7, 8, 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>One place I shall adde more, wherein our intendment is positively expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">§ 6.</note>
beyond all possibility of any colourable evasion, especially considering
the Explication, Enlargement, and Application, which in other places it hath
received. The place intended is <hi>Jeremy</hi> 32. v. 38, 39, 40. <hi>They shall be my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and I will be their God; and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they
may feare me for ever, for the good of them, and their Children after them, and I
will make an everlasting Convenant with them, that I will not turne away from
them to doe them good, but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not
depart from me;</hi> in conjunction with those words of the same importance. Ch.
31. v: 31, 32, 33. <hi>Behold the daies come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new
Covenant with the house of Israel, and the house of Judah, not according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that I made with their Fathers; but this shall be my Covenant, that I will
make with the house of Israel after those daies, saith the Lord, I will put my Law
in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and
they shall be my People, and they shall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and
every man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know mee, from the
least of them to the greatest of them, saith the Lord, for I will forgive their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and remember their sinnes no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Thesis</hi> under demonstration is directly, and positively affirmed, in
most significant, and emphaticall words, by God himselfe: seeing then the
Testimony of his holy <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> concerning him are so excepted
against, and so lightly set by, let us try if men will reverence himselfe, and
cease contending with him, when he appeareth in judgement. Saith he then
to Believers, those whom he taketh into covenant with him, <hi>This is my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with you</hi> (in the performance whereof his Allsufficiency, Truth, and
Faithfulnesse with all other his glorious Attributes are eminently engaged) <hi>I
will be your God</hi> (what that expression intends is known, and the Lord here
explaines, by instancing in some eminent Spirituall mercy thence flowing, as
<hi>Sanctification,</hi> and Acceptance with him by the forgivenesse of sinnes) and
<hi>that for ever in an everlasting Covenant, that He will not turne away from them
to doe them good.</hi> This plainely God saith of himselfe, and this is all we say of
him in the businesse, and which (having so good an Author) we must say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men will heare, or whether they will forbeare: Whether it be right in
the sight of God to hearken unto men, more then unto God, let all judge.
Truly they have a sad taske in my Apprehension, who are forced to sweat and
labour to alleviate and take off the Testimony of God.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, That the way the Lord proposeth to secure his Love to his,
is upon termes of Advantage of Glory and Honour to himselfe, to take away
all scruple which on that hand might arise, is fully also expressed: Sinne is the
only differencing thing between God and man; and hereunto it hath a double
influence: First, <hi>Morall</hi> in its <hi>guilt,</hi> deserving that God should cast off a sinner,
and prevailing with him upon the account of justice so to doe; Secondly, <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
by causing men through its <hi>power</hi> and deceitfulnesse, to depart from
God,<note place="margin">Heb. 3, 1: Prov. 1. 31. 14. 14.</note> untill, as <hi>back-sliders in heart, they are filled with their owne waies.</hi> Take
away these two, provide for Security on this hand, and there is no possible
case imaginable, of separation between God and man once brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Peace and Unity. For both these doth God here undertake; for the
first (saith he) <hi>I will forgive their Iniquities, and remember their sinnes no more.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59070:76"/>
Cap.</hi> 31. 34. The guilt of sinne shall be done away in Christ, and that on termes
of the greatest Honor and Glory to the Justice of God, that can be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
God hath <hi>set forth</hi> Christ <hi>to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to
declare his Righteousnesse for the Remission of sinnes that are past. Rom.</hi> 3. 25.
And for the latter, that <hi>that</hi> may be throughly prevented, saith God the care
shall ly on me, <hi>I will put my Law in their Hearts &amp; write it in their inward parts.
Cap. 31. 33. I will put my feare in their inward parts, that they shall not depart
from me. Cap.</hi> 32. 40. So that the Continuance of his Love is secured against all
possible interveniences whatever, by an assured prevention of all such that
have an inconsistency therewithall.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> setting out the Covenant,<note place="margin">§: 7.</note> which God ratifieth in the Blood of
Christ, which shall never be broken, takes the description of it from this place
of the Prophet. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11, 12. &amp; therein fixeth particularly on the <hi>Vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geablenesse</hi>
of it, in opposition to the Covenant, which went before, which was
lyable to mutation: when if these differed only in the <hi>Approbation of severall
Qualifications,</hi> they come to the same end. For if this Covenant depends on
<hi>Conditions</hi> by our selves &amp; in our owne strength, with the advantage of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall
to us, attended with exhortations &amp; therefore by us to be fulfilled, how
was it distinguished from that made with the People, when they came out of
<hi>Egypt?</hi> But in this very thing the difference of it lyeth, as the Apostle asserts. <hi>v.</hi>
6, 7, 8. The Immutability of this Covenant, and the certaine product of all the
Mercy promised in it, might (were that our present taske) be easily demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as First.</p>
            <p>1. From the Removal of all causes of Alteration. When <hi>two</hi> enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
and Agreement, no <hi>one</hi> can undertake, that that Covenant shall be
firme, and stable, if it equally depends upon both: yea both it may be are
changeable, and so actually changed, before the accomplishing of the thing
engaged about therein: However though the one should be faithfull, yet the
other may faile, and so the Covenant be broken: Thus was it with <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Adam;</hi> it could not be undertaken, that that Covenant should be kept invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
because though God continues faithfull, yet <hi>Adam</hi> might prove, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he did) faithlesse: and so the Covenant was disanulled, as to any power
of knitting together God and Man. The Covenant betweene <hi>Husband</hi> and
<hi>Wife;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> party cannot undertake that the whole Covenant shall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
because the other may prove treacherous. In this Covenant the case
is otherwise. God himselfe hath undertaken the whole, both for his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with us, and our continuing with him. Now he is one, God is one, and
there is not another, that they should faile &amp; disanull this agreement. Though
there be sundry persons in covenant, yet there is but one <hi>undertaker</hi> on all
hands, and that is God himselfe. It doth not depend upon the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but of him only, who is faithfull, who <hi>cannot lye,</hi> who <hi>cannot deceive,</hi>
who will make all his engagements good to the utmost. He is an <hi>Allsufficient
one,</hi> he will worke, and who shall let him? The Lord of Hosts hath purposed,
and who shall disanull it? Yea he is an <hi>unchangeable</hi> one, what he undertakes,
shall come to passe. Blessed be his name, that he hath not laid the <hi>foundation</hi>
of a Covenant in the Bloud of his deare Sonne, layd out the riches of his Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Grace, and power about it; and then left it to us, and our fraile will
to carry it on, that it should be in our power to make void the great work of
his mercy. Whence then (I say) should any <hi>change</hi> be, the whole depending
on one, and he immutable.</p>
            <p>2. Seeing that God and man, having been at so great a distance, as they
were by sinne, must needs meet in some <hi>Mediatour,</hi> some middle person
in whom, and by whose bloud, (as covenants usually were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59070:77"/>
by bloud) this Covenant must be ratified; consider who <hi>this</hi> is, and what
he hath done for the establishing of it. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus. 1 Tim.</hi> 2.5. He is the <hi>surety of this
Testament. Heb. 7. 22. The Mediator of this better Covenant, established upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Promises Heb:</hi> 8. 6. neither is this <hi>surety</hi> or <hi>Mediator</hi> subject to change. He
is the same <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever. Heb.</hi> 13. 8. But though he be so in
himselfe, yet is the work so, that is committed to him? saith the Apostle, all
the <hi>Promises of God are yea and amen in Jesus Christ, to the glory of God by us,</hi> 2
Cor: 1. 20. God hath in him, and by him, ascertained all the Promises of the
Covenant, that not one of them should be broken, disanulled, frustrate, or
come short of an Accomplishment. God hath so confirmed them in him, that
he hath at his death made a Legacy of them, and bequeathed them in a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamentary
dispensation to the <hi>Covenanters. Heb:</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. and what he
hath farther done for the Assuring of his Saints abiding with God, shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be declared.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God is oftentimes peculiarly mentioned
in reference to this very thing, <hi>the God that keepeth Covenant is his Name,</hi>
That which he hath to <hi>keepe,</hi> is, all that in Covenant he undertaketh: now in
this Covenant he undertaketh: First, <hi>That he will never forsake us:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>That we shall never forsake him:</hi> his <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> is engaged to both these; and
if either part should faile, what would the Lord doe to his great name, <hi>The
God that keepeth Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the undertaking of God on <hi>both sides</hi> in this Covenant,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
notwithstanding his <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> in the performance of what he undertaketh,
notwithstanding the <hi>Ratification</hi> of it in the bloud of Jesus, and all that he
hath done for the confirmation of it, notwithstanding its <hi>differing</hi> from the
Covenant, that was disanulled on this Account, that that was broken, which
this shall never be, (that being broken, not as to the truth of the Proposition
wherein it is contained, Doe this &amp; Live, but as to the succes of it in bringing
any to God) notwithstanding the Seale of the Oath that God set unto it; they
(I say) who notwithstanding all these things, will hang the unchangeablenesse
of this Covenant of God upon the slipperinesse, and uncertainty, and lubrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Will of Man, <hi>let them walke in the light of the sparkes, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have kindled,</hi> we walke in the light of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p>When first I perused Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> Exceptions to this Testimony (<hi>Cap.</hi> 10.
<hi>Sect. 52, 53, 54, 55, 56. Pag.</hi> 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224.) finding them opposed
not so much,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> nor so directly to our inference from this place, as to the designe,
intendment, and arguing of the <hi>Apostle Rom.</hi> 9, 10, 11th <hi>chapters,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcing
of the Objections by him, answered, casting again the <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>offence</hi>
in the way, by him removed, I thought to have passed it without any <hi>Reply,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not convinced, that it was possible for the <hi>Author</hi> himselfe to be satisfied ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his own exposition of this place, or his exceptions unto ours; but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at length to the close of this discourse, I found him <hi>quasi re preclarè gestâ,</hi>
to triumph in his victory, expressing much confidence, that the <hi>World of Saints,</hi>
who have hitherto bottomed much of their Faith &amp; consolation, on the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of God in these words expressed, will veile their faith &amp; understanding to
his uncontrouleable Dictates, &amp; not once make mention of the name of God
in this place any more. Truly for my part, I must take the boldnesse to say,
that before the coming forth of his <hi>Learned Treatise,</hi> I had read, &amp; (according
to my weake ability) weighed and considered what ever either <hi>Arminians,</hi> or
<hi>Socinians</hi> (from the Founder of which Sect, their and his Interpretation of
this place is borrowed) had entred against the interpretation insisted on, that
I could by any meanes attaine the sight of, and was not in the least shaken by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59070:77"/>
any<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of their Reasonings, from rejoycing in the Grace of God, as to the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse
of his Love</hi> to Believers, and the certainety of their <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
with him to the end, therein expressed: And I must adde, that I am not
one jot enamored on their Objections and Reasonings, for all the new dresse,
which with some cost our Author hath been pleased to furnish them with,
<hi>fashionably</hi> to set out themselves withall. Were it not for the confidence you
expresse in the close of your Discourse, of your noble Exploits and Atcheive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the consideration of this <hi>Text</hi> (which magnificent thoughts of your
undertakings and successe, I could not imagine from the reading of your
Arguments or Exceptions, though on other accounts I might) I should not
have thought it worth while to examine it particularly, which now, to safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Consolation of the weakest Believers, and to encourage them to
hold fast their confidence so well established against the assaults of all Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
<hi>Sathan</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> I shall breifely doe.</p>
            <p>Then (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin,) Evident it is from the whole Tenour of the
Chapter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that the words containe especiall Promises made particularly to the
Jewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If by <hi>particularly,</hi> you meane <hi>exclusively,</hi> to them, and not to others,
this is evidently false; for the Apostle tels you <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. to the end of the
<hi>Chapter,</hi> that the <hi>Covenant</hi> here mentioned is that, whereof Christ is <hi>Mediator,</hi>
and the <hi>Promises of it</hi> those <hi>better Promises,</hi> which they are made partakers off,
who have an interest in his Mediation.</p>
            <p>2. (<hi>He saith</hi>) As evident it is, upon the same account, that the Promise here
mentioned was not made only to the Saints or sound Believers amongst the Jewes,
who were but few; But to the whole body or generality of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> True, it is as <hi>evident</hi> as what before you affirmed, &amp; that in the same
kind, that is, it is <hi>evidently false;</hi> or else the Promise it selfe is so; for it was
never fulfilled towards them all. Bnt I referre you to a <hi>Learned Author,</hi> who
hath long since assoyled this difficulty, and taught us to distinguish between
a Jew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and a Jew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of <hi>Israel according to the flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28, 29.</note> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Promise:</hi> He hath also taught us,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6, 7.</note> that they are not all <hi>Israel</hi> that
are of <hi>Israel. Rom:</hi> 9. 6. And upon that account it is, that the <hi>word of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
doth not faile,</hi> though all <hi>of Israel</hi> doe not enjoy the fruit of it. Not that
it is <hi>Conditionall,</hi> but that it was not at all made unto them, as to the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
part of it, to whom it was not wholly fulfilled. And <hi>cap.</hi> 11. He tells you
that it was the <hi>Election</hi> to whom these <hi>Promises</hi> were made, and they <hi>obtained</hi>
the fruit of them: neither doth that <hi>Appendix</hi> of Promises poynted to, look
any other way. When you have made good your Observation by a <hi>Reply</hi> to
that <hi>Learned Author,</hi> we shall think of a Rejoynder. It is therefore added,</p>
            <p>3. It is yet upon the same account as evident, as either of the former, that this
Promise was made unto this Nation of the Jewes, when and whilest they were (or
at least considered as now being) in the Iron-furnace of the Babylonian captivity.
<hi>v.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That this solemne Renovation of this promise of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> was
(not made to them when in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but) given out to them before hand, to
sustaine their hearts and spirits withall, in their Bondage and Thraldome, is
granted; and what then I pray? Is it any new thing to have spirituall Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
solemnly given out, &amp; renewed upon the occasion of temporall distresses?
A <hi>Promise</hi> of Christ is given out to the House of <hi>David,</hi> when in feare of being
destroyed, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 7. 13. So it was given to <hi>Adam Gen:</hi> 3.16. So to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi>
17. So to the Church; <hi>Isaiah</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4. But farther it is said,</p>
            <p>4. From the words immediately preceding the passages offered to debate, it
clearly appears, that the Promise in these passages relates unto, and concernes their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59070:78"/>
reduction, and returne from, and out of that Captivity, into their own Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Will Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> say, that it doth only concerne that? Dareth any
man so boldly contradict the <hi>Apostle</hi> setting out from this very place the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Covenant of Grace, ratified in the bloud of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.? Nay
will any say, that so much of the Promise here, as God calleth his Covenant,
cap. 31. v. 32, 33. chap: 32. v. 38, 39, 40. doth at all concerne their Reduction
into their own Land, any farther then as it was a <hi>Type</hi> or Resemblance of our
deliverance by Christ? These <hi>evident</hi> Assertions are as expresse and flat <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi>
to the <hi>evident</hi> intendment of the Holy Ghost, as any man is able to
invent. But,</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath many deductions out of the former (sure and evident)
premises,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> to prove that this is not a promise of <hi>Absolute and Finall Perseverance</hi>
(it is a strange Perseverance, that is not finall) in Grace to the end of their
lives: for saith he,</p>
            <p>1. The Promise is made to the Body of the People, and not to the Saints and
Believers among them, and respects as well the Vnfaithfull, as the Believers, in
that Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It was made to the <hi>Body of the People</hi> only <hi>Typically</hi> considered, and
so it was accomplished to the Body of the People; <hi>Spiritually</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> to
the <hi>Elect</hi> among the People, who, as the Apostle tells us, <hi>obtained</hi> accordingly.
There being also in the Promise wrapped up, the Grace of effectuall Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
It may in some sense be said to be made to the <hi>unfaithfull:</hi> that is, to such
as were so antecedently to the Grace thereof: but not to any that <hi>abide</hi> so, for
the Promise is, not that they shall not, but that they shall Believe, &amp; continue
in so doing to the end. But saith he,</p>
            <p>2. This Promise was appropriated and fitted to the state of the Jewes, in a sad
captivity: but the Promise of Perseverance was (if our Adversaries might be Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
a standing Promise among them, not appropriated to their condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. 1. Non venit ex pharetris ista sagitta tuis.</hi> It is <hi>Socinus</hi>'s, in reference
to <hi>Ezechiel 36. In Prael: Theol: cap. 12. Sect:</hi> 6. And so is the whole Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the place afterwards insisted on, derived to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> through the
hands of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> at the <hi>Hague</hi> Conference. 2. If this exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Testimony given in these words for the confirmation of the <hi>Thesis</hi>
in hand may be allowed, what will become of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Argument from
<hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18. for the Apostasy of the Saints? It is most certaine, the
words from thence, by him and others insisted on, with the whole discourse,
of whose contexture they are a part, are appropriated to a peculiar state of
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and are brought forth as a meete vindication of the Righteousnesse
of God in his dealing with them in that condition. This then may be laid up
in store to refresh Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> with something of his own providing, when
we are gone so farre onward in our journey: But 3. It is most evident to all
the World, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is not such a stranger in the Scriptures, as not to
have observed long since, that <hi>Spirituall</hi> Promises are frequently given to the
People of God, to support their Soules under <hi>Temporall</hi> distresses: and that
not alwaies <hi>new</hi> Promises for the matter of them, (for indeed the substance of
all Promises is comprized in the first promise of Christ) but either such, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
and cleare up Grace formerly given or promised; or such, as have need
of a solemne <hi>Renewall,</hi> for the establishing of the Faith of the Saints, assaulted
in some particular manner, in reference to them: which was the state of the
Saints among the Jewes at this time. How often was the same promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
to <hi>Abraham?</hi> And upon what severall occasions? And yet that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
for the matter of it, was the same that had bin given from the beginning
of the World; That Gods solemne Renewall of the <hi>Covenant</hi> at any time, is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59070:78"/>
called his making of, or entring into Covenant, needs no labour to prove.
But (saith he)</p>
            <p>3. <hi>This Promise is the same with that of</hi> Ezek. 11. 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>which
Promise notwithstanding,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> 
               <hi>it is said</hi> v. 21. But as for them whose heart walketh
after the heart of their detestable things, and their abominations, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
their wayes upon their heads; so that, notwithstanding this seeming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
(as is pretended) of Perseverance in Grace, they may walke after their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
things, for this threatning intends the same Persons or Nations (as <hi>Calvin</hi>
himselfe confesseth) the Israelites.</p>
            <p>1 Grant that this is the <hi>same Promise</hi> with the other,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> how will it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
that this is not a Promise of such an enterposure of the Spirit and
Grace of God, as shall infallibly produce the effect of <hi>Perseverance?</hi> Why?
<hi>Because some are threatned for following the Heart of their abominable things.</hi>
Yea but how shall it appear that they are the <hi>same Persons</hi> with them, to
whom the Promise is made? The <hi>Context</hi> is plainely against it: saith he, <hi>I will
give them a Heart to walke in my Statutes and Ordinances, to doe them: but for
them that walke after their owne Hearts, them I will destroy,</hi> in as cleare a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of the Object of the Promise, and threatning as is possible. Saith
Mr <hi>Goodwin, this Threatning concernes the same Persons or Nation:</hi> the same
Nation, but not the same Persons in that Nation: but <hi>Calvin</hi> saith that it
concerneth the <hi>Israelites:</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us, that they <hi>are not all Israel
who are of Israel,</hi> not all Children of the Promise, who are Children of the
flesh. And</p>
            <p>2. If it doe any way concerne the Persons to whom that Promise is given,
it is an expression suited to the dispensation of God, whereby he carrieth
Believers on in the enjoyment of the good things he gives them in and by his
Promises, without the least prediction of any event, being only declarative
of what the Lord abhorreth, and the connexion that is between the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
and the Consequent of the <hi>axiome,</hi> wherein it is contained: and is farre
from the nature of those Promises, which hold out the Purpose or Intention
of God, with the engaging of a reall efficacy for their accomplishment. He
adds.</p>
            <p>4. If this be a Promise of absolute Perseverance, no time nor season can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
wherein it was fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> At all times and seasons to them, to whom it was made, according
to their concernement in it. But saith he,</p>
            <p>1. It hath been proved that it was made to the community of the Jewish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
toward whom it was not fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It hath been said indeed, againe and againe, but scarce once
attempted to be proved: nor the Reasoning of the <hi>Apostle</hi> against some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
proofes and Answers to them, at all removed.</p>
            <p>2. It was fulfilled to the <hi>Body of that Naiion,</hi> as farre as it concerned
the <hi>Body of that Nation,</hi> in their <hi>Typicall</hi> returne from their captivity. But
then,</p>
            <p>2. If this be the sence, it was fulfilled in the captivity as well as afterward, for
you say the Saints alwaies Persevere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Typicall part of it was not then accomplished.</p>
            <p>2. It is granted, that as to the Spirituall part of the Covenant of Grace,
it was at all times fulfilled to them, which is now evidently promised to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
them in the Assurance thereof. Wherefore it is,</p>
            <p>5. Argued (Sect. 53.) That these words, I will give them one Heart, that they
shall not depart from me, may be as well rendred that they may not depart from
me, and so it is said in the verse foregoing, that they may feare me for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59070:79"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Suppose the words may be thus rendred, what inconvenience will
ensue? Either way they evidently &amp; beyond exception designe out the End ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at by God; and when God intends an End or Event, so as to exert a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
efficiency for the compassing of it, to say that it shall not be infallibly
brought about, is an Assertion, that many have not as yet had the boldnesse
to venture on. But saith he:</p>
            <p>2. The words so read doe not necessarily import the actuall event or taking
place, of the effect intended of God in the Promise, and his performance thereof,
but only his intention it selfe in both these, and the sufficiency of the means allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the producing such an effect: but it is of the same nature with that, that our
Saviour saith <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 34. these things I say unto you, that yee might be saved: And
that of God to Adam Gen: 3. 10, 11. <hi>All which things were in like manner insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on by the Remonstrants at the</hi> Hague Colloquie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not amisse that our contests about the sence of this place of
Scripture, are at length come to the state and issue here expressed. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the thing promised, and that according to the intendment of God, is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance:</hi>
but that there is any necessity that this <hi>Promise</hi> of God should be
<hi>fulfilled,</hi> or his intention accomplished, that is denied. Were it not, that I
should prevent my selfe, in what will be more seasonable to be handled,
when we come to the consideration of the Promises of God, I should very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ingage here into the proofe of this Assertion: When God <hi>purposeth</hi> or
intendeth an event, and <hi>promiseth</hi> to doe it, to that end putting forth and
exercising an <hi>efficient reall</hi> power, it shall certainly be accomplished and
brought to passe; neither can this be denied without casting the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of <hi>Mutability, Impotency,</hi> and <hi>breach of Word</hi> upon the most Holy, that
is possible for any man to doe: Neither doe the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> nor Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
acquit themselves from a participation in so high a crime, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10, 11. where a <hi>Command</hi> of God is only related to expresse
his <hi>duty</hi> to whom it was given, not in the least asserting any intention of God
about the event, or Promise, as to the meanes of its Accomplishment. Nor
doth that of <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 28 give them any more assistance in their sad underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to alleviate the truth of God. A meanes of Salvation in its own nature
and kind sufficient is exhibited, which asserts not an infallible necessity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
as that doth which in this place is ascribed to God. But it is added.</p>
            <p>6. (<hi>Sect.</hi> 54.) The continuance of externall and Civill prosperity to the Jewish
Nation may much more colourably be argued from hence, then the certainty of
their Perseverance in Grace: for these things are most expresly promised, verses 39,
40. and yet we find that upon their nonperformance of the condition, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the most contemptible and miserable Nation under Heaven: certainly then
the Spirituall Promises here must also depend on conditions, which if not fulfilled,
they also may come short of performance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans: 1. Rom:</hi> 11. 25, 26, 27. 2. These <hi>Temporall Promises</hi> were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
unto them, so farre as they were made to them, that is, as they were
<hi>Typicall,</hi> and what is behind of them, shall be made good in due time. 3. All
these Promises are, and were in their chiefest and most eminent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(even the spirituall things set forth by allusions to the good land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they lived) compleatly and absolutely fulfilled to them all, and every one,
to whom they were properly and directly made, as the Apostle abundantly
proveth <hi>Rom:</hi> 9.10,11. 4. Whereas there are two speciall spirituall Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
here expressed, one of <hi>Conversion,</hi> the other of <hi>Perseverance,</hi> I desire to
know on what condition their accomplishment is suspended? On what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
will God write his Law in their hearts? <hi>On condition they heare him, and
obey him, suffer his mercies and kindnesses to work kindly on them:</hi> that is, on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59070:79"/>
condition his Law be in their hearts, he will write it there thankes yet for
that: On what condition doth God promise, that they shall abide with him for
ever? Why, on condition they depart not from him: very good! To what end
doth God promise that, which he will not effect, but only on condition that
there is no need for him so to doe? But saith he.</p>
            <p>7. If the Spirituall Promises be absolute, so must the Temporall be also: For
their accomplishing depends solely on the things mentioned and promised in the
Spirituall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Temporall things in the Promises are often expressed only to be a
resemblance, and to set off some eminent Spirituall Grace intended, as shall
afterwards appeare. In that sense the Promises mentioning such things, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
and fully accomplished in the collation of the Spirituall things by
them <hi>typed</hi> and resembled. 2. Temporall Promises as such, belong not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, as they are of Temporall things for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of them but to the Covenant with that whole Nation, about their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
in the Land of Canaan, which was expressely conditionall, and
which held out no more of Gods <hi>Intendment</hi> to that Nation, but only that
there should be an inviolable connexion between their Obedience &amp; Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes.
3. The things in this Promise are expresly differenced from the things
of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> on this account, that that <hi>Covenant</hi> being broken on the
part of the Nation, they enjoyed not that which was laid out as a fruit of their
Obedience; but this shall never be violated or broken, God undertaking for
the accomplishing of it, with another manner of engaging, and sutable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
exerted, then in that of old. <hi>Heb: 8. 7, 8, 9, 10. Cap.</hi> 10. 16, 17. But
saith he,</p>
            <p>8. The expression of a Covenant plainly shewes it to be conditionall; for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is not, but upon the mutuall stipulation of parties: when one failes, then is
the other true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The word <hi>Berith</hi> is sometimes used for a single Promise without a
condition. <hi>Gen:</hi> 6.18. cap. 9.9. Whence the Apostle handling this very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
changeth the termes, and calleth it a Testament. In a <hi>Testamentary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation,</hi>
there is not in the nature of it any mutuall stipulation required, but
only a meere single favour and grant or concession. 2. It may be granted,
that here is a <hi>stipulation</hi> of duty from us, God promising to work that in us,
which he requires of us: and thereby is this Covenant distinguished from that
which was disanulled. In the <hi>good things</hi> indeed of this Covenant, one may be
the condition of another, but both are freely bestowed of God: And these are
Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> exceptions against this Testimony, which cometh <hi>in,</hi> in the cause
of God, and his Saints, that we have in hand. His next attempt is to give you
the sense of the words on this consideration, to manifest from thence, <hi>that this
Promise of God may come short of Accomplishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then at length is the account that is given in of the sence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in hand,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> and all others of the like nature.</p>
            <p>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may feare me for ever, and
will put my feare into their hearts, that they shall not, or may not depart from me,
(<hi>i.e.</hi>) I will deale so above measure graciously and bountifully with them, as well
in matters relating to their Spirituall condition, as in things concerning their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condition, that, if they be not prodigiously refractory, stubborne, and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
I will overcome their evills with my Goodnesse, &amp; will cause them to owne mee
for their God, and will reduce them, as one man, to a loving and loyall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rame and
temper of heart, that they shall willingly with a free and full purpose of heart feare
and serve me for ever. <hi>Sect:</hi> 55.</p>

Erasmus <hi>in his</hi> Diatribe, <hi>saying, that there is an usuall figure of
speaking contained in it, whereby a care in any, of working something
by another, is signified, his endeavour being not excluded; as if a
Maister should say to his Scholar speaking improperly, I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that barbarous tongue from thee, and give thee the Romane: these
are almost the words of</hi> Erasmus: <hi>to which adde, that it appeareth
from the place it selfe, that God would not signify any necessity, or any
internall efficacy, when he declareth that he will effect what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth,
no other way, then by the multitude of his benefits, wherewith he
would affect the people, and mollify their hearts and mindes, and
thereby as it were, beget and create in them a willingnesse and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in obeying of him.</hi> The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> received this sence, in the
conference at the <hi>Hague,</hi> managing it in these words: <hi>it is manifest
that these words doe signify some great efficacy and motion, which
should come to passe by the many and excellent benefits of God, for
whose sake they ought to convert themselves, &amp;c.</hi> which worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
being at length fallen upon Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> hand, is
trimmed forth as you have heard. Secondly, not to insist on
those Assumptions, which are supposed in this interpretation, as
that this Promise was made peculiarly to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and to the whole Nation
of them, properly and directly, &amp;c. The G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>osse it selfe will be found by no
meanes to have the least consistency with either the words, or intendment of
the Holy Ghost in the place, nor to be suited to Answer our Argument from
thence, nor yet to hold any good intelligence or correspondency with what
hath already been delivered concerning it. For,</p>
            <p>1. To beginne with the <hi>latter:</hi> he affirmes this cannot be a Promise of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Perseverance, <hi>because if it be so, the Jewes enjoyed it in that Captivity, as
well as afterwards; when that is here promised, which they were not to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
in, and upon their returne from Babylon. Sect:</hi> 52. Pag: 220, 221. But if that,
which is here mentioned, be all that is promised to them, namely, dealing so
graciously and bountifully with them in his Dispensations, according as was
intimated, there is not any thing in the least held out to them in this place,
but what God had already (himselfe being judge) in as eminent and high a
manner wrought in reference to them and for them, as could be conceived.
And indeed it was such, as he never after this, arose to that height of outward
mercy and bounty, in things <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall,</hi> so as before. <hi>Isai.</hi> 5.1,2,4.
Neither after the Captivity unto this day, did they see againe the triumphant
glory of <hi>David,</hi> the magnificent peace of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the beauty of the <hi>Temple,</hi>
the perfection of Ordinances &amp;c. as before.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he affirmed formerly, that <hi>this Promise is conditionall, and
that the things therein promised, doe depend on conditions by them to be fulfilled, to
whom the Promise is made. Sect: 54. pag. 221. in the Glosse</hi> here given us of the
words, there is no intimation of any such conditions, as whereon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
actings of God should be suspended, but only an <hi>uncertainty</hi> of Event in
reference to these actings Asserted. That (according to this interpretation)
which alone God promiseth to doe is, that he <hi>would deale above measure graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and bountifully with them, as well in matters relating to their spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
as in things concerning their outward condition,</hi> this is all he promiseth,
and this he will absolutely doe, be the Event what it will. It is not said, (nor
can it with any pretence of reason) that this also is conditionall, nay <hi>whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Event</hi> and issue be, that God will thus deale with them, is the sence of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59070:80"/>
the words in hand, according to the estimate here taken of them. It is true,
it is in the Exposition under consideration left doubtfull and ambiguous, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such, or such an Event shall follow the promised actings of God or no;
but what God promiseth concerning his dealing with them, that without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall
of any condition what ever, shall be accomplished. According as <hi>a sence</hi>
serves the turne, so it is to be embraced, when men are once engaged against
the Truth.</p>
            <p>3. Neither doth this Interpretation so much as take notice of, much lesse
doth it with any strength, or evidence, wave our Argument for the <hi>Saints Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi>
from this place. We affirme 1. That the Promise God made
unto, or the Covenant he makes here with his people, is distinguished from,
or opposed unto the Covenant that was broken, upon this account, that that
was broken by the default of them, with whom it was made; but God would
take care and provide that this should not faile, but be Everlasting. <hi>Jer:</hi> 31. 32,
33. <hi>Ch. 32. 40. Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9. 2. That the intendment of God in this Promise,
and the administration of this Covenant, with meanes and power mentioned
therein, is the <hi>abiding of his Saints</hi> with him, or rather (primarily, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally)
his abiding with them, notwithstanding all such interveniences, as he
will not powerfully prevent from ever interposing to the disturbance of that
Communion he taketh them into. <hi>I will, saith he, make an everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with them, that I will not turne away from them from doing them good.</hi> Now
these things, and such like, are not once taken notice of, in the exposition
boasted to be full and cleare.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Neither indeed hath it any affinity unto,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> or acquaintance in name or
thing, with the words or intendment of God, with the Grace of the Promise,
or the Promise it selfe. For,</p>
            <p>1. God (saies he) <hi>will give them one heart and one way, or he will put his
Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts:</hi> which is plainely the
work of his Grace in them, and not the effect and fruit of his dealing with
them. In the Glosse in hand, the work of God is limited to such dealings with
them, as may overcome them to such a frame. The having of a <hi>new heart</hi> is
either the immediate work of God; or it is their yeelding unto their duty to
him, upon his dealing bountifully and graciously with them. If the First; it is
what the Scripture affirmes, and all that we desire: If the Latter; how comes
it to be expressed in termes holding out an immediate <hi>Divine Efficiency?</hi> That
the taking away of a heart of Stone, the giving of a new heart, and Spirit, the
writing of the Law in their hearts, and (which is all one) the quickning of
the Dead, the opening of blind eyes, the begetting of us a new, as they relate
unto God doe signifie no more but his administration of meanes, whereby men
may be wrought upon, and perswaded to bring their hearts and spirits into
such a condition, as is described in those expressions, to quicken themselves,
to open their blind eyes &amp;c. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> shall scarce be able to evince.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Conversion,</hi> and <hi>Pardon of Sinne</hi> being both in this promise of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
(I take in also that place of the same importance <hi>cap.</hi> 31.) and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
alike to the Grace of God, if Conversion, or the <hi>giving of a new heart,</hi> be
done only by administring outward meanes, and perswasions unto men to
make the new heatrs; the <hi>forgivenesse of Sins</hi> must also be supposed to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto them upon the condition, that their sinnes be forgiven; as Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is, on condition they be converted, or doe convert themselves.</p>
            <p>3. This Promise being by the Prophet and Apostle insisted on, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Grace, whereby eminently and peculiarly the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from that which was <hi>abolished;</hi> If the Grace mentioned therein, be
only the laying a powerfull and strong obligation on men to duty, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59070:81"/>
upon the account of the gracious, and bountifull dealing of God with
them, both as to their Temporall and Spirituall condition, I desire to know
wherein the difference of it from the old Covenant, as to the collation of
Grace, doth consist? And whether ever God made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he did not put sufficient obligations of this kind upon him, unto obedience?
And if so, what are the <hi>better promises</hi> of the New Covenant? And what emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and singular things, as to the bestowing of Grace, are in it? Which things
here are emphatically expressed to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>4. The scope of this Exposition (which lookes but to one part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
about bestowing of Grace, overlooking the maine End and intendment
of it, as hath been shewed) being to darken the words of the Holy Ghost, so
farre, as to make them represent a <hi>contribution of means,</hi> instead of an <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
working the end</hi> and the event, on which the means supplied have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of perswasion, to prevaile with men to doe the things they are affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them for: I desire to know, (First) What new thing is here promised to
them, which exceeded that mentioned ch. 25. <hi>v:</hi> 4, 5. Wherein the Lord testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
that he had granted them formerly a large supply of outward means
(and especially of the word) for the end here spoken of. (Secondly) To
what end, and on what account, is this administration of <hi>means for a work</hi>
expressed by termes of a <hi>reall efficiency</hi> in reference to the work it selfe, which
proceeding from the intendment of God, for the event aimed at, must needs
produce it? And (Thirdly) Why these words should not be of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
with the associate expression, which of necessity must be interpreted
of an actuall and absolute efficiency? v. 41, 42. And (Fourthly) Whether the
Administration of outward sufficient means for the producing of an Event, can
be a ground of an infallible prediction of that Event? As God here absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saith, <hi>they shall all know him from the Greatest to the least. Ch:</hi> 31. 34. which
how it is brought about, the Holy Ghost acquaints us <hi>Is. 4. 13. They shall be all
taught of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Ioh: 6. 44, 45, 46. It is written of the Prophets. And they
shall be all taught of God: Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of
the Father, cometh unto mee.</hi> But Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath sundry Reasons to confirme
his <hi>Glosse,</hi> which must also be considered; and he saith.</p>
            <p>1. That it is the familiar Dialect of Scripture to ascribe the doing of things
or effects themselves, to him that ministers occasions, or proper and likely meanes
for the doing of them: so God is said to give them one heart, and one way, to put
his feare into their hearts, when he administers motives, means, occasions, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to them, which are proper to work them to such a frame, and disposition
of heart, out of which men are wont to love, and obey him, whether they be ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
brought thereunto, or no: and this Promise was fulfilled to the People after
their returne out of Captivity, in the mercies they enjoyed, and the Preaching of the
Prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We are not now to be informed, that this is Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning conversion: that God doth only administer <hi>meanes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
and oportunities for it, but that man thereupon converts himselfe. And
2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> That when God hath done all he will, or can: that the Event may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
nor the work be wrought. But 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, That this sence by any meanes or
opportunities can be fastned on the Promise under consideration, we are not as
yet so well instructed. When God once intendeth an End, and expresseth
himselfe so to doe, promising to work really and efficiently for the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of it, yea that he will actually doe it, by that <hi>efficiency</hi> preventing all
interpositions whatever, that may tend to frustrate his designe, that that End
of his shall not be accomplished, or that that working of his is only an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of meanes, whereby men may doe the things intended, if they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59070:81"/>
will, or may doe otherwise, (he affirming that he will doe them himselfe) is a
Doctrine beyond my reach and capacity. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> His saying, that <hi>in this sence the
Promise was fulfilled to the People after the Captivity,</hi> is a saying against his own
light. He hath told us not long since, that it could not be a Promise of those
things which were enjoyed before it was ever given, as in our sence they did
the Grace of Perseverance. &amp;c Surely the means he mentioneth (untill at least
the coming of Christ in the Flesh) were advanced to a farre higher pitch
and eminency on all hands, before the Captivity, then after: and at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, it was eminently fulfilled in our acceptation of it, unto all, to
whom it was made. But he adds.</p>
            <p>2. That if it be not so to be understood,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> and so said to be fulfilled as above, it
is impossible for any one to assigne how, and when this Promise was fulfilled. For
first it was made to the whole People, and the fulfilling of it to a few, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Truth of it. Secondly, The Elect had no need of it (knowing themselves
to be so) that they should never fall away: so that this is but to make voyd the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Promise of God. And thirdly, to say that it was made to the Elect, is but to
begge the thing in question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As farre as the <hi>Body of the People</hi> was concerned in it, it was, and
shall be in the latter daies absolutely accomplished towards them. It was, is,
&amp; shall be fulfilled to all to whom it was made, if so be that God be faithfull,
and cannot deny himselfe. 2. It was, it is, and shall be accomplished pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and directly to <hi>all the Elect of that Nation,</hi> to whom it was so made, as it
hath been cleared already from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 10, 11. Where the Apostle expresly
and <hi>datâ operâ</hi> answers the very Objection, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> makes about the
accomplishing of these Promises, concerning the hardening and rejection of
the greatest part of that people, affirming it to consist in this, that the <hi>Election
obtained,</hi> when the rest were hardened. Wherein he did not <hi>begge</hi> the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though he <hi>digged</hi> not for it; but answered by clear distinctions, as you may
see <hi>Rom. 9. 6 Ch.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. 3. Neither doe all the Elect after their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
know themselves to be so, nor have they any other way to come acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their <hi>Election,</hi> but by their faith in the Promises; nor is it spoken like
one acquainted with the course and frame of Gods dealing with his Saints, or
with their Spirits in walking with God, who supposeth the solemne and clear
Renovation of Promises concerning the same things, with Explanations and
enlargements of the Grace of them to confirme and establish the communion
between the one and the other, to be needlesse. And who make the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of God void, and of no effect? we who professe the Lord to be faithfull in
every one of them, and that not one Title of them shall fall to the ground,
or come short of accomplishing? or Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who reports the Grace men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in them, for the most part to come short of producing the effect, for
which it is bestowed, and the engagements of God in them, to depend so
upon the labricity of the wills of men, that mostly they are not made good in
the end aimed at, the Lord will judge. But it is farther Argued.</p>
            <p>3. That the Scripture many times asserts the futurity, or coming to passe of
things, not yet in being,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> not only when the coming of them to passe is certainly
known, but when it is probable upon the account of the meanes used for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to passe; <hi>for God saith in the Parable,</hi> they will reverence my Sonne,
Mark. 12. <hi>(and yet the event was contrary. So upon the executing an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
he saith,</hi> the People shall heare and feare, and doe no more presumptuously,
which yet might not have its effect on all. So God saith, I will give them one heart,
not out of any certainty of knowledge or determînation in himselfe, that any such
heart or way should actually be given them, which would infallibly produce the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59070:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mentioned, but that he would grant such meanes, as were proper to create such a
heart in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The neerer the <hi>bottome,</hi> the more sower <hi>Lees.</hi> First, Doth God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
the coming to passe of things future, upon a probable conjecture, which
is here assigned to him? Is that the Intendment of the expression in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>they will reverence my Son?</hi> Or was he mistaken in the Event, the thing fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out contrary to his expectation? Or is there any thing in this, or the place
mentioned <hi>Deut:</hi> 17. 12, 13. but only an expression of the duty of men, upon
the account of the meanes offered? Is there any the least intimation of any
<hi>Intent</hi> and purpose of God, as to the Events insisted on? Any <hi>Promise</hi> of his
effectuall working for the accomplishing of them? Any <hi>Prediction</hi> upon the
account of his Purpose and Designe, which are the foundation of all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions?
Or is there any the least correspondency in name, or thing between
the places now instanced in, and called in for reliefe, with that under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration?
This then is the sinew of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> arguing in this place: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when there is meanes offered men for the performance of a duty, the
accomplishment of it is spoken of, as of what ought to have succeeded; and it
is the fault of men to whom that duty is prescribed, and these meanes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
if it come not to passe: therefore when God proposeth, and promiseth
to work and bring about such, and such a thing, and engageth himselfe to a
reall efficiency in it, yet it may come to passe, or it may not, it may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
or God may faile in his intendment.</p>
            <p>2. The sense here given to the promise of God, <hi>I will give them one
heart &amp;c.</hi> hath been formerly taken into consideration, and it hath been made
to appeare, that notwithstanding all the glorious Expressions of Gods Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of meanes to work men into the frame intimated, yet upon the
matter, the intendment of the Exposition given amounts to this, though God
saith, <hi>he will give us a new heart,</hi> yet indeed he doth <hi>not</hi> so give it to any one
in the World, nor ever intended to doe so; but this <hi>new Heart,</hi> men must cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
make, and worke out themselves, upon the meanes afforded them, which
being very eminent, are said to <hi>create</hi> such hearts in them, though they doe it
not, but only perswade men thereunto: A Comment this is, not much unlike
the first that ever was made upon the words of God <hi>Gen:</hi> 4. 5. Whether God,
or man, create the new Heart, is the matter here in Question.</p>
            <p>For what he lastly affirmes, <hi>That if this be a Promise of Absolute Perseverance,
it is inconsistent with all the Prophesies of the Rejection of the Jewes, which are
accordingly fulfilled.</hi> I must referre him to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath long agoe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to answer this Objection, from whom if he receive not satisfaction, what
am I, that I should hope to afford the least unto him?</p>
            <p>And these are the Reasonings, upon the account whereof Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
this Text of Scripture, by vertue of his <hi>Autocratoricall</hi> power in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
Controversies of this nature, from bearing Testimony in this cause any
more. Whether he will be attended unto herein, time will shew. Many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to the same purpose have formerly been made, and yet it endureth
the tryall.</p>
            <p>I have thus turned aside to the consideration of the Exceptions given in to
the ordinary interpretation of this place,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> least any should think that they
were waved upon the account of their strength and efficacy to overthrow it.
The Argument I intended from the words, for the stability of Gods Love and
Favour to Believers, upon the account of his <hi>Covenant</hi>-engagement, is not once
touched in any of them. These words then yeeld a Third Demonstration of
the Stedstastnesse and Unchangeablenesse of Acceptation of Believers in

Christ, upon the account of the Absolute Stability of that Covenant of Grace,

               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> which are all branches of
the forementioned Roote, all streaming from the fountain of the
Covenant of Grace, is, according to the <hi>method</hi> proposed, in the

<hi>the first-borne of our strength, cap. 11. Sect. 1. pag.</hi> 225. and indeed we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
that it may be so accounted, desiring nothing more <hi>ancient,</hi> nothing

of that God,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18. Titus 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>who cannot lye.</hi> I shall for the present insist only on those,
which peculiarly assert, and in the name and Authority of God, confirme that
part of the Truth, we are peculiarly in Demonstration of; namely the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
stability of the Love and Favour of God to Believers, in regard
whereof he turneth not from them, nor forsaketh them, upon the Account
of any such <hi>Interveniences</hi> what ever, as he will suffer to be interposed in their

            <p>I am not unacquainted with the usuall Exception,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that lyeth against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Truth in hand, from the Promises of God; to wit, that
<hi>they are conditionall,</hi> depending on some things in the Persons themselves to
whom they are made, upon whose change, or Alteration, they also may be
frustrated, and not receive their accomplishment. Whether this plea may be
admitted against the particular Promises, that we shall insist upon, will be put
upon the tryall, when we come to the particular handling of them. For the
present being resolved (by Gods Assistance) to pursue the Demonstration
proposed from them, it may not be amisse, yea rather it may be very usefull,
to insist a little upon the <hi>Promises</hi> themselves, their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> that
we may be the more stirred up to enquire after every Truth, &amp; sweetnesse of
the Love, Grace, and kindnesse (they being the peculiar way chosen of God,
for the manifestation of his good will to sinners) that is in them; and I shall
doe it briefely, that I may proceed with the businesse of my present Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Gospell Promises then are,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> 1. The <hi>free,</hi> and gracious dispensations, and
2. Discoveries of Gods good will and Love to 3. Sinners, 4. through Christ,
5 In a Covenant of Grace, 6. Wherein upon his Truth and Faithfulnesse, he
engageth himselfe to be their God, to give his Sonne unto them, and for
them, and his Holy Spirit to abide with them, with all things that are either
required in them, or are necessary for them, to make them accepted before
him, and to bring them to an enjoyment of him.</p>
            <p>I call them <hi>Gospell Promises:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 4.</note> not as though they were onely contained in
the Bookes of the New Testament, or given only by Christ after his coming
in the flesh;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14, 15 Gal. 3. 17.</note> for they were given from the beginning of the World, or
first entrance of sinne:<note place="margin">Titus 1. 2.</note> and the Lord made plentifull provision of them and by
them for his People, under the Old Testament: but only to distinguish them
from the Promises of the Law, which hold out a word of Truth &amp; Faithfulnes
engaged for a reward of Life, to them that yeeld obedience thereunto (there
being an indissolveable connexion between entring into life, and keeping the
Commandements) and so to manifest,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 12. Luk. 2. 10.</note> that they all belong to the <hi>Gospell</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called,<note place="margin">Ephes 2. 15.</note> or the tidings of that peace for sinners, which was wrought
out,<note place="margin">Isa. 52. 7.</note> and manifested by Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>2. Farther, I doe not give this for the description of any one single, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
Promise, as it lyeth in any place of Scripture, as though it expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all the things mentioned therein (though vertually it doth so) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to shew what is the designe, ayme, and good will of God in them all,
which he discovers and manifests in them by severall <hi>parcells,</hi> according as
they may be suited to the Advancement of his Glory, in reference to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to whom they are made. Upon the matter, all the <hi>Promises of the Gospell</hi>
are but one, and every one of them comprehend, and tender the same Love,
the same Christ, the same Spirit, which are in them all. None can have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in any one, but he hath an interest in the <hi>good</hi> of them all, that being
only represented variously for the advantage of them that believe. My designe
is,<note place="margin">Gal. 16. 17.</note> to describe the generall intention of God in all <hi>Gospell Promises,</hi> whereby
they being equally <hi>Spirited,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12. Heb. 6. 17.</note> become as <hi>one;</hi> and concerning these I say.</p>
            <p>1. That they are <hi>free and Gracious</hi> as to the rise,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> and fountain of them. They
are <hi>given unto us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> meerely through the good will and pleasure of God. That
which is of <hi>Promise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3, 4.</note> is every where opposed to that, which is of <hi>doubt,</hi> or that
which is any way deserved or procured by us. <hi>Gal. 3. 18. If the inheritance be
of the Law,</hi> (which includes all that in us is desireable, acceptable and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59070:83"/>
it is <hi>no more of Promise,</hi> that is, <hi>free,</hi> and of meere Grace. He that can find
out any Reason, or cause without God himselfe, why he should promise any
good things whatever to Sinners, (as all are, &amp; are <hi>shut up under sinne, till the
Promise came,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22.) may be allowed to Glory in the invention which he
hath found out. A well conditioned Nature, necessitating him to a velleity
of doing good, and yeelding reliefe to them that are in misery (though just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>receiving the due reward of their deeds,</hi> which even among the Sonnes of
men, is a vertue dwelling upon the confines of vice) for their recovery, is by
some imposed on him. But that this is not the fountaine and rise of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
needs no other evidence, but the light of this Consideration. That,
which is naturall, is necessary, and universall: Promises are distinguishing as
to them in misery: at least they are given to men, and not to fallen Angells:
But may not God doe what he will with his own?</p>
            <p>Farther, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is himselfe in the Promise: he is the great originall
matter, and subject of the Promises; and the giving of him was doubtlesse of
free Grace and Mercy so <hi>Iohn 3. 16. God so Loved the World, that he gave his
only begotten Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Rom: 5. 8. God commendeth his Love towards us, in that
whilest we were Sinners, Christ died for us:</hi> and in the first of <hi>Ioh: 4. 10. Herein is
Love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 26.</note> 
               <hi>not that we Loved God, but that he Loved us, and sent his Sonne to be a
Propitiation for us.</hi> All is laid upon the account of Love, and free Grace. I
confesse there are <hi>following Promises,</hi> given out for the orderly carrying on of
the persons, to whom the maine <hi>originall</hi> fundamentall Promises are made,
unto the end designed for them, that seeme to have <hi>Qualifications</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in them; but yet even those are all to be resolved into the Primitive
grant of Mercy. That which promiseth Life upon believing, being of use to
stirre men up unto, and carry them on, in Faith and Obedience, must yet as to
the pure nature of the Promise be resolved into that, which <hi>freely</hi> is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>viz.</hi> Christ himselfe, and with him both Faith, and Life, Believing, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
As in your <hi>Automata,</hi> there is one <hi>originall</hi> spring or wheele, that give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
motion to sundry lesser and subordinate movers, that are carried on with
great variety, sometimes with a seeming contrariety one to another, but all
regularly answering, and being subservient to the impression of the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The first great Promise of Christ,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15. 16</note> and all good things in him, is that
which <hi>Spirits</hi> and principles all other Promises whatsoever;<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10. Isa. 9. 6.</note> and howsoever they may seem to move upon <hi>conditionall termes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> yet they are all to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into that absolute, and free Originall Spring. Hence that great Grant of
Gospell Mercy, is called the Gift by him. <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. 16, 17. yea all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Law, as to their Originall Emanation from God, and the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the reward in them ingaged to be bestowed for the services requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
are free and Gracious. There is not any naturall indispensable connexion
between Obedience and Reward,<note place="margin">Diatr. de Iust. Div.</note> as there is between Sinne and Punishment:
as I have elsewhere at large Disputed, and Proved.</p>
            <p>2. I call them <hi>Discoveries and Manifestations of Gods Good-will and Love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
which is the prime, and <hi>sole</hi> cause of all the good things, which are wrapped
up, and contained in them. Of this <hi>Good-will</hi> of God, the Promises, which he
hath given, are the sole discoveries: We doe not in this Discourse take Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
meerely for what God hath said he <hi>Will</hi> doe in termes, expresly, but
for every Assertion of his Good will and Kindnesse to us in Christ, all which
was first held out under a word of Promise. <hi>Gen:</hi> 3. 15. And this the Apostle
inferres in <hi>Tit. 1. 2, 3. In hope of eternall life, which God, that cannot lye, promised
before the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> World beganne, but hath in due time manifested his Word through
Preaching;</hi> or discovered, or made known that good will of his, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in Preaching of the Gospell. And to this extent of significancy is that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59070:84"/>
Promise in the Scripture, both name and thing, in very many places stretched
out: Every thing whatever, that is manifestative of Grace and good will to
Sinners, is of the Promise, though it be not cast into a Promissory forme of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
Yea whereas strictly a Promise respecteth that, which is, either only
future, and not of present existence, or the continuance of that which is; yet
even expressions of things formerly done, and of a present performance, (some
Individuals to the end of the World being to be made a new partakers of the
Grace, good will, and Mercy in them,) doe belong to the Promise also, in
that Acceptation of it, which the Holy Ghost in many places leads unto, and
which we now insist upon.<note place="margin">Mica. 7. 17, 18, 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. I say they are <hi>made unto sinners,</hi> and that <hi>as sinners,</hi> under no other
<hi>Qualification</hi> whatever: it being by the Mercy of the Promise alone, that any
men are relieved out of that condition of being sinners, and morally nothing
else. Were not the Promises <hi>originally</hi> made to sinners,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 12.</note> there would never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one be found in any other state or Condition.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note> I know there are Promises
made to Believers,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 22.</note> even such as are unchangeable, and shall beare them into
the bosome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I say these are all <hi>consequentiall,</hi> and upon suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>first</hi> and great Promise, whereby Christ himselfe, and Faith, for his
sake is bestowed on them. This runs through them all, as the very tenor of
them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16. Rom. 8. 32.</note> and method of God in them do manifest, as we shall see afterwards. So
the Apostle. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22: <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor: 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
by Faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that Believe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> All are shut
up under sinne,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 3.</note> untill the Promise of Salvation by Jesus Christ, and Faith in
him, cometh in for their deliverance. The Promise is given to them as shut
up under sinne, which they receive by mixing it with Faith. And <hi>Rom:</hi> 3. 23.
24. <hi>All have sinned and come short of the Glory of God, being justified freely by
his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ.</hi> Their condition is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of sinne, and <hi>falling short of the glory of God,</hi> when the Promise for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is given unto them, and finds them. Thence the Lord tells us <hi>Isai:</hi> 54.
8, 9. that this Promise of mercy is like that, which he made about the <hi>waters
of Noah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen: 5. 21, 22</note> where is mentioned no condition at all of it, but only the sinnes of
men. And in that state unquestionably was <hi>Adam,</hi> when the first Promise
was given unto him. To say then, that Gospell Promises are made to men in
such <hi>conditions,</hi> and are to be made good only upon the account of mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
in the <hi>condition,</hi> wherein they are when the Promise is made to them;
is to say,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 4, 5, 8.</note> that for men to leave the state of sinne, is the way to frustrate all the
Promises of God. All deliverance from a state of sinne is by Grace: all Grace
is of Promise: under that condition then of sinne doth the Promise find men,
and from thence relieve them.</p>
            <p>4. I say,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> these <hi>Discoveries of Gods good Will</hi> are made <hi>through Christ,</hi> as the only
<hi>medium</hi> of their Accomplishment,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> and only <hi>procuring cause</hi> of the good things
that flowing from the good will of God are enwrapped and tendred in them.
And they are said to be in Christ: as 1. The <hi>great Messenger of the Covenant,</hi>
as in him who comes from the Father; because God hath confirmed and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
them all in him: not in themselves, but unto us. He hath in him, and by
him given <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of them all unto us, declaring and confirming
his good Will and Love to us by him: He reveals the Father (as a Father)
from his own Bosome: <hi>Ioh:</hi> 1. 18. declaring his name, or Grace unto his. <hi>Ioh:</hi> 17
3. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. In whom all the Promises of God are yea, and in him amen, to the
Glory of God by us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh: 17. 3.</note> In him, and by his Mediation, they have all their Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
Establishment, and unchangeablenesse unto us. And 2. Because he
hath undertaken to be <hi>Surety</hi> of that Covenant, whereof they are the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<hi>Heb: 7. 24. He is the Surety of the Covenant,</hi> that is, one who hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59070:84"/>
both on the part of God and ours, what ever is needfull for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof. 3. Because that <hi>himselfe</hi> is the great Subject of all these Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and in him (it being of his own Purchase and procuring, he <hi>having obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Eternall Redemption</hi> for us, <hi>Heb:</hi> 9.)<note place="margin">John 1. 16.</note> there is treasured up all the fulnesse of
those Mercies,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 18, 19.</note> which in <hi>them</hi> God hath graciously engaged himselfe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow;
<note place="margin">cap. 2, 10. &amp;c.</note> they being all annexed to him, as the portion he brings with him to the
Soule.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> Then I say,</p>
            <p>5. <hi>That they are discoveries of Gods good will, in a Covenant of Grace:</hi> they
are indeed the Branches, Streames, and manifesting conveyances of the Grace
of that Covenant, and of the Good Will of God, putting it selfe forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Hence the Apostle mentions the <hi>Covenant of Promise. Ephes:</hi> 2. 12. either
for the <hi>Promises of the Covenant,</hi> or its manifestation, as I said before Indeed
as to the Subject-Matter and eminently, the Promise is but one, as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is no more; but both come under a <hi>plurall Expression,</hi> because they have
been variously delivered, and renewed upon severall occasions So the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, is said to be <hi>established upon these Promises: Heb:</hi> 8. 6. that is,
the Grace and Mercy of the Covenant, and the usefulnesse of it to the Ends of
a Covenant, to keep God and man together in Peace and Agreement, is laid
upon these Promises, to be by them confirmed and established unto us: God
having by them revealed his Good Will unto us, with an attendency of stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of duty. Their use, for the begetting and continuing Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and us, with the concomitancy of precepts, places them in the
capacity of a Covenant.</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p>6. I mentioned the foundation of the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Vnchangeablenesse</hi> of
these Promises, with our Assurance of their Accomplishment. The Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Undertakings of God; upon his <hi>Truth and Faithfulnesse,</hi> is the
stock, and unmoveable foundation of this respect of them. Therefore speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, the Holy Ghost often backs them with that Property of God: <hi>He
cannot lye,</hi> so <hi>Heb: 6. 17. 18. God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
Promise, the immutability of his Councell, confirmed it by an Oath, that by two
immutable things, wherein it was not possible for God to lye &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Tit: 1. 2. God,
which cannot lye, hath promised us eternall life.</hi> There is no one makes a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Promise, but as it ought to proceed from him in sincerity and Truth,
so he engageth his Truth and Faithfulnesse, in all the credit of them, for the
Accomplishment thereof, what lyeth in him. And on this account, doth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
so often appeale unto,<note place="margin">Psal. 31. 1. 5. 14.</note> and call upon the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of God, as to the
fulfilling of his Promises,<note place="margin">Isa: 45. 19. 2 Pet: 1. 1.</note> and the word, which he caused him to put his trust
in. It is because of his engagement of his Truth and Faithfulnesse, whence it
becometh a <hi>righteous thing</hi> with him, to performe what he hath spoken. How
farre this Respect of the Promises extends, and wherein it is capable of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation,
is the summe of our present Controversy: but of this afterwards.
Then,</p>
            <p>7. A briefe description of the <hi>Matter</hi> of these Promises, and what God freely
engageth himselfe unto in them, was insisted on. Of this, of the Promises in
this regard, there is one <hi>maine Fountaine or Spring,</hi> whereof there are two <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Streames,</hi> whence <hi>Thousands</hi> of refreshing <hi>Rivolets</hi> doe flow. The <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Fountaine</hi> and spring of all good unto us, both in respect of its being
and manifestation, is, that He <hi>will be our God. Gen: 17. 1, 2. I am Almighty God:
walke before me, and be thou perfect, and I will make my Covenant.</hi> So every
where, as the bottome of his dealing with us in <hi>Covenant Ierem: 31. 33. I will
be their God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos: 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and they shall be my People, Isai:</hi> 54. 5. And in very many other
places. Now that he may thus be our God, two things are required.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59070:85"/>
1. That all <hi>Breaches,</hi> and Differences between him and us be removed,
perfect Peace and Agreement made, and we rendred acceptable, and well
pleasing in his sight. These are the termes, whereon they stand to whom he is
a God in Covenant: For the Accomplishment of this, is the first <hi>maine streame,</hi>
that floweth from the former Fountaine, namely the <hi>great Promise</hi> of giving
Christ <hi>to</hi> us, and <hi>for</hi> us, <hi>who is Peace: Ephes. 2. 14. And who of God is made unto
us Wisdome, Righteousnesse, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor: 1. 30. <hi>Who
loves us, and washeth us in his owne blood, and makes us Kings, and Priests to
God and his Father. Revel: 1. 6. Giving himselfe for his Church, that he might
purify, and cleanse it, with the washing of water, by the word, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it to himselfe a glorious Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5, 26, 27</note> 
               <hi>not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,
but that it should be Holy and without blemish.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> Doing and accomplishing all
things,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> that are required for the fore-mentioned Ends; And this is the first
<hi>maine Streame,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 19. 25.</note> that flowes from that Fountaine. Christ as a Redeemer,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14.</note> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 17.</note> a Mighty one, a Priest, a Sacrifice, an Oblation, a Ransome, our Peace,
Righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 2. 1 Tim. 2. 6.</note> and the Author of our Salvation, is the Subject matter
thereof.</p>
            <p>2. That we may be kept and preserved meet for communion with him,
as <hi>our God,</hi> and for the enjoyment of him, as our Reward. For this End, flows
forth the other great Streame from the former Fountaine, namely, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which he gives us, to <hi>make us meet for the inheritance
with the Saints in Light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 11.</note> to put forth and exercise towards us, all the Acts of his
Love, which are needfull for us, and to worke in us the Obedience, which he
requires, and accepts of us in Jesus Christ, so preserving us for himselfe. This
Promise of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Covenant,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 21.</note> with his worke and peculiar dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 21.</note> is plentifully witnessed in very many places of the Old Testament, and
New;<note place="margin">Ch. 36. 26, 27</note> some whereof must afterwards be insisted on: Hence he is sometimes
called the <hi>Promise of the Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 15, 16. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Acts 2. 59. The Promise is to you;</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is that which Christ receiveth from his Father <hi>v:</hi> 33. even the <hi>Promise of
the Holy Ghost.</hi> I shall only adde, that though this be a great Streame, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the first Fountaine, yet it comes not immediately thence, but issues
out from the Streame before mentioned, the Promise of the Lord Jesus Christ;
for he is given by him unto us,<note place="margin">John 14. 16. Gal. 4. 6.</note> as procured for us, and given only unto
his.</p>
            <p>Now from these two <hi>grand Streames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 8.</note> doe a thousand <hi>Rivulets</hi> flow forth for
our refreshment. All the mercy that Christ hath purchased, all the Graces
that the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth bring forth, (which in the former description I call, <hi>all
things, that are either required in them, or needfull to them, to make them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before God, and to bring them to an enjoyment of him</hi>) all Promises of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Forgivenesse, all Promises of Faith and Holinesse, of Obedience and
Perseverance, of Joy and Consolation, of Correction, Affliction, and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
they all flow from these: that is, from the <hi>matter</hi> of those Promises,
doth the matter of these arise, and hence are the ensuing Corollaries.</p>
            <p>1. Who ever hath an interest in any one Promise, hath an interest in
them all, and in the Fountaine-Love, from whence they flow. He to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
droppe of their sweetnesse floweth, may follow it up unto the Spring:
Were we wise, each tast of Mercy would lead us to the Ocean of Love. Have
we any hold on a Promise, we may get upon it, and it will bring us to the
<hi>Maine,</hi> Christ himselfe, and the Spirit, and so into the bosome of the Father.
It is our folly to abide upon a little, which is given us meerely to make us
presse for more.</p>
            <p>2. That the most <hi>Conditionall</hi> Promises, are to be resolved into absolute,
and inconditionall Love. God, who hath promised <hi>life</hi> upon <hi>Believing,</hi> hath
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59070:85"/>
promised <hi>Believing,</hi> on no Condition (on our parts) at all, because to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>This
in generall being given in,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of the Promises, I
shall proceed to some such Considerations, as are of particular usefulnesse unto
that improvement, which (the Lord assisting) I intend to make of them, for
the confirmation of the Truth under debate. And they are these,</p>
            <p>1. All the Promises of God are <hi>true,</hi> and faithfull, and shall most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely,
all of them be accomplished. His nature, his veracity, his Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geablenesse,
his Omniscience, and Omnipotency, do all contribute strength
to this assertion. Neither can these Properties possibly continue intire, and
the honour of them be preserved unto the Lord, if the least failing in
the Accomplishment of his Promises be ascribed unto him. Every such <hi>fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
must of necessity relate to some such <hi>Principle,</hi> as stands in direct Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to one or more of the perfections before mentioned. It must be a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Truth, Unchangeablenesse, Prescience, or Power, that must frustrate
the Promise of any one. We indeed often alter our Resolutions, and the
Promise that is gon out of our mouthes, and that (perhaps) righteously,
upon some such change of things, as we could not foresee, nor ought to have
supposed, when we entred into our engagements. No such thing can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
unto him, who knowes all things, with their Circumstances, that can
possibly come to passe, and hath determined, what shall so do, and therefore
will not engage in any Promise that he knowes, something, which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
would follow after, would cause him to alter. It were a ludicrous thing
in any sonne of man, to make a solemne Promise of any thing to another, if
he particularly knew, that in an hower some such thing would happen, as
should enforce him to change, and alter that promise, which he had so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
entred into. And shall we ascribe such an action to him, before whom
all things are open, and naked? Shall he be thought solemnely to engage
himselfe to do, or accomplish any thing, which yet not only he will not do,
but also at that instant hath those things in his eye, and under his Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for which he will not so do, as he Promiseth, and determined before
that he would not so do. If this be not unworthy the infinite Goodnesse, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Faithfullnesse of God, I know not what can, or may be ascribed
unto him, that is. Yea the Truth, and veracity of God in his Promises cannot
be <hi>denyed</hi> him, without denying him his Deity, or <hi>asserted,</hi> without the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Accomplishment of what he hath Promised.</p>
            <p>2. There are sundry things relating to the Accomplishment of Promises,
as to <hi>Times, Seasons, Persons, Wayes, &amp;c.</hi> wherein <hi>we</hi> have beene in the darke,
and yet the <hi>Promises</hi> concerning them be fully accomplished. The rejection
of the <hi>Jewes</hi> supplyes us with an instance pregnant with this objection; The
Apostle tells us, that with many this Objection did arise on that Account:
If the <hi>Jewes</hi> be rejected, then the Promises of God to them do faile. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9.
He layes downe, and answers this Objection, discovering that fallacy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by a distinction. <hi>They are not</hi> (saith he) <hi>all Israel that are of Israel. v.</hi> 7, 8. As
if he had said, there is a twofold <hi>Israel,</hi> an <hi>Israel</hi> after the <hi>flesh onely,</hi> and an
<hi>Israel</hi> after the <hi>flesh and Spirit also.</hi> Unto these latter were the Promises made;
and therefore they who looke on the former only, thinke it faileth, whereas
indeed it holdeth its full accomplishment. So he disputes againe <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. 7.
I say then we may be in the <hi>darke,</hi> as to many <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of Promises, when yet they have received a most exact accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>3. All the <hi>Conditionall</hi> Promises of God are exactly true, and shall be most
faithfully made good by accomplishment, as to that wherein their being as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59070:86"/>
Promises doth consist, as farre as they are declarative of Gods Purpose and
intendment. This is that, which (as I said before,) some object; Many of the
Promises of God are <hi>Conditionall,</hi> and their truth must needs depend upon
the Accomplishment of the Condition mentioned in them: if that be not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
then they also must faile, and be of none effect. I say then that
even the <hi>Conditionall</hi> Promises of God, are <hi>Absolutely</hi> made good. The
truth of any Promise consists in this, that that whereof it speakes, answers
the Affirmation it selfe. For instance; <hi>He that believeth shall be saved.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
doth not <hi>Primarily</hi> affirme that any one shall be saved, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it, no one might so be: but only this it affirmes, that there is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
connexion betweene Faith and Salvation: and therein is the Promise
most true, whither any one believe or no. Breifely, Conditionall Promises
are either simply declarative of the <hi>Will</hi> of God, in fixing an exact correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
betweene a Condition mentioned and required in them, and the thing
promised by them, in which case they have an Unchangeable &amp; infallible veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in themselves, as there is in all the Promises of the Morall Law to this day;
for he that keeps the Commandements shall live or they are also the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the <hi>Goodwill</hi> of God, his intendments and Purposes, that, whereof they
make mention, being not the Condition, whereon his Purposes are suspended,
but the way and meanes, whereby the thing promised is to be accomplished:
and in the latter Acceptation alone are they (in the businesse in hand) our
concernment.</p>
            <p>4.<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> That the Promises concerning <hi>Perseverance</hi> (as hath been often inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
are of two sorts. The first, of the Continuance of the Favour of God
to us; which respects our <hi>Justification.</hi> The other, of the continuance of our
Obedience unto God; which respects our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Let us consider both
of them, and begin with the latter.</p>
            <p>1. Of them, I say then, they are all <hi>Absolute,</hi> not one of them <hi>Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
(so as to be suspended, as to their accomplishment, on any Conditions)
nor can be; The <hi>Truth</hi> of God in them, hath not its efficiency and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
by establishing the relation that is between one thing and another,
or the connexion, that is betweene duty and reward, as it is in Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Promises that are purely and meerely so: but inforceth the exact fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the thing promised, and that with respect unto, and for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Glory of that Excellency of God, <hi>He cannot lye.</hi> Let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
what that Condition, or those Conditions be, or may be, on which
Promises of this nature should be suspended, and the Truth of the former
Assertions will evidently appeare: That God hath Promised unto Believers,
that they shall for ever abide with him, in the Obedience of the Covenant
unto the End, shall afterwards be proved by a cloud of Witnesses. What
now is the Condition, whereon this Promise doth depend? It is (saies Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win)
That they performe their duty, that they suffer not themselves to be seduced,
nor willingly cast of the yoake of Christ;</hi> But what doth this amount unto? Is it
not thus much, if they abide with God, (for if they performe their Duty,
and not suffer themselves to be seduced, nor willingly depart from God, they
abide with him) God hath promised, that they shall abide with him. Upon
Condition they abide with him, he hath promised they shall; <hi>egregia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verò lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>
Can any thing more ridiculous be invented? If men abide with God, what
need they any Promise, that they shall so do? The whole virtue of the Promise
depends on that condition &amp; that condition, conteineth all that is promised:
neither is it possible that any thing can be invented to be supplyed as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or conditions of these Promises, but it will quickly appeare upon consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that, how ever it may be differently phrased, yet indeed it is coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59070:86"/>
with the matter of the Promise it selfe. That condition, or those conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must consist in some Act, Acts, Way or Course of acceptable Obedience in
them, to whom the Promises are made: This the nature of the thing it selfe
requireth. Now every such Act, way, or course is the matter of the Promise,
even universall Obedience. Now if one man should promise another, that he
should at such a time and place be supplyed with an hundred pounds to pay
his Debts, on condition that he came and brought the Monies himselfe, ought
he to be esteemed to have a mind to relieve the poore man, or to mock him?
To affirme, that, when God promiseth to write his Law in our Hearts, to put
his Feare in our inward parts, to Create in us a New Heart, to circumcise our
Hearts that we may feare him alwaies, to give us his Spirit to abide with us
for ever, to preserve us by his Power, so that we shall never leave him nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him, shall live to him, and sinne shall not have dominion over us &amp;c. he
doth it upon condition, that we write his Law in our hearts, Circumcise them,
continue to feare Him, abide with Him, not forsake him, &amp;c. is to make him
to mock and deride at their misery, whose reliefe he so seriously pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
What ever Promises then of this kind (Promises of working Obedience
in us, for our abiding with him) shall be produced, they will be found to be
Absolute, &amp; independent on any condition whatever, &amp; their Truth no waies
to be maintained, but in and by their Accomplishment.</p>
            <p>2. For those of the first sort,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> which I shall now handle, farther to cleare
the foundation of their ensuing Application, I shall propose only some few
things unto consideration. As,</p>
            <p>1. That they are not to be taken, or looked upon, as to their use for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in the present Controversy, separated and divided from those other
Promises formerly insisted on, which assure Believers, that they shall alwaies
abide with God, as to their Obedience: all hope that any have to prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, is by dividing of them. It is a very vaine supposall and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sand, which our Adversaries build their inferences upon, which they
make against the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Impossibility
that God should continue his Love and Favour to them, whilest they wallow
in all manner of Abominations, and desperate Rebellions against him: An
Hypothesis crudely imposed on our Doctrine, and repeated over and over, as
a matter of the greatest detestation, and abomination, that can fall within
the thoughts of men. And such supposalls and conclusions are made thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as border at least upon the cursed cost of Blasphemy, but <hi>cui fini,</hi> I pray?
To what end is all this noyse? as though any had ever Asserted, that God
promised to continue his Love and gracious Acceptation alwaies to his Saints,
and yet took no care, nor had promised, that they should be continued
Saints: but would suffer them to turne very Devills. It is as easy for men to
confute <hi>Hypotheses</hi> created in their own imaginations, as to cast downe <hi>men
of straw</hi> of their own framing, and setting up. We say indeed, that God hath
faithfully promised, that he will never leave nor forsake Believers; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that he hath no lesse faithfully engaged himselfe, that they shall never
<hi>wickedly depart from him,</hi> but that they shall continue Saints and Believers.
Yea (if I may so say) Promising alwaies to accept them freely, it is incumbent
on his Holy Majesty, upon the account of his Truth, Faithfulnesse, and
Righteousnesse, to preserve them such, as without the least dishonour to his
Grace, and Holinesse, yea to the greatest advantage of his Glory, he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
accept them, delight in them, and rejoyce over them: and so he tells us
he doth, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.7: <hi>Yea I have loved thee with an everlasting Love, therefore
with loving kindnesse have I drawne thee:</hi> he drawes us with his kindnesse, to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59070:87"/>
follow him, obey him, live unto him, abide with him, because he <hi>Loves</hi> us
with an Everlasting Love.</p>
            <p>2. That these promises of God doe not properly, and as to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
rise, depend on any <hi>conditions</hi> in Believers, or by them to be fulfilled, but
are the Fountains, and Springs of all conditions whatever, that
are required to be in them, or expected from them; though the Grace
and Obedience of Believers are often mentioned in them, as the means,
whereby they are carried on according to the appointment of God, unto the
enjoyment (or continued in it) of what is promised. This one Consideration,
that there is in very many of these Promises, an expresse <hi>non obstante,</hi> or a
not-withstanding the want of any such condition, as might seeme to be at the
bottome, and to be the <hi>occasion</hi> of any such Promise, or Engagement of the
Grace of God, is sufficient to give light and evidence to this Assertion. If the
Lord sayeth expresly, that he will doe <hi>so</hi> with men, though it be not <hi>so</hi> with
them, his doing of <hi>that thing</hi> cannot depend on any <hi>such thing</hi> in them, as he
saith, notwithstanding the want of it, he will doe it. Take one instance, <hi>Isai.</hi>
54. v. 9, 10. <hi>In a little wrath have I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with
everlasting kindnesse will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord they Redeemer: for
this is as the waters of Noah unto mee; whereas I have sworne, that the waters of
Noah shall no more cover the Earth, so have I sworne that I will not be worth with
thee, nor rebuke thee: for the mountaines shall depart, aud the hills be removed,
but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my peace
be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> He will have mercy on
them with everlasting kindnesse <hi>v.</hi> 8. Yea, but how if they walke not worthy
of it? Why yet this kindnesse shall not faile, saith the Lord: for it is as the
<hi>waters of Noah:</hi> God sweareth that the <hi>waters of Noah should no more cover the
Earth,</hi> and you see the stability of what he hath spoken. The World is now
reserved for Fire, but drowned it shall be no more: my kindnesse to thee
(saies God) is such. it shall nor more depart from thee, then those <hi>waters</hi> shall
returne againe upon the Earth. Neither is this all, wherein he compareth his
kindnesse to the <hi>waters of Noah,</hi> but in this also, in that in the Promise of
drowning the World no more, there was an expresse <hi>non obstante</hi> for the
sinnes of men. <hi>Gen. 8 21. The Lord said in his heart, I will not againe curse the
ground any more for mans sake, for the imagination of mans heart is evill from his
youth.</hi> Though men grow full of wickednesse and violence, as before the
Flood they were, yet saith the Lord, <hi>the World shall be drowned no more.</hi> And
in this doth the Promise of kindnesse hold proportion with that of the waters
of <hi>Noah:</hi> there is an expresse reliefe in it, against the sinnes and failings of
them, to whom it is made, <hi>viz.</hi> such as he will permit them to fall into,
whilest he certainly preserves them from all such, as are inconsistent with his
Love and Favour, according to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace: and
therefore it depends not on any thing in them, being made with a proviso
for any such defect, as in them may be imagined.</p>
            <p>3. To affirme that these Promises of God's abiding with us to the end do
depend on any <hi>condition,</hi> that may be uncertaine in its event, by us to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
as to their Accomplishment, doth wholly enervate and make them
void in respect of the <hi>maine end,</hi> for which they were given us of God. That
one chiefe end of them is to give the Saints consolation in every condition,
in all the straights, tryalls, and temptations, which they are to undergoe, or
may be called to, is evident. When <hi>Ioshua</hi> was entring upon the great work
of subduing the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and setting the Tabernacle, and people of God
in their appointed Inheritance, wherein he was to passe through innumerable
difficulties, tryalls, and pressures, God gives him that word of Promise, <hi>I will
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59070:87"/>
never leave thee, nor forsake thee. Iosua</hi> 1.5. so are many of them made to the
Saints in their weaknesse, darknesse, and desertions, as will appeare by the
consideration of the particular instances following.<note place="margin">Isa. 4. 3, 4.</note> Now what one drop of
consolation can a poore drooping tempted soule squeeze out of such Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that depend wholly and solely upon any thing within themselves: he will
be with mee and be my God, it is true: but alwaies provided, that I continue
to be his: That also is a sweet and gratious Promise; but that I shall doe so, he
hath not promised; It seems I have a <hi>cursed Liberty</hi> left me, of departing
wickedly from him; so that upon the matter, notwithstanding these Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his, I am left to my selfe; If I will abide with him, well and good, he will
abide with me, and so it shall be well with mee: That <hi>he</hi> should so abide with
<hi>me,</hi> as to cause <hi>me</hi> to abide with <hi>him,</hi> it seemes there is no such thing; Soule
look to thy selfe; all they hopes and help is in thy selfe: but alas! for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
I have no sence of this Love of God, and I know not that I haue any true,
reall, unfained Obedience to him. Corruption is strong, Temptations are
many, what shall I say? Shall I exercise Faith on those Promises of God,
wherein he hath said, and given Assurance, that <hi>he will be a God to me for ever?</hi>
According as my thoughts are of my own abiding with him, so may I think
of them, and no otherwise; so that I am againe rolled upon mine own hands,
and left to mine own endeavours, to extricate my selfe from these sad intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements.
What now becomes of the <hi>Consolation,</hi> which in these Promises is
intended? Are they not on this account rather flints, and pieces of Iron, then
Breasts of comfort and joy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if it be so as is supposed, it is evident, that God makes no Promises
unto <hi>Persons,</hi> but only unto <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Qualifications,</hi> that is, His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are not engagements of his love &amp; Goodwill to Believers, but discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of his Apporbation of <hi>Believing:</hi> suppose any Promise of God, to be our
God, our allsufficient God for ever, non eminently to include an engagement
for the effectuall exertion of the alsufficiency to preserve and continue us, in
such a state and spirituall condition, as wherein he may with the Glory and
Honor of his Grace (and will not faile to) abide and continue our God, and
you cut all the nerves and sinewes of it, as to the Administration of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
unto them to whom it is given. The Promises must be made good:
that is Certaine: and if they are accomplished, or not accomplished unto
men, meerely upon the account of such, and such <hi>Qualifications</hi> in them,
which if they are not found, then they shall be fulfilled; if not, then they are
suspended: they are made to the Conditions, and not at all to the Persons.
And though some perhaps will easily grant this, yet upon this account it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said, that God ever made any one Promise unto his <hi>Church,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of such persons, namely <hi>Abraham and his Seed;</hi> which is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that of the Apostle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. Where he calleth the Elect, <hi>the Children
of the Promises,</hi> or those to whom the Promises were made. It appears then,
that neither are <hi>these</hi> Promises of God <hi>Conditionall.</hi> As they proceed from
free Grace, so there is no other accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, on which they are given out, continued
and accomplished towards the Children of God. Though the things of the
Promise are often placed in dependence one of another, as Meanes and Ends,
yet the Promises themselves are absolute.</p>
            <p>These few things being premised,<note place="margin">§: 11.</note> I shall now name and insist upon some
<hi>particular Promises,</hi> wherein the Lord hath graciously engaged himself that he
will abide to be a <hi>God in Covenant</hi> unto his People, &amp; their Guide unto death:
from which I shall labour to make good this Argument, for the <hi>Perseverance
of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which that God, who cannot lye, nor deceive, with whom is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59070:88"/>
nor shadow of turning, who is Faithfull in all his Promises, and all whose
words are Truth and Faithfullnesse,<note place="margin">Titus 1. 2. Heb. 6. 18. Jam. 1. 18. 1 Cor. 1. 9.</note> hath solemnely promised and engaged himselfe
unto, to this end, that they, unto whom he so promiseth and engageth himselfe, may
from those Promises receive strong Consolation; That he will certainely performe
and Accomplish. That he will be a God and a Guide unto death unto his Saints,
that he will never leave them nor forsake them, that he will never cast them off,
nor leave them out of his favour, but will preserve them such as is meet for his
Holy Majestie to embrace, Love, and delight in, and that with an expresse <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding</hi>
for every such thing, as might seeme to provoke him to forsake them;
He hath Promised, and for the end mentioned. Therefore that he will so abide with
them, that his Love shall be continued to them to the End, that he will Preserve
them unto himselfe &amp;c. according to his Truth and Faithfullnesse, shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
and fulfilled. <hi>The inference hath its strength from the</hi> Nature, Truth
<hi>and</hi> Faithfulnesse <hi>of God: and whilest they abide in any credit with the
somes of men, it may seeme strange, that it should be denyed or questioned.
The major proposition of the forementioned Argument is examined by Mr</hi>
Goodwin Cap. 11. Sect. 1. <hi>Pag. 225. saith he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. What God hath promised in his Word,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> is certaine in such a sence, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Termes, as God would be understood in his Promises; but what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in one sence, is not certaine of performance in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Doubtlesse Gods meaning and intention in his Promises is the
Rule of their accomplishment. This sometimes we may not be able to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome:
and thereupon be exposed to Temptations not a few, concerning
their fulfilling, so was it with them with whom <hi>Paul</hi> had to do, in reference
to the Promises made to the <hi>Seed of Abraham.</hi> The Question then is not
whither that which is promised in <hi>one</hi> sence, shall be performed in <hi>another:</hi>
but whither God's Promises have, and shall certainely have, all of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his intendment, any performance at all. And the aime of Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> in the Example, that he afterwards produceth, is not to manifest
that that which God promiseth, shall certainely be performed only in that
sence, wherein he made his Promise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but that they may be performed, or not
performed at all. It is not in <hi>whose</hi> sence they shall have their performance, but
whither they shall have <hi>any</hi> performance, or no. If the thing promised be not
accomplished, the Promise is not at all <hi>in any sence</hi> performed; unlesse Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> will distinguish, and say, there are two wayes of any things perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
<hi>one</hi> whereby it is performed; <hi>another,</hi> whereby it is not. But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes
to manifest this Assertion by an indction of instances.</p>
            <p>God <hi>(saith he)</hi> promised to Paul the lives of them that were in the Ship:<note place="margin">Acts 27.</note> his
intent and meaning was not, that they should all be preserved, against what ever
they in the Ship might do to hinder that Promise, but with this proviso or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that they in the Ship should harken unto him, and follow his advice:
which is evident from those words of Paul, Except these abide in the Ship, yee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be saved: And had they gone away, God had not made any breach of Promise,
though they had been all drowned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First when men seriously promise any thing, which is wholly, and
absolutely in their power to Accomplish &amp; bring about, causing thereby good
men to rest upon their words, &amp; to declare unto others their repose upon their
honesty and worth; if they do not make good what they have spoken, we
account them unworthy promise breakers, and they do it at the perill of all
the repute of honesty, honor, and Faith they have in the world. With God it
seemes it is otherwise; He makes a solemne Gracious Promise to <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>the
lives of all them in the Ship with him, should be saved: Paul</hi> on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was as much
incumbent as on any man in the world not to engage the name of God (that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59070:88"/>
God whom he worshiped and Preached) in any thing, whose truth might in
the least be lyable to exception, being in the way of declaring a new Doctrine
to the world,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 15. &amp; 17. 24. 1 Tim: 4. 10.</note> which would have beene everlastingly prejudiced by any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision
of the Faithfulnesse of that God, in whose name &amp; Authority he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
it. The summe of that Doctrine also being the exaltation of that God,
in opposition to all the pretended Deities of the world: He (I say) boasts
himselfe upon the Promises that he had received,<note place="margin">vers. 22, 23.</note> that there should be <hi>no
losse of any mans life among them, v. 22. v.</hi> 25. he gives the reason of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
Assertion, when all hope was taken away, <hi>v. 20. I believe God</hi> (saith
he) <hi>that it shall be even as it was told me;</hi> His Faith in God was in reference to
the event, that it should come to passe, as it was told him. Faith in God,
Divine Faith can have nothing for its Object, that may faile it. He doth not
say, that he believes that God will be <hi>Faithfull</hi> to his Promise in Generall, but
also tells them wherein his Faithfulnesse doth consist, even in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
and accomplishment of that which he had promised. This he informes
the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and the rest in the ship with him: and if in the issue it had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
fallen out, there had not beene any colour of Justifying the Faith of
that God he served, or his owne truth in being witnesse to him. Had any
perished, those that remained would have argued him of lying. Yea but saith
he not himself, <hi>except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved?</hi> He did so indeed,
and thereby declared the necessity of using sutable <hi>meanes,</hi> when Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
affordes them to us, for the Accomplishment of appointed determined
ends. God, who Promiseth any thing, and affordeth meanes for the attaining
of it, will direct them to whom those Promises are made, to the use of those
meanes, as he doth the <hi>Centurion</hi> by <hi>Paul;</hi> It being incumbent in this case
on his Holy Majesty, upon the account of his <hi>engaged Faithfulnesse</hi> to save
them, he will yet have them subservient to his Promise in their endeavours
for their owne safety. Meanes may be assigned for an End, as to their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
subserviency thereunto, without any suspending of the Event on them, as
a condition of an uncertaine issue and Accomplishment. And therefore that
this solemne Promise made unto <hi>Paul,</hi> whose Event and Accomplishment, up
on the account of his believing God, he absolutely believed, &amp; whose perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
he foretold with out the least intimation of any Condition whatever,
(only he bids them not throw away the meanes of their Preservation) should
depend, as to its fulfilling, on such a Condition, as in respect of the event
might not have beene, (God who made the Promise not making any infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
provision for the Condition) and so have beene actually frustrate, is an
Assertion, not only not grounded on these words of <hi>Paul,</hi> setting out the suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meanes of the providence of God for the accomplishment of an appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
end, but also derogatory in the highest to the Glory of the Truth and
Faithfulnesse of God himselfe. But</p>
            <p>3. That Promise, <hi>(saith he)</hi> of our Saviour to his Disciples. Mat. 19. 28. That
they who followed him in the Regeneration, should sit upon twelve thrones Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the twelve tribes of Israel, Judas being yet one of them, was not fulfilled, and
in case the rest had declined, they also with him might have come short of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ knew <hi>what was in man,</hi> and had no need of any to tell him,
he knew from the beginning who it was that should betray him, and plainely
pronounced him to be a Divell; He knew he was so, that he <hi>Believed not;</hi> that
he would continue so,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 64, 70, 7. 1.</note> 
               <hi>he would betray him,</hi> that his end would be desperate;
be pronounced a curse upon him, as being <hi>cursed by David: Ps.</hi> 109. so many
Generations before his coming into the world; and is it probable now that
he promised this man a Throne for his following him in the Regeneration?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59070:89"/>
which is most certaine (take it in what sence you will) he did never follow
him in, but only as he gave him his bodily attandance, in his going up and
downe. He was never admitted to be witnesse of his Resurrection, the time
being not yet come, wherein a discovery was to be made of the hypocrisie of
<hi>Judas,</hi> that he might have space to carry on the worke which he had to do,
and the number of those, who in a peculiar manner were to beare witnesse
to the compleating of the whole worke of Regeneration in the Resurrection
of Christ,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 21.</note> being twelve, he who was afterwards admitted into that number
being one that now followed him, our blessed Saviour telleth them <hi>indefinitely</hi>
to their consolation, what will be the Glorious Issue of their following him,
and bearing witnesse to him, in this worke. That which is <hi>promissory</hi> in the
wordes, is made to them, who forsooke all and followed him in the worke
mentioned, which assuredly he, who was alwaies a <hi>theife,</hi> a <hi>Divell,</hi> a <hi>covetous</hi>
person, that followed not in the maine of the worke it selfe, was none of; that
Promise being afterwards fulfilled to another then present with Christ. It is
granted, if the rest of the twelve had fallen away, you may suppose of them
what you please: that they might fall away, is to <hi>begge</hi> that, which you cannot
<hi>prove,</hi> nor will ever be granted you, though you should resolve to starve your
selfe, if you get it not: But this is</p>
            <p>4. Confirmed out of Peter Martyr, whose Doctrine it is, that the Promises of
God are wont to be made with a respect unto the present estate and condition of
things, with men: that is, they shall be performed unto men abiding under the
Qualifications, unto which they are made; as for example. What Promises soever
God maketh to Believers, with respect had to their Faith, or as they are Believers,
are not to be looked on as performeable, or obliging the maker of them unto them,
in case they shall relapse into their former unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is too well known, how, and to what end, our Author cites <hi>Peter
Martyr,</hi> and men of the same judgement with him, in this Controversy, &amp; to
how little Advantage to his Cause with discerning men, he hath done it. In
the same place, from whence these words are taken, the Author distinguisheth
of the Promises of God, and telleth you, that some of them are <hi>conditionall,</hi>
which are (saith he) of a <hi>Legall nature,</hi> which only shew the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Condition, or Qualification</hi> they require, and the thing they promise
thereunto: and such are <hi>those</hi> whereof he speakes: but others he tells you, are
<hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> not depending on any Condition in us at all; and
so he tells us, out of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that this of our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. is of the
former sort; and the Accomplishment of such like Promises as these; He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
us to consist not in the actuall fulfilling of what is conditionally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
but in the certain truth of the <hi>axiom,</hi> wherein the condition, and the
Event as such, are knit together.</p>
            <p>2. To the Example urged, I shall only aske what Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of the Promises, that God hath made to Believers, that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
relapse into their former state of unbeliefe, and on what condition they
are made? Whether his Promise of his Love unto, and Acceptance of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
wherein he will abide for ever, doe not inferre their Preservation in the
Condition, wherein they are (<hi>i e.</hi> Believers), will in the next place fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Consideration. Your Conclusion is, in the sence explained you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Proposition; whatsoever God promiseth is certaine, that is, it shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be fulfilled, or it shall not.</p>
            <p>There is moreover no small contribution of strength, as to our establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Faith of it,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> given to our Proposition, by the signall ingagement of
the <hi>Faithfullnesse</hi> of God, for the Accomplishment of the Promises, which he
makes unto us; as it is manifest in those words of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 9. God is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59070:89"/>
faithfull, by whom you are called to the fellowship of his Sonne:</hi> in the foregoing
verse he telleth them that <hi>God will confirme them to the end, that they may be
blamelesse in the day of the Lord Christ;</hi> of which confident Assertion, he gives
them this account, <hi>Gof is faithfull</hi> to make good his Promises made unto
them, he changeth not. When a Promise is once passed, that which first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it selfe to the consideration of them to whom it is made, and whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement
it is, that it be fulfilled, is, the Faithfulnesse of him that hath made
the Promise. This property of Gods nature doth the Apostle therefore mind
the Saints of, to lead them to a full Assurance of their preservation. His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
being passed, feare not his faithfulnesse for its Accomplishment. Might
there in this case a supposall be allowed of any such interveniences, as might
intercept them in the way of enjoying what God truly promised, and cause
them to come short thereof, what assurance could arise to them from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Faithfulnesse of God, who made those Promises unto them?
The Faithfulnesse of God then is ingaged for the Accomplishment of the thing
promised, which also shall be done, in case that faile not. So also the 1 <hi>Thes:</hi> 5.
23, 24. <hi>The very God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God, your spirits, and
soules, and body be preserved blamelesse unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
faithfull is he that calleth you, who will also doe it.</hi> He assures them of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in, and unto the enjoyment of the things which he prayed for, and
that upon the account of his <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> who had promised them: and, saith
he, <hi>he will doe it: viz.</hi> because he is Faithfull. Let the oppositions to it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many, the difficulties never so great, the interveniences what they will;
<hi>He is faithfull, and he will doe it:</hi> as it is affirmed 2 <hi>Thes: 3. 3. But the Lord is
faithfull, who shall establish you, and keepe you from evill:</hi> as also in the 1 <hi>Cor: 10.
13. God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able,
but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to
beare it.</hi> The same <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God is held out as that upon the account
whereof no <hi>temptation</hi> shall befall Believers, so as to separate them from him.
The <hi>Promise</hi> here peculiarly confirmed by it, and established on it, is such as
no <hi>condition</hi> can tollerably be fixed unto. I will not suffer Believers to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
with Temptations, in case they be not overcome with Temptations,
is a Promise not to be ascribed to the Infinite Wisdome of God, with which
we have to doe, and yet no other can with the least colour be proposed. All
sinne, all falling from God is upon temptation. Though Sathan and the
World should have no hand in drawing man aside from God, yet what they
doe from their own Lusts, they doe from Temptation. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. If God in
his Faithfulnesse will not suffer any Temptation to prevaile against Believers,
unlesse they neglect their duty and fall from him, and they can no otherwise
neglect their duty, nor depart from him, but upon the prevalency of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
their abiding with him, their finall unconquerablenesse hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
answerable to the faithfulnesse of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This part of our strength Mr</hi> Goodwin <hi>attempts to deprive us of.</hi> Cap. 11.
Sect: 18. p. 236. <hi>in these words.</hi> Whereas the Apostle mentioneth the Faithfulnesse
of God, as that Divine principle in him, or Attribute, out of which he is moved to
establish, and confirme Believers unto the end, and so to keepe them from evill; by
Faithfulnesse he doth not necessarily meane that Property or Attribute of his, that
renders him true, and just, or Constant in the performance of his Promises, as if the
Apostle in these, or any like places, supposed such a promise, one or more made by
him, by which he stands obliged to establish and confirme his Saints unto the end
by a strong and irresistible hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The summe of this Answer is, that the Apostle by saying <hi>God is Faithfull,</hi>
doth not understand Gods <hi>Faithfulnesse.</hi> What other virtue is intended in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59070:90"/>
God by his <hi>Faithfulnesse,</hi> but that whereby his Truth and his Constancie in
Words and Promises is signified, I know not. Let the places from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scriptures to the end, wherein there is mention made of the <hi>Faith,</hi>
or <hi>Faithfulnesse of God,</hi> of his being <hi>Faithfull,</hi> with the Application thereof,
the Scope, and intendment of the place, be perused, and see if they will give
the least allowance to turne aside from eying the Property and Perfection
of God before mentioned, as that which they peculiarly intend. <hi>Deut: 7. 9. Ps:
36. 5. Ps: 89. 1, 2, 5. Ps: 143. 1. Isai: 49 7. Hos: 2. 20. Rom. 3. 3. 2 Tim: 2. 13. Heb:
10. 23. 1 Iohn</hi> 1. 9. are some of them. <hi>Why</hi> we should wring out another sence
of the expression in this place, I know not.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God is not mentioned as that <hi>Divine principle,</hi> out
of which he is moved to establish and confirme Believers to the end, but only
to confirme them in the faith of his Unchangeablenesse and Constancie, in the
accomplishing the worke of his free Grace, which he had begun in them, and
promised to confirme to the end. The work flowes from the Principle of his
free Grace in Jesus Christ, whence alone, he gives them great, free, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Promises. His stability and Constancie in those Promises, as to their
performance, is intended by his <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> and Truth in them. What are
the Promises of God <hi>improperly so called,</hi> and <hi>not exhibited in words,</hi> which you
intimate, I know not.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostle doth not only suppose, but in the name, and Authority of
God, gives actually in the places under consideration, Promises of the certain
and infallible preservation of Believers to the end, asserting the immutability
of Gods engagement in them from his Faithfulnesse. In briefe: not to darken
counsell and understanding with a multitude of words; by the <hi>Promises of
God,</hi> we intend in a peculiar manner, those exprest in the Texts under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
<hi>viz. That God will establish Believers to the end,</hi> keep them <hi>from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and all Temptations,</hi> that would overthrow them: and by the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi>
of God, from whence Believers have their Assurance of the accomplishment
of these promises, that which the Scripture holds out, and all the World of
Believers have hither to taken to be, the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God, as was before
described. But it seemes the word is here used otherwise. For (saith he.)</p>
            <p>It is such a kind of Faithfulnesse, or disposition in him, as that meant by <hi>Peter,</hi>
when he stileth him a faithfull Creator: Now God is, and may properly be termed a
faithfull Creator, because he constantly per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormes unto his Creature, whatsoever
the Relation of a Creator promiseth in an equitable and rationall way unto it,
which is a great care and tendernesse for the preservation and well-being of it: in
like manner he may, yea it is most likely that he is, called faithfull in his calling
of men, as he is a spirituall Father or Creator, a giver of a new being unto men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he never faileth to performe unto those new creatures of his, whatsoever such
a being as this regularly interpreted, promiseth unto him, who receiveth it from
him who is the donor of it: <hi>(that is)</hi> convement and sufficient meanes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and well-being of it. So that the Faithfulnesse of God in the Scriptures
in hand, supposes no such Promise made by God, as our opposers imagine. <hi>viz.</hi>
Whereby he should in termes, or words stand engaged to establish, confirme, or keep
Believers from evill, his new creatures, his regenerated ones, after any such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but that they, if they be carelesse or negligent for themselves, may be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and decline, and commit evill notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That by Gods <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> mentioned in that place of Peter, such a
<hi>disposition</hi> as you afterwards describe, is intended, you had better say, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to prove. It is evident the scope of the Apostle is to exhort the Saints
of God in all their trialls and afflictions, to commit themselves and their
waies, with patience &amp; quietnesse unto God, upon the account of his <hi>power</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59070:90"/>
to preserve them, as he is the Creator of all, and his constancy in receiving of
them, being present with them, abiding with them, as he is <hi>Faithfull</hi> in his
word and Promises. Yea and the interpretation, our Author would have fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the expression here used, is not only remote from the intendment of
the place, turning that into a generall <hi>good disposition</hi> towards all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which is intimated for the peculiar support of Believers, and that in
their distresse, but also is in it selfe, a false, fond, and loose Assertion. There
is no Law, nor Relation of <hi>Creation,</hi> that laies hold on God so farre, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to the <hi>Communication</hi> of one droppe of his Goodnesse to any of the
creatures, beyond what is given them by their Creation, or to continue <hi>that</hi>
unto them for one moment; All the dispensation of himselfe unto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
flowing from his soveraigne good pleasure, doing what he will with his
owne.</p>
            <p>2. He doth very faintly, when he hath made the farthest steppe in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
asserting that he dares venture upon, (<hi>it may be, and it is most likely</hi>)
suppose that the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God in these places under consideration,
may be taken in such a sence as that before described. But,</p>
            <p>1. This is <hi>no sence</hi> at all of the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God, neither is the word e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
used in Scripture to signify any such <hi>thing</hi> in God, or man, nor can with
any tollerable sence be applied to any such thing; neither would there be any
Analogy between that which in God we call <hi>Faithfulnesse,</hi> and that vertue
in man, which is so termed: nor is the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God here mentioned
upon any such account, as will endure this description, being insisted on only
to assure the Saints of the stedfastnesse, and unalterablenesse of God in the
performance of his Promises made to them: neither is the obligation of God,
to continue his Love and Favour, with Grace, and meanes of it to Believers,
founded upon such a <hi>disposition</hi> as is imagined; but in the free purpose of his
will, which he purposed in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> before the world was: so that there is
not the least appearance of <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>soundnesse</hi> of Reason, or any thing that
is desireable, in this attempt to corrupt the Word of God.</p>
            <p>2. Then, the <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> of God in the Scriptures in hand bespeakes his
truth and stability in the performance of his Promises, made of establishing
Believers to the end, keeping them from evill, not suffering any temptation
to befall them, but making withall a way to escape: in all which God assures
them he will prevent all such carelesnesse, and negligence in them, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with their Establishment, which he will certainly accomplish. And
thus is our <hi>Major Proposition</hi> with its supplies of light, and <hi>strength,</hi> freed from
such exceptions, as M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> supposes it liable unto.</p>
            <p>For the Assumption,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> I shall not much trouble my selfe with that <hi>ridiculous
sence</hi> (called a sober and Orthodox explication) which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is pleased
to put upon it, to allow it to passe currant. <hi>In this sence</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is most
true, that God hath promised that all Believers shall Persevere,</hi> i.e. <hi>that all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
formally considered,</hi> i.e. <hi>as such, and abiding such, shall persevere:</hi> viz.
<hi>in his Grace and Favour; But this he presumes is not our sence.</hi> Ch: 11. Sect: 2.
pag. 226. And well he may presume it: for what ever his greatest skill may
inable him unto, we can make no sence of it, but this: God hath promised
Believers shall Persevere, in case they Persevere: which is to us upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
no sence at all. To Persevere in Gods Grace and Favour, is to continue in
Faith and Obedience, which if men doe, God hath solemnely promised, and
sworne that they shall so doe. Certainly there is an <hi>Orthodox sence</hi> in Gods
Promises, that is not <hi>non-sence</hi> Be it granted then, that this is not <hi>our sence,</hi>
not so much because not <hi>ours,</hi> as because not <hi>sence,</hi> what is our meaning in
this Proposition? <hi>It is</hi> (saith Mr <hi>Goodwin) that God will so preserve Believers, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59070:91"/>
none of them shall make shipwrack of their Faith, upon what quick-sands of lust
and sensuality soever they shall strike, against what rock of obduration and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
soever they dash.</hi> But I beseech you, who told you that this was our sence
of this Proposition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being indeed no more sence then that which you give in
for your owne: By striking on <hi>the quick-sands of Lust,</hi> and <hi>dashing upon Rocks
of sensuality, impenitency, and obduration,</hi> you have in other places sufficiently
explained your selfe to intend their falling under the power of Sinne. And is
this asserted by us to be the tenor of Gods Promises to Believers? Or is it not?
or do you not know that it is not so? did ever any say that God preserveth men
in believing under obduration &amp; impenitency? that is, under unbeliefe? for no
man can be obdurately impenitent but unbelievers: doe not you know that
we maintaine that the Grace faithfully engaged to be bestowed on
them, is given them to this end, to preserve them from the power of sinne,
from obduration and impenitency, and shall certainely be effectuall for that
purpose? <hi>Prima est haec ultio, quòd se Judice, nemo nocens absolvitur.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>1. The former Argument confirmed by an induction of particular instances: Ioh: 1. 5. opened. The concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Believers in that Promise, proved by the Apostle. Heb: 13. 5. The generall interest of
all Believers in all the Promises of God cleared. Objections answered. How Old Testament Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
may be improved. 2. The Promise insisted on relates principally to Spiritualls. The
strength of it to the end intended. 3. 1 Sam. 12. 22. To whom the Promise there is given. 4.
The twofold use of this Promise: Threats to wicked men of use to the Saints: Promises to the
Saints, of use to wicked men. Isa. 4. 2, 3, 4. Psal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. opened. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of back-sliding supposed in Believers: yet they not rejected: Gods abididing with his Saints,
upon the account of his (1.) Faithfulnesse, (2.) Loving-kindnesse. (3.) Covenant: (4.) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
(5.) Oath. 5. The intendment of the words insisted on, from 1 Sam: 12. 22. Isa. 27. 2, 3,
4. Zeph. 3, 17. illustrated. The intendment of those words, I will not forsake thee. The reason of
the Promise, and means promised therein: no cause in them, to whom the Promise is made. Ezek.
36. 31. Isa. 43. 22, 23, 24, 25. opened, also Isa. 57. 17. 6. The cause in God himselfe only. The
Name of God what it imports: his Allsufficiency ingaged therein, and his Goodnesse. 7. The Rise
and fountaine of all Gods Goodnesse to his peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Argument fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place of Scripture. 8. Psl. 23. 4, 5. opened: the Psalmists use of assurance of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severante.
9. Inferences from the last use: 2 Tim: 4. 18. opened: all Believers in the same condition,
as to Perseverance, with David and Paul. 10. The Second inference from the place insisted on. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
a motive to obedience, and is the end that God intends to promote thereby. 11. Psal: 125.
12. explained. Psal: 37. 28. Deut: 33. 3. 12. Inferences from that place of the Psalmist: perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
preservation in the condition of Saints promised to Believers. 13. Mr G. Objections and
Exceptions to our Exposition and Argument from this place, removed. 14. Promises made ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
to persons, not Qualifications: not the same Reason of Promises to the Church, and of
threatnings to sinners. 15. Other objections removed. 16. Isa. 54. 7, 8, 9. 17. The mind of
the Lord in the Promises mentioned in that place opened. 19. The exposition given on that place
and Arguments from thence vindicated. 20. Direction for the right improvement of Promises.
20. Hos. 2. 19, 20. opened. 21. Of the generall designe of that Chapter: the first part of the totall
Rejection of the Church and Politicall state of the Jewes. 23. The second, of Promises to the
remnant according to the election of Grace. Of this foure particulars: (1.) Of Conversion: v. 14,
15. (2.) Of obedience and forsaking all false, worship. (3.) Of Peace and quietnesse v. 18. (4.) Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the fountaine of all the mercies. 24. Some objections removed: to whom this Promise
is made. 25. The Promise farther opened: the persons to whom it is made. 26. v. 14. of that
Chapter opened. The wildernesse condition whereunto men are allured by the Gospell, what it
imports: (1.) Separation: (2.) Intanglement. 27. Gods dealing with a soule in its wildernesse
condition. 28. Promises given to persons in that condition. 29. The summe of the foregoing
Promises: The persons to whom they are made farther described. 30. The nature of the maine
Promise it selfe considered. Of the maine Covenant between God and his Saints. 31. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of God engaged for the Accomplishment of this Promise. 32, 33, 24. Mr G. Exposition
of this place considered, and confuted. 35. Ioh. 10. 27, 28, 29. opened. 30. Vindicated.</p>

mentioned in the Argument last proposed, I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the <hi>Latter,</hi> by an induction of particular Promises. The first,
that I shall fixe upon, is that of <hi>Ioshuah 1. 5. I will be with thee, I will
not faile thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> This Promise (it is true) in this originall Copy
of it is a grant to one <hi>single person,</hi> entring upon a <hi>peculiar employment:</hi> but
the Holy Ghost hath eminently taught the Saints of God to plead, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it in all Generations for their own Advantage, and that not only upon
the account of the generall rule,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 10.</note> of the establishment of all Promises in Jesus
Christ, to the glory of God by us; but also by the application which himselfe
makes of it unto them, and all their occasions, wherein they stand in need of
the Faithfulnesse of God therein. <hi>Heb: 13. 5. Let your conversation be without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,
and be content with such things as you have; for he hath said, I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> The Apostle layeth downe an Exhortation in
the beginning of the verse, against the inordinate desire of the things of this
World, that are laboured after upon the account of this present life: To
give power and efficacy to his Exhortation, he manifesteth all such desires to
be altogether needlesse, upon consideration of <hi>his</hi> Allsufficiency, who hath
promised never to forsake them, which he manifests by an instance in this
Promise given to <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> giving us withall a <hi>Rule</hi> for the Application of all
the Promises of the Old Testament, which were made to the Church and
People of God. Some labour much to rob Believers of the consolation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them in the <hi>Evangelicall</hi> Promises of the Old Testament, though
made in generall to the Church, upon this account, that they were made to
the <hi>Jewes:</hi> and being to them peculiar, their concernment now lyeth not in
them. If this plea might be admitted, I know not any one Promise that
would more evidently fall under the power of it, then <hi>this</hi> we have now in
consideration. It was made to a <hi>peculiar</hi> person, and that upon a <hi>peculiar</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
made to a <hi>Generall,</hi> or <hi>Captaine of Armies,</hi> with respect to the great
Warres he had to undertake, upon the speciall command of God. May not a
poore <hi>hungry</hi> Believer, say, what is this to mee? I am not a Generall of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
have no Warres to make upon Gods command, the vertue doubtlesse of
this Promise expired with the conquest of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and died with him, to
whom it was made. To manifest the samenesse of Love, that is in all the
Promises, with their Establishment in one <hi>Mediator,</hi> and the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of Believers in every one of them, how ever, and on what occasion
soever given to any, this Promise to <hi>Ioshua</hi> is here applied to the condition of
the weakest, meanest, and poorest of the Saints of God; to all, and every one
of them, be their state and condition what it will. And doubtlesse Believers
are not a little wanting to themselves, and their own consolation, that they
doe no more particularly close with those words of <hi>Truth, Grace, &amp; Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
which upon sundry occasions and at diverse times have been given
out unto the Saints of old, even <hi>Abraham, Isaack, Jacob, David,</hi> and the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of them, who walked with God in their Generations: These things in an
especiall manner, are recorded for our <hi>consolation,</hi> that we through <hi>patience
and comfort of the Scripture might have hope. Rom:</hi> 15. 4. Now the Holy Ghost
knowing the weaknesse of our Faith, and how apt we are to be beaten from
closing with the Promises, and from mixing them with faith, upon the least
discouragement that may arise, (as indeed this is none of the least, that the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59070:92"/>
Promise is not made to us, it was made to others, and they may reape the
sweetnesse of it, God may be faithfull in it, though we never enjoy the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
intended in it; I say) in the next words he leads Believers by the hand, to
make the same conclusion with <hi>boldnesse</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> from this, and the like
Promises, as <hi>David</hi> did of old, upon the many Gracious assurances, that he had
received of the presence of God with him. <hi>v. 6. So that</hi> (saith he upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that Promise) <hi>we may say boldly</hi> (without staggering at it by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe)
<hi>that the Lord is our helper;</hi> This is a conclusion of Faith: Because God said
to <hi>Ioshuah</hi> a Believer, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee,</hi> (though upon a
particular occasion, and in reference to a particular employment) every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
may say with <hi>boldnesse, He is my helper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">§: 2.</note> the Application of the Promises here lookes immediately unto
temporalls: but yet being drawne out from the testimony of the continuance
of the presence of God with his Saints, doth much more powerfully conclude
to spiritualls. Yea the Promise it selfe is of <hi>Spirituall</hi> Favour, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
<hi>Temporalls,</hi> is only from thence extracted. Let us then weigh a little the
importance of this Promise, which the Apostle hath rescued from suffering
under any <hi>private Interpretation,</hi> and set at liberty to the use of all Believers.
To every one of them then, God saith directly and plainly, that he will
<hi>never leave them nor forsake them.</hi> If there should any Question arise, wehther
he should be taken at his word or no,<note place="margin">Gen 3. 1.</note> it must be the <hi>Devill</hi> that must be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
as an advocate against him. Unbeliefe indeed <hi>hath</hi> many pleas, and
will have in the breasts of Saints against closing with the Faithfulnesse of God
in this Promise, and the Issue of confidence in him, which from a due closing
with it, would certainely flow. But shall our <hi>unbeliefe make the truth of God
of none effect<expan>

                  </expan>?</hi> He hath told us that he <hi>will never leave us nor forsake us;</hi> The old
Serpent, &amp; some arguing from him herein, are ready to say: yea, <hi>hath God indeed
sayed so?</hi> The truth of it shall not indeed be surely so, it may be otherwise,
for God doth know, that many cases may fall out, that you may be utterly
rejected by him, and cast out of his presence: you may have such oppositions
rise against you in your walking with him, as shall certainely overcome you
and set you at Enmity with him; or you may fully depart from him: and
many such like pleadings will Sathan furnish the <hi>unbeliefe of Believers</hi> withall.
If they are not sufficiently taught by experience, what it is to give credit to
Sathan, indeavouring to impair, and call in Question (upon any pretence
what ever) the Faithfulnesse of God and his Truth, when will they learne it?
Surely they have little need to joyne with their Adversaries for the <hi>weakning</hi>
of their <hi>supportments,</hi> or the <hi>impairing</hi> of their <hi>Consolations;</hi> Whereas there
is an endeavour to make men believe, that the denying any <hi>absolute unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Promise</hi> of God unto Believers makes much for their <hi>Comfort and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
it shall afterwards be considered in common, in reference also to those
other Demonstrations of the <hi>Saints Perseverance,</hi> that shall, God willing, be
produced.</p>
            <p>It will be excepted, that God will not forsake them, whilst they are Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
but if they forsake him, and fall from him, he is at liberty to renounce
them also. But that Gods not forsaking of any, is no more but a meer non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of them, shall afterwards be disprooved. Whom he doth not forsake
as a God in Covenant, to them doth he continue his Presence, and towards
them exerciseth his Power and Allsufficiency for their Good. And if he can by
his Spirit and the Power of his Grace keep them whom he doth not forsake,
in a state and Condition of <hi>not-forsaking</hi> him, he doth forsake them, before
they forsake him, yea before he is said to forsake them. Gods not forsaking
Believers, is effectually preventive of that state and condition in them, on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59070:92"/>
the account whereof it is asserted that he may forsake them.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. The truth we have under consideration is confirmed by the
Prophet in the name &amp; Authority of God himselfe,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> and the words wherein it
is done, have the force of a Promise, being declarative of the good will of
God unto his people in Christ: <hi>For the Lord will not forsake his People for his
great Name sake, because it pleased the Lord to make them his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The expression is the same with that, which the Lord gives his People of
his good will in the Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">Gen: 17. 1. Ierem. 31. 38, 39.</note> of which I have spoken before. Many
may be their Calamityes, and Afflictions, many their Tryalls and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
many their Desertions, and Darknesses, but God <hi>will not forsake them,</hi>
he will not utterly cast them off for ever. That his People are his People in
Covenant, his secret ones, his Spirituall Church, the remnant according to
the Election Grace, hath beene before declared in the handling of like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture. It is to vindicate this and the like Promises from all surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of failing and coming short of Accomplishment, that the Apostle saith,
<hi>God hath not cast away his People which he did fore-know. Rom.</hi> 11. 2. that is, He
hath made good <hi>this Promise</hi> to them: even to them among the Jewes,
whom he did so fore-know; as also to <hi>Predestinate them to be Conformed to the
Image of his Sonne, Rom.</hi> 9. 29. So out of <hi>all Israel</hi> Saving <hi>all Israel,</hi> even the
whole <hi>Israel</hi> of God. That a discriminating Purpose of God is intended in
that expression, hath been already declared, and shall (the Lord assisting) be
farther manifested.</p>
            <p>The Promise, as here mentioned, hath a double use.</p>
            <p>1. It is held out as an <hi>Inducement</hi> to Obedience,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> to that whole People, in
reference whereunto he telleth them, that <hi>if they did wickedly, they should be
destroyed, both they and their king, v.</hi> 25. In the dreadfull threatnings that
God denounceth against wicked and impenitent ones, he hath an end to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
in reference to his Saints, unto his owne: even to make them
know his terrour, and to be acquainted with the Abomination of sinne.
And in his Promises intended directly to them, he hath designes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
upon the most wicked, and ungodly: even to discover his <hi>Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of that which is Good, that they may be left inexcusable</p>
            <p>2. It was a <hi>Testimony</hi> of his good will unto his secret ones; his <hi>Remnant,</hi>
his Residue, his brand out of the fire, unto his People called according to his
<hi>Eternall purpose,</hi> in the midst of his people by <hi>externall profession,</hi> and of his
presence with them, under the accomplishment of the threatning mentioned
upon the generality of that Nation. He <hi>did not forsake them,</hi> when the people
in generall, and their King were destroyed. What ever outward dispensation
he bringeth upon the whole, the Love and Grace of the Promise shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainly
be reserved for them, as, <hi>Isa. 4. v: 2, 3, 4. the remnant,</hi> the <hi>escaping</hi> of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
those that were <hi>written unto life,</hi> shall obtaine, when the rest are destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or hardened. So <hi>Ps:</hi> 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37: <hi>If his children forsake
my Law, and walke not in my judgements, if they breake my statutes, and keep
not my Commandements, then will I visit their transgressions with a rod, and their
iniquity with stripes; nevertheles my Loving-kindnesse will I not utterly take from
him, nor suffer my faithfulnesse to faile: my Covenant will I not breake, nor alter
the thing that is gone out of my lipps: once have I sworne by my Holinesse, that I
will not lye unto David; His seed shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sunne

            <p>A supposall is made of such <hi>waies</hi> and <hi>walkings</hi> in the <hi>spirituall seed</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the Lord Christ, (which in the Psalme is typed out by <hi>David</hi>) that
the Lord will be as it were compelled to deale sharply with them, for their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59070:93"/>
iniquities and transgressions: yet his <hi>kindnesse,</hi> that shall abide with Christ, in
reference to the preservation of his seed; his <hi>Faithfulnesse,</hi> that shall not faile,
his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and his <hi>Oath</hi> shall be made good to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>It is supposed, which is the worst that can be supposed, that in some degree,
at least for some season, they may <hi>forsake the Law,</hi> not <hi>keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and <hi>prophane the Statutes</hi> of God, which continues the burthen of poore
Believers to this day: yet the worst that the Lord threatens them on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
when they might have expected, that he would have utterly cast off
such unthankfull, unfruitfull backsliders, poore creatures, is but this, I will
visit <hi>them with a rod, and with stripes;</hi> they shall have what ever comes within
the compasse of correction or affliction: Rod and Stripes shall be on them,
and that whether outward correction, or inward desertion. but will the Lord
proceed no farther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Will he not for ever cast them off, and ease himselfe of
such a provoking Generation? No, saith the Lord: there lye five things in the
way, upon whose account I cannot so deale with them. All regard the same
persons, as is evident from the <hi>Antithesis</hi> that is in the discourse.</p>
            <p>1. There is my <hi>Loving-kindnesse</hi> (saith God) which is eternall, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable:
for <hi>I love them with an everlasting Love Ier.</hi> 31. 3. this I cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
take away, though it may be hid and eclipsed, as to the appearance
and influences of it, yet utterly it shall not be taken away as to the reality of
it. Though I chasten and correct them, yet my loving kindnesse shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to them. And then, (saith he)</p>
            <p>2. There is my <hi>Faithfulnesse,</hi> which I have engaged to them, which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (that is, that I will suffer them to doe, or that they may doe
upon supposition of the Grace of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Isa. 43. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,</note> wherewith they are supplied)
though they behave themselves very foolishly, and frowardly, yet <hi>that</hi> I must
take care of, that must not <hi>faile. 2 Tim. 2. 13. He abideth faithfull, he cannot
deny himselfe:</hi> And this Faithfulnesse (saith God) I have engaged in three
things.</p>
            <p>1. First, In my <hi>Covenant,</hi> that I have made with them to be their God,
and wherein I have promised that they shall be my People: wherein also I
have made plentifull provision of Mercy, and Grace for all their failings:
and this must not be broken, my <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> is in it, and it must abide. My
Covenant of Peace that I make with them, is an everlasting Covenant: it <hi>is
an everlasting Covenant ordered in all things and sure. 2. Sam: 22.5. Ezek:</hi> 37. 26.
it is a Covenant of Peace an everlasting Covenant.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, <hi>In the thing that is come out of my lipps,</hi> or the Grace and
Love I have spoken of in the <hi>Promise,</hi> herein also will I be <hi>Faithfull,</hi> and that
shall not be altered: all my <hi>Promises are yea and amen in Iesus Christ. 2 Cor:</hi> 1.
20. And,</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, All this I have confirmed by an <hi>Oath,</hi> I have sworne it by my
<hi>Holinesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note> and <hi>I will not lye:</hi> so that in all <hi>these immutable things, wherein it is
impossible for God to deceive,</hi> he hath treasured up strong consolation for them
that doe believe. Though then the seed of Christ, which he is to see, upon the
account of his suffering for them (<hi>Isa:</hi> 53. 10.) doe sinne and transgresse, yet
God hath put all these Gracious obligations upon himselfe, to reduce them by
Correction and Affliction, but never to proceed to finall sentence of utter
Rejection.</p>
            <p>To this purpose I say are the words in the place of <hi>Samuel</hi> now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">§. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. First, the matter of the Promise, or what he promiseth the People, is,
he will <hi>not forsake them.</hi> Gods not forsaking them, is not a bare not casting
them off, but an active continuance with them in love and mercy. He exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59070:93"/>
not a pure <hi>negative</hi> Act of his Will towards any thing, or person. Whom he
hates not, he loves: so <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. these words, <hi>I will not forsake thee,</hi> hold out
a continuall supply of all those wants, whereunto in our selves we are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and what from his presence we doe receive. I will not forsake them, is,
I will continue my presence with them, a God in Covenant. so he expresleth
his presence with them. <hi>Isa. 27. 3. I the Lord doe keep it, I doe water it every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
least any hurt it, I will keepe it night and day.</hi> He abideth with his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
so as to keep it, and to preserve it from being destroyed. But may it not
at one time or other be surprized into desolation? No, saith he, <hi>I will keep it
night and day:</hi> but what if this vineyard prove barren, what will he then doe?
Nay but he will so deale with it, that it shall never be so barren, as to cause
him to cast it up. He is not with it for nought, his presence is attended with
Grace, and Kindnesse. <hi>I water it,</hi> (saith he) and that not now and then, but,
<hi>every moment.</hi> He powres out fresh supplies of his Spirit upon it, to make it
fruitfull. Thence it becomes a <hi>vineyard of red wine, v.</hi> 2. the best wine, the
most delicious, the most pretious, to cheare the heart of God himselfe, as <hi>Zep:</hi>
3. 17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will Save thee, he will
rejoyce over thee with joy, he will rest in his Love, he will joy over thee with sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
He causes them thereby that come of <hi>Iacob</hi> to take root, he makes Israel
blossome and bud, to fill the face of the World with fruit. This is that which
God promiseth his people; he will not <hi>forsake them,</hi> he will alwaies give them
his presence, in the kindnesse and supplies of a God in Covenant, to protect
them from others, to make them fruitfull to himselfe: This is <hi>his not forsaking
them:</hi> He will preserve them from others, who shall take them out of his
hand? he will make them fruitfull to himselfe; he will worke, and who shall
let him?</p>
            <p>2. The Reason <hi>why the Lord will not forsake his People,</hi> why he will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
doing them good, is expressed in these words <hi>for his owne name sake,</hi>
and in this Assertion two things are considerable.</p>
            <p>1. A tacite exclusion of <hi>any thing</hi> in themselves, for which, or upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof God will constantly abide with them. It is not for their
sakes, for any thing in them, or what they have done, may, or can do, it is
not upon the account of any Condition, or qualification whatever, that may,
or may not be found on them, but meerely for his <hi>name sake;</hi> which in the
like case he expresseth fully <hi>Ezek. 36. 32. Not for your sakes doe I this; saith the
Lord, be it knowne unto you, be ashamed and confounded for your owne wayes, oh
House of Israel!</hi> The truth is, they may prove such, as on all accounts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall deserve to be rejected, that nothing in appearance, or in their owne
sence, as well as others, though the root of the matter be in them, may be
found upon them, when God takes delight in them. Like those you have
described at large. <hi>Isai. 43. 22, 23, 24, 25. But thou hast not called upon me Oh
Jacob, but thou hast been weary of me Oh Israel, thou hast not brought me the
small Cattell of thy burnt offerings, neither hast thou honoured me with thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
I have not caused thee to serve with an Offering, nor wearied thee with
Incense, thou hast brought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me
with the fat of thy Sacrifices, but thou hast made me to serve with thy sinnes, thou
hast wearied me with thine iniquities: I even I am he that blotteth out thy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
for mine owne sake, and will not remember thy sinnes any more.</hi> Weary
of God they are, neglecting his worship, making his Patience and Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to serve with their iniquities. It seemes to be impossible almost for any
Creature to apprehend, that God will not give them up to everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Yea perhaps they may be forward in their follies, and contend with
God when he goes to heale them. <hi>Isai. 57. 17. For the iniquity of his covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59070:94"/>
was I wroth and smote him, I hid me and was wroth and he went on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in the way of his heart.</hi> Iniquity is upon them, a vile iniquity, <hi>the iniquity
of Covetousnesse.</hi> God is <hi>wroth</hi> with them, and smites, and hides him, and they
goe on <hi>frowardly:</hi> and yet for all this he <hi>forsakes not for ever,</hi> he abides to be
their God, and that because his so <hi>doing</hi> is not bottomed on any considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what they are, have been, or will be, but he doth it for his <hi>Names sake,</hi>
and with regard unto that, which thereupon he will doe for them. And upon
this account, this Promise of Gods abiding and continuing with his, let
Grace be never so weake, corruption never so strong, temptations never so
violent, may be pleaded, and the Lord rejoyces to be put in remembrance of
it by the weakest, frailest, sinfullest Saint, or Believer in the World.</p>
            <p>2. The Cause or reason is <hi>positively</hi> expressed,<note place="margin">§: 6.</note> why God will not forsake
them, it is, <hi>for his Great Name sake.</hi> His <hi>Great name</hi> is all that he consults with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
about his continuance with his people: this he calls <hi>himselfe Isa. 43. 25. I
blot out thy sinnes for my own sake:</hi> that is for no other cause in world that may
by found in thee, or upon thee. <hi>The Name of God</hi> is all that whereby to us he is
knowne; all his Attributes, his whole will, all his Glory. When God is said to
doe any thing for his <hi>name,</hi> it is either the Cause and End of what he doth, or
the Principle from whence, with the motive wherefore he doth it, that is by
him intended. In the first sence, to doe a thing for his <hi>Name sake,</hi> is to doe it
for the manifestation of his Glory, that he may be known to be a God, in the
Excellency of those Perfections, whereby he reveals himselfe to his, with (most
frequently) a speciall regard to his Faithfulnesse and Grace: it is in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
to make himselfe knowne, and to be exalted in the hearts of his. So all
his dispensations in Jesus Christ are for <hi>the praise of his glorious Grace. Eph.</hi> 1. 6.
That he may be exalted, lifted up, made knowne, believed, and received as
a God pardoning iniquity, in the Sonne of his Love. And in this sence may
the Lord be said to abide with his people <hi>for his Name sake;</hi> for the exalting of
his Glory; that he may be known to be a God faithfull in Covenant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
in his Love, who will not <hi>cast off for ever,</hi> those whom he hath
once received into favour. It will not enter into the hearts of Believers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
why the Lord should so deale with them as he doth, and not cast them
off; their soules may goe to rest as to this thing: he himselfe is glorious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
he is exalted and doth it on that account 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. If by his name you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the principle from whence he worketh, and his motive thereunto, as
it comprehends the whole long-suffering, gratious, tender, unchangeable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, according as he hath revealed himselfe in Iesus Christ, in whom
his name is, <hi>Ex.</hi> 23. 21. and which he hath committed to him to be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
<hi>Ioh:</hi> 17. 6. so evidently two things in God are engaged, when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to work for his Names sake, or according to his great Name.</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>sufficiency:</hi> Upon the engagement of the Name of God on
his peoples behalfe, <hi>Moses</hi> carefully pleads this latter, or part thereof. <hi>Num:</hi>
14. 17, 18, 19. God hath given his Name unto his people: and <hi>this</hi> is wrapt up
in that mercy, that he will lay out his Power to pardon, heale, and doe them
good in his preserving of them, and abiding with them: <hi>Let thy Power be great,
according as thou hast spoken, the Lord is long suffering:</hi> and as when he workes
for his name, the way whereby he will doe it, is according to the greatnesse
of his Power; so the fountaine and rise, from whence he will doe it, is,</p>
            <p>2. His Goodnesse,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 3, 26</note> Kindnesse, Love, Patience, Mercy, Grace, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 22.</note> And thus under the title of his <hi>Name,</hi> doth he call poore
afflicted,<note place="margin">Psal. 63. 4.</note> darke, hopelesse, helpelesse Creatures, (upon any other account in
the World) persons ready to be swallowed up in disconsolation and sorrow,<note place="margin">Psal. 69. 30.</note>
to rest upon him. <hi>Isa: 50. 10. Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59070:94"/>
the voyce of his Servant, that walketh in darknesse and hath no light, let him
trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon his God.</hi> When all other holds are
gon, when flesh failes, and heart failes, then doth God call poore soules to
rest upon this <hi>Name</hi> of his. So the Psalmist <hi>Psal: 73. 26. My flesh, and my heart
faileth,</hi> (all strength, naturall and spirituall, faileth and is gone) <hi>but God is
the strength of my heart</hi> (saith he) <hi>and my portion for ever.</hi> Now this is the sole
motive also of Gods continuance with his: He will doe it, because he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is good, gracious, mercifull, loving, tender: and he will lay out these
Properties to the utmost in their behalfe, that it may be well with them, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, exalting, and making himselfe Gracious in so doing. This the Lord em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
expresseth five times in one verse, <hi>Isa. 46. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven to your old age I am
he, even to hoary haires,</hi> will I carry <hi>you,</hi> I have <hi>made,</hi> and I will <hi>beare,</hi> I will <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and will <hi>deliver you:</hi> this then I say is the reason, and only ground: This
the principall aime and End, upon the account whereof the Lord will not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Rise of all this Goodnesse,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Kindnesse, Faithfulnesse of God to his
People, as to the exercise of it, is also expressed: and that is, his own good
pleasure, <hi>because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his People.</hi> This is the
spring, and fountaine of all the goodnesse mentioned. God is essentially in
himselfe of a good, gracious, and loving nature, but he acts all these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as to works that outwardly are of him, <hi>according to the Counsell of his
Will, Eph:</hi> 1. 11. according to the Purpose which he purposeth in himselfe, and
his Purposes all of them have no other rise, or cause, but his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Why did the Lord make us his People, towards whom he might act
according to the Gracious Properties of his nature, yea and lay them forth
and exercise them to the utmost on our behalfe? Was it because we were
better then others? <hi>did his Will?</hi> walked with him? Did he declare we should
be his People upon condition we did so and so? Not on any of these, or the
like grounds of proceeding doth he doe this, but meerely because <hi>it pleaseth
him to make us his People. Mat:</hi> 11. 26. and shall we think that he who took us
to be his People, notwithstanding our universall alienation from him, on the
account of his own good pleasure, which caused him to make us his People,
(that is obedient, believing, separated from the World) will, upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
being himselfe Unchangeable, not perserve us in, but reject us from
that Condition? Thus is God's Mercy in not forsaking his People, resolved
into its originall principle, <hi>viz. his owne good-pleasure</hi> in choosing of them,
carried on by the Goodnesse &amp; Unchangeablenesse of his own Nature to the
appointed Issue. This then is the summe of this Argument. What worke or
Designe the Lord entereth upon meerly from his own <hi>good pleasure,</hi> or solely
in answer to the Purpose, which he purposeth in himselfe, and engageth to
continue in Mercy for his <hi>Name sake,</hi> thereby taking upon him to remove, or
prevent what ever might hinder the accomplishment of that Purpose, Work,
or Designe of his, that he will abide in unchangeable to the end. But this is the
state of the Lords undertaking to abide with his People, as hath been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
at large.</p>
            <p>Let us adde in the next place that of the Psalmist,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Ps. 23. 4, 6. Though I
walke through the vally of the shaddow of death, I will feare none evill, for thou
art with me; thy rod &amp; thy staffe doth comfort me: Surely Goodnesse &amp; mercy shall
follow me all the dayes of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever.</hi> The <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresseth an exceeding confidence in the middest of most
inexpressible troubles and pressures. He supposes himselfe walking through
<hi>the vally of the shadow of death,</hi> as death is the worst of evills and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of them all, so the <hi>shaddow of death</hi> is the most dismall and darke Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59070:95"/>
of those evills to the Soule, and the <hi>vally</hi> of that <hi>shaddow</hi> the most
dreadful bottome and depth of that Representation. This then the Prophet
supposed, that he may be brought into a condition, wherein he may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with sad apprehensions of the comeing of a confluence of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of evills upon him, and that not for a short season, but he may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
<hi>to walke in them,</hi> which denotes a state of some continuance, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
with most dismall evills and in their owne nature tending to death, is
in the supposall. What then would he do if he should be brought into this
estate? Saith he, even in that condition, in such distresse, wherein I am to my
owne, and the eyes of others, hopelesse, helpelesse, gone and lost, <hi>I will feare
none evill.</hi> A noble resolution, if there be a sufficient bottome &amp; foundation for
it, that it may not be accounted rashnesse &amp; groundlesse confidence, but true
Spirituall courage, and holy Resolution. Saith he, it is because the <hi>Lord is
with me:</hi> But alas! what if the Lord should now forsake thee in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and give thee up to the power of thine enemies, and suffer thee by the
strength of thy Temptations, wherewith thou art beset, to fall utterly from
him? Surely then thou wouldest be swallowed up for ever; the waters would
go over thy Soule, and thou must for ever lye downe in the shades of death.
Yea but (saith he,) I have an assurance of the contrary, <hi>Goodnesse and Mercy
shall follow me all the dayes of my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is (say some) a very desperate perswasion. If thou art sure that <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; Mercy shall follow thee all the dayes of thy life,</hi> then live as thou pleasest, as
loosly as flesh can desire, as wickedly as Sathan can prompt thee to: Certainely
this perwasion is fit only to ingenerate in thee an high contempt of humble
and close walking with God. What other conclution can' st thou possibly
make of that presumption, but only that, <hi>I may then do what I please, what I
will; let the flesh take its swing in all abominations,</hi> it matters not, <hi>Goodnesse and
Mercy shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollow me.</hi> Alas! saith the Psalmist, these thoughts never come in
my heart: I finde this perswasion through the Grace of him, in whom it is, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
to ingenerate contrary Resolutions. This is that which I am upon the
account thereof, determined on, I <hi>will dwell in the house of God for ever:
seeing Goodnesse and Mercy shall follow me,</hi> I will dwell in his house; and seeing
they shall follow me all <hi>the dayes of my life, I will dwell in his House for
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are then these two things in this last verse,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> pregnant to the purpose
in hand.</p>
            <p>1. The Psalmist's assurance of the presence of God with him <hi>for ever,</hi> and
that in kindnesse and pardoning Mercy, upon the account of his Promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; <hi>Goodnesse</hi> or benignity (saith he) <hi>shall follow me,</hi> into every Condition,
to assist me, &amp; extricate my Soule, even out of the <hi>vally of the shadow of death.</hi>
A conclusion like that of <hi>Paul. 2 Tim. 4. 18. The Lord shall deliver me from every
evill wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdome.</hi> Having (<hi>v.</hi> 17.)
given testimony of the Presence of God with him in his great tryall, when he
was brought before that devouring monster <hi>Nero,</hi> giving him deliverance, he
manifesteth in the 18. <hi>v.</hi> that the Presence of God with him was not only
effectuall for one or an other deliverance, but that it will keepe him from
<hi>every evill worke,</hi> not only from the rashnesse, cruelty, and oppression of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but also from any such way or workes of his owne, which should lay a
barre against his injoyments of, and compleat preservation unto that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdome, whereunto he was appointed.</p>
            <p>What reason now can be imagined, why other Saints of God, who have
the same Promise with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> established unto them in the hand of
the same Mediator,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> being equally taken into the same Covenant of Mercy and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59070:95"/>
Peace with them, may not make the same conclusion of Mercy with them;
<hi>viz. That the Mercy, &amp; Goodnes of God will follow them all the dayes of their lives
that they shall be delivered from every evill worke, and preserved to God's Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kingdome.</hi> To fly here to <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> as though God had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
and immediately assured some persous of their <hi>Perseverance,</hi> which begat
in them a confidence, wherein others may not share with them, besides that
it is destructive of all the vigour and strength of sundry, if not all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
produced against the Saints Perseverance, it is not in this place of any
weight, or at all relative to the businesse in hand. For evident it is, that one of
them even <hi>David,</hi> is thus confident upon the common account of Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto all his Saints, as he is their <hi>Shepheard:</hi> one that takes care of them,
and will see, not only whilst they abide with him, that they shall have Pasture
and refreshment, but also will find them out in their wandrings and will not
suffer any of them to be utterly lost. And he is a <hi>Shepheard</hi> equally in care and
love to every one of his Saints, as he was to <hi>David.</hi> He gives them all the <hi>sure
Mercies of David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 3.</note> even the Mercy conteined &amp; wrapped up in the Promise that
was given to them, and what by virtue thereof, he did enjoy, with what he
received from God in that Covenant-Relation wherein he stood. And for
<hi>Paul,</hi> it is most evident that he grounded his Confidence and Consolation,
meerly upon the generall Promise of the Presence of God with his, that <hi>he will
never leave them nor forsake them,</hi> but be their God, and guide even unto
death. Neither is there the least intimation of any other bottome of
his Consolation herein. Now these being things wherein every Believer, even
the weakest in the world, hath an equall share and interest with <hi>Paul, David,</hi>
or any of the Saints in their generations, what should lye in their way, but that
they also may grow up to this assurance, being called thereunto. I say they
may <hi>grow</hi> up unto it: I doe not say that every believer can with equall assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of mind thus make their boasts in the Lord, and the continuance of his
kindnesse to them. The Lord knowes we are oftentimes weake, and darke,
&amp; at no small losse even as to the main of our interest in the Promises of God:
But there being an equall certainty in the things themselves, of which we
speake, it being as certaine that the <hi>Goodnesse and Mercy</hi> of God shall follow
them all their dayes, as it did <hi>David,</hi> and as certaine that God will deliver
them from every evill worke, and preserve them to his Heavenly kingdome
as he did <hi>Panl,</hi> they also may grow up unto, and ought to presse after the
like Assurance and Consolation With them, whom Goodnesse and Mercy
shall follow all their dayes, and who shall be of God preserved from every
evill worke, they can never fall totally and finally out of the Favour of God:
That this is the state and Condition of Believers is manifested from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
given of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> testifying their full perswasion and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
concerning that Condition, on Grounds common to them with all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>2. The conclusion and inference thar the Psalmist makes,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> from the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which he had of the Continuance of the Goodnesse, and Kindenesse of
God unto him, followeth in the words insisted on, <hi>All the daies of his life, he
would dwell in his House.</hi> He would for ever give up himselfe unto his Worship
and service, seeing this is the case of my Soule that God will never
forsake me, let me answer this Loye of God in my constant obedience.
Now this conclusion followes from the former principle upon a twofold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>1. As it is a <hi>motive</hi> unto it. The Continuance of the Goodnesse, and
Kindnesse of God unto a Soule is a constreining <hi>motive</hi> unto that Soule to
continue with him in Love, Service and Obedience: It workes powerfully
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59070:96"/>
upon a heart any way enobled with the ingenuity of Grace, to make a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
returne, as farre as possible it can, to such eminent Mercy and Goodnesse.
I professe, I know not what those men thinke the Saints of God to be, who
suppose them apt to make conclusions of wantonnesse and rebellion, upon the
account of the Stedfastnesse of the Love and Kindnesse of God to them. I shall
not judge any, as to their state and Condition: yet I cannot but thinke, that
such mens prejudices, and fulnesse of their own perswasions doe exceedingly
interpose in their Spirits, from receiving that impression of this Grace of God,
which in its owne nature it is apt to give; or it would be impossible they
should once imagine, that of it selfe it is apt to draw the Spirits of men into
a neglect and contempt of God.</p>
            <p>2. As the end of God intended in giving that assurance, to the effecting
whereof it is exceedingly operative and effectuall; so you have it <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74,
75. This is the intendment of God in confirming his Oath and Promise unto
us, <hi>that he may grant unto us, that wee being delivered out of the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
might serve him without feare, in righteousnesse and holinesse all the daies of
our lives.</hi> Now though these forementioned, with many other Texts of
Scripture, are plaine, evident, and full to the businesse we have in hand; yet
the Adversaries of this truth having theirhands so full with them that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
urged, that they cannot attend unto them, I shall not need to spend
time in their vindication from exceptions, which none, that I know, have as
yet brought in against them (though, upon their principles, they might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be invented) but shall leave them to be mixed with faith, according as
God by his Spirit shall set them home upon the soules of them, who doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them.</p>
            <p>The whole 125. <hi>Ps.</hi> might in the next place be brought in,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> to give Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the truth in hand. I shall only take a Proofe from the first verses of
it. <hi>They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion, which cannot be removed;
as the mountaines round about Jerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people
from henceforth even for ever.</hi> whereunto answereth that of <hi>Ps: 37. 28. The Lord
loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his Saints, they are preserved for ever.</hi> as also
<hi>Deut. 33. 3. Yea he loveth his people, all his Saints are in thy hand.</hi> In the verses
named, I shall a little fixe upon two things conducing to our purpose, which
are evidently contained in them.</p>
            <p>1. A Promise of Gods everlasting presence with his Saints, Believers, them
that <hi>trust</hi> in him; and their stedfastnesse thereupon, <hi>they shall be as mount Sion
that can never be removed,</hi> and that, because the <hi>Lord is round about them, and
that for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. An allusive comparison of both these, both their stability, and Gods
presence with them, given for the encouragement of weake Believers, with
speciall regard to the dayes wherein the Promise was first made, which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
also belongs to them, on whom the ends of the World are fallen. The
Psalmist bids them (as it were) lift up their eyes, and look upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi>
and the hills that were round about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and tells them that God will
as certainly, and assuredly continue with them, and give them establishment,
as those hills and mountaines which they beheld round about, abide in their
places: so that it shall be as impossible for all the powers of Hell to remove
them out of the Favour of God, as for a man to pluck up mount <hi>Sion</hi> by the
<hi>rootes,</hi> or to overturne the foundations of the Mountaines, that stand round
about <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> It is true, the Holy Ghost hath speciall regard to the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Temptations that they were to undergoe from men, but bears also
an equall regard to all other meanes of separating them from their God; It
would be a matter of small consolation unto them, that men should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59070:96"/>
over them for ever, if in the meane time there be other more close and
powerfull Adversaries, who may cast them downe with a perpetuall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Some few considerations of the intendment of the place, will serve for
the inforcing of our Argument from this portion of Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. That which is here promised the Saints,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> is a perpetuall preservation of
them in that condition wherein they are, both on the part of God, he is <hi>round
about them,</hi> even henceforth &amp; for ever, and on their parts, they shall <hi>not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;</hi>
that is, from the state and conditon of acceptation with him, wherein
they are supposed to be, but abide for ever and continue therein immoveable
unto the end. It is (I say) a plain Promise of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in that condition,
wherein they are, with their safety from thence, and not a Promise of some
other good thing, provided that they continue in that condition. Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compared to Mountaines, and their Stability, which consists in their being
and Continuing so, will admit no other sence. As <hi>Mount Sion</hi> abides in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
so shall they: aud as the Mountaines about <hi>Jerusalem</hi> continue, so doth
the Lord his presence unto them.</p>
            <p>2. That expression which is used <hi>v.</hi> 2. is weighty and full to this purpose,
<hi>The Lord is round about his People henceforth and for ever.</hi> What can be spoken
more fully, more pathetically? Can any expression of men so set forth
the truth which we have in hand? The Lord is <hi>round about them,</hi> not to save
them from this or that incursion, but from all: not from one or two evills,
but from <hi>every one,</hi> whereby they are, or may be assaulted. He is with them
and round about them, on every side, that no evill shall come nigh them.
It is a most full expression of universall preservation, or of Gods keeping his
Saints in his Love and Favour, upon all accounts whatsoever. And that not
only for a season, but it is, <hi>henceforth from his</hi> giving this Promise unto their
Souls in particular, and their receiving of it in all Generations, according to
their appointed times, even for ever.</p>
            <p>Some few exceptions,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> with a great surplusage of words and phrases, to
make them seeme some other things, then what have been formerly insisted
on againe and againe, are advanced by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> to overturne this <hi>Sion,</hi>
and to cast downe the mountaines that are about Jerusalem. <hi>Ch. 11. Sect. 9.
pag:</hi> 230, 231, 232. The summe of our Argument from hence, as of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this place, is this: Those whom the Lord will certainly preserve for
ever in the state and conditon of trusting in him, they shall never be forsaken
of him, nor separated from him. The latter clause of this <hi>Proposition</hi> is that
which we contend for, the whole of that whose proofe is incumbent on us: of
this, the former part is a sufficient <hi>basis</hi> and foundation: being comprehensive
of all that is, or can be required to the unquestionable establishment thereof:
from the Letter of the Text we <hi>assume;</hi> But God will certainly preserve for
ever all his Saints that put their Trust in him, in their so doing, that they
shall not be altered, or cast downe from that state and conditon: Change but
the figurative expressions in the Text, and the Allusions used for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
of their Faith in particular, to whom this Promise was first given,
into other termes of a direct and proper significancy, and the Text and the
<hi>Assumption</hi> of our Argument will appeare to be the same; whence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
intended will undeniably follow: unto this cleare deduction of the
Truth contended for, from this place of Scripture, the Discourse ensuing in
the place mentioned, is opposed.</p>
            <p>1. The Promise only assures them that trust in the Lord, that they shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
but not at all that they that trust in him, shall be necessitated to doe so still,
or that so they shall doe. So Paul saith, it was in my heart to live and dye with the
Corinthians: but doubtlesse with this proviso, that they alwaies continued such as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59070:97"/>
they then were, or as he apprehended them to be, when he so wrote to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I must be forced to smite this evasion once and againe, before we
arrive at the close of this contest, it being so frequently made use of by our
Adversary, who without it, knowes himselfe not able to stand against the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of any one Promise usually insisted on. This is the substance of all
that, which with exceeding delightfull variety of expressions, is an hundred
times made use of. <hi>The Promise is conditionall, and made to those that trust in the
Lord, and is to be made good only upon the account of their continuing so to doe: but
that they shall so doe, that they shall continue to trust in the Lord, that is wholly
left to themselves, and not in the least undertaken in the Promise;</hi> and this is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>a discharging or dismissing</hi> of places of Scripture, from <hi>the service whereunto
(contrary</hi> to their proper sence &amp; meaning) they are <hi>pressed,</hi> a delivering them
from the bearing the crosse of this warfare, with such like Imperiall termes
and expressions. To speake in the singlenesse of our spirits, we cannot see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of the <hi>discharged Souldiers,</hi> returning from the Campe, wherein they
have long served for the safety and consolation of them that doe believe.
Particularly this Scripture detests the glosse with violence imposed on it, and
tells you, that the end for which the God of truth sent it into this service,
wherein it abides, is to assure them that trust in the Lord, that they shall be
preserved in that condition to the end. That in the condition of trusting and
depending on God, they shall be as <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Favour of God unto
them as immoveable mountaines, <hi>he will for ever</hi> be with them and about
them: And that all this shall certainly come to passe, Christ does not say, that
they shall be as established mountaines, if they continue to trust in the Lord,
but they shall be so in their trusting, abiding for ever therein, through the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
presence of God. For their being <hi>necessitated</hi> to continue trusting in
the Lord, there is not any thing in Text, or in our Argument from thence, or
in the doctrine we maintaine, that requires or will admit of any such proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, as by that expression is properly signified. Indeed there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in termes, if they are used to the same pupose: to <hi>Trust</hi> in the Lord,
is the <hi>voluntary free act</hi> of the creature: to be necessitated unto this <hi>Act,</hi> and in
the performance of it, so that it should be done <hi>necessarily</hi> as to the manner
of its doing, is wholly destructive to the nature and being of it. That God
can effectually, and infallibly as to the event, cause his Saints to continue tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in him, without the least abridgement of their liberty, yea that he doth so
eminently by heightning and advancing their spirituall <hi>liberty,</hi> shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
declared: if by <hi>necessitated to continue trusting,</hi> not the manner of Gods
operation with, and in them, for the compassing of the end poposed, and the
efficacy of his Grace, whereby he doth it (commonly decryed under those
termes) be intended; but only the certainty of the issue, rejecting the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the expression, the thing it selfe we affirme to be here promised of
God. But is urged,</p>
            <p>2. That this Promise is not made unto the Persons of any,<note place="margin">§: 14.</note> but meerely unto their
Qualifications: like that, he that believeth shall be saved, it is made to the
Grace of Trusting, Obedience, and walking with God, for threatnings are made to
the evill Qualifications of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This it seemes then we are come unto, and what farther progresse
may be made the Lord knowes. The Gratious Promises of God, made to his
Church, his People; in the bloud of Jesus, on which they have rolled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with safety and security in their severall generations, are nothing but
bare declarations of the will of God; what he allowes, and what he rejects:
with the firme concatenation that is between Faith and salvation, Obedience
and reward. And this it seemes is the only use of them: which if it be so, I
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59070:97"/>
dare boldly say, that all the Saints of God from the foundations of the
World, have most horribly abused his Promises, and forced them to other
ends, then ever God intended them for. Doubtlesse all those blessed soules,
who are fallen a sleepe in the Faith of Jesus Christ, having drawn refreshment
from these breasts of Consolation, could they be summoned to give in their
experience of what they have found in this kind, they would with one mouth
professe that they found farre more in them, then meere <hi>conditionall declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the will of God: Yea that they received them in Faith, as the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his heart and good will towards them, &amp; that he never failed in the
accomplishment and performance of all the good mentioned in them: neither
will that emphaticall expression in the close of the second verse, (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somewhat too rough for our Author to handle, he left it quite out) beare
any such sence. That the Promises of the Covenant are made originally to
Persons, and not to Qualifications, hath been in part already proved, and shall
be farther evinced, (God assisting) as occasion shall be offered in the ensuing
discourse: The Promises are to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seede: and some of them (as
hath been declared) are the springs of all Qualifications whatever, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God: what be the Qualifications of Promises of opening blind
eyes, taking away stony hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath not as yet been declared. But it is
farther argued.</p>
            <p>3. That this and the like Promises are to be interpreted according to the rule
which God hath given for the interpretation and understanding of his threatnings
unto Nations about temporall things, and his Promises that are of the same import;
which we have Jer. 18. 7, 8. Plainely affirming that all their accomplishment depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
on some conditions in the Persons, or Nations, against whom they are denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> God forbid! shall those Promises which are branches of the everlasting
Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 23.</note> called <hi>better Promises</hi> then those of the old Covenant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of their infallible accomplishment,<note place="margin">2 Cor: 1. 20.</note> ratified in the blood of
Christ, made <hi>yea and amen</hi> in him the witnesse of the Faithfulnesse of God to
his Church,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3.</note> and grand Supporter of our Faith, exceeding great and pretious;
shall they be thought to be of no other sence and interpretation, to make no
other Revelation of the <hi>Father</hi> unto us, but in that kind, which is common to
threatnings of Judgements (expresly conditionall) for the deterring men
from their impious and destructive courses? I say, God forbid. To put it then to
an issue. God here promiseth that they who here trust in him shall never be
remooved. What (I pray) is the Conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, on which this Promise doth depend?
It is say they who oppose us in this, <hi>if they continue trusting in him:</hi> that is, if
they be not removed; for <hi>to trust in him,</hi> is, <hi>not to be removed;</hi> if then they be
not removed, they shall not be removed; and is this the minde of the Holy
Ghost? Notwithstanding all the <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> in the world, this Promise will
stand for the consolation of them that believe, as the Mountaines about Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
that shall never be removed.</p>
            <p>In some it is said <hi>to be a Promise of abiding in Happinesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> 
               <hi>not in Faith:</hi> but it
plainely appeares to be a Promise of abiding in <hi>trusting</hi> the Lord; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
both our Faith and Happinesse</p>
            <p>Ob. It is not promised, that they who once trust in the Lord, shall abide happy,
though they cease to trust in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is a Promise that they shall not cease to trust in him:</p>
            <p>Ob. It is not that they shall be necessitated to abide trusting in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No, but it is that they shall be so far assisted and effectually wrought
upon, as certainely to do it.</p>
            <p>Ob. It is no more then the Apostle sayes to the Corinthians 2 Cor. 2. 3. which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59070:98"/>
frame towards them he would not continue, should they be changed and turned into
Idolaters and Blasphemers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, the Promises of God, and the affections of men are but ill
compared. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> loved the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whilst they were such as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
God promiseth his Grace to Believers, that they may continue such
as he loves.</p>
            <p>Ob. All the Promises are made to Qualifications, not to Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Prove that, and 1. Take the case in hand; and 2. Cast downe
the Church to the ground, it having no one Promise on that account made
unto it, as consisting of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed: and so this witnesse also is freed from
all exceptions put in against it, and appeares with confidence to give in its Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to the Vnchangeablenesse of God unto Believers.</p>
            <p>I shall in the next place adjoine another portion of Scripture of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with those foregoing,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> wherein the truth in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is no <hi>lesse</hi> clearly, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more pathetically, &amp; convincingly expressed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that last mentioned.
It is <hi>Isa. 54. 7, 8, 9, 10. For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but
with everlasting kindnesse will I have Mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.
For this is as the waters of Noah unto me, for as I have sworne that the Waters of
Noah shall no more cover the Earth, so have I sworne that I will not be wrath with
thee, nor rebuke thee: for the Mountaines shall depart and the hils be removed, but
my Loving-kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my
Peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee.</hi> The place I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before, but only as to one speciall inference from one passage in the
words, I shall now use the whole for the confirmation of the generall Truth
we plead for; the words are full, plaine, suited to the businesse in hand. No
expressions of our finding out, can so fully reach the Truth we assert, much
lesse so <hi>pathetically</hi> worke upon the Affections of Believers, or so effectually
prevaile on their understandings to receive the Truth contained in them, as
these words of God himselfe, given us for those ends, are suited to doe. Goe
to men, whose minds in any measure are free from prejudice, not forestalled
with a contrary perswasion, and furnished with evasions for the defence of
their opinions, and aske whether God doth not in these words directly and
positively promise to those, to whom he speaketh, that he will <hi>alwaies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his kindnesse to them, to the end:</hi> and that for the daies of eternity his Love
shall be fixed on them: and I no way doubt but they will readily answer, <hi>It is
so indeed,</hi> it cannot be denied. But seeing we have to deale, as with our own
unbelieving hearts, so with men who have turned every stone to prejudge
this Testimony of God, the words must a little more narrowly be considered,
and the mind of the Holy Ghost inquired into.</p>
            <p>V. 5. mention is made of the desertion of the Church,<note place="margin">§: 17.</note> by the eclipsing of
the beames of Gods countenance, and the inflicting of some great affliction for
a season: in opposition unto which <hi>momentary desertions,</hi> in that, and in the
beginning of the 8. <hi>v.</hi> he giveth in Consolation from the Assurance of the
<hi>great Mercies,</hi> and <hi>Everlasting Kindnesse,</hi> wherein he abideth to doe them
good; <hi>with everlasting kindnesse will I have mercy on thee,</hi> I will pardon, pitty,
and heale thee, with that mercy which floweth from Love, which never had
beginning, that never shall have ending, that cannot be cut off, <hi>Everlasting
Kindnesse.</hi> Beare with patience your present desertion, your present trialls,
whatever they are that befall you, they are but for a season, but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and these also consistent with that Mercy &amp; Kindnesse, which is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
and turneth not away; If this Mercy and Kindnesse dependeth on any
thing in us, and is resolved lastly thereunto, which may alter and change eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59070:98"/>
moment, as our walking with God in its selfe considered, not relating to
the Unchangeablenesse of his Purpose, &amp; the efficacy of his promised Grace, is
apt to doe; what opposition can there be betwixt that desertion wherewith
they are exercised, and the kindnesse wherewith they are embraced, as to
their continuance? As that is said to be for a <hi>little while,</hi> for a <hi>moment,</hi> so this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
may be of no longer abode: It may possibly be as <hi>Jonah's Gourd,</hi> that grew
up in the morning, and before night was withered; what then shall become
of the foundation of that consolation, wherewith God here refresheth the
soules of his people, consisting in the continuance of his kindnesse, in an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
to the <hi>moment arinesse</hi> of their desertion.</p>
            <p>Least that any should call this into Question,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> (as our unbelieving hearts are
very apt, and skilfull in putting in pleas against the truth of the Promises of
God, and their accomplishment towards us) <hi>v.</hi> 9. the Lord farther confirmeth
the Assurance formerly given, and removeth those objections, to which
through the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of Satan, and the <hi>Sottishnesse</hi> of our own hearts, it may
seem to be lyable. <hi>This is</hi> (saith he) <hi>as the waters of Noah:</hi> Gods dealing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in that mercy, which floweth from his everlasting kindnesse, is like his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the World in the matter of the waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> or the floud where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it was drowned and destroyed, when he, with his, were saved in the Arke.
He calleth upon his Children to consider his dealings with the World in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the floud, <hi>I have sworne,</hi> (saith he) (that is, I have entred into a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to that end, which was wont to be confirmed with an <hi>Oath,</hi> and God
being absolutely faithfull in his covenant, is said to sweare thereunto, though
there be no expresse mention of any such oath,) that the World should no
more be so drowned as then it was: now (saith God) see my Faithfulnesse
herein, it hath never been drowned since, nor ever shall be; with equall Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
have I engaged (even in Covenant) that that kindnesse, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to thee, shall alwaies be continued, <hi>so that I will not be wroth to rebuke
thee,</hi> (that is) so as utterly to cast thee off, as the World was when it was
drowned. But some may say, before the floud <hi>the Earth was filled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and sinne:</hi> and should it be so againe, would it not bring another floud
upon it? Hath he said he will not drowne it, notwithstanding any interposall
of sinne, wickednesse, or rebellion whatever? Yea, saith he, such is my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
I took notice in my first engagement therein, that the <hi>Imagination of
mans heart would be evill from his youth. Gen:</hi> 8. 21. and yet I entred into that
solemne Covenant; so that this exemption of the World from an universall
deluge is not an Appendix to the obedience of the World, which hath been
upon some accounts more wicked since, then before; (as in the crucifying of
<hi>Christ the Lord of Glory,</hi> and in rejecting of him being preached unto them)
but it solely leaneth upon my <hi>Faithfulnesse</hi> in keeping Covenant, and my
<hi>Truth</hi> in the accomplishment of the <hi>Oath,</hi> that I have solemnely entred into:
So is my kindnesse to you; I have made expresse provision for your sinnes and
failings therein; such I will preserve you from, as are inconsistent with my
kindnesse to you, and such will I pardon, as you are overtaken withall. When
you see an <hi>universall deluge</hi> covering the face of the Earth, (that is, God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
to his Oath and Covenant) then, and not till then, suppose that his
kindnesse can be turned from Believers.</p>
            <p>Something is excepted against this Testimony,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Ch: 11. Sect: 4 Pag:</hi> 227. but
of so little importance, that it is scarce worth while to turne aside to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of it. The summe is, <hi>that this place speaketh only of Gods Faithfulnesse
in his Covenant; but that this should be the Tenor of the Covenant, that they who
once truly believed, should by God infallibly, and by a strong hand, against all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posalls
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59070:99"/>
of sinne, wickednesse, or rebellion, be preserved in such a Faith, is not by any
word, syllable, or Iota intimated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is that which is repeated <hi>usque ad nauseam;</hi> and were it not for
variety of expressions, wherewith some men doe abound, to adorne it, it
would appeare extreame beggerly and over-worne; but a sorry shift (as they
say) is better then none, or doubtlesse in this place it had not been made use
of. For,</p>
            <p>1. This <hi>Testimony</hi> is not called forth to speake immediately, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Believers in their Faith, but to the continuance and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of the Love of God to them; and consequentially only to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in Faith upon that account.</p>
            <p>2. It is not only <hi>assumed</hi> at a cheap, and very low rate or price, but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>gratis</hi> supposed, that Believers may make such <hi>interposalls of Sinne, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and Rebellion</hi> in their walking with God, as should be inconsistent with
the continuance of his Favour and Kindnesse to them, according to the tenor
of the Covenant of Grace. His Kindnesse and Favour being to us things <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall,</hi>
our sinnes are not opposed unto them <hi>really</hi> and <hi>directly,</hi> as though
they might effectually infringe an Act of the Will of God, but only <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;</hi>
now when God saith, that he will continue his kindnesse to us for ever,
notwithstanding the demerit of Sinne, as is plainly intimated in that Allusion
to the <hi>Waters of Noah,</hi> for any one to say that they may fall into such Sinnes
and Rebellions, as that He cannot but turne his Kindnesse from them, is a
bold attempt for the violation of his Goodnesse and Faithfulnesse, and a
plaine begging of the thing in Question. Certainly it is not a pious labour to
thrust with violence such supposalls into the Promises of God, as will stoppe
those breasts from giving out any consolation, when no place or roome for
them doth at all appeare: there being not one <hi>word, syllable, Iota,</hi> or <hi>tittle</hi> of
any such supposalls in them.</p>
            <p>3. The Exposition and Glosse, that is given of these words, namely, <hi>that
upon conditon of their Faithfulnesse and Obedience, which, notwithstanding any
thing in this or any other Promise, they may turne away from, he will engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be a God to them,</hi> is such, as no Saint of God, without the helpe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and his owne unbeliefe, could affixe to the place, neither will that at all
assist: which</p>
            <p>4. Is affirmed, namely, that <hi>in all Covenants (and his Promise holdeth out a
Covenant) there must be a condition on both sides;</hi> For we willingly grant that in
this Covenant of Grace, God doth <hi>promise</hi> something to us, and <hi>requireth</hi>
something of us; and that these two have mutuall dependance one upon
another. But we also affirme that in the very Covenant it selfe, God hath
graciously promised to worke effectually in us those things, which he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of us; and that therein it mainly differeth from the Covenant of Works,
which he hath abolished. But such a Covenant, as wherein God should Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be a God unto us, upon a condition by us, and in our own strength to
be fulfilled, and on the same account continued in unto the end, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not, nor can whilest our hearts have any sence of the <hi>Love</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>Bloud</hi> of the Sonne, of the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Holy Spirit, the fountaines
thereof. Notwithstanding then any thing that hath been drawn forth in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to it, Faith may triumph from the Love of God in Christ, held out in
this Promise to the full assurance of an everlasting Acceptance with him; for
God also willing yet more abundantly to give in consolation in this place, to
the <hi>heirs of the Promis,</hi> assureth the stability of his Love and kindnesse to
them by another allusion. <hi>v. 10. The Mountaines</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall depart, and the
hills be removed, but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59070:99"/>
of my Peace be removed, saith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee.</hi> He
biddeth them consider the <hi>mountaines</hi> and <hi>hilles,</hi> and suppose that they may
be removed, and depart; suppose that the most unlikely things in the World
shall come to passe, whose accomplishment none can judge possible, while
the World endureth, yet my kindnesse to thee is such, as shall not fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those supposalls, which concerne things of such an impossibility. I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
conscious, that all <hi>Paraphrasing,</hi> or Exposition of the words that may be
used for their Accommodation to the Truth we plead for, doth but darken
and Eclipse the Light and Glory, which in and by themselves, to a believing
soule, they cast upon it. Now least any should think, that there is the least
tendency in such Promises as these (as held out to Believers) to turne them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
from close walking with God, before I enter upon the consideration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other (this seeming of all others most exposed to Exceptions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
I shall give some few Observations, that may a little direct Believers,
to whom I write, and for whose sake this taske is undertaken, into the right
improvement of them.</p>
            <p>The genuine influence which this,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> and the like Promises have upon the
soules of the Saints, is, mightily to stirre them up unto, and to assist them in
answering, what lieth in them, that inexpressible Love and Kindnesse, which
their God and Father in Jesus Christ, holdeth out unto their hearts in them:
This the Apostle inferreth from them. 2 <hi>Cor: 7. 1. Having these Promises</hi> (that
is those especially mentioned in the words preceding the conclusion, and the
inference the Apostle here maketh, <hi>Ch. 6. v. 16, 18. I will dwell in them, and
will be a Father unto them, and they shall be my children) therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>let
us cleanse our selves from all pollution of slesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse in
the feare of the Lord.</hi> Universall purity, holinesse, and close walking with God,
is that which these Promises doe presse unto, and naturally promote in the
hearts of Believers: and in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5, 6. that Apostle pursueth the same at
large; God hath called us <hi>to Glory and Vertue,</hi> hath given us <hi>exceeding great
and pretious Promises, that by these you might be partakers of the Divine Nature,
having escaped the corruption, that is in the World through lust: Besides this giving
all diligence &amp;c The exceeding great and pretious Promises,</hi> which are given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, in our calling, are bestowed for this end, that by them we may be made
partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> they have no tendency to communicate to us
the <hi>Nature of the Divell,</hi> and to stirre us up to <hi>Rebellion, Vncleannesse,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of the God of all that Love that is in them; But lye indeed, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
the Root, and foundation of the practice and exercise of all those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which he enumerates, and from the receiving of those Promises, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
us to, in the following verse. Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>trine of grace, and of pardon of
sinne in the bloud of Jesus Christ; and so the mercy mentioned in such Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as these, (meerely as in them it is mentioned) Grace and Mercy <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi>
cannot be turned into Wantonnesse; but what are they that doe so?
<hi>Vngodly men, men of old ordained to condemnation; Jude 4. Paul</hi> rejecteth any
such thoughts from the hearts of Believers, <hi>Rom. 6. 1. Shall we continue in sin,
that Grace may abound? God forbid!</hi> Nay suppose that that naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> that is in Believers, be apt to make such a conclusion
as this; Because God will certainly abide with us for ever, therefore let us
walke carelesly, and doe him all the despight we can, these Promises being
not made for the use and exalting of the flesh, but being given to be mixed
with <hi>Faith,</hi> which is carefully to watch against all abusing or corrupting of
that Love and Mercy, which is held out unto it, flesh and bloud can have no
advantage given unto it thereby, as shall afterward be more fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59070:100"/>
demonstrated. The Question is then, what conclusion Faith doth, will, and
ought to make of these Promises of God, and not what abuse the flesh will
make of them. Let then the meanest and weakest Faith in all the World,
that is true and saving, speake for it selfe, whether there be any thing in the
nature of it, that is apt to make such conclusions as these: <hi>My God and Father
in Jesus Christ, hath graciously promised in his infinite Love and Goodnesse to mee,
through him in whom he is well pleased, that he will be my God, and guide for ever,
that he will never forsake mee, nor take his Kindnesse from mee to eternity: And he
hath done this, although that he saw and knew, that I would deale foolishly, and
treacherously, that I would stand in need of all his Goodnesse, Patience, and Mercy
to spare mee, and heale mee, promising also to keep me from such a wicked depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from him, as should for ever alienate my soule from him; therefore come on,
let mee continue in sinne, let me doc him all the dishonour and despight that I can:
this is all the sence that I have of his infinite Love, this is all the impression that it
leaveth upon mee, that I need not love him againe, but study to be as vile and as
abominable in his sight, as can possibly be imagined:</hi> certainly there is not any
<hi>smoaking flax,</hi> or any <hi>oruised reed,</hi> there is not a soule in the World, whom
God in Christ hath once shined upon or dropped the least dramme of Grace
into his heart, but will look on such a conclusion as this, as a blast of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
pit, a detestable dart of Satan, which it is as proper for Faith to
<hi>quench,</hi> as any other Abomination whatever. Let then Faith in reference unto
these Promises, have its perfect worke, not abiding in a naked contemplation
of them, but mixing them with its selfe, and there will be undoubtedly found
the improvement before mentioned, for the carrying on of Godlinesse, and
Gospell obedience in the hearts of Believers; But this I shall have occasion to
speake to more afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 19, 20.<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> is pertinent also to the same purpose, <hi>I will betroth thee unto
mee for ever, I will betroth thee unto mee in righteousnesse, and in judgement, and
in loving kindnesse, and in mercies: I will even betroth thee unto mee in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and thou shalt know the Lord.</hi> The words themselves as they lye in the
<hi>Text,</hi> doe directly confirme our Assertion. The Relation, whereunto God here
expresseth that he will, and doth take his People, is one of the most neer and
eminent, which he affordeth to them; a <hi>conjugall Relation,</hi> he is and will be
their <hi>Husband,</hi> which is as high an expression of the <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt God
and his Saints, as any is, or can be used. Of all Covenants that are between
sundry persons, that, which is between Man and Wife, is the strongest, and
most inviolable; So is this Covenant expressed, <hi>Isai: 54. 5. Thy maker is thine
Husband (the Lord of Hosts is his Name);</hi> and this Relation he affirmeth shall
continue <hi>for ever,</hi> upon the Account of those Properties of his, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
in this his Gracious undertaking to take them to himselfe therein. He
doth it in <hi>Righteousnesse and in Judgement, in Loving-kindnesse and in Mercies,
and in Faithfulnesse;</hi> so that if there be not something in the Context, or
words adjoyning, that shall with an high hand turne us aside from the first,
immediate, open, and full sence of these words, the case is undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in them. This then we shall consider, and therefore must look a little
back into the generall designe of the whole Chapter; for the evasion of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
will not here serve: God betrotheth Persons, not Qualifications.</p>
            <p>There are two parts of the Ch:1.<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> That from the beginning to v. 4. containeth
a most fearfull, and dreadfull commination, and threatning of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord, against the whole Church, and Common-wealth of the
Jewes, for their <hi>Apostasy, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against him; It is not an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or a triall, or some lesser desolation, that God here threatneth them
withall, but utter destruction and rejection, as to all <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Politicall</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59070:100"/>
State; He will leave them neither substance, nor ornament, State, nor Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
describing the condition which came upon them, at their Rejection of
the Lord Jesus Christ; left they must be, as in the day that God first looked
on them <hi>poore, naked,</hi> in <hi>their bloud,</hi> unpittied, formed neither into Church
State, nor Commonwealth: so will I make them saith the Lord; And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
of God the Prophet expresseth with great dread, and terrour, to
the end of the 13. verse.</p>
            <p>2. The second part of the Chapter is taken up and spent,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> from the 14.
verse to the end, in heavenly and gracious <hi>Promises,</hi> of the conversion of the
true <hi>Israelites,</hi> the seed according to the Promise of God, of the Renovation
of the Covenant with them, and blessing them with all spirituall blessings in
Jesus Christ, unto the end. And hereof, there are these foure parts.</p>
            <p>1. An heavenly Promise of their <hi>Conversion,</hi> by the Gospell, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth
and setteth out, by comparing the Spirituall deliverance therein,
to the deliverance, which they had by an high hand from Aegypt: v. 14.
and 15.</p>
            <p>2. The delivery of them so converted, from <hi>Idolatry, False-worship,</hi> and
all those waies whereby God was provoked to cast off their Fore-fathers; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by their obedience, in close walking with God for ever.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>quietnesse and peace,</hi> which they shall enjoy being called, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from their sinnes before mentioned; which the Lord expresseth by his
making a Covenant, with the whole Creation, in their behalfe. v. 18.</p>
            <p>4. A discovery of the fountaine of the mercies before mentioned, with
those also, which afterwards are insisted on, (to wit) the Everlasting <hi>Covenant
of Grace,</hi> through which, God will with all Faithfulnesse, and Mercy take them
to himselfe: v. 19, 20. to the end.</p>
            <p>Before we farther open these particulars,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> some Objections must be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that are laid to prevent the inference intended from these words. <hi>Ch: 11.
Sect: 8. pag.</hi> 229. It is first objected.</p>
            <p>1. The Promise of the Betrothing here specified, is made unto the entire body
and Nation of the Jewes, as well unbelievers, as Believers, as appeareth by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the Chapter throughout.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. The carriage of the Chapter throughout,</hi> is a weake proofe of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
&amp; (no doubt) fixed on, for want of particular instances, to give any
light unto it: neither doth the <hi>carriage of the Chapter throughout,</hi> intimate any
such thing in the least, but expressely manifesteth the contrary. It is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
desolation and utter Rejection, that is assigned as the portion of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
as such, all along this Chapter. This Promise is made to them, whom
<hi>God allureth into the Wildernesse, and there speaketh comfortably to them:</hi> which
what it doth import, shall be afterwards considered. Yea and which is more,
the words of v. 23. which runne on in the same tenor with the Promises par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
insisted on, and beyond all exception are spoken to, and of the same
persons, are applied by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> not to the whole Nation of the Jews,
Idolaters and Unbelievers, but to them that were brought in unto the Lord
Christ, <hi>and obtained the Righteousnesse of Faith,</hi> when <hi>the rest were hardened.
Rom.</hi> 9. 26. From v. 24. to the 30. the Apostle by sundry instances from the
Scripture of the Old Testament, manifesteth, that it was a <hi>Remnant of Israel
according to the election of Grace,</hi> to whom the Promise was made; <hi>To us whom
God hath called, not to the Jewes only, but also to the Gentiles. For so</hi> (saith he)
<hi>it is in Hosea,</hi> (instancing in the passage we insist on) <hi>I will call them my people,
which were not my people, and her beloved which was not beloved, and it shall
come to passe, that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people,
there shall they be called the Children of the Living God.</hi> Which he farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59070:101"/>
firmeth by a Testimony out of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 10. 22, 23. manifesting, that it is but a
<hi>Remnant,</hi> that are intended. Wherefore it is objected:</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That the Promise is conditionall and the performance of it, &amp; of the Mrceies
mentioned in it, suspended upon the repentance of that people, especially of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
to the true, and pure worship of God, as appeareth v. 14, 16, 17. which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sheweth, that it was made as well, nay rather to those that were wicked, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
amongst this People then unto others, as being held forth unto them, chiefly
for this end, to wooe them away from their Idols unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I hope the people of God will more stedfastly abide by their interest
in the sweetnesse, usefulnesse, and consolation of this Promise, then to throw
it away, upon such slight, and <hi>Atheologicall</hi> flourishes. For,</p>
            <p>1. Is there any <hi>title, Iota,</hi> or <hi>word</hi> in the whole Text to intimate that
this Promise is conditionall, and dependeth on the peoples forsaking their
Idolatry, The 14, 16, 17. verses are urged for proofe thereof; God indeed in
those verses doth graciously promise that from the Riches of the same Grace
whence he freely saith, <hi>that he will Betroth them to himselfe,</hi> that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them, and turne them away from their Idolatry, and all their sinnes; but
that that should be required of them, as a <hi>condition</hi> whereon God will enter
into Covenant with them, there is nothing in the whole Context, from v. 14.
and downewards, that intimateth it in the least, or will endure to be wrested
to any such sence; it holding out severall distinct Acts, of the same free Grace,
of his unto his People.</p>
            <p>2. That this is a Promise of <hi>entring into Covenant</hi> with them; cannot be
denied. Now that God should require their Repentance, as an antecedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
previous qualification to his receiving them into Covenant, and yet in
the Covenant, undertake to give them that Repentance, as he doth, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
them to take away their hearts of stone, and give them new hearts of
flesh, is a direct Contradiction, sit only for a part of that <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is in the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an expresse contradiction to the Word, and mind of God.</p>
            <p>3. Neither can it be supposed as a <hi>conditionall Promise,</hi> held out to them
as a motive to work them from their Idolatry, when antecedentaly thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
God hath expressely promised to doe that for them (v. 16, 17.) with as
high an hand and efficacy of Grace, as can well be expressed; wherefore these
being exceptions expressely against the scope of the whole: It is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>3. That it cannot be proved that this promise properly, or directly intendeth the
collation of Spirituall or heavenly good things unto them, so as of Temporall: yea the
situation of it betwixt Temporall Promises, immediately both behind and before
it, perswadeth the contrary: Read the Context from v. 8. to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The other forts being demolished, this last is very faintly defended.
That it cannot be proved, that it doth <hi>so properly</hi> or directly; but if it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
spiritualls <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>directly,</hi> though not <hi>so</hi> properly or directly, the
case is cleare: And that it doth properly intend <hi>Spiritualls,</hi> and but <hi>secondarily</hi>
and indirectly <hi>Temporalls,</hi> as to sundry limitations, is most evident For,</p>
            <p>1. The very <hi>Conjugall Expression</hi> of the Love of God here used, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it beyond all contradiction, to be a Promise of the Covenant: <hi>I will Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth
thee unto mee,</hi> I will take thee unto mee in a Wedlock covenant. What!
in Temporall mercies? Is that the tenor of the Covenant of God? God
forbid!</p>
            <p>2. The Foundations of these Mercies, and the principles from whence
they flow, are <hi>Loving-kindnesses,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Fathfulnesse</hi> in God, which
are fixed upon them, and engaged unto them, whom he thus taketh into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59070:101"/>
and surely they are Spirituall Mercies.</p>
            <p>3. The Mercies mentioned are such, as never had a literall accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in Temporalls, nor can have; and when things promised
exceed all accomplishment as to the outward and <hi>temporall</hi> part, it is the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,</hi>
that is principally and mainely intended; And such are these, v. 18.
<hi>I will breake the bow, and the sword, and the battell out of the earth, and make
you to lye downe in safety:</hi> How I pray was this fulfilled towards them, whilest
they lived under the power of the <hi>Persian, Graecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires, to
their utter desolation? and v. 23. he telleth them that he <hi>will sowe them unto
himselfe in the Earth, and have mercy on them:</hi> which, as I said before, <hi>Paul</hi>
himselfe interpreteth, and applieth to the speciall Mercies of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
in the bloud of Christ; So that both the verses going before, and those
that follow after, to the consideration whereof we are sent, containe direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and properly <hi>spirituall Mercies,</hi> though expressed in words, and termes of
things of a temporall importance. Thus notwithstanding any Exception to
the contrary, the Context is cleare, as it was at first proposed; Let us then in
the next place, consider the intendment of God in this Promise, with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Demonstration, which it hath upon the Truth we are in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of, and then free the words from that <hi>corrupting Glosse,</hi> which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be put upon them.</p>
            <p>In the first I shall consider.<note place="margin">§. 25.</note>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Persons</hi> to <hi>whom</hi> this Promise is made.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Nature</hi> of the Promise it selfe.</item>
                  <item>3. The great <hi>undertaking</hi> and <hi>engagement</hi> of the <hi>Properties</hi> of God, for the
accomplishment of his Promise.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Persons</hi> here intimated are such as are under the power, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Grace and kindnesse mentioned in v. 14, 16, 17, 18. Now because a
right understanding, of the Grace of those Promises, addeth much, to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the Kindnesse of these particulars insisted on, the opening of
those words may be thought necessary.</p>
            <p>1. V. 14. they are those, <hi>whom God allureth into the Wildernesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
comfortably unto them:</hi> He <hi>allureth,</hi> and perswadeth them; there is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
in the words, to the great originall Promise of the conversion of the
Gentiles, and the way whereby it shall be done. <hi>Gen:</hi> 9. 27. God <hi>perswades Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to dwell in the tents of Shem.</hi> Their <hi>alluring</hi> is by the powerfull and sweet
perswasion of the Gospell, which here is so termed, to begin the <hi>Allegory</hi> of
<hi>Betrothing</hi> and <hi>Marriage,</hi> which is afterwards pursued. It is God's beginning
to <hi>Wooe</hi> the Soule by his Embassadors: God <hi>perswadeth them</hi> into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<hi>perswadeth them,</hi> but yet with mighty power, as he carried them of old
out of Aegypt, for thereunto he evidently alludeth, as in the next verse is more
fully expressed. Now the <hi>Wildernesse condition,</hi> whereunto they are allured,
or perswaded by the Gospell, comprizeth two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Separation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Intanglement.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Separation;</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the <hi>Wildernesse</hi> were separated from the
residue of the World, and the pleasures thereof, <hi>the people dwelling alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not reckoned with the Nations,</hi> having nothing to doe with them. So God
separateth them to the love of the Gospell, from their carnall contentments,
and all the satisfactions which before they received in their Lusts, untill they
say to them, <hi>Get you hence, what have we to doe with you any more?</hi> They are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the practice of them, and made willing to bid them everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
farewell. They see their <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Lusts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye slaine, or dead, or at least dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the crosse of Christ, and desire to see them no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59070:102"/>
2. <hi>Intanglement;</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in the Wildernesse, they knew not
what to doe, nor which way to take one step, but only as God went before
them: as he took them by the hand, and taught them to goe; God bringeth
them into a lost condition: they know not what to doe, nor which way to
take, nor what course to pitch upon: and yet in this <hi>Wildernesse state,</hi> God
doth commonly stirre up such gracious dispositions of soule in them, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is exceedingly delighted withall: hence he doth peculiarly call this time,
<hi>a Time of Love,</hi> which he remembreth with much delight. All the time of the
Saints walking with him, he taketh not greater delight in a soule, when it
cometh to its highest peace and fullest assurance, then when it is seeking after
him in its Wildernesse Intanglement. So he expresseth it <hi>Ierem: 2. 2. Thus saith
the Lord, I remember thee, the kindnesse of thy youth, the Love of thine Espousals,
when thou wentest after mee in the Wildernesse, in a land that was not sowen.</hi> And
what he here affirmeth, holds proportion therewithall. The Time of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Wildernesse, was the Time of their <hi>Espousals;</hi> and so it is here, the
Time of the Lords Betrothing the Soule to himselfe: the <hi>Wooing words</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he doth it, being intimated in the next verse. For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He speaketh comfortably to them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 27.</note> speaketh to their hearts: good words
that may satisfy their spirits, and give them Rest, and deliverance out of that
condition. What it is that God speaketh, when he speaketh comfortably to
the very hearts of poore soules, he telleth you, <hi>Isai: 40. 1. Comfort you, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you my People, saith your God, speake you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry
unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned;</hi> It is the
pardon of iniquity that enwrappeth all the Consolation, that a poore Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
soule <hi>separated</hi> and <hi>intangled</hi> is capable of, or doth desire. And this is
the first description of the Persons, to whom this Promise is given. They are
such as God hath <hi>humbled</hi> and <hi>pardoned;</hi> such as he hath <hi>converted,</hi> and <hi>justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
whom hehath <hi>allured</hi> into the Wildernesse, &amp; there spoken <hi>comfortably</hi> to
them.</p>
            <p>2. Verse 15,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> the Lord promiseth to this called and justified People, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Spirituall Gospell Mercies,</hi> which he shaddoweth out with <hi>typicall</hi> Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Temporall enjoyments, and that with Allusion to their deliverance
of old, from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in three particulars.</p>
            <p>1. In generall; He will give them <hi>Vineyards from thence</hi> (that is, from the
Wildernesse) as he did to them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> when he brought them out of the
Wildernesse. This God often mindeth them of, that he gave them <hi>Vineyards
which they planted not. Deut.</hi> 6. 11. And here setteth out the plenty of Gospell
Grace, which they never laboured for, which he had provided for them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that notion. He giveth them of the Wine of the Gospell, his holy
Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. In particular: He compares his dealings with them, to his dealings in
the <hi>valley of Achor;</hi> a most pleasant and fruitfull valley, that was neere <hi>Jericho,</hi>
being the first the <hi>Israelites</hi> entred into, when they came out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
which is mentioned as a fruitfull place. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 10. And therefore this is
said to be to them a <hi>doore of hope,</hi> or an entrance into that, which they hoped
for; it being the first fat, fruitfull, and fertile place that the <hi>Israelites</hi> came
into, in the Land of Canaan, and so an entrance into the good land which
they hoped for, answering their Expectation to the uttermost. In the Promise
of the abundance of Spirituall Mercies &amp; Grace, which God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for his, here calleth into their minds, the consideration of the refreshment,
which the Israelites after so long an abode in the <hi>wast and howling Wildernesse,</hi>
had, and took in the fruitfull plenteous <hi>valley of Achor.</hi> Such is the spirituall
provision, that God hath made for the entertainment of poore soules, whom
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59070:102"/>
he hath <hi>allured</hi> into the Wildernesse, and there <hi>spoken comfortably</hi> to them;
being <hi>called</hi> and <hi>pardoned,</hi> he leadeth them to sweet and pleasant pastures,
treasures of Grace and Mercies, which he hath laid up for them in Jesus
Christ. He giveth them of the <hi>first fruits of Heaven,</hi> which is a <hi>doore of hope</hi>
unto the full possession. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23.</p>
            <p>3. To the <hi>Songs,</hi> and <hi>Rejoycings,</hi> which the Church had, when they sung
one to another, upon the destruction of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> at their delivery out of
the bondage of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> As then they sung for joy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15, upon the sence
of that great and wonderfull deliverance, which God had wrought for them,
so shall their hearts be affected with Gospell Mercies, pardoning, healing,
purging, and comforting Grace, which in Jesus Christ he will give in unto
them. These then are the three things, which are promised to them that
come out of the Wildernesse. 1. Gospell refreshment, in powring out of the
Spirit upon them. 2. The first fruits of Heaven, <hi>a doore of Hope.</hi> 3. Spirituall
joy, in the destruction and conquest of sinne.</p>
            <p>This then is the summe,<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> of this second part of that description, which wee
have of those persons, to whom the Promise under consideration is given;
They are such as being <hi>Called,</hi> and <hi>Pardoned,</hi> are admitted to that portion in
the wonderfull marvelous provision of Gospell Mercies, and Grace, which in
Jesus Christ he hath provided for them, with that joy and Consolation which
thereon doth ensue. In the following verses you have a fuller description of
these Persons, upon a twofold account.</p>
            <p>1. By their delivery from Idolarty and falfe-worship, <hi>v:</hi> 16, 17. which is
particularly and peculiarly insisted on, because that eminently was the sinne,
for which, those mentioned in the beginning of the Chapter, were utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:
God will preserve these, as from the sinne of Idolatry, so from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that should procure their utter Rejection and desolation, as that of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
had formerly done, in respect of the only carnall Jewes.</p>
            <p>2. By their protection against their enemies, v: 18. and these are the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
to whom this Promise is made; converted, justified, sanctified, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Persons.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> We may take a little view of the Nature of the Promise it selfe,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> 
               <hi>I will</hi>
(saith the Lord) <hi>betroth thee unto me for ever;</hi> There is in this Promise a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
opposition to that Rejection, that God had before denounced unto the
carnall and <hi>rebellious Jewes.</hi> 1. In the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing it selfe, unto the
<hi>divorce,</hi> that God gave them <hi>v. 2. Shee is not my Wife, neither am I her Husband:</hi>
but to these (saith God) <hi>I will betroth them unto my selfe,</hi> they shall become a
<hi>Wife</hi> to mee, and I will be a <hi>Husband</hi> unto them: and this also manifesteth
that they are not the same persons, to whom that threatning was given, that
are principally intended in this Promise; For if God did only take <hi>them</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<hi>whom</hi> he had once put away, there would have been no need of any
betrothing of them anew; New <hi>Sponsalia</hi> are not required for such an
Action.</p>
            <p>2. In the continuance of the Rejection of the first, and the establishment
of the Reception of the latter, at least in respect of his abiding with these, and
those; with those for a season: but unto these (he saith) <hi>I will Betroth them
unto me</hi> FOR EVER. Gods betrothing of Believers is his actuall taking
them into a <hi>Marriage covenant</hi> with himselfe, to deale with them in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
faithfulnesse, and protection of a Husband. So is he often pleased
to call himselfe in reference to his Church; I shall not goe forth to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this <hi>Relation,</hi> that God is pleased to take the soules of Saints into
with himselfe. The eminent and precious usefulnesse and consolation, that
floweth from it, is ready to draw me out thereunto, but I must attend that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59070:103"/>
which I principally aime at; namely, to evince, that God hath undertaken,
the <hi>Hee</hi> and Believers, will, and shall abide in this Relation to the end; that
he will for ever be a Husband to them, and that in opposition to his dealing
with the carnall Church of the Jewes, to whom he was betrothed as to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
but rejected them, and said he was <hi>not their Husband,</hi> as to peculiar
grace. To whom God continueth to be a <hi>Husband,</hi> to them he continueth the
loving-kindnesse, goodwill and protection of a Husband, the most intense,
usefull, fruitfull, that can be imagined: This then will he doe to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and that for Ever. Now because sundry Objections may be levied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Accomplishment of this Engagement of God, upon the account of
our instability, and backsliding, the Lord addeth the manner of his entring
into this engagement with us, obviating and preventing, or removing all
such <hi>Objections</hi> whatever, which is the third thing proposed to consideration,
namely, the Engagement of the Properties of God, for the accomplishment
of this Promise.</p>
            <p>Five <hi>Properties</hi> doth the Lord here mention,<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> to assure us of his constancy in
this undertaking of his Grace, and the stedfastnesse of the Covenant he hath
taken his People into: and they are <hi>Righteousnesse, Judgement, Loving-kindnesse,</hi>
and <hi>Mercies,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulnesse;</hi> whose efficacy also in reference unto <hi>their</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
with him, whom he doth betroth to himselfe, he mentioneth in the
close of <hi>v: 20. thou</hi> (saith he) <hi>shalt know the Lord.</hi> I shall not insist on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
importance of the severall Expressions, whereby the Lord hath set
forth himselfe, and his goodnesse here unto us: It is plaine, that they are all
mentioned to the same end and purpose, namely to give Assurance unto us of
the Unchangeablenesse of this worke of his Grace, and to prevent the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which the fears of our unbelieving hearts, from the consideration of
our weaknesse, wayes, and walkings, temptations, trialls and troubles, would
raise upon it. The Lord, when he <hi>betroths</hi> us to himselfe, sees and knows what
we are, what we will be, and how we will provoke the eyes of his Glory. He
sees, that if we should be left unto our selves, we would utterly cast off all
knowledge of him, and obedience unto him; Wherefore (saith he) <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth
thee unto me in Righteousnesse and Judgment,</hi> allowing full measure for all
thy weaknesses, that they shall not dissolve that union I intend. As if a Prince
should goe to take to him in Marriage a poore deformed Beggar, who being
amazed with his kindnesse, and fearing much least he should be mistaken, and
account her otherwise then indeed shee is, which, when it is discovered, will
be her ruine, she plainly telleth him, she is poore, deformed, and hath nothing
in the World, that may answer his expectation, and therefore she cannot but
feare, that when he knoweth her throughly indeed, he will utterly cast her off:
But he thereupon replieth, Feare no such thing, what I doe, I doe in <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>
and <hi>Judgement,</hi> knowingly of thee, and thy Condition, and so as that,
I will abide by it. Perhaps (as some think) by this <hi>betrothing us in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
the Lord may intimate his bestowing upon us Righteousnesse, yea his
becoming in Jesus Christ our Righteousnesse, to supply that utter want,<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 24.</note> which
is in us of that which is acceptable unto him. Now because we are not only
unmeet, to be at first accepted into any such termes of alliance with the Lord,
but also shall certainly in the carrying of it on, behave our selves foolishly and
frowardly, unanswerable to his loving-kindnesse, so that he may justly cast
us off for ever, he telleth us farther, that he betroths us to himselfe <hi>in Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse
and Mercies,</hi> knowing that in entring into this alliance with us, he
maketh worke for his tenderest bowels of Compassion, his pitty, and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy. In his continuance in this Relation, whatever his Kindnesse, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Pardoning mercy can be extended unto, that he will accomplish
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59070:103"/>
and bring about. But will not the Lord, when he pardons once, and againe,
at length be waried by our innumerable provocations, so as to cast us off for
ever? No (saith he) this will I doe in <hi>Faithfulnesse.</hi> He doubleth the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Grace, and addeth a Property of his nature, that will carry him out
to abide by his first Love to the utmost; <hi>I will</hi> (saith he) <hi>even betroth thee unto
my selfe in Faithfulnesse.</hi> His firmenesse, constancie, and truth, in all his waies
and promises will he use in this work of his Grace, <hi>Deut:</hi> 32. 4. But perhaps
notwithstanding all this, the heart is not yet quiet: yet it feareth it selfe, and
its own treachery, least it should utterly fall off from this gracious <hi>Husband;</hi>
wherefore in the close of all, God undertaketh for them also, that no scruple
may remaine, why our soules should not be satisfied, with the sincere milke
that floweth from this breast of Consolation; <hi>Thou shalt</hi> (saith he) <hi>know the
Lord;</hi> This indeed is required, that under the Accomplishment of this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Promise, you <hi>know the Lord,</hi> (that is) believe, and trust, and obey the
Lord: and (saith he) thou shalt doe it. I will by my Grace keep alive in thy
heart (as a fruit of that Love, wherewith I have <hi>betrothed</hi> thee to my selfe) that
Knowledge, Faith, and Obedience, which I require of thee</p>
            <p>This then is some part of that, which in this Promise, the Lord holdeth out
unto us, and assureth us of: notwithstanding his Rejection of the carnall
<hi>Jewes,</hi> yet for his elect, both the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he will so take them into
a <hi>Marriage Covenant</hi> with himselfe, that he will continue for ever a <hi>Husband</hi>
unto them: undertaking also, that they shall continue in Faith, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>knowing him all their dayes:</hi> and of all this, he effectually assureth them,
upon the account of his <hi>Righteousnesse, Judgement, Loving-kindnesse, Mercy,
and Faithfulnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but adde, that, if there were no other place of Scripture in the
whole Book of God, to confirme the Truth we have in hand, but only this: I
should not doubt (the Lord assisting) to close with it upon the signall Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
given unto it thereby, notwithstanding all the specious Oppositions that
are made thereunto.</p>
            <p>For the Close,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> I shall a little consider that leane and hungry Exposition of
these words, which is given in the place before metioned Ch. 11. Sect: 8. pag.
229. <hi>I will betroth them unto me in Righteousnesse, and in Judgement, and in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindnesse,
and Mercy:</hi> so the words are expressed in a different <hi>Character,</hi>
as the very words of the Promise in the Text. 1. (<hi>Thee</hi>) that is, the <hi>Church,</hi> is
changed into (<hi>Them</hi>) that is, the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and their Children or carnall seed, as a
little before was expressed: and then that emphaticall expression (<hi>for ever</hi>)
is quite thrust out of the Text, as a stubborne word, not to be dealt withall
upon any faire termes. Let us see then, how that which remaineth is treated
and turned off. (<hi>I will betroth thee) that is, I will engage and attempt to insure
both them, and their affections to mee, by all variety of waies, and meanes, that
are proper and likely to bring such a thing to passe:</hi> But who knoweth not that
this is <hi>wooing,</hi> and not <hi>betrothing?</hi> we need not goe farre to find out men lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Law, to informe us, that to <hi>try,</hi> and <hi>attempt to get</hi> and assure the
affections of any one, is not a <hi>Betrothment.</hi> This then is the first part of this
Exposition: (<hi>I will betroth</hi>) that is, I will <hi>wooe</hi> and <hi>essay,</hi> attempt and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to get their affections: which besides the forementioned absurdity, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with another sore oversight, (to wit) that God promiseth to <hi>doe</hi> this
very thing in the last words of <hi>v.</hi> 20. which is affirmed, that he doth but <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
to doe.</p>
            <p>To proceed: (he saith) <hi>I will doe this, 1. By shewing my selfe Just and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unto them, in keeping my Promise concerning their deliverance out of captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
at the end of 70 years.</hi> So then, in this new Paraphrase, <hi>I will Betroth thee,</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59070:104"/>
(that is, the <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles) to my selfe for ever in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
is, I will essay to get their affections, by shewing my selfe <hi>Righteous</hi> in
the Promise of bringing the Jewes out of captivity. That this Promise is not
made to the body of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> returning out of Captivity, was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated;
The <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> here mentioned, is that, which God will, and
doth exercise in this very Act of <hi>Betrothing,</hi> and not any other act of it, which
he will make use of to that purpose. God engageth to <hi>betroth them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in Righteousnesse,</hi> using and exercising his Righteousnesse in that very Act
of his <hi>Love,</hi> and Grace to them: and this is now given, in an <hi>alluring them to
love him by appearing Righteous, in bringing them out of Captivity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like interpretation is given of the other expressions following,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> (<hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>)
<hi>It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>by punishing and judging their enemies, and destroying
them that led them into captivity, and held them in bondage and subjection,</hi> and
(Loving-kindnesse) <hi>is his giving them corne, wine, oyle, peace and plenty,</hi> and
(Mercy) <hi>in pardoning of daily sins, and insirmities,</hi> and (Faithfulnesse) is, <hi>he
knoweth not what.</hi> This is made the summe of all; God by doing them good,
with outward mercies, and pardoing some sins and infirmities, will <hi>morally</hi>
try to get their affections to himselfe. <hi>Virgula Pictoris.</hi> 1. It is not an Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods <hi>attempting to get</hi> their Love, but of the establishing and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own. 2. That God should morally try and <hi>essay</hi> to doe, and effect,
or bring about any thing, which yet he doth not, will not, or cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
and effect, is not to be ascribed to him, without casting the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of <hi>Impotency, Ignorance, Changeablenesse,</hi> upon him imaginable. 3. God
promising to <hi>Betroth</hi> us to himselfe, fixing his love on us, <hi>that we shall know
him,</hi> so fixing our hearts on him; to say, that this holdeth out only the use of
some outward meanes unto us, enervateth the whole <hi>Covenant of his Grace,</hi>
wrapt up in these Expressions; so that all things considered, it is not a little
strange to me, that any sober learned man, should ever be tempted so to
wrest, and corrupt, by wrested and forced Gsosses, the plaine words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
wherein whatever is pretended, he cannot have the least countenance of
any Expositor of note, that went before him: Although we are not to be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the name of <hi>Tarnovius a Lutheran,</hi> a professed Adversary in this cause;
yet let his Exposition of that place under consideration be consulted with, and
it will plainely appeare, that it abideth not in any compliance with that,
which is here by our Author imposed on us.</p>
            <p>The Promises we have under consideration,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> looking immediately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
only to <hi>one part</hi> of that Doctrine, whose defence we have undertaken,
(to wit) the <hi>Constancy and Unchangeablenesse of the Grace of Justification,</hi> or
God's abiding with his Saints, as to his free acceptance of them and love unto
them unto the end, I shall not insist on many more particulars.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the verse foregoing, our Saviour renders a reason why the <hi>Pharisees</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all his <hi>Preaching</hi> to them, and the <hi>Miracles</hi> he wrought among
them, yet believed not, when sundry others, to whom the same dispensation
of outward meanes was afforded, did heare his voice and did yeild obedience
thereunto; and this he telleth us was, because <hi>they were not of his sheepe:</hi> such
as were given him of his Father, and for whom as the <hi>good Shepheard</hi> he lay'd
downe his life, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. upon the close of this discourse, he describeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Condition of his <hi>Sheepe,</hi> &amp; their Preservation in that Condition from the
power of himselfe, and his Father engagedthere unto. He layeth <hi>their abiding
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59070:104"/>
him as his Sheepe,</hi> upon the Omnipotence of God, which upon account of the
constancie of his Love towards them, he will exercise and exert as need shall
be, in their behalfe. There are many emphaticall expressions both of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in the Obedience of Faith, and of his undertaking for their Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein. The latter I at present only intend. (Saith he) 1. <hi>I know them.</hi>
2. <hi>I give them Eternall Life. 3. They shall never perish. 4. No man shall plucke
them out of my hand.</hi> 5. My Father is Omnipotent: and hath a Soveraignty
over all, and he taketh care of them, <hi>and none shall take them out of his hand.</hi> It
is not easy to cast these words into any other form of arguing, then that
wherein they lye, without loosing much of that convincing Evidence that is
in them: this you may take for the summe of their influence into the Truth
in hand. Those whom Christ so owneth, as to take upon him to give them
Eternall Life, and by his Power, and the Power of his Father, to preserve
them thereunto, which power shall not, nor possibly can be prevailed against,
so that the end aimed at to be accomplished therein, should not be brought
about, those shall certainely be kept for ever in the Favour and Love of God,
they shall never be turned from him. Such is the case of all Believers: for they
are all the Sheep of Christ, they all heare his voice and follow him.</p>
            <p>Some few things to wrest this Gracious assurance given Believers, of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
good will of God &amp; Christ unto them,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> by Mr <hi>Goodwin Cap. 10. Sect.
37. Page.</hi> 203. are attempted.</p>
            <p>1. He granteth, that there is an engagement of the <hi>mighty power of God for
the safegarding of the Saints, as such, or remaining such, against all adverse power
what ever: But no where for the compelling or necessitating of them to persevere,
and continue such, is there any thing in the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The sum is, if they will continue Saints, God will take care that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all opposition, they shall be Saints still. Very well! if they will
be so, they shall be so: But that they shall <hi>continue</hi> to be so, that is not promised.
The termes of Compelling, or Necessitating, are cast in, meerly to throe dirt
upon the Truth, least the beauty shining forth too brightly, there might have
bin danger, that the very <hi>Exceptor</hi> himselfe could not have born it. We say not
that God by his Power compelleth men to persevere, (that is) maketh them
doe it, whether they will or no. Perseverance being an habitual Grace in their
wills, it is a grosse contradiction once to imagine that men should be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thereunto. But this we say, that by the Almighty Power of his Spirit, and
Grace, he confirmeth his Saints, in a voluntary abiding, with him all their
dayes. Having made them a willing People in the day of the Power of Christ
towards them, he preserveth them unto the end. Neither are they wrapt up by
the power of God into such a necessity of <hi>Perseverance,</hi> as should obstruct the
liberty of their Obedience; The necessity that regardeth them in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
respecting only the <hi>issue</hi> and end of things, and not their manner of
support in their abiding with God. And it is not easie to conjecture why our
Author, should so studiously avoid the grant of a Promise of finall Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
in these words, who in his next observation upon them, affirmeth,
<hi>that they respect the state of the Saints in Heaven, and not at all those that are on
Earth;</hi> I meane that part of those words, which expresseth their preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and safegarding by the Power of God. So that this is fancied perhaps, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to be the condition of the Saints in Heaven, that God will there preserve
them whilst they continue Saints, but that they shall so do, there is not any
Assurance given, or to be had. It is marvelous if this be so, that in so large
and vast a space of time, we yet never heard of any of those holy ones, that
were cast out of his Inheritance, or that forfeited his injoyment. But let us
heare what is farther asserted. He addeth by way of Answer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59070:105"/>
1. <hi>The security, for which our Saviour engageth the Greatnesse of his Fathers
power unto his sheepe, is promised unto them, not in order to the effecting or procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their finall Perseverance, but rather by way of reward to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But what <hi>Tittle</hi> is there (I pray you) in the whole Context to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
any such thing? What insinuation of any such Condition? <hi>They heare
my voice, and they follow me,</hi> (that is) they believe in me, and bring forth the
fruits of their Believing in suitable obedience, as these words of <hi>hearing</hi> and
<hi>following</hi> do imply. (Saith our Saviour,) these <hi>shall not perish;</hi> the Power of my
Father shall preserve them; (that is) saith our Author, <hi>in case they persevere
to the end,</hi> then <hi>God will preserve them:</hi> clearely our Saviour undertaketh, that
Believers shall not perish, and that his Power and his Fathers are engaged
for that end, which is all we assert, or have need to do.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That this Promise of safety, made to his Sheepe by Christ, doth not relate to
their state or condition in this present world, but that of the world to come. My
Sheepe heare my voice and follow me, in which words of hearing and following
him, he intimateth or includeth their Perseverance, as appeareth by the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
following. And I give them Eternall Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This I confesse is to the purpose if it be true: but being so contrary
to what hath been (I had almost said <hi>Universally</hi>) received, concerning the
mind of Christ in this place, we had need of evident concluding Reasons, to
enforce the truth of this glosse or interpretation. For the present I shall
give you some few inducements or perswasions, why it seemeth altogether
unsuitable to the mind of our Blessed Saviour, that this ingagement of his
Fathers Power, and his owne, should be shut out from taking any place in the
Kingdome of Grace.</p>
            <p>1. Observe that there is a great opposition to be made against the Saints,
in that condition, wherein they are promised to be preserved. This is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the words themselves. <hi>There is none shall take them out of my hands: my
Father is great, and none shall be able to take them out of his hands.</hi> As if he
should have said, It is true, many Enemies they have, great opposition will
there be, and arise against them on all hands, but preserved they shall be in
the midst of them all; But now what Enemies, what opposition will there be,
and arise against the Saints in Heaven? The Holy Ghost telleth us, <hi>the last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is Death,</hi> and that at the Resurrection, that shall be utterly <hi>swallowed up
into Victory,</hi> that it shall never lift up the head; There they rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
who dye in the Lord. Yea, it is exceeding ridiculous to suppose, that
the Saints need Assurance of the engagement of the Omnipotency of God, for
their safeguarding in heaven, against all opposition, when they are assured of
nothing more, then that there they shall not be liable to the least opposition,
or obstruction, in their enjoyment of God, unto all eternity.</p>
            <p>2. Our Saviour here describeth the present condition of his <hi>sheep,</hi> in a way
of opposition to them that are not his <hi>sheep:</hi> His <hi>heare his voyce,</hi> the others
doe not, and his shall be preserved, when the others perish: The <hi>Pharisees</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not, and, as he told them, <hi>they died in their sinnes;</hi> his sheep heard him,
and were preserved in their obedience. It is then evidently the deportment
of Christ towards, and his care of his sheepe in this World, in a contra-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to them, who <hi>are not</hi> his sheepe, among whom they live, that is here set
forth.</p>
            <p>3. The very Context of the words inforceth this sence: <hi>They follow me, and
I give them eternall life,</hi> I doe it, that's the work I have in hand. Take eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Life in the most comprehensive sence, for that which is to be enjoyed in
heaven, (though doubtlesse it comprizeth also the Life of Grace, which here
we enjoy. <hi>Ioh:</hi> 17. 3:) What is that which our Saviour undertaketh to give

               </gap>

               </gap>
on, though without offering the greatest violence imaginable to Truth it
selfe, it cannot be done. It is said, that by these words, <hi>They heare my voyce,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Christ doth intimate, or include their Perseverance:</hi> to say a <hi>thing

               </hi> or <hi>included,</hi> is of small power against so many expresse Reasons,
as we have induced to the contrary; but will this be granted, that where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Saints are said to heare the voyce of Christ, Perseverance is included?
We shall quickly have a fresh supply of Scripture proofes, for the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Truth in hand: but what attempt is made for the proofe hereof?
It is so, because the words immediatly following are, <hi>I give to them eternall
Life,</hi> which presuppose their finall Perseverance; and this must be <hi>so,</hi> because
it <hi>is so said; I will give to them Eternall Life,</hi> is either an intimation of what he
doth for the present, by giving them a <hi>spirituall Life</hi> in himselfe, or a Promise
he will doe so, with respect to eternall Life consummated in heaven; which
Promise is every where made upon Believing: and it is a <hi>Promise of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
not given <hi>upon Perseverance.</hi> Neither is there any thing added in the
words following, to confirme this uncouth wresting of the mind of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
but only the Assertion is repeated, <hi>that God will defend them in Heaven
against all opposition.</hi> Here, where their oppositions are innumerable, they
may shift for themselves, but when they come to Heaven, where they shall
be sure to meet with no opposition at all; there the Lord hath engaged his
Almighty power for their safety, against all that shall arise up against them;
and this is (as is said) the naturall, and cleare disposition of the Context in
this place, but, <hi>Nobis non licet &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are sundry other texts of Scripture, which most clearely and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
confirme the truth we have in hand, which are all well worth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
for our consolation and establishment: as also something of our
labour and diligence to quit them from those glosses and interpretations,
(which turne them aside from their proper intendment) that are by some put
upon them. Amongst which 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 8, 9. 1. Philip. 6. 1 Thess. 5. 24. Joh.</hi> 5.

God thereby accomplished: His distributive justice engaged. 11. Observations for the clearing
of the former assertions. Whether any one, for whom Christ died, may dye in sinne. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Faith and Obedience. The Reasons thereof. The end of Faith and Holinesse. 12. The
first Argument for the proofe of the former Assertions, concerning the fruit, and efficacy of the
death of Christ: Heb. 9. 14. The second. The third. The compact between the Father &amp; Son about
the work of mediation. 14. The Fourth. Good things bestowed on them for whom Christ died,
antecedently to any thing spiritually good in them. The Spirit so bestowed, and Faith it selfe. The
close of those Arguments. 14. Inferences from the foregoing discourse. The Efficacy of the
death of Christ, and the necessity of Faith and Obedience reconciled. Sundry considerations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that end proposed. All Spirituall mercies, fruits of the death of Christ. (2.) All the fruits of
Christs death laid up in the hand of Gods Righteousnesse. (3.) The state of them, for whom
Christ died not actually changed by his death. (4) On what account Believing is necessary.
15. Christ secures the stability of the Saints abiding with God. What is contrary thereunto, how
by him removed. The World overcome by Christ, as mannaged by Sathan in an enmity to the
Saints. 16. The compleat victory of Christ over the Devill. The waies, whereby he compleats
his conquest. The Rule of Sathan in respect of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

17. The Title of Sathan to a rule over men, judged and destroyed by Christ. The exercise of all
power taken from him. 18. The works of Sathan destroyed by Christ, in, and for his Elect.
19. The Holy Spirit procured by the death of Christ. 20. The giving of the spirit, the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the New Covenant. 21. This farther proved and confirmed. 22. The perpetuall Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Holy Spirit with Believers, proved by the threefold testimony of Father, Sonne, and

That farther cleared: not to all Israel according to the flesh. 25. Mr G's Objections answered.
26. The Testimony of the Sonne given to the perpetuall abiding of the Spirit with Believers.
Ioh: 14. 16. opened. The Promise in those words equally belonging to all Believers. 27. Mr G's
Objections answered. No Promise of the Spirit abiding with Believers on his principle allowed.
The Promise given to the Apostles personally, yet given also to the whole Church. Promises
made to the Church, made to the individualls, whereof it is constituted. 28. The giving of
this Promise to all Believers farther argued from the scope of the place: And vindicated from
Mr G's exceptions. 29. The third Testimony of the Holy Spirit himselfe proposed to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
His Testimony in sealing particularly considered. 2 Cor: 1. 22. Ephes: 1. 13. 4. 30. Of the

shall reserve the handling of it to the close of the whole; if God
be pleased to carry us out thereunto, that we may give <hi>The Oath of God</hi> its due

            <p>The order of our method first proposed would here call me to handle <hi>our

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59070:106"/>
But because some men may admire, and aske, whence it is, that the Lord will
abide so Stedfast in his Love towards Believers, as hath been manifested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
severall accounts, that he will, besides what hath beene said before of his
owne Goodnesse and Unchangeablenesse &amp;c. I shall now adde that outward
consideration, which lyes in the <hi>Mediation of Christ,</hi> upon the account whereof,
he acts his owne Goodnesse, and Kindnesse to us, with the greatest advantage
of Glory ad Honour to himselfe, that can be thought upon. Only I shall desire
the Reader to observe, that the Lord Jesus is an undertaker in this businesse
of perfecting our Salvation, and safegarding our Spirituall Glory, not in one
regard and respect only; There is one part of his Ingagement therein, which,
under the Oath of God, is the close of the whole; and that is, his becoming a
<hi>surety</hi> to us of his Fathers Faithfulnesse towards us; and a <hi>suerty</hi> for us, of our
Faithfulnesse to him; so that upon the whole matter, the businesse on each
side, as to security, will be found knit up in him, and there we shall do well
to leave it, though the handling of that <hi>suertiship</hi> of his be not of our present
consideration; Men will scarce dispute him out of his Faithfulnesse; <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
he dyeth no more, death hath no more dominion over him, he sitts at the

will doe if God permit. And for the stedfastnesse of his Saints, in their abiding
with God, I shall (I feare) no otherwise insist peculiarly upon it, but as occasion
shall be ministred by dealing with our Advesary, as we passe on.</p>
            <p>That which I shall now doe,<note place="margin">§: 3.</note> is, to consider the influence of the <hi>Preisthood</hi>
of Christ in those two Grand Acts thereof, his <hi>Oblation &amp; Intercession,</hi> into the
Perseverance of <hi>Saints,</hi> according to that of the Apostle <hi>Heb. 5. 27. Wherefore he
is able also to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he
liveth ever to make intercession for them.</hi> And I will doe it the more carefully,
because though it be one of the greatest strengths of our Cause, yet I shall
walke in a path, wherein none shall meet me, for the most part of the way, to
make any opposition.</p>
            <p>My entrance into the consideration of the procurement of our Glory by
Christ,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> shall be with that, whereby he came into his owne, <hi>viz.</hi> his Oblation,
which hath a twofold influence into the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 24.</note> or into the
<hi>Safeguarding</hi> of their Salvation to the utmost.</p>
            <p>1. By removing and taking out of the way all causes of separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 2.</note> and those that come unto God by him: that is, all Believers.
Now these are of two sorts:</p>
            <p>1. That which is <hi>morall,</hi> &amp; procuring such seperation or distance, which
is the <hi>Guilt of Sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That which is <hi>Efficient,</hi> &amp; working as the <hi>power of Sathan &amp; of sinne.</hi> The
first of these, being that alone, for which it may be supposed that God will
turne from Believers; and the latter, that alone, whereby they may possibly be
turned from him. Now that both these are so taken out of the way by the <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Christ, that they shall never actually &amp; eventually worke, or cause any
totall, or finall separation betweene God &amp; Believers, shall be demonstrated.</p>
            <p>1. He hath so taken away the <hi>Guilt of Sinne</hi> from Believers,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> from them
that come to God by him,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 10. 2. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> that it shall not prevaile with the Lord to turne
from them: He hath obtained for us <hi>Eternall Redemption Heb. 9. 12. Eternall</hi>
and <hi>Compleat;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coll. 1. 20, 21, 22.</note> nor <hi>so</hi> farre and <hi>so</hi> farre, but <hi>Eternall Redemption</hi> hath he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
Redemtion that shall be compleated, notwithstanding any interveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
imaginable what ever:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.</note> This Redemption, which he hath obtained for
us,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 7.</note> and which by him we obtaine, the Apostle tells us what it is, and wherein
it doth consist <hi>Ephes. 1. 2. In whom we have Redemption through his Bloud, even
the forgivenesse of sinnes.</hi> He hath obtained for us <hi>everlasting forgivenesse of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59070:107"/>
Sinnes;</hi> as to the compleat efficiency of the procuring cause thereof, absolutely
perfect and compleat in its owne kinde, not depending on any Condition in
any other whatsoever, for the producing the utmost effect intended in it;
There shall be no after reckoning or account for sinne, betweene God and
them, for whom he so obtaines Redemption. And the Apostle in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> disputes at large this difference, betweene the
<hi>Typical Sacrifices,</hi> &amp; the Sacrifice of the bloud of Christ; He tels you, those were
offered <hi>year by yeare,</hi> and could never make the <hi>comers to God by them perfect:</hi>
(or acquit them from sinne) for then they could have had no more <hi>Conscience
of sinne</hi> being once purged; but now (saith he) <hi>there was a remembrance againe of
sinne renewed every yeare, v.</hi> 3, 4. If sinne had been taken away, there would
have been no more <hi>Conscience of it:</hi> that is, no such Conscience, as upon the
Account whereof, they came for helpe unto, or healing by those Sacrifices:
no more Conscience <hi>condemning for sinne;</hi> Conscience judges according to the
Obligation unto punishment; which it apprehends upon it. Conscience of
sinne; that is, a <hi>tendernesse</hi> to sinne, and a <hi>condemnation</hi> of sinne, still continues
after the taking of the guilt of it away; but Conscience disquieting, judging,
condemning the <hi>Person</hi> for sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> that vanisheth together with the guilt of it;
And this is done, when the Sacrifice for sinne is perfect and compleat, and
really attaines the end for which it was instituted; And if any Sacrifice
for sinne what ever, doe not compleatly take away that sinne for
which the Oblation is made, and the Attonement thereby, so that no after
charge might come upon the sinner, it is of necessity, that, that Sacrifice be
renewed againe, and againe. The reason the Apostle gives of the repetition of
the Legall Sacrifices, is, that they made not the <hi>comers to them perfect:</hi> that
is, as to the taking away of their sinnes and giving them entire and complete
peace thereupon; All this the Apostle informes us, was don in the Sacrifice of
Christ, <hi>v. 14. with one offering he hath for ever perfected</hi> (or made perfect that
worke for them as to this businesse of Conscience for sinne) <hi>them that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi>
His one Offering perfectly put an end to this businesse; even the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene God and us, upon the account of sinne; which if he had
not done, it would have beene necessary, that he should have <hi>been often
offered,</hi> his Sacrifice having not obtained the complete end thereof; That
the efficacy of this Sacrifice of his, cannot depend on any thing forraigne unto
it, shall be declared afterwards. Also that the necessity of our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
in their proper place, is not in the least hereby impaired, shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.
That they may have a proper place, efficacy, and usefullnesse, and
not be conditions whereon the effects of the death of Christ are suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as to their Communication unto us, is by some denyed: how weakely,
how falsly, will then also appeare. Now this Christ doth for all that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
or dedicated, or consecrated unto God, (which is almost the perpetuall
sence of that word in this Epistle) in, and by that Offering of his. And this
the Apostle farther conmfires from the Consideration of the New <hi>Covenant</hi>
with us, ratifyed in, and whose Effects were procured by, the Bloud-shedding
and Offering of Christ, <hi>v. 17. their sinnes and their iniquities I will remember no
more.</hi> Saith God, upon the account of the Offering of Christ, there is an end of
that businesse, and that Controversy, which I have had with those <hi>Sanctifyed</hi>
ones: and therefore let them (as to this) as to the making satisfaction for
sinne, trouble themselves no more, to thinke of <hi>thousands of Rammes,</hi> or the
like;<note place="margin">Mic. 6. 6, 7.</note> for there is <hi>no more Offering for sinne</hi> required; And on this foundation. I
may say, there doth not remaine any such Guilt to be reckon'd unto Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
as, that with regard thereunto, God should forsake them utterly and give
them over unto everlasting ruine; And this is the summe of the Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59070:107"/>
in that Chapter, as it lookes upon the matter under present considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That Sacrifice, which so taketh away the Sinnes of them, for whom 'tis
offered, as that thereupon they should be perfect, or perfectly accquitted of
them, and have no more conscience (which is a judgement of a mans selfe,
answering to the judgment of God concerning him) of sinne, so to judge him
and condemne him for it, as not to have remedy of that Judgement or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
provided in that Sacrifice, that (I say) doth so take away the Guilt
of sinne, as that it shall never separate between God and them, for whom and
whose sinne it was offered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but such was the Sacrifice of Christ: <hi>Ergo;</hi> The
Reason of the <hi>Consequence</hi> is cleare from the very forme of the proposition;
and nothing is assumed, but what is the expresse Testimony of the Apostle, in
that and other places?</p>
            <p>So <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 24.<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> The designe in the Death of Christ, <hi>is to finish the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
to make an end of Sinne, and to make reconciliation for iniquities, and to
bring in everlasting Righteousnesse;</hi> Christ makes an end of sinne: not that there
should be no more sinne in the world; for there is yet sinning to the purpose,
in some respect,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4, 5. 10. 28.</note> much more then before his death; and there will be so to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
if those under the ultimate sentence may be thought to sinne; but he
makes an <hi>end of it,</hi> as to the Controversy and difference about it, between
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> and them for whom he died; and that by making Reconciliation; On
the part of God, attoning him toward us, which Attonement we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to accept:<note place="margin">Isa. 27. 3, 4. 45. 24, 25.</note> and by bringing in for us, a <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> which is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
and will abide the triall, which God will certainly accept: Now when
God is satisfied for sinne, and we are furnished with a Righteousnesse exactly
compleat, and answering to the utmost of his demand, whence can any more
contest arise about the guilt of sinne, or the obligation of the sinner unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
that from the Justice and Law of God doth attend it? This also the
Apostle urgeth <hi>Rom. 8. 34. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died.</hi> He
argueth from the death of Christ to the ablation,<note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for sinne; because by his death he hath made an end of sinne, as was
shewed, and brought in everlasting Righteousnesse. To suspend the issue of
all these transactions between God, and the Mediator, upon conditions by
us to be accomplished, not bestowed on us, purchased for us, and as
to their event uncertaine, is disadvantagiously to begge the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>Now because it appears,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> that, notwithstanding the death of Christ, many
for whom he died,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 11, 12</note> are kept a long season under the guilt of sinne, and are all
of them borne in a condition of wrath, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3.) I shall crave leave a little
to insist on this instance, and to shew, that notwithstanding the Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet the guilt of sinne is so taken away, from all those for whom Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by his death, that it shall never be a cause of everlasting separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and them.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20.</note> In the Obedience and Death of Christ, whereby as a
compleatly sufficient and efficacious meanes, he made way for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of his eternall purposes, in such paths of infinite wisdome, as
brought in all the good he aymed by it, in that order, which the very frame
and nature of things by him appointed, required the exaltation of his Glory,
God is satisfied, well pleased, and resolved that he will not take his course at
Law against those, in the behalfe of whom he died. Though an <hi>Arrest</hi> was
gone forth against all mankind, yet the Lord suspended by his Soveraignty
the utmost Execution of it, that roome and space might be given, according
to the Eternall thoughts of his heart, for the deliverance of some. A reprieve
is granted mankinde out of Reasons, and for Purposes of his owne: After
the sentence of Death was denounced against them, God being pleased to

Christ,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 6, 11.</note>

render unto that sinne,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 6.</note> or sinner, guilty thereof, a meet <hi>Recompence of Reward:</hi>
Jesus Christ hath so answered his Righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Vid. Diat. de Just. Div.</note> that without the impairing
of his <hi>Right, or Soveraignty,</hi> without the least derogation from his Perfections,
he may receive his sinning Creatures againe to favour; It being the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>He loved his Church, and gave himselfe for it, that he might Sanctify, and
Cleanse it with the washing of water, that he might present it to himselfe a Glorious

and without blame Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. He makes compleate Attonement to the
Justice of God on their behalfe, so that the very <hi>vindictive Justice</hi> of God hath
nothing to lay to their charge. That which in God maintaines the
Quarrell against sinners Is attoned, and is no more their Enemy than
Mercy it selfe: And this not upon condition of Believing to be antecedently
accomplished before this be done. The Satisfaction of Justice vindictive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
not at all on any thing in us; it requires only that there be <hi>vindicta
noxae,</hi> and a vindication of the Soveraignty of God, over the sinning Creature,
by the inflictioon of that punishmient, which in his Infininite Wisdome and
Righteousnesse, he hath proportioned unto sinne; on a supposition of sinne
in such Creatures, as being made meet and fit to yeild voluntary Obedience
unto God, and so standing in a morall subjection to him, being their cutting
off, what lyes in them, their dependance on God; (which that it should be
contlnued, is as necessary as that God be God, or the Lord of all) Those
Creatutes are upon the account of the Soveraignty &amp; Righteousnesse of God,
whereof we speake, indipensably obnoxious unto punishment, which is of
necessity required unto Gods retaining his Dominion over them. By the
Death of Christ, this Condition is so farre repaired, that the dependance and
subjection unto God, of those, for whom he Dyed, is made up, so farre as to a
deliverance of them, from a necessity of being obnoxious unto punishment,
and that compleately, without any Abeyance upon conditions in themselves,
which can have no influence thereunto. So that though the proces of the Law,
sent forth,<note place="margin">John 3. 36.</note> be not instantly recalled, but man is suffered to lye under that arrest
for a season,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note> yet God lets fall his suit on this account,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 18.</note> and will never passe his
first sentence,<note place="margin">Psal. 21. 3, 4.</note> from which we are reprieved, unto full and finall execution:
pronouncing himselfe,<note place="margin">Math. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>well pleased with his Sonne,</hi> resting satifyed with his
mediatory performances, and seeking no farther.</p>

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59070:108"/>
2. The <hi>Law</hi> of God is fulfilled. Unlesse this be answered in all concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, the Lord would be thought to change his Will, to reverse his
Word, and to blurre the Coppy of his owne Holinesse. There is in the whole
Law, and every parcell of it an eternall indispensable Righteousnesse and
Truth: arising either from the nature of things themselves, concerning which
it is, or the Relation of one thing unto another. That to feare God, to Love
him, to Obey him, to doe no wrong, are everlastingly indispensablely good &amp;
necessary, is from the nature of the things themselves: only with this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that God would make Creatures capable of yeilding him such Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
That that which is good, shall be so rewarded, that which is evill so
punished, is also an everlasting truth upon supposition of such actuall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
Whereas then of this Law there are two parts, the one <hi>Absolute</hi> or
Preceptive, in the Rule and commands thereof, The other <hi>Conditionall,</hi> and
rewarding in its Promise, or condemning in its curse, Christ by his death
put himselfe, in their behalfe, for whom he Dyed, (to speake to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar)
under the curse of it.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Gal. 3. 13. He Redeemed us from the curse of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kom. 10. 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>being made a curse for us;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6.</note> neither is this at all <hi>suspended</hi> on our Believing; The
Law doth not threaten a Curse,<note place="margin">Philipp. 3. 9.</note> only if we do not Believe, but if we <hi>do not
all things written therein;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 27. 26.</note> whether we believe or not, the Law takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
as to the Curse that it denounceth; If there hath been any sinne, <hi>that</hi>
must be executed.<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 28.</note> And the Law is for the Curse, as <hi>Isaac</hi> for the the great
Spirituall Blessing; He had but one; it hath but one great Curse, and that
being underrgone by Christ, it hath not an other for them, in whose stead
Christ underwent it;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> God having <hi>made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, we
become the Righteousnesse of God in him;</hi> All separation from God is by the
Curse of the Law; All that is required in it, by it, is, that it be undergone:
this is done by Christ for all Believers: that thereby is taken away, which
alone can separate them from God, or put any distance between them: But
of this, and their subjection to the Curse before their Believing, more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> or veracity of God was particularly ingaged to see sin punished,
upon the account of the Promulgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the first expres Sanction of the Law;
<hi>In the day thou eatest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>thou shalt dye;</hi> For the satisfying the ingagement of <hi>God's
Truth,</hi> there seem'd to be a tender made in the Sacrifices instituted of old:
but it was rejected, as insufficient to make good that Word of God, so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
given out; There was neither any such Relation, Union, or Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the sinner and the innocent Creature Sacrificed, or any such reall
worth in the Sacrifice it selfe, as that the Death of the substituted beast, might
by any meanes be so interpreted, as to amount to the accomplishment of the
Truth of God: Death being once denounced, as the reward of sinne. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
5, 6. <hi>Sacrifices and Offerings for sinne thou wouldest not, in burnt-Offerings and
Sacrifices for sinne thou hadst no pleasure;</hi> but saith our Saviour <hi>Lo I come to do
thy will, O God, v.</hi> 7. Will that do it? Yea, it will assuredly, for <hi>in the volume
of his Booke it is written, that he should so do;</hi> All that God willed to be done
for the accomplishment of his <hi>Truth,</hi> was fulfilled by Christ, when he came to
give up himselfe a <hi>sweet smelling Sacrifice, Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. God then may be
true, His Truth being salved to the utmost, though never any one of them,
for whom Christ Dyed, doe dye: But this to the Salvation of Believers, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as <hi>removens prohibens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>distributive Justice</hi> of God is,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 10, 11.</note> upon this Oblation of Christ ingaged
upon the Covenant and compact made with Christ as Mediator, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to bestow on them, for whom he Offered and Dyed, all the good things
which he promised him for them, in and upon the account of his undertaking
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59070:109"/>
in their behalfe: The distributive Justice of God, is that perfection of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 24.</note> whereby he rendreth to every one, according to what, either his <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Justice</hi> on the one side,<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 31, 35. 65. 5. 71. 2. 96. 13. 98. 2. 103. 17. 141. 1. 11</note> or his Uprightnesse, and Faithfulnesse, on the
other, do require. In rewarding, it respects his owne Faithfulnesse in all his
ingagements immediately, in punishing, the demerit of the Creature: there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no such naturall connexion and necessary coherence, from the nature of
the things themselves, between Obedience and Reward, as there is between
Sinne and Punishment.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord having given many eminent and Glorious Promises to his
Sonne Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 7, 8. 110. 3. 7. 45. 13, 14</note> (some wherof we shall mention afterwards) concerning
his Seed,<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 5, 6, 8. 52. 13, 14. 53. 11. 59. 20.</note> and Ofspring, or those that he committed to his charge, to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from their sinnes, it is incumbent on him, in regard of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to make out all those things in due time unto them. And therefore that
he might magnify that Righteousnesse &amp; Truth of his,<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 51, 52.</note> he hath cast the whole
procedure of his Grace, into such a way, and all the Acts of it, into such a
dependance upon one another, as that the one of them, should have infallible
influence into the other, and the effects of every one of them be rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably
certaine.</p>
            <p>Thus upon the Account of the Death of Christ, antecedently to all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Faith,<note place="margin">Isa 53. 6,</note> or Beliefe, in them for whom he Dyed, thus much is done,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> for
the extinguishing the quarrell about sinne:<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> The <hi>vindictive Justice, Law,</hi> and
<hi>Truth</hi> of God are disingaged from pursuing the Sentence of Death and
Everlasting Separation from God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34.</note> against them as sinners; Neither have they
at all any thing to lay to their charge, for which they should be cast out of the
presence of God:<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 11, 12.</note> Yea the Lord is moreover, in his owne Faithfulnesse &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> with respect to the Covenant of the Mediator, ingaged to doe that
which is needfull,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> to the bringing of them to himselfe; After some previous
Observations,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 3.</note> I shall confirme what hath been spoken, by sundry Arguments.
I say then,</p>
            <p>First, that it is a most vaine supposall, which some make: What if any one
of them, for whom Christ Dyed, should dye in an Unregenerate Condition?
Would not the Justice and condemning Power of the Law of God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Death of Christ, lay hold upon them? It is I say a supposall of
that, which <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> is impossible &amp; so in that sence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> however upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects it may) not to be argued from;<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16, 17. 7. 33.</note> Christ <hi>Dyed,</hi> that those for whom
he Dyed might <hi>Live;</hi> that they might be <hi>quickned and borne againe.</hi> And so
they shall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</note> in their due season, every one undoubtedly be, and not any of them
dye in their sinnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that our Affirmation, is not in the least lyable to that Exception
which usually men insist upon, in opposition unto it: <hi>viz.</hi> That if Christ hath
so satsfyed <hi>Justice,</hi> and fulfilled the <hi>Law,</hi> in reference to all them, for whom
he dyed, that the sentence of Condemnation should not be issued out
against them, but they must infallibly be Saved; then there is no necessity,
either that they doe at all <hi>Believe,</hi> or if they do, that they live in Holinesse,
and the avoidance of Sinne;<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 5, 6, 11, 12.</note> all that being accomplished, which by these <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi>
is sought for.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> I say our position in it selfe is no way lyable to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
For</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32, 33</note> though the <hi>Justice, Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God be satisfyed and fulfilled,
as to their sinnes,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14, 15.</note> that he hath not, as on that account, any thing to lay to their
charge,<note place="margin">Rom 1. 16, 17, 3. 23, 24, 25. 4. 16. 9. 31, 32.</note> yet this hinders not at all, but that God may assigne and ascribe such
a <hi>way for their coming to him,</hi> as may be suited to the <hi>exalting</hi> of his Glory,
the <hi>Honour</hi> of Jesus Christ, who hath brought all this about, and the <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
of the soule of the sinner for the full enjoyment of himselfe;<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 23.</note> &amp; this he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59070:109"/>
hath done by the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> which gives him the Glory of his
Grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> and all his other Attibutes, exalts Jesus Christ, whom it is his
will <hi>we should Honour, as we Honour himselfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 6.</note> &amp; emptyes the poore sinfull
Creature of it selfe,<note place="margin">Philip. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> that it may be made <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints
in Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly This consideration of the Death of Christ,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27.</note> of his freeing us from
condemnation for any,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> or all of our sinnes, is not to be taken apart, or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the other,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6.</note> of his procuring the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and Grace for us, that
we should not commit sinne,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 7.</note> being borne of God, with all the dispensations
of Precepts and Promises,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18, 19, 20.</note> Exhortations and Threatnings whereby he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
carryes on the worke of his Grace,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12, 13, 14.</note> in the hearts of his Saints; setting us
free from the <hi>guilt</hi> of sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp;c.</note> he so farre also sets us free from the <hi>Power of sinne,</hi>
that we should be dead to it, live no longer in it, that it should not <hi>raigne in
us,</hi> nor prevaile to turne us utterly from God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they seeme not much to be acquainted with the nature of <hi>Faith,
Holinesse, and Communion</hi> with God, who suppose the end of them, is only for
the escapeing of the Wrath that is to come;<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22.</note> they are the things,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15.</note> whereby we
are daily renewed,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1, 2.</note> and changed into the <hi>Image of the Glory of God,</hi> and so not
only made usefull,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> and serviceable to him here, but also prepared for the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his Likenesse, wherewith we shall be satisfyed hereafter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
observe</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that though this complete Attonement be made in the Death of
Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 5, 6.</note> yet it remaines free in the bosome of God, when he will begin our
<hi>Actuall Deliverance,</hi> from under that arrest of Death, that was gone out against
us,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 11.</note> and how farre in this Life he will carry it towards perfection; It is I say in
his bosome,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 8.</note> when he will bestow his Spirit on us, for Regeneration &amp; Faith;
when he will actually absolve us from under the arrest of the Law, by the
Application of his Mercies in Christ unto us, by the Promise of the Gospell; &amp;
how farre he will carry on the worke of our deliverance from sinne,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> in this
Life. Only that is done, upon the account whereof, it is impossible that the
quarrell against sinne, should be carryed on to the utmost Execution of the
sentence denounced towards those sinners, for whom Christ dyed; which I
prove by these following Arguments.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> it is plainely affirmed, that Christ by his Death obtained <hi>everlasting
redemption. Heb:</hi> 9. 12. he obtained everlasting Redemption, before his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into the most holy place,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> called elsewhere the <hi>purging of our sinnes.</hi> Now
this Redemption (as was said) the Apostle informes us to consist <hi>in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse
of sinnes, Ephes. 1. 7. in whom we have redemption through his bloud, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the forgivenesse of sinnes;</hi> or the Intercision of that Obligation unto punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which attends sinne, in reference to the sinner, and his subjection to the
Law of God, and the righteousnesse thereof. As the oblation of Christ respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
God and his justice, to whom it is given as a price and Ransome, and
whereof it is an Attonement, so it is, and is called (or we are said to receive
thereby) Redemption: As it respects them, who receive the benefit of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 5.</note> it is the forgivenesse of sinnes. Forgivenesse of sinnes, as tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
and terminated in the Consciences of Believers, requireth the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Faith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> for the receiving of Christ in the Promise, who <hi>of God is
made unto us Righteousnesse;</hi> but in respect of the procurement of it, and the
removing all causes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 4.</note> upon the account whereof, sinne should be imputed unto
us, that is perfected in the oblation of Christ; hence he is said to <hi>beare our sins
in his own body on the Crosse; 1 Pet:</hi> 2. 24. and being once on him, either he was
discharged of them, or he must for ever lye under the burthen of them: They
were <hi>on him</hi> on the Tree, what is then become of them? If he were freed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59070:110"/>
of them, and Justifyed from them (as he was, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 8, 9.) how should they
ever be laid to our charge? And yet this freedome from condemnation for sin,
for all the Elect, which God himselfe so clearly asserts <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. 33. &amp;c. doth
not in the least set them free from the necessity of Obedience, nor acquit them
from contracting the guilt of sin, upon the least irregularity or disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
we are said to doe, together with Christ, those things, which he
doth for us in his own person:<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 5, 8.</note> and that upon the account of that benefit,
which by those his personall performances,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15, 16.</note> doth redound unto us, and which
being done,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> the Quarrell about sinne, as to make an utter separation between
God and our souls,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 7.</note> is certainly removed; Thus we are said <hi>to dy</hi> with him, to
be <hi>raised again</hi> with him, and with him we enter into the holy place; this
whole businesse about sin being passed through: for he that is dead, is justifyed
from sin. Now all this being done by us, and for us, in, &amp; by our head, can we
hencesorth dy any more? shall death any more have dominion over us? This
the Apostle argues, 2 Cor. 5. 15. <hi>we judge</hi> (saith he) <hi>that if one dyed for all, then
were all they</hi> (that is, all those for whom he dyed) <hi>dead,</hi> or dyed likewise; they
were dead in, and with him, their <hi>sponsor,</hi> as to the curse due for sin, that
henceforth they might <hi>live to him that dyed for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Compact or agreement, that was between the Father and the
Sonne as Mediator, about the businesse of our Redemption in his blood, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests
this Truth.<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 8.</note> The Father required at his hands, that he should doe <hi>his
will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 10, 11.</note> fulfill his pleasure and counsell, make <hi>his soule an offering for sinne,</hi> and
do that which the Sacrifices of <hi>Bulls &amp; Goates</hi> shadowed out,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5, 9, 7.</note> but could never
effect: upon the performance whereof, he was to <hi>see his Seed,</hi> and to bring <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sonnes to Glory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2, 10.</note> (A covenanting and agreement into an uncertaine Issue
and event (as that must be of God and the Mediator, if the Salvation of the
persons, concerning which, and whom it was, be not infallibly certaine) ought
not at any cheap rate, or pretence to be assigned to infinite Wisdome.) In the
Accomplishment of this undertaking, whereunto Christ was designed,
the Father dealt with him in strict aud rigid Justfce:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> There was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
composition about the debt,<note place="margin">2 pet. 2. 4.</note> nor commutation about the punishment,
that he had taken upon himselfe:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> Now doth not exact Justice require, that
the Ransome being given in,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> the Prisoners be delivered? That the debt being
paid,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> the bond be cancelled, as to any power of imprisoning the Originall
debtor? That punishment being undergone, and the Law fulfilled, the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
goe free? Especially all this being covenanted for, in the first undertaking;
doubtlesse wrath shall not arise a second time. The right knowledge, use, and
improvement of this Grace, being given, bounded, &amp; directed by the Gospell,
it is safegarded from abuse, by that which God calls his owne Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> it appeares from what God bestowes upon his Elect, upon the
Account of the undertaking of Christ for them (in the pursuit of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
purpose of his Will) <hi>antecedently</hi> to any thing whatsoever in them, that
should ingage him to do them the least good; when God comes as a friend to
hold out unto, &amp; bestow good things upon men, (I meane) good in that kind
of Mercy, which is peculiarly suited to the bringing of them to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himselfe, it is evident that he hath put an end to all enmity and
quarrell between him &amp; them:<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 20. 21</note> Now antecedently unto any thing in men, God
for Christs sake bestowes,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note> with the greatest act of friendship imaginable,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> no
lesse than the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> on them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4.</note> By him they are quickned;<note place="margin">2 Cor 3. 5.</note> &amp; their Faith is
but a fruit of that Spirit bestowed on them;<note place="margin">John 15. 3, 5.</note> If they have not any sufficiency in
themselves, as much as to <hi>think a good thought,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 1, 2.</note> nor can doe any thing, that is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59070:110"/>
acceptable to God, being by nature dead in trespasses and sinnes, which at
present (the Scripture affirming it) I take for granted; then assuredly God
doth give his Holy Spirit to the Saints, whereby he workes in them <hi>both to
will and to do of his owne good pleasure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 13.</note> antecedently to any good thing in
them,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> that is well pleasing unto him. Every thing that men do, must either
be brought forth by the strength and Ability of their owne naturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
assisted and provoked by motives and perswasions from without, or it
must be of the operation of the Spirit of God: there is not another princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be fixt on. The first (at present I take for granted) is not the fountaine,
of any Spirituall acting whatsoever:<note place="margin">John Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Neither can any Gracious act be educed
<hi>radically</hi> from the corrupt naturall faculty,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 21.</note> however assisted, or advantaged;
It must be the <hi>Spirit</hi> then,<note place="margin">Job. 14. 4.</note> that is the sole principall cause and Author, of all
the movings of our soules towards God,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33.</note> that are acceptable to him in Christ:
Now the <hi>cause</hi> is certainely before the <hi>effect;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is bestowed upon us, antecedently to all the Grace which he worketh in
us: whether the Spirit be bestowed on men, on the account of Christ's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
for them, none can question, but they must withall deny him to be the
Mediator of the new Covenant: The Spirit of Grace is the principall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
thereof <hi>Isa. 59. 20, 21. We are blessed with all Spirituall Blessings in Christ,
Ephes.</hi> 1. 3. Surely the holy Spirit himselfe so often Promised to us of God, is
a Spirituall Blessing: God's bestowing Faith on us, is antecedent to our Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
&amp; this also is given upon the account of Christ. <hi>Phil. 1. 29. It is given to us,
on the behalfe of Christ, to Believe on him.</hi> If then God for Christs sake, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to any thing that is good, that is not enmity to him, that is not iniquity
in men, do bestow on them, all that ever is good in them, as to the root &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of it, surely his quarrell against their sins is put to an Issue. Thence Christ
being said to make <hi>Reconciliation for the sins of the people Heb.</hi> 2. 17. God as one
pacifyed and attoned thereupon, is said to be in him, <hi>reconciling the world unto
himselfe 2 Cor.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13, 24</note> 5. 19. And in the dispensation of the Gospell, he is still set
forth, as one carrying on that peace, whose foundation is laid in the blood of
his Sonne, by the Attonement of his Justice; and we are said to accept, or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Attonement Rom.</hi> 5. 10. We receive it by Faith, it being accepted by
him: Thus his death and Oblation is said to be a <hi>Sacrifice of a sweet smelling
savour. Eph.</hi> 5. 2. that wherein God is abundantly delighted, &amp; wherewith his
soule is fully satisfyed; so that as when he smelt a sweet savour from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of <hi>Noah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 21.</note> he sware he would curse the Earth no more: smelling this sweet
savour of the Oblation of Christ, on the account of them, for whom it was
Offered,<note place="margin">John 17. 19.</note> he will not execute the Curse on them, whereof they were guilty.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note>
I might also insist on those Testimonies for the further proofe of the former
Assertion,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> where an immediate efficacy for the taking away of sinne,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the death of Christ:<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25. 26</note> But what hath, been spoken may at present suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.<note place="margin">Titus 2. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Premises considered,<note place="margin">§<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> some Light may be brought forth, to discover
the various mistakes of men,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> about the effects of the Death of Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> as to the
taking away of sinne,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> if that were now the matter before us. Some having
truly fixed their thoughts on the efficacy of the death of Christ,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 7.</note> for Abolition
of sin,<note place="margin">Revel. 1. 5, 6,</note> doe give their, Lusts and darknesse leave to make wretched inferences
thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as that therefore because we are so compleatly justified, &amp; accepted
before, &amp; without our believing, or the consideration of any thing what ever in
us; that therefore sinne is <hi>nothing,</hi> nor at all to be accounted of. And though
they say, we must not sinne, that Grace may abound, yet too many by wofull
experience have discovered, what such corrupt Conclusions have tended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Others againe, fixing themselves on the necessity of Obedience, and the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59070:111"/>
concurrence of actuall Faith, to the compleating of justification in the soule of
the sinner, with a no lesse dangerous reflection upon the Truth, do suspend the
efficacy of the death of Christ upon our believing, which gives life, &amp; vigour, &amp;
virtue unto it, (as they say) &amp; is the sole originally discriminating cause, of all
the benefits we receive thereby; without the antecedent accomplishment of
that condition in us, or our Actuall believing, it is not (say they) nor will be
usefull: yea that the intention of God is, to bestow upon us the fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the death of Christ, upon condition we do Believe, which that we
shall, is no part of his purchase, and which we can of our selves performe, say
some of them, others not. Doubtlesse these things are not (being rightly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
in the least inconsistent; Christ may have his due, and we bound to the
performance of our duty; which might be cleared by an enlargement of the
ensuing Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. First, That all good things, that are spirituall whatsoever, that are
wrought either for men, or in them, are fruits of the death of Christ. They
have nothing of themselves, <hi>but nakednesse, bloud, and sinne,</hi> guilt and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
so that it is of indispensable necessity, that God should shew them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
antecedently to any Act of their Believing on him. Faith is given for
Christs sake, as was observed.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, That all the Effects and Fruits of the death of Christ, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to our Believing, are deposited in the hand of the Righteousnesse, and
Faithfulnesse of God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.</note> to whom, as a <hi>ransome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 17.</note> it was <hi>paid,</hi> as an <hi>Attonement,</hi> it
was <hi>offered,</hi> before whom, as a <hi>price</hi> and <hi>purchase,</hi> it was <hi>laid downe.</hi> It is all
left in the hands of Gods Faithfulnesse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.</note> Righteousnesse, Mercy, and Grace, to
be made out effectually to them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.</note> for whom he died, in the appointed time or
season. So that,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, The state or condition of those, for whom Christ died, is not
actually and really changed by his death,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> in its selfe; but they lye under the
curse, whilest they are in the state of nature, unregenerate, and all effects of
sinne whatever:<note place="margin">John 3. 36.</note> That which is procured for them, is left in the hand of the
Father; They are not in the least intrusted with it, untill the Appointed time
do come.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, That Faith and Beliefe are necessary, not to adde any thing
to compleat the procurement of forgivenesse of sins, any or all; but only to
the Actuall receiving of it, when upon the account of the death of Christ, it
pleaseth God, in the Promise of the Gospell, to hold it out, and impart it unto
the soule, thereby compleating Covenant-justification. And thus the whole
businesse of Salvation, may be resolved into the mediation of Christ, and yet
men carried on, under an orderly dispensation of Law and Gospell, into the
enjoyment of it.<note place="margin">Acts 13. 38, 39.</note> Of the whole, these degrees are considerable.</p>
            <p>1 Gods eternall purpose of saving some,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> in, and by the mediation of
Christ,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16</note> that mediation of Christ being interposed between the purpose of
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 7, 8.</note> and the accomplishment of the thing purposed,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 10.</note> as the fruit and effect of
the one,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 17. 9. 14.</note> the meritorious procuring cause of the other. This Act of the Will
of God,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5. 6, 7, 8, 9. &amp;c.</note> the Scripture knowes by no other name then that of Election, or
Predestination, or the Purpose of God according to Election, or the Purpose
of his Will in Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11.</note> which though it comprize his Will of not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their own persons,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> that are within the verge of this his Purpose,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note>
yet it is not properly an Act of forgivenesse of sinns,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6, 8.</note> nor are they pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by it,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23.</note> nor is the Law actually innovated,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5 21.</note> or its obligation on them unto
punishment dissolved,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23, 24, 25.</note> nor themselves justified in any sence thereby.</p>
            <p>2. That interposition of the Lord Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 30.</note> whereof we have been treating,
being a <hi>medium</hi> indispensably necessary as to satisfaction,<note place="margin">Math. 17. 5.</note> and freely designed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59070:111"/>
by the will and Wisdome of God, for such a procurement of the good things
designed in his Eternall Counsell, as might advance the Glory of his Grace,
and make knowne his Righteousnesse also: And this being fixed on by God,
as the only thing by him required, that all the Mercies, all the Grace of his
eternall Purpose, might be dispensed in the order by him designed unto
them;<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 9, 10.</note> upon the performance of it, God resteth, as well pleased, and they for
whom he hath mediated by his Blood,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18, 19, 21.</note> or for whom he is considered so to
have done,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> are reconciled unto God, as to that part of Reconciliation,
which respects the Love of God, as to the dispencing the fruits of it,
unto them, even whilest they are enemies, upon the accounts before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>3. Things being thus stated between God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> and them,<note place="margin">Rom 8. 11.</note> for whom Christ
dyed, on the account of his death God actually absolves them from under
that sentence and Curse of the Law, by sending the Spirit of his Sonne into
their hearts, to quicken them and to implant Faith in them. Aud in what Act
of God to place his actuall absolution of sinners, ungodly persons, whom
Christ dyed for, but in this actuall collation of the Spirit, and habit of Grace
on them, I am not as yet satisfyed: neither doth this in any measure confound
our Justification, and Sanctification: For nothing hinders, but that the same Act
as it is of free Grace, in opposition to workes, or any thing in us, may justify
us, or exert the fruit of his Love, which was before purchased by Christ, in
our Gracious Acceptation, notwithstanding all that was against us: and also
by principling us with Grace for Obedience, Sanctify us throughout.</p>
            <p>4. This being done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they, with whom God thus Graciously deales, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Attonement, and being Justifyed by Faith, have peace with
God.</p>
            <p>But this is not the matter, or subject of our present Contest. This then is
the first influence, which the Bloodshedding in the death &amp; Oblation of Christ,
hath into the Saints continuance of the Love and Favour of God; It taketh
away the guilt of sinne, that it shall not be such a provocation to the eyes of his
Glory, (his Law being fulfilled, and Justice satisfyed) as to cause him utterly
to turne away his Love from them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> And they becoming the Righteousnesse
of God in him, to all intents and purposes, what should separate them from
the Love of God?<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14, 15</note> He hath made peace in the Blood of the Crosse of his
Sonne,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32, 33.</note> and will not ingage in enmity against his Elect any more to Eternity:
But in his owne way and own time (as he hath the Soveraignty of all in his
hands) he will bring them infallibly to the enjoyment of himselfe. And
thus much by this discourse about the effects of the Death of Christ, have we
clearely obtained; what Christ aymes to accomplish by his Death, and what
was the designe and intention of the Father, that he should accomplish,
that cannot faile of its issue and appointed event, by any interposure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
That the effectuall removall of every thing, that might intercept, hinder,
or turne aside the Love and Favour of God from them, for whom he dyed, is
the designed effect of the death of Christ, hath been demonstrated. This then,
in the order, wherein it hath seemed good, to the infinite Wisdome of God to
proceed in dispencing his Grace unto sinners, shall certainely be fulfilled, and
all Believers saved to the utmost.</p>
            <p>I come,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> in the second place, to demonstrate, that as our. Saviour secures the
stability of the Love of the Saints to God, and their abiding with him, by
taking away and removing, what ever might hinder them therein, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
upon them utterly and wickedly to depart from him; That which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously
might cause God to turne from us, he utterly destroies and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes,
and that, which efficiently might cause us to turne from God, that also
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59070:112"/>
he destroyes and and removes. Now all, that is of this kind, that workes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
and powerfully for the alienating of the hearts of Believers from
God, or keeping men in a state of alienation from him, may be referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two principles.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> 1. <hi>Sathan</hi> himselfe. 2. His Workes; The world,
as under the Curse, is an instrument in his hand, who is called the God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to allure,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> vex, and mischiefe us withall; neither hath it the least power
or efficacy in it selfe,<note place="margin">Math. 4. 9.</note> but only as 'tis managed in the hand of <hi>Sathan</hi> to
turne men from God. And yet the Lord Christ hath not let that goe free,
neither without its deaths wound,<note place="margin">John 16. 32.</note> but bids his followers be of good <hi>comfort,
for he had overcome the World;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 4.</note> that is,<note place="margin">1 John 5. 4, 5.</note> for them, and in their stead; so that it
should never be used nor heightned in its enmity to a conquest over them; I
meane a totall and finall Conquest, such as might frustrate any intention of
God in his undertaking for them: It is not our losse of a little bloud, but our
losse of Life, that makes the enemy a Conqueror. But now for Satan.</p>
            <p>1. First he overcomes,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> destroyes, and breakes him in pieces, with his
power: <hi>Heb: 2. 14. by death he destroyed him, that had the power of death, that is,
the Divell.</hi> The first thing that was promised of him, was, That he should
<hi>breake the head of the Serpent: Gen.</hi> 3. 15. He doth it also in, and for the <hi>seed
of the Woman,</hi> all the Elect of God, opposed to the seed of the Serpent, or
Generation of Vipers. In pursuit hereof, he <hi>spoyles Principalities and Powers,
and makes a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in his Crosse, Col.</hi> 2. 15. In
the bloud of his Crosse he conquered, and brake the power of the Divell, <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that strong man Armed, and spoyling his goods,</hi> making a shew of him, and
them, as great Conquerors were wont to doe with their Captives and their
spoyles.</p>
            <p>Now there are two waies, whereby the bloud of Christ thus brake the
power of Satan, that he shall not lead those alwaies captive at his pleasure,
nor rule in them, as Children of disobedience, in the behalfe of whom his
power was so broken.</p>
            <p>1. First, He subdues him by taking away all that Right and Title, which
he had by sinne, to rule over them: I speake of the Elect of God. By the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of sinne, the Divell entred upon a two fold rule in reference to sinners;
First, A Rule over them with the terrour and dread of death and Hell; they
are in bondage by reason of death,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> all their daies, <hi>Heb:</hi> 2. 15. And the Divell
hath the power of that death upon the World, whereunto they are in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
The death, that is in the Curse, is put into his hand to manage it, to
the dread and terrour of sinners; and by it he hath alwaies kept many, and to
this day doth keep innumerable soules in unexpressable bondage: putting
them upon Barbarous Inhumanities, to make Attonement for their sinnes:
and forcing some to inflict revenge and destruction upon themselves, thinking
to prevent, but really hastening that which they feare. As of old, this power
of his lay at the bottome of all the Abominations,<note place="margin">Diat. de Just. Divin.</note> wherewith men provoked
God, when they thought to Attone him, as by burning their Children in the
fire, and the like. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 7, 8. So at present is it the principle of all that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Will-worship,<note place="margin">Levit. 18. 21.</note> and Religious drudgery, which is spread over the
Antichristian World:<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 10. 2</note> yea the inventions of men,<note place="margin">Kings 21. 6. 23. 10.</note> ignorant of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, and convinced of their own insufficiency to performe, worke
out,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 33. 6.</note> and establish a Righteousnesse of their owne,<note place="margin">Jer. 32. 35.</note> that shall perfectly answer
the exact holy demands of the Law, as far as to them is discovered, to deliver
themselves from under this dread of Death, wherewith he, that hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it, terrifies them all their daies, are indeed the foundation, and spring,
the summe and substance of all Religions in the World, and the darling of all
Religious Persons, in, and with whom, Christ is not all and in all. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59070:112"/>
have the Papists gon one notable step beyond all their predecessours in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and devotion: for whereas they universally contented themselves,
with sacrifices, purifications, purgations, lustrations, satisfactions, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be in this life performed, these latter, more refined, sublimated mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall
wits, observing that nothing, they could here invent, would settle and
charme the spirits of men haunted with the dread of death we speake of, but
that instantly they came againe with the same disquietnesse as formerly, &amp;
renewed mention of sinne, upon the insufficiency of the Attonement fixed on
for its expiation, they found out that noble expedient of the future Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which might maintaine the soules of men in some hopes in this life, and
secure themselves from the cryes &amp; complaints of men, against the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of their Remedy, which they doe prescribe.</p>
            <p>2. As he rules <hi>over</hi> men by death, and hell that followes after, so also he
rules <hi>in men</hi> by sinne, he <hi>ruleth in the children of disobedience. Eph.</hi> 2. 2. And
to this end, to secure men to himselfe, he being that <hi>strong man armed,</hi> who
hath the first possession,<note place="margin">Math. 12. 39.</note> and labours to keepe what he hath got,<note place="margin">Mark. 3. 27.</note> in peace, he
sets up <hi>strong holds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Imaginations, and highthings,</hi> against God. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.
Now this twofold power of Sathan, <hi>over men</hi> and <hi>in men,</hi> do both arise from
sinne: whereby men are first, cast out of Gods Love and care, becoming ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to death. And secondly are alienated from God, in willing subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Enemy: And both these parts and branches of his dominion,
are, in reference unto the Elect, cast downe and destroyed and taken away.
For</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> Christ by his Death Casheires the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Claime,</hi> that Sathan lay'd
to the exercise of any such power in reference unto the Elect. When men cast
downe any from Rule, they may interrupt, and put by their exercise of any
power, but they cannot take away their Title, unlesse it be of their owne
giving; Christ by his Death, takes away the very bottome, foundation, and
occasion of the whole power of Sathan.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 3.</note> All the power of Sathan in the first
sence,<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 29.</note> consists in death,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> and those things that either conduce to it; or do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
it.<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> Now death entred by sinne, and there withall the power of Sathan.
The Lord Jesus taking away sinne, and puting an end thereunto, as was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
the whole Title of Sathan falls and comes to nothing. And this was
really done in the Crosse:<note place="margin">Col. 2. 15.</note> its manifestation by the Gospell ensuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
according to the appointment of God.<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly he takes away the exercise of his power,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> and that to the utmost.
For</p>
            <p>1. He <hi>bindes</hi> him with bonds, <hi>He binds</hi> the <hi>strong man Armed Math.</hi> 12. 19.
And he <hi>breaks his head. Gen.</hi> 3: 15. Then <hi>leades him captive. Psal. 68. 18. Triumphs
over him. Col. 1. 16. Treads him downe under the feet of his. Rom.</hi> 16. 20. as the
Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> were trod downe under the feet of the Children of Israel;<note place="margin">John 10. 24.</note> then
<hi>destroyes</hi> him <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. What exercise of power is left, to a conquered bound,
wounded, captived, triumphed over, trodden downe, destroyed Caytife?
Think yee this wretch shall ever wholy prevaile against any one of them, for
whose sake, all this was done to him? Neither can this with any colour of
reason be said to be done for them, or with respect unto them, towards
whom the power of Sathan remaines entire all their dayes, whom he leades
captive and rules over at his pleasure, untill death take full dominion over
them.</p>
            <p>2. As he destroyes Sathan, so he doth his workes; <hi>For this cause was he
manifested, even to destroy the workes of the Divell. 1 John</hi> 3. 8. He doth not
only binde the strong man armed,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 21.</note> but also he spoiles his Goods. Whatsoever
is in men, that followes from that corrupted principle of nature, is reckoned
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59070:113"/>
to the worke of Sathan, being the issue of his seduction. Whatsoever his
temptations draw men out unto, the Lord Christ came to destroy it all, to
make an end of it: and he will not faile of his end, but certainely carry on his
undertaking, untill he hath utterly destroyed all those workes of Sathan, in
the hearts of all that are his. <hi>He redeemes us from our vaine Conversation.</hi>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. from the power of our lusts and corruptions, leading us out to
a vaine Conversation. The Apostle tells us (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6.) that by his death <hi>the old
man is crucified, and the body of sinne destroyed.</hi> The craft of sinne, the <hi>old man,</hi>
and the strength of sinne, the <hi>body of it,</hi> or the ruling of Originall sinne, the
<hi>old man,</hi> and the full fruit of actuall sinne, in the <hi>body</hi> of it, is by the death
of Christ, crucified and destroyed; and in that whole Chapter, from our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
in the death of Christ, he argues to such an abolition of the Law,
and Rule of sinne, to such a breaking of the power and strength of it, that it
is impossible, that it should any more rule in us, or have dominion over us.
Of the way, whereby virtue flowes out from the death of Christ, for the kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of sinne, I am not now to speake.</p>
            <p>And this is the first way, whereby the death of Christ hath an influence into
the safegarding of Believers, in their continuance of the Love and Favour of
God. He so takes away the guilt of sinne, that it shall never be able utterly
to turne the Love of God from them, and so takes away the rule of Sathan,
and power of sinne, destroying the one, and killing the other, that they shall
never be able to turne them wholly from God.</p>
            <p>Farther,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> to secure their continuance with God, he procureth the Holy
Spirit for them, as was shewed before. But because much weight lyes upon this
part of our foundation, I shall a little farther cleare it up. That the Spirit of
Grace and Adoption, with all those Spirituall Mercyes, and operations,
wherewith he is attended and accompanied, is a Promise of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
doubtlesse is by its own evidence put out of question. There is scarce any
Promise thereof, wherein he is not either clearly expressed, or evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
Yea and often times, the whole Covenant is stated in that one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Spirit, the actuall collation and bestowing of all the Mercy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being his proper worke, and peculiar dispensation, for the carrying on the
great designe of the Salvation of sinners. So <hi>Isa. 59. 20. As for me</hi> (saith God)
<hi>this is my Covenant with them; my Spirit that is upon thee, and my word which
I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart from thee.</hi> This is my Covenant (saith
God) or what in my Covenant I do faithfully ingage to bestow upon you.
But of this Text and its vindication more afterwardes. Many other places
not only pregnant of proofe to the same purpose, but expressly in termes
affirming it, might be insisted on.</p>
            <p>Now that this Spirit,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> promised in the Covenant of Grace as to the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him on the elect of God, or those for whom Christ dyed, is of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing
and procurement in his Death, is apparent,</p>
            <p>1. Because he is the Mediator of the Covenant, by whose hands, and
for whose sake, all the Mercyes of it are made out to them, who are admitted
into the bond thereof.<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> Though men are not compleatly <hi>stated</hi> in the Covenant
before their owne Believing,<note place="margin">Ierem. 31. 32. 32. 38, 39, 40</note> which brings in what of their part is stipulated,
yet the Covenant and Grace of it layes hold of them before, even to bestow
Faith on them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 19. 36. 25, 26.</note> or they would never Believe: for Faith is <hi>not of our selves, it is
the Guift of God.</hi> God certainely bestowes no such Guifts, but from a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
Spirituall Graces are not administred soly in a providentiall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 9, 10, 11.</note>
Faith for the receiving the pardon of sinne, is no guift, nor product of
the Covenant of workes. Now, as in generall the Mercies of the Covenant
are procured by the Mediator of it, so this, whereof we speake, in an especiall
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59070:113"/>
manner <hi>Heb. 9. 15. For this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament, that
by meanes of death, they which are called might receive the Promise of Eternall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi>
By his death, they for whom he dyed, and who thereupon are
called,<note place="margin">Deut: 27, 29.</note> being delivered from their sinnes, which were against the Covenant of
workes,<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 12.</note> receive the Promise,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 21.</note> or pledge of an Eternall Inheritance. What
this great Promise here intended is, and wherein it doth consist, the Holy
Ghost declares, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. The Promise, which Jesus Christ received of the
Father upon his exaltation, was that of the Holy Ghost, having purchased
and procured the bestowing of him by his Death: upon his Exaltation, the
dispensation thereof, is committed to him, as being part of the Compacte and
Covenant, which was between his Father and himselfe, The grand bottome
of his satisfaction &amp; merit. This is the great Originall radicall Promise of that
Eternall Inheritance. By the <hi>Promised</hi> Spirit are wee begotten a new, into a
hope thereof,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note> made meet for it,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> and sealed up unto it;<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 30.</note> Yea do but looke
upon the Spirit as promised, and yee may conclude him purchased: <hi>for all the
Promises of God are yea and a men in Jesus Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. They all have
their Confirmation, Establishment and Accomplishment in, by, and for Jesus
Christ. And if it be granted that any designed appointed Mercy whatever that
in Christ, the Lord blesseth us withall, be procured for us by him, in the way
of merit, (being given freely to us, through him, but reckoned to him of debt)
it will easily be manifested, that the same is the condition of every Mercy
whatever promised unto us, and given us, upon his <hi>Mediatory</hi> interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>2. It appears from that peculiar promise,<note place="margin">§: 21.</note> that Christ makes of sending his
Holy Spirit unto his owne; He tels them indeed, once, and againe, that the
Father will send him:<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 16, 26.</note> As he comes from that originall and Fountaine Love,
from which also himselfe was sent. But withall, he assures us, that he himselfe
will send him. <hi>Ioh. 15. 26. When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto
you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth.</hi> It is true! that he is promised
here only as a <hi>Comforter,</hi> for the performance of that part of his Office. But
look upon what account he is sent for any one Act,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 7.</note> or Worke of Grace, on
that he is sent for all. I will send him, then saith Christ: and that as a fruit of
his death, as the procurement of his Mediation; for that alone he promiseth
to bestow on his. And in particular he tells us, that he receives the spirit from
the Father for us upon his Intercession, wherein, as hath been elsewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
he askes no more nor lesse,<note place="margin">Salus Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sanguis Iesu.</note> then what by his death is obtained.
<hi>Iohn 14. 16, 17. I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
that he may abide with you for ever, even the spirit of Truth, whom the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive;</hi> he tells us <hi>v.</hi> 13. that whatsoever we aske, he will doe it: But
withall, in these verses, how he will doe it: even by interceding with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for it, as a fruit of his Bloodshedding, and the Promise made to him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his undertaking to <hi>Glorify his Fathers name,</hi> in the great worke of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore he informes us,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 4. 6.</note> that when the <hi>Comforter,</hi> whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth
for us, shall come, he shall Glorify him, and shall <hi>receive of his,</hi> and
<hi>shew it unto us, (Ioh.</hi> 16. 14.) farther manifest his Glory, in his bringing nothing
with him, but what is <hi>his,</hi> or of his procurement; so also instructing us clearly
and plentifully, to <hi>aske in his name,</hi> that is, for his sake, which to doe plainly
and openly, is the great priviledge of the New Testament; (for so he tells his
Disciples <hi>Ioh. 16. 24. hitherto have you asked nothing in my name,</hi> who yet
were Believers, and had made many addresses unto God in and through him;
but darkely, as they did under the Old Testament, when they begged mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<hi>for his sake Dan.</hi> 9. 17. But to plead with the Father, clearly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Mediation and Purchase of Christ) That (I say) is the priviledge
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59070:114"/>
of the New Testament. Now in this way he would have us aske the Holy
Spirit at the hand of God. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 9, 13. Aske him, that is, as to a clearer, full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Administration of him unto us: for he is antecedently bestowed, as to the
working of Faith, and Regeneration, even unto this Application, for without
him we cannot once aske in the name of Christ; for none can call Jesus Lord,
or doe any thing in his nane,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> but by the spirit of God: This I say then; He, in
whom we are blessed with all spirituall blessings,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> hath procured the Holy
Spirit for us, and through his Intercession he is bestowed on us. Now where
the Spirit of God is,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 17.</note> there is liberty from sinne, peace and acceptance with
God. But it may be objected, although this Spirit be thus bestowed on Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
yet may they not cast him off,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> so that his abode with them may be but
for a season, and their Glory not be safegarded in the Issue, but their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
increased by their receiving of him? This being the only thing,
wherein this proofe of Believers abiding with God, seemes lyable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
I shall give a triple Testimony of the certainty of the continuance
of the Holy Spirit with them, on whom he is bestowed, that in the mouth of
two or three witnesses this Truth may be established: and they are no meane
ones neither, but the <hi>three that beare witnesse in Heaven, the Father, the Sonne,
and the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first you have <hi>Isa.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> 59. 21. <hi>But as for me, this is my Covenant with them
saith the Lord, my Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in
thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed, nor
out of the mouth of thy Seeds Seed, saith the Lord hence forth and for ever.</hi> That
which the Lord declares here to the Church, he calls his Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Now whereas
in a Covenant there are two things, 1. What is stipulated, on the part of him
that makes the Covenant. 2. What of them is required, with whom it is made,
(which in themselves, are distinct, though in the Covenant of Grace, God
hath promised, that he will worke in us, what he requires of us) that here
mentioned is clearely an Evidence of somewhat of the first kinde, of that
Goodnesse, that God in the Covenant, doth promise to bestow; Though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
words of the <hi>future tense</hi> may sometimes have an <hi>Imperative</hi> Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
where the import of the residue of the words inforces such a sence, yet
because it may be so, in some place, therefore it is so in this place, and that
therefore these words are not a Promise, that the Spirit shall not depart, but
an injunction to take care, that it do not depart (as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will have it)
is a weake inference. And the close of the words will by no meanes be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to speake significantly to any such purpose, <hi>Saith the Lord, henceforth even
for ever;</hi> which plainely make the words <hi>Promissory,</hi> &amp; an ingagement of God
himselfe to them, to whom they are spoken: So that the interpretation of
these words, this is my Covenant with them, by Mr <hi>Goodwin Cap. 11. Sect 4.
Pag. 227. That Covenant of perpetuall Grace and Mercy, which I made with them
requireth this of them, in order to the performance of it on my part, that they
quench not my Spirit, which I have put into them,</hi> doth plainly invert the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God in them, and substitute, what is tacitely required as our duty,
into the roome of what is expressly promised as his Grace. Observe
then</p>
            <p>Secondly, that, as no Promise of God given to Believers, is either apt of
it selfe to ingenerate, or by them to be received under such an absurd noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of being made good, what soever their deportment be, it being the nature
of all the Promises of God to frame and mould them, to whom they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into all Holinesse and purity (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.) and this in especiall is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the principall Author and cause all Holinesse to be continued to
them, and is impossible to beapprehended under any such foolish supposall,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59070:114"/>
so also that this Promise is absolute, &amp; not Conditionall, can neither be colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
gainesaid, nor the contrary probably confirmed; so that the strength of
Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> two next Exceptions. 1. <hi>That this cannot be a Promise of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
unto true Believers, whatsoever their deportment shall be.</hi> And 2. <hi>That
it must be Conditionall (which cannot, as he saith, be reasonably gainesaid.)</hi> The
first of them not looking towards our perswasion in this thing: And the latter
being not in the least put upon the proofe, is but very weakenesse; For what
Condition (I pray) of this Promise can be imagined? God promises his Spirit
of Holinesse, that sanctifyeth us, and worketh all holinesse in us; and therewith
the holy Word of the Gospell, which is also Sanctifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>John</hi> 17. 7. that they
shall abide with us for ever: It is the continuance of the presence of God with
us for our Holinesse, that is here promised. On what condition shall this be
supposed to depend? Is it in case we continue Holy? Who seeth not
the vanity of interserting any condition? I will be with you by my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Word for ever, to keep you Holy, provided you continue Holy.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, It is a hard taske to seeke to squeeze a condition out of those
gracious words in the beginning of the verse, <hi>As for mee:</hi> which <hi>Iunius</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(<hi>de me autem</hi>); words wherein God graciously reveals himselfe, as the sole
Author of this great blessing promised, it being a worke of his owne, which he
accomplisheth upon the account of his free Grace. And therefore God sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
placed that expression in the entrance of the Promise, that we may
know, whom to look unto for the fulfilling thereof; And it is yet a farther cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
to say, <hi>that as for me, is as much, as, for my part, I will deale bountifully
with them, provided that they doe so &amp; so, what I require from them,</hi> which is
Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Interpretation of the words; for of this supposition there is not
one word in the Text, as incumbent on them, to whom this Promise is made,
in contradistinction to what God here promiseth; yea he promiseth them, at
least in the root and principall, whatsoever is required of them: Let it be,
that <hi>as for mee,</hi> is, <hi>as for my part</hi> I will doe, what here is promised: and there is
an end of this debate.</p>
            <p>4. The Persons, to whom this Promise is made, are called <hi>thee,</hi> and <hi>thy
Seed,</hi> that is all those, and only those, with whom God is a God in Covenant.
God here minds them of the first making of this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and his Seed <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. Now who are this Seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Not all his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Posterity, not the whole Nation of the Jewes; which is the last subterfuge
invented by our Author, to evade the force of our Argument from this
place. Our Saviour not only denies, but also proves by many Arguments, that
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and their followers, who doubtlesse were of the Nation of the
Jewes, and the <hi>carnall seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were not the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> in
this sence, nor his Seed, but rather the Devills, <hi>Ioh:</hi> 8. 39, 40, 41. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
disputes and argues the same case, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. and proves undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
that it is Believers only, whether <hi>Circumcised</hi> or <hi>Vncircumcised,</hi> whether
<hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are this Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Heires of the Promise. So
plainly, <hi>Gal. 3. 7. Know ye therefore that they, which are of the Faith are Blessed
with Faithfull Abraham,</hi> and then concludes againe as the Issue of his debate,
<hi>v. 9. So then they which he of Faith, are Blessed with Faithfull Abraham:</hi> And this
is the summe of what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> objects unto this Testimony in our case, to
the perpetuall abiding of the Spirit with the Saints.</p>
            <p>The force then of this <hi>Promise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> &amp; the influence it hath into the establishment
of the <hi>Truth</hi> we have in hand, will not be evaded and turned aside, by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>that it is made to the whole people of Israel:</hi> for besides, that the Spirit of the
Lord could not be said to be in the ungodly rejected part of them, nor his
<hi>Word</hi> in their mouth, there is not the least in Text or Context, to intimate
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59070:115"/>
such an extent of this Promise, as to the <hi>object</hi> of it, and 'tis very weakly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to be proved from <hi>Pauls</hi> accommodation, and interpretation of the
verse foregoing, <hi>and the Redeemer shall come to Sion, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Rom:</hi> 11. 26. for it
is most evident, and indisputable, to any one who shall but once cast an eye
upon that place, that the Apostle accommodates, and applies these words to
none, but only those who shall be saved, being turned <hi>away from ungodlinesse
to Christ,</hi> which are only the seed before described. And those he calls <hi>all Israel;</hi>
either in the spirituall sence of the word, as taken for the chosen Israel of God,
or else indefinitely for that Nation, upon the account of those plentifull fruits,
which the Gospell shall find amongst them, when they shall <hi>feare the Lord and
his Goodnesse in the latter daies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 3. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>5. This then is a Promise equally made unto all <hi>Believers;</hi> it is to all that
are in Covenant; neither is there any thing that is of peculiar importance to
any sort of Believers of any time, or age, or dispensation, therein comprized.
It equally respecteth all, to whom the Lord extends his Covenant of Grace.
Certainly the giving of the Spirit of Grace is not enwrapped in any Promise,
that may be of <hi>private Interpretation:</hi> the concernment of all the Saints of
God lying therein. It cannot but be judged a needlesse labour to give parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
instances, in a thing so generally known in the word; Though the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
differ, the matter of this Promise is the same with that given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
the Holy Spirit being the great blessing of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on all, and every one, and only on them, whom God hath graciously ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into Covenant from the foundation of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr</hi> Goodwin <hi>then labours in the fier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 25.</note> 
               <hi>in what he farther objects,</hi> Sect. 6.
<hi>That</hi> this Promise exhibiteth, and holds forth some new Grace, <hi>or Favour,</hi> which
God had not vouchsafed formerly either unto the persons, to whom the said Promise
is now made, or to any other: but for the Grace or favour of final Perseverance, it is
nothing (<hi>at least in the opinion of our Adversaries</hi>) but what is common to all
true Believers, and what God hath conferred upon one and other, on this Generation,
from the beginning of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Emphasis</hi> here put upon it, doth not denote it to be a <hi>new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
but a <hi>great</hi> one, not that it was never <hi>given</hi> before, but that it is now so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
<hi>renewed,</hi> for the Consolation and Establishment of the Church. If
wherever we finde a <hi>solemne Promise</hi> made and confirmed and ratified to the
Church, we must thence conclude, that no Saints were before made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the Mercy of that Promise, we must also in particular conclude,
that no one ever had their <hi>sinnes pardoned,</hi> before the giving of that solemne
Promise. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 32.</p>
            <p>6. We say, that the Grace of Perseverance is such as Believers may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi>
not upon the account of any thing in themselves, nor of the dignity of
the state, whereunto by Grace they are exalted; but meerely on this bottome
and foundation, that it is freely promised of God; who hath also discovered
the rise, and Fountaine of his Gracious Promise to lye in his <hi>Eternall Love</hi>
towards them, so that they can lay no other claime unto it, then to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Grace whatsoever. When we have the Assurance given by any Promise of
God, to say that what is promised of him, may be <hi>expected of course,</hi> is an
expression that fell from Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> when in the heate of disputation, his
thoughts were turned aside from the Consideration of what it is, to mixe
the Promises of God with Faith.</p>
            <p>7. Whereas this is given in for the sence of the words, <hi>that God will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Dispensation of his Grace and Goodnesse, towards, or among his People,
to such an Excellency and height, that, if they proove not extremely unworthy, they
shall have of the Spirit, and Word of God abundantly amongst them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59070:115"/>
abundance of Peace and Happinesse for ever:</hi> It is most apparent that
not any thing of the mind of God in the words, is reached in this glosse.
For</p>
            <p>1. That Condition, <hi>if they prove not extremely unworthy,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
unworthily inserted; the Promise being an ingagement of
God to keepe and preserve them, to whom it is made by his Spirit,
from being so; the Spirit is given and continued to them for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>2. It is supposed to be given to all the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
made to the Church, and Seed in Covenant.</p>
            <p>3. It carryes the Mercy promised no higher then outward dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when the words expressly mention, the <hi>Spirit already received.</hi> Evident
it is, that the whole Grace, Love, Kindnesse, and Mercy of this eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and consequently the whole Covenant of Grace, is enervated by this
corrupting <hi>Glosse;</hi> Doe men think indeed, that all the mercy of the Covenant
of Grace consists in such tenders, and offers, as here are intimated? that it all
lyes in outward endearements, and such dealings with men, as may seeme
to be suited to win upon them: and that, as to the reall exhibition of it, it is
wholly suspended upon the unstable, uncertaine, fraile wills of men? The
Scripture seemes to hold out something farther of more efficacy.<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 19.</note> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
of these exceptions,<note place="margin">Jere, 31. 32. 32. 40.</note> is indeed to exclude all the effectuall Grace of God,
promised in Jesus Christ, upon the account, that the things which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to work in us thereby, are the duties which he requireth of us.</p>
            <p>In summe; these are the exceptions which are given into this <hi>Testimony</hi> of
God, concerning the abiding of the spirit with them, on whom he is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and for whom he is procured, to whom he is sent by Jesus Christ. And
this is the Interpretation of the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>As for mee</hi>] for my part, or as much as
in me lieth [this is my Covenant] I will deale bountifully and gratiously
[with them] the whole Nation of the Jewes, [my spirit that is in thee] that
they ought to take care that they entertaine, and retaine the Holy Spirit, and
not walk so extremely unworthily, that he should depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: the residue
of the words wherein the maine <hi>Emphasis</hi> of them doth lye, is left untouched.
The import then of this Promise, is the same with that of the Promises insisted
on before, with especiall reference to the Holy Spirit, procured for us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto us by Christ. The stability, and establishing Grace of the Covenant,
is here called the Covenant; as sundry other particular mercies of it are also.
Of the Covenant of Grace in Christ, the blessed Spirit to dwell in us, and rest
upon us, is the maine and principall Promise: This for our consolation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
againe and againe, in the Old and New Testoment. As a <hi>Spirit of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi>
he is given to men to make them believe; and as a <hi>spirit of Adopli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
upon their Believing. In either sence, God, even the Father, who takes us
into Covenant in Jesus Christ, affirmes here, that he shall never depart from
us: which is our first Testimony in the case in hand. With whom the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides,
and whilest he abides with them, they cannot utterly forsake God, nor
be forsaken of him; for they who have the spirit of God, are the Children of
God, sonnes, and Heyres. But God hath promised that his Spirit shall abide
with Believers for ever: as hath been clearly evinced from the Text under
consideration, with a removall of all exceptions put in thereto.</p>
            <p>The second witnesse we have of the constant abode and residence of this
spirit bestowed on them,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> which Believe, for ever, is that of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
his Disciples of it. <hi>Joh. 14. 16. I will</hi> (saith he) <hi>pray the Father, and he
shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> As our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
gives a Rule of Interpretation, expressely of his Prayers for Believers,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59070:116"/>
that he did in them intend not only the men of that present Generation, but
all that should <hi>believe to the end of the World, Ioh.</hi> 17. 20. (<hi>I pray not for these
alone, but for them also, who shall believe on me through their word,</hi>) so is it a
Rule equally infallible for the interpretation of the gracious Promises, which
he made to his Disciples, that are not peculiarly appropriated to their season
and worke, (in which yet, as to the generall Love, Faithfulnesse, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
manifested and revealed in them, the concernements of the Saints in all
succeeding ages does lye) they are proper to all Believers, as such. For whom
he did equally intercede, to them he makes Promises alike. They belong no
lesse to us, on whom, in an especiall manner, the <hi>ends of the World are fallen,</hi>
then to those, who first followed him in the Regeneration. Let us then attend
to the Testimony in this place, (and as he shall be pleased to increase our
Faith, mix it therewithall) that the Spirit he procureth for us, and sends to
us, shall abide with us for ever: and whilest the Spirit of the Lord is with us,
we are his. Doubtlesse it is no easy taske to raise up any pretended plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the evidence given in by this Witnesse, the <hi>Amen,</hi> the <hi>great and faithfull</hi>
witnesse in Heaven: He tells us, that he will send the Spirit to abide with us
for ever; and therein speaks to the whole of the case in hand, and Question
under debate. All we say, is, that the Spirit of God shall abide with Believers
for ever; Christ saies so too: and in the issue what ever becomes of us, he
will appeare to be one, against whom there is no rising up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Against this Testimony it is objected by Mr</hi> Goodwin.<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Cap. 11. Sect. 14. Pag.</hi>
234. This Promise (<hi>saith he</hi>) concerning the abiding of this other Comforter for
ever, must be conceived to be made, either to the Apostles, personally considered,
or else to the whole body of the Church, of which they were principall members: If
the first of these be admitted, then it will not follow, that, because the Apostles had
the perpetuall residence of the spirit with them, and in them, therefore every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Believer hath the like: no more then it will follow, that, because the Apostles
were infallible in their judgments, through the teachings of the spirit in them;
therefore every Believer is infallible upon the same account also; If the latter be
admitted, neither will it follow, that every Believer, or every member of the
Church, must needs have the residence of the spirit with them for ever: There are
principall priviledges appropriated to Corporations, which every particular member
of them cannot claime: the Church may have the residence of the spirit of God
with her for ever, and yet every present member thereof loose his interest and part
in him; yea the abiding of the spirit in the Apostles themselves, was not absolutely
promised. Ioh. 15. 10.</p>
            <p>1. The designe of this discourse is to prove,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> that this Promise is not made
to Believers in generall, or those, who through the word, are brought
to believe in Christ in all Generations to the end of the World: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that they have no Promise of the Spirits abiding with them: for that
is the thing opposed; and this is part of the Doctrine, that tends to their
Consolation and improvement in Holinesse. What thankes they will give to
the Authors of such an eminent discovery, when it shall be determined that
they have deserved well of them, and the Truths of God, I know not: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when it shall be considered that not only this, but all other Promises
uttered by Christ to his Apostles (as we had thought) not for their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe
alone, but also for the use of the Church in all ages, are tyed up in their
tendency and use to the men of that Generation, and to the employment, to
which they, to whom he spoke, were designed; But let us see whether these
things are so or no. I say,</p>
            <p>2. There is not any necessary cause of that disjunctive proposition, The
Promise of the perpetuall residence of the Spirit is made, <hi>either to the Apostles
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59070:116"/>
personally,</hi> or to the whole body of the Church: By the <hi>Rule</hi> formerly given for
the Interpretation of these Promises of Christ, it appears, that what in this
kind was made to the <hi>one,</hi> was also given to the <hi>other;</hi> and how Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
will inforce any necessary conclusion from this distinction framed by himselfe,
for his own purpose, I know not; The Promise was made both to <hi>these</hi> and
<hi>those,</hi> the Apostles, and all other Believers, because to the Apostles, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>3. The making of the Promise to the Apostles <hi>personally,</hi> doth not argue
that it was made to them, as Apostles, but only that it was made to their
<hi>Persons,</hi> or to them, though under another qualification, <hi>viz.</hi> of Believing.
'Tis given to them <hi>personally</hi> as <hi>Believers,</hi> and so to all Believers whatever;
This also sets at liberty, and plainly cashiers the comparison instituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Apostles <hi>Infallibility</hi> as <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their sanctifying grace as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
by the Spirit of Grace given for that end; The Apostles <hi>Infallibility,</hi> we
confesse, was from the Spirit; for they (as other Holy men of old) <hi>wrote as they
were moved by the Spirit of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> but that this was a <hi>distinct guift</hi> bestowed on
them as <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not the <hi>teaching of the Spirit of Grace,</hi> which is given to
all Believers 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 22. we need not contend to prove.</p>
            <p>Besides, to what end doth he contend, that it was made to the Apostles in
the sence urged, and by us insisted on, seeing he denies it in the close of this
Section; and chooseth rather to venture upon an opposition unto that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
received perswasion, that the Apostles of Christ, (the sonne of perdition
only excepted) had an absolute promise of Perseverance, then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that, which would prove so prejudiciall and ruinous to his cause, as he
knowes the confession of such a Promise made to them would inevitably be:
He contends not (I say) about the <hi>sence</hi> of the Promise, but would faine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
it from <hi>other</hi> Believers, (at the entrance of the Section) by limiting it to
the Apostles; but considering afterward better of the matter, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that the concession of an <hi>absolute Promise</hi> of Perseverance to any one
Saint whatever, would evidently root up, and cast to the ground the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
engine, that he hath set up against the Truth he opposeth, he suits it (in the
close of the Section) to an evasion, holding better Correspondency with its
associates in this undertaking.</p>
            <p>4. I wonder what <hi>Chimericall Church</hi> he hath found out, to which <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
are made, and <hi>Priviledges</hi> granted, otherwise then upon the account of
the Persons, whereof'tis constituted; suppose (I pray) that Promises of the
Residence of the Spirit for ever with it, be made to the Church, which is
made up of so many members, and that all these members every one, should
loose their interest in it, what subject of that Promise would remaine? What
<hi>Vniversall</hi> is this, that hath a reall existence of it selfe, and by it selfe, in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
from its particulars, in which alone it hath its being? Or what
whole is that, which is preserved in the destruction and dissolution of all its
essentially constituent <hi>parts?</hi> The Promises then, that are made to the
Church, are of two sorts. 1. Of such Grace and Mercies, as, whether <hi>inherent</hi>
or <hi>relative,</hi> have their <hi>residence in,</hi> and <hi>respect unto</hi> particular persons as such;
of this sort are all the Promises of the Grace of Sanctification, as also of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
&amp;c. which are all things of mens personall spirituall interest; The
Promises made to the Church of this nature, are made unto it, meerely as
consisting of <hi>so many, and those</hi> Elected, Redeemed persons, whose right and
interest, as those individuall persons they are. 2. Of all such good things,
as are the exurgency of the collected state of the Saints, in reference to their
spirituall invisible Communion, or visible gathering into a Church, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the mind of Christ, and his Appointment in the Gospell; and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59070:117"/>
these also are all of them founded in the former, and depend wholly upon
them, and are resolved into them. All Promises then whatever made to the
Church, the Body of Christ, doe not respect it primarily, <hi>as a Corporation,</hi>
which is the second notion of it, but as consisting of those particular Believers;
much lesse as a <hi>Chimericall universall,</hi> having a subsistence in and by it selfe,
abstracted from its <hi>particulars.</hi> This evasion then, not withstanding this <hi>Promise
of our Saviour,</hi> doth still continue to presse its Testimony concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
residence of this Holy Spirit with Believers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>scope</hi> of the <hi>place</hi> inforces that exception of these words,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon. Our Blessed Saviour observing the trouble and disconsolation of
his followers, upon the apprehension of his departure from them, stirres them
up to a better hope and confidence by many Gracious Promises, and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of what would and should be the Issue of his being taken away. <hi>v.</hi> 1.
He bids them to free their <hi>hearts from trouble,</hi> and in the next words, tells
them, that the way whereby it was to be done, was by acting Faith on the
Promises of his Father, and those which in his Fathers name, he had made,
and was to make unto them. Of these he mentions many in the following
verses, whereof the Fountaine, Head, and Spring, is that of giving them the
<hi>Comforter,</hi> not to abide with them for a season, as he had done, with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
presence, but to continue with them as a Comforter, (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to the discharging of his whole dispensation towards Believers) <hi>for ever.</hi>
He speakes to them as Believers, as disconsolate dejected Believrs, quickning,
their Faith by Exhortations, and gives them this Promise, as a solid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of peace and composednesse of Sprit, which he exhorted them unto.
And if our Saviour intendeth any thing, but what the words import <hi>viz.</hi> that
he will give his Holy Spirit, as a Comforter, to abide with them for ever,
the Promise hath not the least sutablenesse to relieve them in their distresse,
nor to accomplish the end for which it was given them. But against this it is
excepted <hi>Cap. 11. Sect. 13. Pag.</hi> 233</p>
            <p>1. Evident it is, that our Saviour doth not in this place oppose the abiding or
remaining of the Holy Ghost, to his owne departure from the hearts or soules of
men, into which he is framed or come; but to his departure out of the world, by
death, which was now at hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is a weighty observation: yet withall it is evident, that he
opposeth the abiding of the Spirit with them as a Comforter, to his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
presence with them for that end. His was for a season, the other to endure
for ever. And I desire to know, how our Saviour Christ comes, or enters into
the soules or hearts of men, but by his Spirit: and how these things come
here to be distinguished. But</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He saies</hi> By the abiding of the Comforter with them for ever, he doth not
meane his perpetuall abode in their hearts, or the hearts of any particular man, but
his constant abiding in the world, in, and with the Gospell, and the Children there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in respect of which, he saith of himselfe elswhere, I am with you alwaies even
to the end of the world: as if he should have said, This the purpose of my Father,
in sending me into the world, requiers, that I should make no long stay in it, I am
now upon my returne, but when I come to my Father, I will intercede for you, and
he will send you another Comforter, upon better termes, for staying and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you, then those on which I came: for he shall be sent, not to be taken out
of the world by death, but to make his residence with, and among you my friends
and faithfull ones for ever; Now from such an abiding of the Holy Ghost with them,
as this, cannot be inferd his perpetuall abiding with any one person or Believer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately,
much lesse with every one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> It was evident before, that this Promise was made to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59070:117"/>
of Christ, as Believers, to quicken and strengthen their failing, drooping
Faith, in and under that great Tryall, of loosing the presence of their <hi>Master,</hi>
which they were to undergoe; and being made unto them as Believers,
though upon a particular occasion, is made to all Believers: for <hi>à quatenus ad
omne valet argumentum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is no lesse evident, that according to the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, here, without the
least attempt of proofe, importunately suggested, the Promise is no way suited
to give the least Incouragement or Consolation unto the <hi>Disciples,</hi> in reference
to the Condition, upon the account whereof it is now so solemnly given the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; It
is alone as if our Saviour should have said, <hi>you are sadly troubled indeed, yea your
hearts are filled with trouble &amp; fear, because I have told you that I must leave you,
be not so dejected; I have kept you whilst I have been with you in the world, &amp; now
I goe away, and will send the Holy Spirit into the world, that, whatsoever becomes
of you, or any of you, whether yee have any Consolation or no, he shall abide in the
world (perhaps) with some or other,</hi> (that is, <hi>if any doe believe, which it may be
some will, it may be not) untill the end, and consummation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Is this Promise of sending the Holy Spirit given to the Apostles, or is
it not? If you say not, assigne who it is given or made unto: Christ spake it
to them, and doubtlesse they thought he intended them, and it was wholly
suited to their Condition. If it were made unto them, is it not in the letter of
the Promise affirmed that the Spirit shall abide with them for ever, to whom
it was given? If there be <hi>any subject</hi> of this Promise in receiving the Spirit,
he must of necessity keepe his residence and abode with it for ever. The
whole designe of this <hi>Section,</hi> is to put the persons, to whom this Promise is
made, into the darke, that we may not see them; yea to deny that it is made
to any persons at all, as the <hi>recipient subject</hi> of the Grace thereof. He tells yee,
that he abides in the world: how I pray? Doubtlesse not as the uncleane Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that goes up and downe in dry places, seeking rest and finding none.
Christ promiseth his Spirit to his Church, not to the world, to dwell in the
hearts of his, not to wander up and downe. <hi>Nay he abides with the Apostles, and
their Spirituall posterity,</hi> that is <hi>Believers,</hi> in our Saviours interpretation <hi>John</hi>
17. 20. Are they then, and their posterity, (that is, Believers) the persons, to
whom this Promise is made, and who are concerned in it, with whom as he is
promised, he is to abide? This you can scarcely finde out an Answer to, in
the whole Discourse. He tells you indeed, the Holy Ghost was not to dye,
with such other rare notions: but for any persons particularly intended in
this Promise, we are still in the Darke.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>He tells us,</hi> That from such an abiding of the Holy Ghost with them, as
this, cannot be inferred his perpetuall abiding with any one person, determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>But</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. What kind of abiding it is, that he intends, is not easily apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>2.
If on the account of this Promise, he is given to any person, on the
same account he is to abide with the same person for ever.</p>
            <p>3. That, which he seemes to intend, is the presence of the Spirit in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the Word, to make it effectuall, unto them to whom it is
delivered; when the Promise is to give him as a Comforter, to them, on
whom he is bestowed. But he adds <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>4. And lastly, This particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not alwayes import the certainty of the thing
spoken of, by way of event, (no, not when the speech is of God himselfe) but oft times
the intention only of the Agent: so that the words (that he may abide with you for
ever) doe not imply an absolute necessity of his abiding with them for ever, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that it should be the intent of him that should send him, and that he would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59070:118"/>
send him in such a way, that if they were true to their own interest, they might retain
him, and have his abode with them for ever. Turne the words any way, with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
congruity, either to the scope of the place, manner of Scripture expression,
principles of Reason, and the Doctrine of Perseverance will be found to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that when all <hi>Medicines</hi> will not <hi>heale,</hi>
must serve to skinne the wound given our Adversaries cause, by the Sword
of the Word. The Promise is made unto Believers indeed, but on such and
such conditions, as on the account whereof, it may never be accomplisht to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. 2. This no way sutes Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> interpretation of the place
formerly mentioned and insisted on: If it be, as was said, only a Promise of
sending his Spirit into the World, for the end by him insinuated, doubtlesse
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, must denote the Event of the thing, and not only an Intention,
that might faile of Accomplishment. For let all, or any individualls, behave
themselves how they will, it is certaine, <hi>as to the Accomplishment</hi> and event,
that the Spirit of God shall be continued in the World, in the sence pleaded
for. But it is not what is congruous to his own thoughts, but what may oppose
ours, (that is, the plaine and obvious sence of the words) that he is concerned
to make use of. It being not the sence of the place, but an escaping our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from it, that lies in his designe, he cares not how many contrary
and inconsistent Interpretations he gives of it: <hi>haec non successit, aliâ aggredie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
viâ.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> denotes, (as is confessed) the intention of Christ in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Spirit: that is, that he intends to send him to Believers, so as that he
should abide with them for ever: Now besides the impossibility in generall,
that the intention of God, or of the Lord Christ, as God and man, should be
frustrate, whence in particular should it come to passe he should faile in this
his intention? <hi>I will send ye the holy spirit to abide with you for ever, that is, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to send you the Holy Spirit, that he may abide with you for ever;</hi> what now
should hinder this? Why it is given them, upon <hi>condition that they be true to
their own interest, and take care to retaine him;</hi> what is that I pray? Why that
they continue in Faith, Obedience, Repentance, and close walking with God;
but to what end is it that he is promised unto them? Is it not to <hi>teach them,</hi> to
<hi>worke in them Faith, Obedience, Repentance,</hi> and close walking with God, to
<hi>Sanctifie them throughout,</hi> and preserve them <hi>blamelesse</hi> to the end, making
them <hi>meet for the inheritance with the Saints in Light?</hi> In case they <hi>Obey, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
&amp;c.</hi> the Holy Ghost is promised unto them, to abide with them to cause
them to <hi>Obey, Believe, Repent &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Intention of Christ for the sending of the Spirit, and his abiding
for ever, with them to whom he is sent, is but one and the same. And if any
frustration of his intention do fall out, it may most probably interpose, as to
his sending of the Spirit, not as to the Spirits continuance with them to whom
he is sent; which is asserted absolutely upon the account of his sending him.
He sends him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: his <hi>abode</hi> is the end of his sending: which, if he be sent,
shall be obtained. Upon the whole doubtlesse it will be found, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Perseverance findes so much for its establishment in this place of
Scripture, and Promise of our Saviour, that by no Art or cunning it will be
prevailed withall, to let goe its interest therein. And though many attempts
be made to turne and wrest this Testimony of our Saviour severall wayes,
and those contrary too, and inconsistent with one another, yet it abides to
looke straight forwards to the proofe and confirmation of the Truth, that lyes
not only in the wombe and sence of it, but in the very mouth and literall
expression of it also. I suppose it is evident to all, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> knowes not
what to say to it, nor what sence to fixe upon. At first it is made to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59070:118"/>
not all Believers; then when this will not serve the turne, there being
a Concession in that Interpretation, destructive to his whole cause, then it is
made as a Priviledge to the Church, not to any individuall Persons; but yet
for feare that this priviledge must be vested in some individualls, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
that it is made to any, but only is a Promise of the Spirits abode in the
world with the Word: but perhaps some thoughts coming upon him, that this
will no way suit the scope of the place, nor be suited to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christ,
it is lastly added, that let it be made to whom it will, it is conditionall, though
there be not the least intimation of any condition in the Text, or Context,
and that by him assigned, be coincident with the thing it selfe promised. But
hereof so farre: And so our second Testimony, the Testimony of the Sonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
still by the Truth, for the confirmation whereof it is produced: and in
the <hi>mouth of these two witnesses,</hi> the abiding of the Spirit with Believers to the
end, is established.</p>
            <p>Adde here unto (thirdly) the Testimony of the <hi>third that beares witnesse in
Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> and who also comes neere, and beares witnesse to this Truth in the
hearts of Believers, even of the <hi>Spirit</hi> it selfe, and so I shall leave it sealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Testimony of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. As the other <hi>two,</hi>
gave in their Testimony in a <hi>word of Promise,</hi> so the Spirit doth in a reall
worke of Performance; wherein as he beares a <hi>distinct</hi> Testimony of his
owne, the Saints having a peculiar Communion and fellowship with him
therein, so he is as the <hi>common seale</hi> of Father and Sonne, set unto that Truth,
which by their Testimony they have confirmed. There are indeed sundry
things, whereby he confirmes and establisheth the Saints in the Assurance of
his <hi>abode</hi> with them for ever: I shall at present mention that one eminent
worke of his, which, being given unto them, he doth accomplish to this very
end and purpose; and that is his <hi>Sealing of them to the day of Redemption.</hi> A
worke it is, often in the Scripture mentioned, and still upon the account of
assuring the Salvation of Believers. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 22. by whom also ye are sealed.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mentioned the Certainty, Unchangeablenesse, and efficacy of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God in Christ, and the end to be accomplished and brought about by
them, namely the <hi>Glory of God in Believers, v.</hi> 20. (<hi>all the Promises of God are
yea and Amen, in him to the Glory of God by us</hi>) the Apostle acquaints the
Saints with one Foundation of the security of their interest in those Promises,
whereby the end mentioned, <hi>the Glory of God by them,</hi> should be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
This he ascribes to the efficacy of the Spirit bestowed on them, in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
workes of his Grace, which he reckoneth, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. Among them this is
one, that he <hi>seales them;</hi> As to the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>sealing,</hi> and what that Act of
the Spirit of Grace is, that is so called, I shall not now insist upon it. The <hi>end</hi>
and <hi>use</hi> of Sealing is more aimed at in this expression, then the nature of it;
what it imports, then wherein it consists. Being a terme <hi>forensicall,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
from the use and practice of men in their Civill Transactions, the use,
and end of it may easily from the originall rise thereof be demonstrated.
<hi>Sealing</hi> amongst men hath a two fold use. First to give <hi>secrecy</hi> and <hi>security</hi> (in
things that are under present consideration) to the things sealed. And this is
the First use of Sealing, by a seale set upon the thing sealed. Of this kind of
sealing chiefely have we that long Discourse of <hi>Salmasius,</hi> in the vindication
of his <hi>Jus Atticum</hi> against the Animadversions of <hi>Heraldus.</hi> And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> to give
an assurance, or faith, for what is by them that seale, to be done. In the first
sence, are things sealed up in <hi>Baggs,</hi> and in Treasuries, that they may be kept
safe, none daring to breake open their seales. In the Latter, are all <hi>promissory
ingagements</hi> confirmed, established, and made unalterable, wherein men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in conditionall compacts, or Testamentary dispositions doe oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59070:119"/>
These are the <hi>Sigilla appensa,</hi> that are yet in use in all Deeds, Enfeofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the like Instruments in Law. And with men, if this be done, their
engagements are accounted inviolable. And because all men have not that
Truth, Faithfulnesse, and Honesty, as to make good even their sealed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
the whole Race of man-kind, hath consented unto the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Lawes, and Governors, amongst others, to this end, that all men may
be compelled to stand to their sealed Promises; hence, whatsoever the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it be, and in what particular soever it doth consist, the end and use of
this worke in this speciall Acceptation, is taken evidently in the latter sence,
from its use amongst men. Expressed it is upon the mention of the Promises.
2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1. 20. To secure Believers of their certaine and infallible accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto them, the Apostle tells them of this <hi>sealing of the Spirit,</hi> whereby
the Promises are irrevocably confirmed unto them, to whom they are made,
as is the case among the Sonnes of men; sutably <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. he saith, they are
<hi>sealed by the Holy spirit of Promise;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> that is, that is promised unto us, and who
confirmes to us all the Promises of God. That the other end of security also,
safety and preservation, is designed therein, secondarily, appears from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
season, whereunto this sealing shall be effectuall: it is, <hi>to the day of
Redemption, Eph:</hi> 4. 30. untill the Saints are brought to the enjoyment of the
full, whole, and compleat purchase made for them by Christ, when he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for them <hi>eternall Redemption.</hi> And this is a reall Testimony which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit gives to his owne abiding with the Saints for ever; The worke he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisheth
in them, and upon them, is on set purpose designed to assure
them hereof, and to confirme them in the Faith of it.</p>
            <p>Unto an Argument from this sealing of the spirit thus proposed;<note place="margin">§: 30.</note> 
               <hi>Those who
are sealed, shall certainly be saved;</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> excepts sundry things Ch. 11.
<hi>Sect. 42. Pag.</hi> 255, 256, 257. which because they are applied to blurre that
interpretation of the words of the Holy Ghost, which I have insisted on, I shall
briefely remove out of the way, that they may be no farther offensive to the
meanest <hi>sealed one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He answers then first by distinguishing the Major Proposition thus;</hi> They
who are sealed, shall certainly be saved, with such a sealing, which is unchangeable
by any intervenience whatsoever, as of sinne and Apostasy, so that they cannot
loose their Faith; but if the sealing be only such, the continuance whereof, depends
on the Faith of the sealed, and consequently may be reversed, or with-drawne, it
no way proves, that all they, who are partakers of it, must of necessity retaine their
Faith: therefore (<hi>saith he</hi>) 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> We Answer farther, that the sealing with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
spoken of, is the Latter kind of sealing, not the former, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) which depends
upon the Faith of those that are sealed; as in the beginning or first impression of it, so
in the duration or continuance of it; and consequently there is none other certainty
of its continuance, but only the continuance of the said Faith, which being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the sealing depending on it must needs be uncertaine also: That the sealing
mentioned, depends upon the Faith of the sealed, is evident, because tis said, in
whom also after yee believed, yee were Sealed with the spirit of Promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I dare say, there is no honest man that would take it well at the
hand of Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> or any else, that should attempt by distinctions, or any
other way, to alleviate, or take off the credit of his Truth, and Honesty, in
the performance of all those things, whereunto, and for the confirmation
whereof, he hath set his Seal. What acceptation an like attempt in reference to
the spirit of God, is like to find with him, he may doe well to consider: In the
meane time he prevailes not with us to discredit this worke of his Grace in
the least. For,</p>
            <p>1. First, This supposall of such <hi>interveniencies</hi> of sinne, and wickednesse
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59070:119"/>
in the Saints, as are inconsistent with the life of Faith, and the favour of God,
as also of Apostasy, are but a poore meane insinuation, for the begging of the
thing in Question, which will never be granted of any such termes. An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of Apostasy, that is defection from the Faith, is not handsomely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
whilest men continue in the Faith.</p>
            <p>2. That which is given for the confirmation of their Faith, and on set
purpose to adde continuance to it, as this is, cannot depend on the condition
of the continuance of their Faith. The Holy Ghost <hi>seales them to the day of
Redemption,</hi> confirming and establishing thereby an infallible continuance,
of their Faith, but it seemes upon condition of their continuance in the Faith.
<hi>Cui fini?</hi> Of what hitherto is said this is the summe. If they who are sealed
Apostatize into sinne and wickednesse, they shall not be saved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that they have been sealed: and this must passe for an answer to
our Argument proving that they cannot so apostatise, because they are Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
on purpose to preserve and secure them from that Condition: Men need
not goe farre to seeke for Answers to any Argument, if such as these, (pure
beggings of the thing in Question and argued) will suffice.</p>
            <p>3. Neither doth the <hi>begining or first impression of the sealing</hi> depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Faith, any otherwise, but as Believers are the subject of it, which is
not to have any kind of dependance upon it, either as to its nature or use.
Neither doth that place of the Apostle <hi>Fph.</hi> 1. 13. (<hi>After ye Believed ye were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>)
prove any such thing, unlesse this generall <hi>axiome</hi> be first established,
that all things which in order of nature, are before, and after, have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of Cause, and effect, or at least of Condition, and Event between
them; It proves indeed that their <hi>Believing</hi> is in order of nature, antecedent
to their <hi>sealing,</hi> respecting the use of it here mentioned; but this proves not
at all, that Faith is the condition of sealing: the bestowing of Faith, and the
grant of this seale to establish it, being both acts depending meerely, solely,
&amp; distinctly, on the free Grace of God in Christ; Though Faith in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
goe before Hope, yet is no Hope bestowed on men on the condition of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi>
The truth is, both Faith &amp; Sealing, &amp; all other spirituall Mercyes, as to
the Goodwill of God bestowing them, are at once granted us in Jesus Christ:
but as to our reception of them, &amp; the actuall instating of our soules in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them, or rather as to the exerting of themselves in us, they have
that order which either the nature of the things themselves requires, or the
soveraigne Will of God, hath alotted to them; neither doth sealing bespeake
any Grace in us, but a peculiar improvement of the Grace bestowed on
us. So that</p>
            <p>4. We refuse the Answer suggested by Mr <hi>Goodwin, That Sealing depends</hi>
(that is in his sence) <hi>upon Believing as to the first grant of it, but not as to the
continuance therof:</hi> and reject his supposall of <hi>one that hath truly Blieved,
making shipwrack of his Faith,</hi> as to importune a crye, or begging of that
which it is evident cannot be proved. I shall adde only that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
granting here the continvance of Faith to be a thing, <hi>uncertaine,</hi> which is a
word to expresse a very weak probability of a thing, is much fallen off from
his former confident expression of the only remote possibility of Believers
falling away. That their falling away should be scarsly possible, and yet their
continuance in the Faith very uncertaine, is somewhat uncouth. But this is
the foundation of that great Consolation which Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Doctrine is so
pregnant and teeming withall, that it even grones to be delivered. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in Believing is uncertaine, therefore they must needs rejoyce and
be filled with Consolation. But he Answers farther:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59070:120"/>
1. <hi>I Answer farther, by way of exception, that the Sealing we speake of, is
neither granted by God, unto Believers themselves, upon any such termes, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no occasion, or occasions whatsoever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> 
               <hi>as of the greatest and most horrid sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and long continued in by them, or the like, it should never be interrupted, or
defaced: for this is contrary to many plaine Texts of Scripture, and particularly
uuto all those, where either Apostates from God, or evill doers, and workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
are threatned with the losse of Gods Favour, and of the inheritance of Life,
such as Heb. 10. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is the intent and purpose of God, that the Sealing of Believers
shall abide with them for ever: whence comes it to passe, that his Purposes
doe not stand, and that he doth not fulfill his pleasure? <hi>It is not that he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
but that men are changed:</hi> that is, the beginning of the change is not in him;
Occasion of it is administred unto him by men. When his Sealing is removed
from Believers, doth God still purpose that it shall continue with them, or
no? If he doth, then he puposeth that shall be, which is not, which it is his
will shall not be, and he continues in his vaine Purpose to Eternity. Or if he
ceases to purpose, how is it that he is not changed? Such things speake a
change in the sonnes of men, and we thought had been incompatible with the
Perfection of the Divine Nature: even that he should Will &amp; Purpose one thing
at one time, and another, yea the cleane contrary, at another: Yea but the
Reason of it is, because the men concerning whom his Purposes are, do
change; This <hi>salves</hi> not the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God; Though he doth not
change from any new consideration in himselfe, and from himselfe, yet he
doth from obstructions in his way, and to his thoughts in the Creatures: yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed
of <hi>salving</hi> his <hi>Vnchangeablenesse,</hi> this is destructive to his <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2.
This whole Answer is a supposall, that God may alter his <hi>Purposes</hi> of
confirming men in Grace, if they be not confirmed in Grace; or that, though
Gods Purpose be to seale them to the day of Redemption, yet they may not
continue, nor be preserved thereunto: and then Gods Purpose of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
ceaseth also. This is</p>
            <p>3. More evident in his second Answer, by way of exception, which is
made up of these two parts. First a <hi>begging</hi> of the maine, and upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>only</hi> thing in question, by supposing that Believers may fall into the most
horrible sinnes, and continue in them to the end: so proving with greate Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and perspicuity, that Believers may fall away, because they may fall
away. And 2. A suggestion of his owne Judgement to the contrary: And
his supposall, that it is confirmed by some <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture, which (God as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting)
shall be delivered from this Imputation hereafter: And these two
do make up so cleare an Answer to the Argument in hand, that a man knowes
not well what to reply: let us take it for granted, that Believers may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and how shall we prevent Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> from proving it? But he adds
farther</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Believers are said to be sealed by the Holy Spirit of God, against, or untill, or for
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the day of Redemption, because that Holinesse, which is wrought in them by
the Spirit of God, qualifies them, puts them into a present and actuall Capacity of
partaking in that Joy and Glory, which the Great day of the full Redemption of
the Saints, (that is, of those, who lived, and dyed, and shall be found such) shall
bring with it; and it is called the Earnest of their Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> comes to be against, or for, or to denote the matter spoken
of, and what all this is to the purpose in hand, he shewes not. The ayme of
him the words are spoken of, and the uninterrupted continuance of the
worke mentioned, to the end expressed, seemes rather to be intended in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59070:120"/>
whole Coherence of the words. Neither is the use of <hi>Sealing,</hi> to prepare any
thing, for such a time, but to secure and preserve it thereunto. He that
hath a Conveyance <hi>Sealed</hi> unto him, is not only capacitated for the present,
to receive the estate conveyed, but is principally assured of a Right &amp; Title,
for a continued enjoyment of it, not to be reversed. It is not the nature of
this worke of the Holy Ghost, wherein it is coincident which other acts of his
Grace; but the particular use of it, as it is a <hi>Sealing,</hi> and Gods intendment by
it, to confirme us to the day of Redemption, that comes under our Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
If it were a season to inquire, wherein it consists. I suppose we should
scarce close with Mr <hi>Goodwin's</hi> description of it, <hi>viz. That it is a quallifying of
men, and putting them in an actuall capacity to partake of Joy &amp;c.</hi> He is the <hi>first,</hi>
I know of, that gave this description of it, and probably the <hi>last</hi> that will do so.
Of the <hi>Earnest of the Spirit</hi> in its propper place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What he addes in the last place, namely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 32.</note> if the Apostles intent had been to
informe the Ephesians, that the gift of the Holy Spirit, which they had received
from God, was the earnest of their inheritance, upon such termes, that no unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or wickednesse whatsoever, on their parts, could ever hinder the actuall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of this inheritance upon them, he had plainly prevaricated with that most
serious Admonition, wherein he addresses himselfe to them afterwards, For this ye
know, that no Whore-monger, &amp;c. hath any inheritance in the Kingdome of
Christ; <hi>This I say, is of the same alloy with what went before. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Here is the same begging of the Question as before, and that upon a
twofold account. 1. In supposing, that Believers may fall into such sinnes,
and unworthinesse, as are inconsistent with the state of Acceptation with God,
which is the very thing he hath to prove. 2. In supposing, that, if Believers
are sealed up infallibly to Redemption, the Exhortations to the avoidance of
sinnes, in themselves, and to all that continue in them, destructive to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are in vaine: which is a figment, in a case somewhat alike (as to the reason
of it) rejected by men, that knew nothing of the nature of Gods Promises,
nor his commands, nor the Accommodation of them both, to the fulfilling in
Believers, <hi>all the good pleasure of his Goodnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Assurance, the Apostle gives of freedome from the wrath of God,
is inseparably associated with that <hi>Assurance</hi> that he gives, that we shall not be
left in, or given up to such waies, as wherein that wrath, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of the Covenant of Grace, is not to be avoided. From this latter Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
this Argument also doth flow; Those, who are sealed of God to the day
of Redemption, shall certainly be preserved thereunto: their preservation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end and aime of God in his sealing of them. Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Answer to
this Proposition is, that they shall be so preserved, in case they fall not into
abominable sinnes and practises, and so Apostatize from the Faith; that is in
case they be preserved, they shall be preserved; but wherein their preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should consist, if not in their effectuall deliverance from such waies and
courses, is not declared. That all Believers are so sealed, and to that end, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
is the plaine Testimony of the Scripture, and therefore our Conclusion
is undeniably evinced.</p>
            <p>Thus have we, through the Lords assistance, freed the <hi>triple Testimony</hi> of
<hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> given to the Truth under Consideration, from all
Objections, and exceptions put in thereunto: so that we hope the mouth of
iniquity may be stopt, and that the cause of the Truth in hand is secured for
ever. <hi>It is a fearfull thing to contend with God. Let God be true and all men ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving shewed,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> that the Holy Spirit is purchased for us, by the
<hi>Oblation</hi> of Christ, and bestowed on us, through his <hi>Intercession,</hi>
to abide with us for Ever, a Truth confirmed by the unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Testimonies of the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> I shall in
the next place, (I hope to the advantage and satisfaction of the
Christian Reader) a little turne aside to consider <hi>how,</hi> and in
<hi>what manner</hi> he <hi>abideth</hi> with them, on whom he is bestowed: together with
some Eminent <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of his Grace, which he putteth forth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erteth
in them, with whom he abideth, all tending to their preservation in
the Love and Favour of God. A Doctrine it is of no small use, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in our walking with God, as we shall find in our pursuit of it. And
therefore though not appearing so directly Argumentative, and immediately
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59070:121"/>
subservient to the promotion of the Dispute in hand, yet tending to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,
guidance, and consolation of them who doe receive it, and to the
cherishing, increasing, and strengthning of the Faith thereof, I cannot but
conceive it much conducing to the carrying on of the maine Intendment of
this whole undertaking. I say then, upon the purchase made of all Good
things for the Elect by Christ, the Holy and Blessed Spirit of God is given to
them, to <hi>dwell</hi> in them <hi>personally,</hi> for the Accomplishment of all the ends
and purposes of his <hi>Oeconomie</hi> towards them, to make them <hi>meet for, and to
bring them unto the inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> Personally (I say) in our
Persons, (not by Assumption of our Natures, giving us <hi>mysticall</hi> union with
Christ, not <hi>Personall</hi> Union with himselfe, that is not one Personality with
him, which is impious and blasphemous to imagine) by a Gracious inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
distinct from his Essentiall filling all things, and his <hi>energeticall</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things as he will, as shall afterwards be declared. Now this being a
Doctrine of pure Revelation, our Demonstrations of it must be meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptuall, and <hi>such</hi> (as will instantly appeare) we have provided in
great plenty. In the carrying on then of this undertaking, I shall do these two
things.</p>
            <p>1. Produce <hi>some</hi> of those many Texts of Scripture, which are pregnant of this Truth.</p>
            <p>2. Shew what great things do issue from thence, and are affirmed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
thereunto, being inferences of a supposall thereof, all conducing to
the preservation of Believers, in the Love and Favour of God, unto the end.
For the first, I shall referre them to 4. heads; unto
<list>
                  <item>1. Promises, that he should so dwell in us.</item>
                  <item>2. Positive Affirmations that he doth so.</item>
                  <item>3. Those Texts that hold out his being distinguished from all his Graces, and
Guifts, in his so doing.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Those that ascribe a Personality to him, in his indwelling, in us.</hi> Of each
sort one, or two places may suffice.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>indwelling of the Spirit</hi> is the great and solemne Promise of the
Covenant of Grace; The manner of it we shall afterwards evince. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27.
<hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my wayes;</hi> In the verse
foregoing he tels them, <hi>He will give them a new heart, and a new Spirit,</hi> which,
because it may be interpreted of a <hi>renewed frame of Spirit,</hi> (though it rather
seemes to be the renewing Spirit, that is intended as also <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. 19.)
he expressly points out, and differences the <hi>Spirit</hi> he will give them, from all
workes of Grace whatsoever, in that <hi>Appellation</hi> of him, <hi>my Spirit,</hi> my Holy
Spirit; Him will I put with in you, I will give him, or place him, <hi>in interiori
vestro,</hi> in your <hi>inmost part,</hi> in your heart; or in <hi>visceribus vestris,</hi> in your
bowels, (as the Soule is frequently signifyed by expressions of sensuall things)
<hi>within you.</hi> In his giving us a new heart, &amp; new Spirit, by putting in us his Spirit,
certainly more is intended then a meere working of Gracious qualities in our
Hearts, by his Spirit, which he may do, &amp; yet be no more in us, then in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Blasphemers in the world. And this in the carrying of it on to its acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
God calls his <hi>Covenant Isa. 59. 21. This is my Covenant with them, saith
the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee, shall not depart from thee: upon thee, in thee,</hi>
that <hi>dwels in thee,</hi> as was promised. And this <hi>Promise</hi> is evidently renewed by
the Lord Christ to his Disciples, clearely also interpreting what that Spirit is,
which is mentioned in the Promise of the Covenant, <hi>Luk. 11. 13. Your Heavenly
Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that aske him, of him;</hi> that is, that pray
to him for the Holy Spirit. Our Saviour instructs his Disciples to aske the
Holy Spirit of God, upon the account of his being so promised, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59070:122"/>
All our supplications are to be regulated by the Promise. And surely he, who
(as shall afterwards appeare) did so plentifully,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 27.</note> and richly Promise the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
of this Spirit on all those, that believe on him, did not instruct them
to aske for any inferion Mèrcy, and Grace, under that name. That Spirit
which the Lord Christ instructs us to aske of the Father, is the Spirit, which he
hath promised to bestow so on us, as that he shall dwell in us. That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which Christ instructs us to aske for, and which himselfe promiseth to send
unto us, is the Holy Ghost himselfe, the Holy Spirit of Promise, by whom wee
are Sealed to the day of Redemption, I suppose will require no labour to
prove: what is needfull to this end, shall be afterward insisted on.</p>
            <p>2. Positive affirmations that he doth so <hi>dwell in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 2.</note> and remaine with the
Saints, are the second ground of the Truth we assert; I shall name one, or two
Testimonies of that kind. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 11. saith <hi>David, take not thy Holy Spirit from
me.</hi> It is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and his presence, as unto Sanctification, not in respect of
Prophesy, or any other gift whatever, that he is treating of with God. All
the Graces of the Spirit, being almost dead and buried in him, he cries aloud
that He, whose they are, and who alone is able to revive and quicken them,
may not be taken from him. With him, in him he was, or he could not be
taken from him. And though the Gifts or Graces of the Spirit only may be
intended, where mention is made of giving or bestowing of him sometimes,
yet when the Saints begge of God, that he would continue his Spirit with
them, though they have grieved him and provoked him, that no more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but some Gift or Grace, is not so cleare. I know men possessed with
prejudice against this Truth, will think easily to evade these Testimonies, by
the Distinction of the Person, and Graces of the Spirit. Wherefore for the
manner how he is with them, with whom he is, the Apostle informes us, <hi>Rom:</hi> 8.
9. <hi>yee are in the spirit</hi> (that is, spirituall men, opposed to being in the flesh, that
is, carnall, unregenerate, unreconciled, and enemies to God) <hi>if so be the spirit
of Christ dwell in you:</hi> and <hi>if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of
his:</hi> Not only the thing it selfe is asserted, but the weight of our Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Acceptation with God through Jesus Christ, is laid upon it. If the
Spirit <hi>dwell</hi> in us, we are <hi>spirituall,</hi> and belong to Christ; otherwise not, wee
are none of his. This the Apostle farther confirmes. v. 11. <hi>if the spirit of him,
that raised up Jesus, dwell in you:</hi> I know not how the <hi>Person</hi> of the Holy Ghost
can be more clearely decyphered, then here he is, <hi>The spirit of him that raised
Jesus from the dead;</hi> Why that is mentioned, shall afterwards be considered.
And this Spirit, as he bears Testimony of himselfe, dwells in Believers, which is
all we say, and, without farther curious enquiry, desire to rest therein. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it were better for men, to captivate their understandings to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Faith, then to invent Distinctions and Evasions, to escape the power
of so many plaine Texts of Scripture, and those litterally, and properly, not
<hi>Figuratively</hi> and <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> expressing the Truth contained in then:
which, though it may be done sometimes, yet is not in a constant uniforme
tenure of expression any where, the manner of the Holy Ghost. The Apostle
also affirmes farther v. 15. that Believers receive <hi>the spirit of Adoption to cry
Abba Father;</hi> which being a worke within them, cannot be wrought and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by Adoption it selfe, which is an extrinsicall Relation. Neither can Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Spirit of Adoption be conceived to be the same. He also far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affirmes it 1 <hi>Cor: 2. 12. we have received the spirit, which is of God, that
we might know the things, that are freely given us of God.</hi> We have so received
him, as that he abides with us, to teach us, to acquaint our hearts, with Gods
dealing with us: <hi>bearing witnesse</hi> with our spirits to the condition wherein
we are, in reference to our Favour from God, and Acceptation with him; and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59070:122"/>
the same he most distinctly asserts <hi>Gal. 4. 6. God hath sent forth the spirit of his
Sonne, into our hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> The distinct <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne, and Spirit, in the work of Adoption, is clearly discovered. He
is <hi>sent,</hi> sent of God, <hi>that is, the Father.</hi> That name is <hi>Personally</hi> to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated,
when it is distinguished (as here) from Sonne, and Spirit; That is
the Fathers work, that work of his Love, he sends him. He hath sent him, as
the <hi>spirit of his Sonne,</hi> procured by him <hi>for</hi> us, promised by him <hi>to</hi> us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from him, as to his <hi>personall subsistence,</hi> and sent by him, as to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Adoption and Consolation. Then whether the <hi>Father</hi> hath sent the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his Sonne,</hi> where he is to abide and make his residence is expressed; it is
into <hi>our Hearts</hi> saith the Apostle: there he dwells and abides. And lastly, what
there he doth is also manifested: he setts them on worke in whom he is, gives
them <hi>priviledges</hi> for it, <hi>Ability</hi> to it, <hi>Incouragement</hi> in it, causing them to cry
<hi>Abba Father;</hi> Once, and againe, to <hi>Timothy,</hi> doth the same Apostle assert the
same truth, 1 <hi>Epist. 3. 14. the good thing committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which dwelleth in us.</hi> The Lord knowing how much of our Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
depends on this Truth, redoubles his Testimony of it, that <hi>wee</hi>
might receive it: even wee, <hi>who are dull and slow of heart to believe the things
that are written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whereas some may say,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> it cannot be denyed, but that the <hi>Spirit dwels</hi>
in Believers, but yet this is not <hi>personally,</hi> but only by his Grace, though I
might reply, that this indeed, and upon the matter, is not to distinguish, but
to deny, what is positively affirmed. To say the <hi>Spirit</hi> dwells in us, but not
the <hi>Person</hi> of the Spirit, is not to distinguish, <hi>de modo,</hi> but to deny the thing it
selfe; To say, the Graces indeed of the Spirit are in us, (not dwell in us, for
an Accident is not properly said to dwell in its subject) but the Spirit it selfe
doth not dwell in us, is expressly to cast downe what the word sets up. If such
distinctions ought to be of force, to evade so many positive and plaine Texts
of Scripture, as have been produced; it may well be questioned, whether any
Truth be capable of proofe from Scripture or no. Yet I say farther, to obviate
such Objections, and to prevent all quarrellings for the future, the Scripture
it selfe, as to this businesse of the Spirits <hi>indwelling,</hi> plainely distinguisheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Spirit it selfe, and his Graces: He is (I say) distinguished from them,
and that in respect to his indwelling. <hi>Rom. 5. 5. The Love of God is shed abroad
in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, that is given to us:</hi> The Holy Ghost is given to
us, to dwell in us, as hath been abundantly declared, and shall yet farther be
demonstrated. Here He is mentioned together with the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and
his <hi>shedding</hi> thereof <hi>abroad in our Hearts;</hi> that is, with his Graces: &amp; is as cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguished and differenced from them, as Cause and effect. Take the
<hi>Love of God,</hi> in either sence, that is controverted about this place, for our <hi>Love</hi>
to God, or a sence of his Love to us, and it is an eminent Grace of the Holy,
Spirit. If then by the Holy Ghost given unto us yee understand only the
Grace of the Holy Ghost, <hi>He</hi> being said to be given, because <hi>that</hi> is given,
then this must be the sence of the place, <hi>The Grace of the Holy Ghost is shed
abroad in our Hearts, by the Grace of the Holy Ghost, that is given to us.</hi> Farther,
if by the Holy Ghost, be meant only his Grace, I require what Grace
it is, hereby the expression intended? Is it the same with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
the Love of God? This were to confound the efficient cause with its
effect. Is it any other Grace, that doth produce the great worke mentioned?
Let us know what that Grace is, that hath this power &amp; <hi>energie</hi> in its hand, of
shedding abroad the <hi>Love of God in our Hearts.</hi> So <hi>Rom. 8. 11. He shall quicken
your mortall bodyes by the Spirit, that dwelleth in you.</hi> This <hi>quickning of our
mortall bodies</hi> is generally confessed to be (and the scope of the place infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59070:123"/>
that sence) our <hi>Spirituall quickning in our mortall bodyes:</hi> mention being
made of our bodyes, in <hi>Analogie</hi> to the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> by his death, we have
life, and <hi>quickning.</hi> Donbtlesse then it is a Grace of the Spirit that is intended.
Yea the habitual principle of all Graces. And this is wrought in us by the Spirit
that dwelleth in us. There is not any Grace of the Spirit whereby he may
dwell in men, antecedent to his Quickning of them. Spirituall Graces, have not
their residence in dead soules. So that this must be the Spirit himselfe dwelling
in us, that is here intended, and that <hi>personally:</hi> or the sence of the words must
be, <hi>The Grace of quickning our mortall bodyes, is wrought in us, by the Grace of
Quickning our mortall bodyes that dwels in us:</hi> which is plainely to confound
the Cause and Effect; Besides it is the same Spirit <hi>that raised up Jesus from the
dead,</hi> that is intended, which doubtlesse was not any inherent Grace, but the
Spirit of God himselfe, working by the exceding greatnesse of his Power.
Thus much is hence cleared. Antecedent in order of nature to our Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
there is a Spirit given to us, to dwell in us. Every efficient Cause hath
at least the precedency of its effect. No Grace of the Spirit is bestowed on us
before our Quickning, which is, the preparation, and fitting of the subject for
the receiving of them; the planting of the Roote that containes them vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and brings them forth actually in their order. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. All Graces
whatsoever come under the name of the <hi>fruit</hi> of the Spirit: that is, which the
Spirit in us brings forth, as the Roote doth the fruit, which in its sodoing, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
therefrom. Many oher instances might be given, but these may suffice.</p>
            <p>4. There is a <hi>Personallity</hi> ascribed to the Holy Ghost, in his <hi>dwelling</hi> in us
and that in such a way,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> as cannot be ascribed to any Created Grace,
which is but a Quality in a subject, and this the Scripture doth three
wayes:
<list>
                  <item>1. In personall Appellations.</item>
                  <item>2. In personall Operations.</item>
                  <item>3. Personall Circumstances.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. First there are ascribed to the <hi>indwelling Spirit,</hi> in his <hi>indwelling,</hi> Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Appellations; <hi>He that is in you, is greater then he that is in the world</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:)
<hi>He that is in you,</hi> is a personall Denomination, which cannot be used
of any Grace, or gratious habit whatsoever: so <hi>John 14 16, 17. He shall abide
with you, he dwelleth with you, shall be in you,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. But when the Spirit of Truth is come, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
His <hi>Person</hi> is as signally designed and expressed, as in any
place of Scripture to what intent or purpose soever mentioned. Neither is it
possible to apprehend, that the Scripture would so <hi>often,</hi> so <hi>expressly</hi> affirme
the same thing in plaine proper words, if they were not to be taken, in the
sence which they hold out. The maine Emphasis of the Expression lyes upon
the Termes that are of a personall designation, and to evade the force of them
by the fore mentioned distinction which they seeme signally to obviate
and prevent: is to say what we please, so we may oppose what pleases us
not.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Personall Operations,</hi> such acts and actings, as are proper to a person
only, are ascribed to the Spirit in his <hi>indwelling.</hi> That place mentioned before
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. is cleare hereunto, <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
the dead, dwell in you, he who raised Christ from the dead shall quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
bodyes by his Spirit which dwélteh in you,</hi> or, <hi>by his indwelling Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
To quicken our mortall bodyes is a Personall acting,</hi>
&amp; such as cannot be wrought but by an Almighty Agent. And this is ascribed
to the Spirit <hi>as inhabiting,</hi> whch is in order of nature antecedent to his
quickning of us, as was manifested. And the same is asserted, <hi>v. 15. The Spirit
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59070:123"/>
beareth witnesse with our spirits, that we are the Sonnes of God:</hi> That Spirit, that
<hi>dwells</hi> in us, beares witnesse in us, a distinct Witnesse by himselfe, distinguished
from the Testimony of our owne spirit here mentioned, is either an Act of
our naturall Spirits, or Gracious fruit of the Spirit of God in our hearts;
If the first, what makes it in the things of God? Is any Testimony of our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
spirits</hi> of any value, to assure us that we are the Children of God? If
the latter, then is there here an immediate operation of the Spirit dwelling in
our hearts, in witnesse-bearing, distinct from all the fruits of Grace whatever.
And on this account it is that, whereas 1 <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>John</hi> 5. 7, 8. the <hi>Father,
Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are said to beare witnesse in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Spirit is moreover
peculiarly said to beare witnesse in the <hi>Earth,</hi> together with the <hi>Blood, and
Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There are such Circumstances ascribed to him in his <hi>indwelling,</hi> as are
proper only to that which is a Person; I will instance only in one, his dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Saints as in a <hi>Temple, 1 Cor. 3. 16. Yee are the Temple of God, and his
Spirit dwelleth in you;</hi> that is, as in a Temple; so plainely <hi>chap. 6. 19. Your body
is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which you have of God,</hi> giving us
both the distinction of the <hi>Person</hi> of the Spirit, from the other <hi>Persons, he is
given us of God,</hi> and his residence with us, being so given, <hi>he is in us,</hi> as also
the manner of his in-being, <hi>as in a Temple;</hi> Nothing can make a place a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but the Relation it hath unto a <hi>Deity.</hi> Graces that are but <hi>Qualifications</hi>
of, and <hi>Qualities</hi> in a Subject, cannot be said to <hi>dwell in a Temple;</hi> This the
Spirit doth: and therefore as a <hi>voluntary Agent</hi> in an habitation, not as a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
or <hi>naturall</hi> principle in a subject: and though every act of his be Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
<hi>intensively,</hi> being the act of an Omnipotent Agent, yet he worketh
not in the acts <hi>extensively,</hi> to the utmost of his Omnipotency: he exerteth and
puts forth his Power, and brings forth his Grace in the hearts of them, with
whom he dwells as he pleaseth: to one he comunicates more Grace, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lesse: yea he gives more strength to <hi>one</hi> and the same person, at <hi>one</hi> time,
and in one condition,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> then <hi>another, dividing to every one as he will:</hi> and if
this peculiar manner of his <hi>personall presence</hi> with his Saints, distinct from his
Ubiquity or <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> may not be believed, because not well by reason
conceived, we shall lay a Foundation for the questioning principles of
Faith, which as yet we are not fallen out withall.</p>
            <p>And this is our first manifestation of the Truth concerning the Indwelling
of the Spirit in the Saints from the Scripture. The second will be from the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Issues, and benefits, which are asserted to arise from this indwelling of the
Spirit in them, of which I shall give sundry instances.</p>
            <p>1. The first signall Issue and Effect which is ascribed to this <hi>Indwelling</hi> of
the Spirit,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> is <hi>Union;</hi> not a <hi>Personall Union</hi> with himselfe, which is impossible:
He doth not <hi>assume</hi> our natures, and so prevent our <hi>Personality,</hi> which would
make us one <hi>Person</hi> with him, but dwells in our Persons, keeping his owne,
and leaving us our Personality infinitely distinct; But it is a <hi>spirituall Union;</hi>
the great <hi>Union</hi> mentioned so often in the Gospell, that is the sole fountain
of our Blessednesse; our <hi>Union</hi> with the Lord Christ, which we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>Many
thoughts of heart there have been about this Union;<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> what it is,
wherein it doth consist, the causes, manner, and Effects of it; The Scripture
expresses it, to be very <hi>Eminent, neere, durable,</hi> setting it out, for the most
part, by similitudes, and <hi>Metaphoricall Illustrations,</hi> to lead poore weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
into some <hi>usefull, needfull</hi> acquaintance with that Mystery, whose
depths in this life, they shall never fathome: That many in the dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live, have miscarried in their conceptions of it, is evident; some to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59070:124"/>
make out their <hi>Imaginary Union,</hi> have destroyed the person of Christ, and
fancying a way of uniting man to God by him, have left him to be neither
God nor Man. Others have destroyed the Person of Believers, affirming that
in their Union with Christ, they loose their own <hi>Personality,</hi> that is, cease to be
<hi>Men:</hi> or at least <hi>these</hi> or <hi>these Individuall men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I intend not now to handle it at large, but only (and that I hope without
offence) to give in my thoughts concerning it, as farre as it receiveth light
from, and relateth unto, what hath been before delivered, concerning the
Indwelling of the Spirit, and that without the least contending about other
wayes of Expression.</p>
            <p>I say then,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> this is that which gives us Union with Christ, and that wherein
it consists; even that the one, and selfe-same Spirit, dwells in him and us; The
first saving <hi>Elapse</hi> from God, upon the Hearts of the Elect, is the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
Their <hi>quickning</hi> is every where ascribed to the Spirit, that is given unto them;
There is not a <hi>quickning,</hi> a <hi>life-giving Power,</hi> in a quality, a created thing. In
the state of Nature, besides gracious dispensations and habits in the Soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
it to that which is good, and making it a sutable subject for spirituall
Operations,<note place="margin">John 5. Eph. 2. 1, 2.</note> we want also a <hi>vitall Principle,</hi> which should <hi>actuate</hi> the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
subject unto answerable Operations; this a <hi>quality</hi> cannot give. He that
carries on the worke of quickning, doth also begin it. <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. 11. All Graces
whatever,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> (as was said) are the fruits of the Spirit; and therefore, in order of
Nature, are wrought in men, consequentially to his being bestowed on them:
Now in the first bestowing of the Spirit, we have Union with Christ, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on whereof, consists in the farther manifestation, and operations of the
<hi>Indwelling Spirit,</hi> which is called <hi>Communion:</hi> To make this evident, that our
Union with Christ consists in this, the same Spirit dwelling in him and us, and
that this is our Union; let us take a view of it First, from Scripturall <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of it; and then Secondly, from Scripture <hi>Illustrations</hi> of it, both briefely,
being not my direct businesse in hand.</p>
            <p>1. First <hi>Peter</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> that it is a <hi>participation of the Divine Nature, 2 Pet.</hi> 1.
4. We are by the Promises made partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> that is, it is
<hi>promised</hi> to be given unto us, which when we receive, we are made partakers
of, by the Promises. That this <hi>participation of the Divine Nature</hi> (let it be
interpreted how it will) is the same, upon the matter, with our Union with
Christ, is not questioned: that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should be only a gracious <hi>habit, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
or <hi>disposition</hi> of Soule in us, I cannot easily receive; that is somewhere call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> the <hi>New Crea ure,</hi> but no where <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> The
pretended high and spirituall, but indeed grosse and carnall conceits of some,
from hence, destructive to the Nature of God and Man, I shall not turne aside
to consider; What that is of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or wherein it doth consist,
that we are made partakers of by the Promises, I shewed before: That the
Person of the Holy and Blessed Spirit is promised to us, whence he is called
the Holy Spirit of Promise: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. hath been I say by sundry evidences
manifested: Upon the Accomplishment of that Promise, he coming to dwell
in us, we are said in him, by the Promises, to be made partakers of the Divine
Nature. We are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we have our Communion with it: Our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
then of the Divine Nature, being our Union with Christ, consists in
dwelling of the same Spirit in him and in us, we receiving him by the Promise
for that end.</p>
            <p>2. Christ tells us,<note place="margin">§: 10.</note> that this Union arises from the <hi>eating of
his flesh, and drinking of his bloud, Ioh: 6. 56. Hee that eateth my
flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him;</hi> The
mutuall <hi>Indwelling</hi> of Christ and his Saints, is their <hi>Union:</hi> this, saith
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59070:124"/>
Christ, is from their <hi>Eating my flesh, and Drinking my bloud;</hi> But how may this
be done? Many were <hi>offended,</hi> when this saying was spoken: neere and close
trialls of sincerity, drive hypocrites into Apostasy; from <hi>his</hi> Christ takes away
this scruple <hi>v 63. it is</hi> (saith he) <hi>the spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth nothing:</hi>
It is by the Indwelling of the quickning Spirit, whereby we have a reall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of Christ, whereby he <hi>dwelleth in us,</hi> and <hi>we in him;</hi> So,</p>
            <p>3. He prayes for his Disciples <hi>Ioh. 17. 21. that they may be one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> 
               <hi>as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in him, and he in the Father, that they may be one in the Father and Sonne,</hi>
and v. 22. <hi>let them be one, even as we are one;</hi> And that yee may not think
that it is only <hi>union</hi> with, and among themselves, that he presses for, (though
indeed that which gives them <hi>Union</hi> with Christ, gives them <hi>Union</hi> one with
another also, and that which constitutes them of the <hi>Body,</hi> unites them to the
<hi>Head,</hi> &amp; there is one <hi>Body,</hi> because, there is one <hi>Spirit Eph.</hi> 4. 4. which even <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>
himselfe had some notion of, in his Assertion, that <hi>Charity,</hi> which is in us,
is the person of the Holy Ghost, from that place of the Apostle <hi>God is Love;</hi>) I
say, he farther manifests, that it is Union with himselfe, which he intends <hi>v.</hi>
23. <hi>I in them</hi> (saith he) <hi>and thou in mee.</hi> This <hi>Union</hi> then with him, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
declares by, or at least illustrates by resemblance, unto his union with
the Father. Whether this be understood of the <hi>Union</hi> of the Divine Persons,
of Father and Sonne, in the Blessed Trinity (the Union I meane, that they
have with themselves, in their distinct Personality; and not their <hi>Unity</hi> of
Essence) or the Union, which was between Father, and <hi>Sonne as Incarnate,</hi> it
comes all to one, as to the Declaration of that Union we have with him: The
Spirit is <hi>Vinculum Trinitatis,</hi> the Bond of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as is commonly, and not
ineptly spoken; proceeding from both the other Persons, being the Love and
Power of them both, he gives that Union to the Trinity of Persons, whose
<hi>substratum</hi> and Ground, is the <hi>inestimable</hi> unity of Essence, wherein they are
one. Or if you take it for the Union of the Father with the Sonne Incarnate,
it is evident and beyond inquiry or dispute, that, as the <hi>Personall Union</hi> of the
<hi>Divine Word,</hi> and the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> was by the <hi>Assumption</hi> of that Nature
into one Personall Substance with it selfe; so the Person of the Father hath no
other union with the Humane Nature of Christ, immediatly, and not by the
Union of his own Nature thereunto, in the Person of his Sonne, but what
consists in that Indwelling of his Spirit, in all fulnesse, in the Man Christ Jesus.
Now saith our Saviour, this Union I desire they may have with mee, by the
dwelling of the same Spirit in me and them, whereby I am in them, and they
in me, as I am <hi>one</hi> with thee O Father.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture sets forth this Union by many <hi>Illustrations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> given unto it
from the things of the neerest Union, that are subject to our apprehension, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the very termes of the things so united, unto Christ and his, in their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I shall name some few of them.</p>
            <p>1. That of <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> making up one Body,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> is often insisted on:
<hi>Christ is the Head of his Saints, and they being many are Members of that one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and of one another,</hi> as the Apostle at large 1 <hi>Cor: 12. 12. even as the Body is
one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many,
are one body, so is Christ;</hi> The <hi>body</hi> is one, and the Saints are one Body, yea
one Christ, that is <hi>mysticall.</hi> They then are the <hi>Body:</hi> what part is Christ? He
is the <hi>Head 1 Cor. 11. 3. the Head of every man</hi> (that is, every Believer) <hi>is Christ;
He is the Head of the Church, and the Saviour of the Body; Ephes. 5. 23. he is the
Head of the Body the Church, Col:</hi> 1. 19. This relation of Head and Members
(I say) between Christ and his, holds out the Union that is between them,
which consists in their being so. As the Head and the Members make one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so Christ and his Members make one <hi>mysticall</hi> Christ; Whence then is it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59070:125"/>
that the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> have this their Union, whereby they become one
Body; Wherein doth it consist? Is it that from the Head, the Members do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their influences of life, sence, and guidance, as the Saints do from Christ?
<hi>Eph. 4. 15, 16. They grow up unto him in all things, who is the Head, from whom the
whole body fitly framed together, and compact, by the which every joynt supplieth,
according to the effectuall working in the measure of every part, groweth up to an
holy increase.</hi> So also <hi>Col: 2. 19. holding the Head, from whom the whole body, by
bands and joynts knit together, increaseth with the increase of God;</hi> But evidently
this is their <hi>Communion,</hi> whereunto <hi>Union</hi> is supposed. Our Union with Christ
cannot consist in the Communcation of any thing to us, <hi>as Members</hi> from him
<hi>the Head:</hi> but it must be in that which constitutes him &amp; us, in the Relation of
Head and Members; He is our Head, antecedently in order of nature, to any
communication of Grace from him as a Head; and yet not antecedently to
our Union with him; Herein then consists the Union of Head and Members,
that though they are many, and have many Offices, Places, and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
there is but one <hi>living, quickning soule, in Head and Members.</hi> If a man
could be imagined so big, and tall, as that his feet should stand upon the
Earth, and his head reach the starry Heavens, yet having but <hi>one soule,</hi> he is
still but <hi>one man.</hi> As then one living soule makes the naturall Head &amp; Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to be one, one body; so one <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> dwelling in Christ and his
members, gives them their Union, &amp; makes them one Christ, one body. This is
cleare from the 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. As the first man Adam was made a living Soul, so
the last man Adam, is made a quickning Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Of Husband and Wife:</hi> The Union, that is between them, sets out
the Union betwixt Christ and his Saints; There is not any one more frequent
Illustration of it in the Scripture, the Holy Ghost pursuing the allusion in all
the most considerable Concernements of it, and holding it out, as the most
solemne Representation of the Union, that is between Christ and his Church.
<hi>Ephes. 5. 31, 32. For this cause shall a man forsake his Father and Mother, and
cleave to his Wife, and they two shall be one flesh: This is</hi> a <hi>great mystery, but I
speake concerning Christ and the Church.</hi> The transition is eminent from the
Conjugall Relation, that is between man and wife, unto Christ and his
Church. What the Apostle had spoken of the one, he would have understood
of the other. Wherein consists then the Union between man, and wife, which
is chosen by God himselfe to represent the Union between Christ and his
Church? The Holy Ghost informes us, <hi>Gen. 2. 24. They shall be no more twaine,
but one flesh;</hi> This is their union, <hi>they shall be no more twaine, but</hi> (in all mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
care, respect, tendernesse, and love,) <hi>one flesh.</hi> The Rise of this you have
<hi>v.</hi> 23. Because of the bone &amp; flesh of <hi>Adam,</hi> was <hi>Eve,</hi> his helper, made; Hence
are they said to be one flesh. Wherein then, in answer to this, is the Union
between Christ, and his Church? The same Apostle tells us 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17.
<hi>He</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is joyned to an harlot is one flesh, and he that is joyned to the
Lord, is one spirit:</hi> as they are one <hi>flesh,</hi> so these are one <hi>spirit;</hi> and as they are
<hi>one flesh,</hi> because the one was made out of the other; so these are one Spirit,
because the Spirit, which is in Christ, by dwelling in them makes them his
Members; which is their Union.</p>
            <p>3. Of a <hi>Tree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> an <hi>Olive,</hi> a Vine, and its Boughs and <hi>Branches; I am the Vine,</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>yee are the Branches, John 15. 5. Abide in me, and I in you;</hi> As <hi>Tree</hi>
&amp; <hi>Branches,</hi> they have an abiding Union, one with another; Wherein this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
the Apostle sets out under the example of an Olive and his Boughs, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 16, 17. It is in this, that the Branches, and Boughs being ingrafted into the
Tree, they partake of the very same juyce and fatnesse with the Root and
Tree, being nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>shed thereby. There is the same fructifying fatning virtue
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59070:125"/>
in the one, as the other: only with this difference, in the Root and Tree it is
<hi>originally,</hi> in the Boughs by way of <hi>Communication.</hi> And this also is chosen to
set out the Union of Christ, and his. Both he, and they, are partakers of the
same fruit-bearing Spirit; He that dwells in them, dwells in him also: only it
is in him, as to them, <hi>originally,</hi> in them by <hi>Communication</hi> from him. Take a
<hi>Cyon</hi> a graft, a plant, fix it to the Tree with all the art you can, and bind it
on as close as possible, yet tis not united to the Tree, untill the Sappe that is
in the Tree, be communicated to it, which communication states the Union;
Let a man be bound to Christ by all the bonds of profession imaginable, yet
unlesse the Sappe, that is in him, the Holy and Blessed Spirit, be also commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to him, thereis no Union between them. And this is the first thing,
that doth issue and depend upon the <hi>indwelling</hi> of the Spirit in Believers, even
<hi>Union</hi> with Christ: which is a Demonstration of it <hi>a posteriori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Spirit as <hi>indwelling,</hi> gives us <hi>Life and Quickning: God Quickens our
mortall bodyes,</hi> (or us in them) <hi>by his Spirit, that dwells in us, (Rom.</hi> 8. 11.) by
which Spirit Christ also was raised from the dead: and therefore the Apostle
mentioning, in another place, the beginning and carrying on of Faith in us,
he saith, it is <hi>wrought according to the exceeding greatnesse of the power of God,
which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, Ephes.</hi> 1. 8. Now
in this Quickning there are two things.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Actus primus,</hi> or the Life it selfe bestowed.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Operations</hi> of that Life in them, on whom it is bestowed.</p>
            <p>For the first, I shall not positively determine, what it is, nor wherein it doth
consist. This is cleare that by nature <hi>we are dead in trespasses and sinnes.</hi> That
in our Quickning, we have a new Spirituall life communicated to us, and that
from Christ, in whom it is treasured up for that purpose. But what this Life is
it doth not fully appeare, whilst we are here below. All actuall Graces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
flow from it, and are distinct from it, as the Operations of it. I say, in
this sence they flow from it confessedly, as suitable actings are from habits:
though to the actuall exercise of any Grace within, new helpe and assistance
is necessary, in that continuall dependance are we upon the fountaine. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it consists in that, which is called <hi>habituall Grace,</hi> or the gracious suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and disposition of the soule unto Spirituall Operations, may be doubted.
The Apostle tells us, <hi>Christ is our Life. Gol. 3 4. When Christ, who is our Life, shall
appeare.</hi> and <hi>Col. 2. 22. Christ Liveth in me;</hi> Christ liveth in Believers by his
Spirit, as hath been declared; Christ <hi>dwelleth in you,</hi> and <hi>his Spirit dwelleth in
you,</hi> are expressions of the same import and signification. But</p>
            <p>2. God by his Spirit <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do, of his owne good
pleasure.</hi> All vitall actions are from him; it may be said of Graces, and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Operations, as well as Guifts, all these <hi>worketh in us that one and selfe same
Spirit, dividing to every one as he will.</hi> (But this is not now to be insisted
on.)</p>
            <p>3. The Spirit as <hi>indwelling,</hi> gives guidance and direction to them, in
whom he is, as to the way wherein they ought to walke. <hi>Rom: 8, 14. As many
as are lead by the Spirit of God:</hi> The Spirit leades them in whom it is, and <hi>v:</hi> 1.
They are said <hi>to walke after the Spirit:</hi> Now there is a twofold Leading, Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
or direction.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Morall and Extrinsecall,</hi> the leading of a <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Internall and Efficient,</hi> the leading of a <hi>Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these, the one layes forth the <hi>way,</hi> the other <hi>directs,</hi> and carryes along
in it. The first is the <hi>Word,</hi> giving us the <hi>Direction</hi> of a <hi>way,</hi> of a <hi>Rule;</hi> the
latter is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> effectually guiding and leading us in all the paths thereof.
Without this, the other direction will be of no saving use. It may be <hi>line</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59070:126"/>
               <hi>line, precept</hi> upon <hi>precept,</hi> yet men goe backward, and are insnared <hi>David</hi>
notwithstanding the Rule of the Word, yea the Spirit of Prophecy, for the
inditing of more of the mind of God for the use of the Church, when moved
thereunto, yet in one Psalme cryes out four times, <hi>Oh! give me understanding
to keepe thy Commandements,</hi> concluding that hence would be his life, that
therein it lay, <hi>Oh give me</hi> (saith he) <hi>understanding and I shall live, Psal.</hi> 119.
144. so <hi>Paul</hi> bidding <hi>Timothy</hi> consider the Word of the Scripture, that he might
know whence it is, that this will be of use unto him, he addes, <hi>I pray the Lord
give thee understanding in all things 2 Tim:</hi> 2. 7. How this Understanding is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the same Apostles informes us. <hi>Eph. 1. 17, 18. The God of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of Glory, give unto us the Spirit of Wisdome, &amp; Revelation in the
knowledge of him, the eyes of our understandings being thereby inlightned.</hi> It is
the <hi>Spirit of Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> the Holy Spirit of God, from whom is all
Spirituall Wisdome and all Revelation of the will of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> who being given
unto us, by the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our God in him, <hi>inlightens
our understandings,</hi> that we may know &amp;c. And on this account is the Sonne
of God said to come and give us an <hi>Vnderstanding to know him that is true:</hi>
that is, himselfe by his Spirit, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
            <p>Now there be two wayes,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> whereby the Spirit gives us <hi>Guidance,</hi> to walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rule of the Word.</p>
            <p>1. By giving us <hi>the knowledge of the will of God, in all Wisdome and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Vnderstanding. Col.</hi> 1. 9. carrying us on <hi>unto all Riches of the full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Vnderstanding, to the acknowledgment of God, and of the Father, and of
Christ, Cap.</hi> 2. 2. This is that Spirituall, Habituall, Saving <hi>Illumination,</hi> which he
gives to the Soules of them, to whom he is given: <hi>He, who commanded light to
shine out of darkenesse,</hi> by him, <hi>shining into their minds, to give them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Glory in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6. This is else where ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>translating from darknesse to light: opening blind eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>giving light to them
that are in darknesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> freeing us from the Condition of <hi>naturall men,</hi> who <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
not the things that are of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note> This the Apostle makes his designe to cleare
up and manifest 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. He tells you,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18.</note> the things of the Gospell are the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
of God in a <hi>mystery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>even the hidden Wisdome, which God ordained before
the world, unto our glory, v.</hi> 7. And then proves that an acquaintance herewith,
is not to be attained by any naturall meanes or abilityes whatsoever: <hi>v:</hi> 9.
<hi>Eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man,
the things which God hath prepared for those that Love him:</hi> And thence unto
the end of the Chapter, variously manifests, how this is given to Believers, and
wrought in them by the Spirit alone; from whom it is, that they know the
mind of Christ; <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>God hath revealed them unto us, by his Spirit, for
the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deepe things of God: for who knoweth the
things of a man, but the spirit of a man? &amp; who knoweth the things of God but the
Spirit of God? and we have received the Spirit, not of this world, but the Spirit
which is of God, that we may know the things which are freely given us of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word is as the <hi>way</hi> whereby we goe: yea an externall Light,<note place="margin">Ps. 119. 119.</note> as a <hi>light
to our feet, and as a Lanthorne to our paths;</hi> yea as the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the firmament,
sending forth its beames of light abundantly. But what will this profit, if a
man have no Eyes in his head? There must not only be light in the <hi>object,</hi> and
in the <hi>medium,</hi> but in the <hi>subject,</hi> in our Hearts and Minds: And this is of the
operation of the Spirit of <hi>Light and Truth</hi> given to us, as the Apostle tells us,
2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. we all with open face beholding the Glory of God as in a glasse, are
changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the first way, whereby the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, gives Guidance
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59070:126"/>
and direction: fundamentally, habitually, he enlightens our mindes, gives us
<hi>eyes, understandings, shines into us,</hi> translates us from darknesse into marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Light, whereby alone we are able to see our way, to know our paths,
and to discerne the things of God: without this, <hi>men are blind, and see nothing
a farre off 2 Pet:</hi> 2. 9.</p>
            <p>There are three things,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> which men either have, or may be made partakers
of without this, this communication of Light, by the Indwelling Spirit.</p>
            <p>1. They have the <hi>Subject</hi> of knowledge, a naturall faculty of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
their mindes remaine, though depraved, destroyed, perverted; yea so
farre that <hi>their eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 6. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and the light that is in them is darknesse;</hi> yet the faculty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
still.</p>
            <p>2. They may have the <hi>Object,</hi> or Truth revealed in the word; This is
common to all, that are made partakers of the good Word of God; that is, to
whom 'tis Preached and delivered, as it is to many, whom it <hi>doth not profit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not mixt with Faith. Heb:</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>3. The way and meanes of Communicating the truth so revealed to their
minds or understandings, which is the <hi>Litterall, Grammaticall, Logicall</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the things contained in the Scriptures, as held out to their Minds and
Apprehensions, in their meditation on them: and this meanes of convayance
of the sence of the Scripture, is plaine, obvious, and cleare, in all necessary
Truths.</p>
            <p>A Concurrence of these three will afford, and yeild them, that have it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their diligence and enquiry, a <hi>Disciplinary</hi> knowledge of the <hi>Litterall</hi>
sence of Scripture, as they have of other things: By this meanes, the Light
<hi>shines</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sends out some beames of light into their darke minds, <hi>but the
darknesse comprehends it not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1. 5.</note> receives not the Light in a spirituall manner:
there is notwithstanding all this, still wanting the work of the Spirit before
mentioned, <hi>creating</hi> and implanting in and upon their understandings and
minds, that Light and power of discerning spirituall things, which before we
insisted on. This the Scripture sometimes calls, the <hi>opening of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Luk:</hi> 24. 45. sometimes the <hi>giving an understanding it selfe, 2 Tim: 2. 7.
1 John.</hi> 5. 20 sometimes, <hi>light in the Lord, Ephes.</hi> 5. 8. Notwithstanding all the
Advantages formerly spoken of, without this men are still <hi>naturall</hi> men, and
<hi>darknesse,</hi> not comprehending, not receiving the things of God: that is, not
<hi>spiritually,</hi> for so the Apostle adds, because they Spiritually discerned. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 14. Receiving Spirituall things, by meere naturall <hi>mediums,</hi> they become
foolishnesse unto them: This is the first thing, that the Spirit dwelling in us,
doth, towards Guidance and Direction: he gives a new Light, and Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
whereby in generall we are inabled to discerne, comprehend, and receive
Spirituall things.</p>
            <p>2. In particular, he Guides and leades men to the embracing particular
Truthes and to the walking in, and up,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> unto them, Christ promised to give
him to us for this end; namely to <hi>lead us into all Truth. John 16. 13. He will guide
us into all Truth;</hi> There is more required to the receiving, entertaining, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
a particular Truth, &amp; rejecting of what is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary unto it, then an habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Illumination: This also is the work of the Spirit that dwells in us; he works
this also in our minds &amp; hearts: therefore the Apostle secures his <hi>little Children</hi>
that they shall be lead into Truth, &amp; preserved fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seduction, on this account,
1 <hi>John 2. 20. You have au Vnction from the holy one</hi> (or, ye have received the
Spirit from the Lord Jesus) <hi>and you shall know all things:</hi> why so? because it is
his worke to Guide and Lead you into all the things, whereof I am a speaking;
And more fully <hi>v: 27. You have received an Vnction from him, that abideth in
you, and you have no need that any teach you, but as the Vnction teacheth you of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59070:127"/>
all things, and is true, and is no lye, and as he hath taught you, abide in him:</hi> It is
received as promised, it doth abide as the Spirit is said to do, and it teacheth,
which is the proper worke of the Spirit in an eminent manner.</p>
            <p>Now this Guidance of Believers by the Spirit,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> as to the particular Truthes,
and actings, consists in his putting forth of a twofold Act of <hi>Light,</hi> and
Power.</p>
            <p>First, Of <hi>Light,</hi> and that also is twofold.</p>
            <p>1. Of <hi>Beauty,</hi> as to the things to be received or done; he represents them
to the soule, as Excellent, Comely, Desirable and Glorious, leading us on in
the receiving of truth, <hi>from Glory to Glory, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 18. He puts upon every
Truth a new <hi>Glory,</hi> making and rendring it desirable to the soule, without
which it cannot be closed withall, as not discovering, either suitablenesse or
proportion unto the minds and hearts of men. And</p>
            <p>2. By some actuall elevation of the minde and understanding to goe
forth unto, and receive into it selfe, the Truth, as represented to it: by both
of them, sending forth <hi>Light and Truth Psal.</hi> 43. 3. blowing of the Cloudes,
and raising up the <hi>day Starre,</hi> that rises in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 19.</note> Of <hi>Power, Isa. 35. 6. The breaking forth of Streames,</hi> makes not
only the blind to see, but the <hi>lame to leape; Strength</hi> comes, as well as <hi>Light,</hi>
by the powring out of the Spirit on us: Strength for the receiving and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all his Gracious discoveries to us: He <hi>leades</hi> us, not only in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
implanting a <hi>saving</hi> Light in the minde, whereby it is disposed and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to discerne Spirituall things, in a Spirituall manner, but also as to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Truths, rendring them Glorious, and Desirable, opening the mind
and Understanding by new beames of Light, he leades the soule irresistably
into the receiving of the truths revealed: which is the second thing we have
by him</p>
            <p>I shall only observe for a close of this,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> one or two Consequences of the
weight of this twofold Operation of the <hi>indwelling</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>1. From the want of the first, or his creating a new light in the minds of
men, it is that so many Labour in the fire, for an acquaintance with the things
of God, It is (I say) a consequence of it, as darknesse is of absence of the Sunne.
Many we see after sundry years spent in considerable labours and diligence,
reading of many bookes, with a contribution of assistance from other usefull
Arts and Sciences,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21, 22</note> in the issue of all their indeavours, <hi>do wax vaine in their
imaginations, having their foolish hearts darkned,</hi> professing themselves wise,
they become fooles, being so farre from any <hi>Sappe,</hi> and savour, that they
have not the <hi>leaves</hi> of ability in things Divine. Others indeed make some
progresse in a <hi>disciplinary</hi> knowledge of Doctrines of the Scriptures, and can
accurately reason and distinguish about them, according to the formes,
wherein they have been exercised, and that to a great height of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their owne spirits, and permanency in the profession they have taken
up. But yet all this while they abide without any effectuall power of the
Truth,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> conforming and framing their spirits unto the <hi>likenesse and mould</hi>
thereof. They doe but see men walking like trees: some shines of the light
breake in upon them which rather amaze, then guides them, they comprehend
it not. They see <hi>Spirituall</hi> things in a <hi>Naturall Light,</hi> and presently forget
what manner of things they were: and in the <hi>species,</hi> wherein they are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12, 13, 14.</note>
they are foolishnesse.</p>
            <p>2. From the want of the <hi>latter,</hi> it is, that <hi>we</hi> our selves are so <hi>slow</hi> in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some partes of Truth, and do find it so difficult to convince <hi>others</hi> of
some other parts of it, which to us are written with the beames of the Sunne.
Unlesse the Truth it selfe be rendred a <hi>Glory</hi> to the understanding, and the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59070:127"/>
mind be actually inlightned, as to the Truth represented, it is not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in a spirituall manner. Those who know at all, what the Truth is, <hi>as the
Truth is in Jesus,</hi> will not take it up upon any other more common account;
Somtimes in dealing with Godly Persons, to convince them of a Truth, we
are ready to admire their Stupidity, or perversenesse, that they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that, which shines in with so broad a Light upon our spirits. The truth
is, untill the Holy Spirit sends forth the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> mentioned, it is
impossible, that their minds and hearts should rest, and acquiesce in any Truth
whatever. But</p>
            <p>4. From this <hi>Indwelling of the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> we have <hi>supportment:</hi> our Hearts are
very ready to sinke and faile under our tryalls: indeed a little thing will cause
us so to do: flesh,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 26.</note> and heart, and all that is within us are soone ready to faile.
Whence is it, that we do not sinke into the deeps? that we have so many and
so sweet, and gracious Recoveries, when we are ready to be swallowed up?
The <hi>Spirit,</hi> that dwells in us, gives us <hi>supportment.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>David,
Psal.</hi> 51. 22. He was ready to be overwhelmed under a sence of the Guilt of
that great sinne, which God then sorely charged upon his Conscience, and
cryes out like a man ready to sinke under water, <hi>Oh uphold me with thy free
Spirit,</hi> if that do not support me, I shall perish: So <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The Spirit helpeth
beares up that Infirmity,</hi> which is ready to make us go double. How often should
we be overborne with our burthens, did not the Spirit put under his Power, to
beare them, and to support us? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> assures himselfe, that he shall be
carried through all his tryalls, by the <hi>helpe supplyed to him by the Spirit. Phil.</hi>
1. 19.</p>
            <p>There are two speciall waies,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> whereby the Spirit communicates <hi>supportment</hi>
unto the Saints when they are ready to sinke, and that upon two accounts.
First of Consolation; and then of Strength.</p>
            <p>1. The first he doth by bringing to mind the things, that Jesus Christ
hath left in store for their supportment. Our Saviour Christ informing his
Disciples, how they should be upheld in their tribulations, tells them, that
the <hi>Comforter, which should dwell with them,</hi> and <hi>was in them, (Ioh:</hi> 14. 16, 17.)
<hi>should bring to remembrance, what he had told them. v.</hi> 26. Christ had said <hi>many</hi>
things, things gracious and heavenly, to his Disciples: He had given them
many <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>pretious Promises,</hi> to uphold their hearts in their greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities;
But knowing full well how ready they were to forget, and to <hi>let
slip the things that were spoken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 1.</note> and how coldly his Promises would come in
to their assistance, when retained only in their naturall faculties, and made
use of by their owne strength; to obviate these evills, tells them, that this
work he committeth to the charge of <hi>another,</hi> who will doe it to the purpose:
When ye are ready to drive away the Comforter (saith he) who is <hi>in you,</hi> he
shall bring <hi>to Remembrance,</hi> &amp; apply to your soules, the things that I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the Promises that I have made, which will then be unto you, as Life
from the dead. And this he doth every day; How often, when the Spirits of
the Saints are ready to faint within them, when straites and perplexities are
round about them, that they know not what to doe, nor whether to apply
themselves for helpe or supportment, doth the Spirit, <hi>that dwelleth in them,</hi>
bring to mind some seasonable, suitable Promise of Christ, that bears them
up quite above their difficulties and distractions, opening such a new spring of
Life and Consolation to their soules, as that they, who but now stooped, yea
were almost bowed to the ground, doe stand upright, and feele no weight or
burthen at all. Often times they goe for <hi>Water to the well,</hi> and are not able
to draw; or if it be powred out upon them, it comes like raine on a stick,
that is fully dry. They seeke to Promises for refreshment, and find no more
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59070:128"/>
savour in them, then in the <hi>white of an Egge:</hi> but when the same Promises are
brought to <hi>remembrance</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Comforter,</hi> who is <hi>with them,</hi> and <hi>in
them,</hi> how full of Life and Power are they?</p>
            <p>2. As this he doth to support Believers,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> in respect of Consolation, so, as to
the <hi>Communion of reall strength,</hi> he stirres up those Graces in them, that are
<hi>strengthning</hi> and <hi>supporting.</hi> The Graces of the Spirit are indeed, all of them
<hi>supporting</hi> and <hi>upholding:</hi> If the Saints fall and sinke at any time, in any duty,
under any tryall, it is because their Graces are decayed, and do draw back, as
to the exercise of them: <hi>If thou faint in the day of Adversity, it is not because thy
Adversaries are great or strong, but because thy strength is small, Prov:</hi> 24. 10.
All our <hi>Fainting</hi> is from the weaknesse of our strength: Faith, Waiting, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
are small: when <hi>Davids</hi> Faith and Patience began to sinke and draw
back,<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 11.</note> he cries <hi>All men are lyars,</hi> I shall one day perish by the hand of mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
When Faith is but <hi>little,</hi> and Grace but <hi>weake,</hi> we shall be forced, if
the Wind do but begin to blow, to cry out, save Lord, or we sinke and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:
let a Temptation, a Lust, a Corruption, lay any Grace a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eepe, and the
strongest Saint will quickly become like <hi>Sampson</hi> with his haire cut, and the
<hi>Philistims</hi> about him; he may think to doe great matters, but at the first try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
he is made a scorne to his enemies; <hi>Peter</hi> thought it was the <hi>greatnesse</hi> of
the <hi>Winds</hi> and waves that terrified him, but our Saviour tells him, it was the
<hi>weaknesse of his Faith</hi> that betrayed him.<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 31. 32.</note> For reliefe in this condition, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that dwells in the Saints, stirres up, enlivens, and actuates all his Graces in
them, that may support, and strengthen them <hi>in</hi> their duties, and <hi>under</hi> their
Tribulations. <hi>Rom: 5. Paul</hi> runs up the influence of Grace into the Saints sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
unto this Fountain. <hi>v. 3. We glory in Tribulation;</hi> this is as high a
pitch, as can be attained: to be patient under <hi>Tribulation,</hi> is no small victory;
to Glory in it, a most eminent Triumph, a conformity to Christ, who in his
Crosse triumphed over all his opposers; we are not only patient under tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and have strength to beare them, but, saith the Apostle, <hi>we glory and
rejoyce in them,</hi> as things very welcome to us; How comes this about? Saith
he, <hi>Tribulation worketh patience;</hi> (that is, it sets it a worke; for Tribulation in it
selfe, will never worke, or beget patience in us) <hi>and Patience Experience, and
Experience Hope, and Hope maketh not ashamed.</hi> It is from hence, that these
Graces, Patience, Hope, Experience, being set on worke, doe beare up, and
support our soules, and raise them to such an height under their pressures,
that we have great cause of rejoycing in them all: Yea but whence is this? Do
these Graces readily come forth, and exert themselves, with an efficacy suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this triumphing frame? The ground &amp; spring of all is discovered <hi>v.</hi> 5.
it is <hi>because the Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, that
is given to us.</hi> From this fountaine do all these fresh streames flow: the Spirit
that is given us, that <hi>sheds abroad the Love of God in our Hearts,</hi> and thereby
sets all our Graces on worke. He oyles the wheeles of the soules obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
when we neither know what to do, nor how to performe what we
know.</p>
            <p>5. This <hi>indwelling Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 27.</note> gives <hi>Restraint: Restraining Grace</hi> doth mainly
consist in morall perswasions, from the Causes, <hi>Circumstances,</hi> and Ends of
things; When a man is disswaded from sinne, upon Considerations taken from
any such head or place, as is apt to prevaile with him, that perswasion so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
and intended of God for that end, is unto him <hi>restraining Grace:</hi> By
this meanes doth the Lord keepe within bounds the most of the Sonnes of
men, notwithstanding all their violent and impetuous lusts; Hell, shame, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternessee,
disappointment on the one hand; Credit, Repute, quietnes of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp; the like, on the other, binde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their good Behaviour. God through
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59070:128"/>
these things, drops an awe upon their Spirits, binding them up from running
out unto that compasse of excesse and ryot in sinning, which otherwise
their lusts would carry them out unto. This is not his way of dealing with
the Saints,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 34.</note> he writes his <hi>Law in their hearts, and puts his feare in their inward
parts,</hi> that they may not depart from him, making them a willing people,
through his owne Power.<note place="margin">Psal. 110. 3.</note> By his effectually remaining Grace, he carryes them
out, kindly, chearefully, willingly, to do his whole will, <hi>working in them to
will and to do, of his owne good pleasure:</hi> yet notwithstanding all this, often
times, through the strength of Temptation, the subtilty of Sathan, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
to improve all Advantages to the utmost, the treachery and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of indwelling sinne, and corruption, they are carryed beyond the
bounds and lines of that principle, or Law of Life and Love, whereby they
are lead. What now doth the Lord do? They are ready to runne quite out
of the pasture of Christ; doth he let them goe, and give them up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
Nay, but he sets an <hi>hedge</hi> about them, that they shall not find their
way. He leades them as the <hi>wild Asse in her month,</hi> that they may be found:
he puts a <hi>Restraint</hi> upon their Spirits, by setting home some sad considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the evil of their hearts and wayes, whether they are going, what they
are doing, and what shall be Issue of their walking so loosly. Even in this life,
what shame, what scandall, what dishonour to themselves, their profession, the
Gospell, their Brethren, it would prove, and so hampers them, quiets their,
Spirits, and gently brings them againe under obedience unto that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Love, that is in them, and the Spirit of Grace (whose yoake they
were casting off,) whereby they are lead. Many times then, even the
Saints of God are kept from sinnes, especially outward, actuall sinnes,
upon such outward motives, reasonings, and considerations, as other
men are: <hi>Peter</hi> was broken loose, and running downe hill apace, <hi>denying</hi>
and forswearing his Master; Christ puts a restraint upon his Spirit
by a looke toward him: this mindes him of his folly, unkindnesse, his former
rash confidence, and ingagement to dye with his Master, and sets him on such
Considerations, as stirred up the principle of Grace in him, to take its place
and rule againe: and in obedience thereunto, he not only desists from any
farther denyall, but Faith, Repentance, Love, all exerting themselves, he
goes <hi>out, and wept bitterly:</hi> It is so frequently with the Saints of God, though
in lesser evills: by neglect and omission of duty, or inclination to evill, and
closing with temptations, they breake out of the pure and perfect Rule
and Guidance of the Spirit, <hi>whereby they ought to be lead:</hi> instantly some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
or other are pressed on upon their Spirits, taken perhaps from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, which recovers them to that obedientiall frame, from whence,
through violence of Corruption, and Temptation, they had broken. Like an
<hi>Hawke</hi> sitting on a mans hand, eating her meat in quietnesse, is suddenly, by
the originall wildnesse of her nature, carryed out to an attempt of flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with speed, but is checkt by the string at her heeles, upon which shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
to her meat againe. We have an innate wildnesse in us, provoking
and stirring us up to runne from God. Were we not recovered by some clog
fastned on us for our <hi>Restraint,</hi> we should often runne into the most desperate
paths. And this <hi>Restraint</hi> (I say) is from the <hi>indwelling Spirit;</hi> He stirrs up one
thing or other, to smite the Hearts &amp; Conscience, when it is under the Power
of any Temptation to sinne and folly. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> in the Attempt he
made upon <hi>Saul,</hi> when he cut of <hi>the lappe of his Garment;</hi> Temptation, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
had almost turned him loose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under the power of Faith, waiting,
and dependance on God, wherein lay the generall frame of his Spirit: he is
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59070:129"/>
recovered to it by a blow upon the heart, from some dismall Consideration of
the Issue, and scandall of that which he was about.</p>
            <p>6. We have hereby also <hi>the Renewall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 28.</note> daily <hi>Renewall of sanctifying Grace;</hi>
Inherent Grace is a thing in its owne nature, apt to decay and dye; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to things <hi>ready to dye. Rev. 3. 2. strengthen the things that remaine,</hi> (saith
Christ to the Church of <hi>Sardis) that are ready to dye.</hi> It is a thing, that may wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and decline from its vigor, and the soule may thereby be betrayed into
manifold weaknesses and backslidings. It is not meerely from the nature of
the <hi>Trees</hi> in the Garden of God, that their <hi>fruit</hi> failes not, nor their <hi>leaves wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 1. 4.</note> but from their <hi>Planting by the Rivers of water;</hi> Hence are the <hi>sicknesses,
weaknesses,</hi> and decayes of the Spirit, mentioned in the Scripture. Should he,
who had the richest stock of any living, be left to spend of it, without new
supplies, he would quickly be a Bankrupt; This also is prevented by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
Spirit.</hi> He is the <hi>fatnesse of the Olive,</hi> that is communicated to the
<hi>branches,</hi> continually to keep them fruitfull and flourishing: He is that <hi>golden
Oyle,</hi> which passes through the <hi>Branches,</hi> and empties it selfe in the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Church. He continually fills our Lamps with new Oyle, and puts
new vigor into our spirits. <hi>Psal. 92. 10. thou liftest up my horne, as the horne of
an Vnicorne, I am anoynted with fresh oyle,</hi> or renewed supplies of the Spirit.
And this <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 5. is called <hi>a renewing of Youth like the Eagles;</hi> a Recovery
of former strength and vigor, new power and ability for new duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;
And how comes that about? saith the Psalmist, it is by Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
my mouth with good things: <hi>he satisfyed his mouth with good things;</hi>
or answered his prayers: What these <hi>good things</hi> are, which the Saints pray
for, and wherewith their mouthes are satisfied, our Saviour tells us; <hi>your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
(saith he) <hi>knoweth how to give good things to them that aske them of him;</hi>
which expressing in another place, he saith, <hi>your Father will give the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to them that aske him of him;</hi> He is given us, and he renewes our <hi>strength as
the Eagles,</hi> making our soules which were ready to languish, prompt, ready,
cheerefull, strong in the wayes of God; To this purpose is that Prayer of the
Spouse. <hi>Cant. 4. 6. Awake O North wind, and come thou South, and blow upon my
Garden, that the savour of my spices may flow out; let my beloved come into his
Garden, that he may eate of the fruit of his precious things;</hi> Shee is sensible of the
<hi>withering</hi> of her Spices, the decayes of her Graces, and her disability there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
to give any suitable entertainment unto Jesus Christ; Hence is her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse
for new breathings, and operations of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Grace, to renew,
and revive, and set on worke againe her Graces in her, which, without it, could
not be done; All Graces are the fruits of the Spirit. <hi>Gal. 5. 25, 26. The fruit of
the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Kindnesse, Goodnesse, Faith, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse,
Temperance;</hi> if the Root doe not communicate fresh juyce and sappe
continually, the fruit will quickly wither; were there not a continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of new life, and freshnesse unto our Graces, from the Indwelling
Spirit, we should soone be poore withered Branches: this our Saviour tells us,
<hi>Ioh. 15. 4, 5. abide in mee and I in you: as the branches cannot bring forth fruit of
themselves, unlesse they remaine in the Vine, no more can yee, unlesse ye abide in
mee; I am the Vine, yee are the Branches: he who abideth in mee, and I in him, he
bringeth forth much fruit, for separate from mee ye can doe nothing.</hi> Our <hi>Abiding</hi>
in Christ, and his in us, is (as was declared) by the <hi>Indwelling</hi> of the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in him and us. Hence, saith Christ, have you all your fruit-bearing vertue,
and unlesse that be continued to us, we shall wither and consume to nothing;
<hi>David</hi> in his spiritually declined condition, intangled under the power and
guilt of sinne, cries out for the continuance of the Spirit, and the <hi>restoring</hi> him,
as to those ends and purpose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him. <hi>Ps:</hi> 51. 21, 22. This the Apostle praies earnestly, that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> may
receive Ch. 3. 16, 17. I <hi>bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
he will give unto you, according to the riches of his Glory, that ye may be strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with might, by his spirit in the inward man, that Christ may dwell in your
hearts by Faith, that yee being rooted, and grounded in Love &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>inward
Man</hi> is the same with the <hi>new Creature,</hi> the new principle of Grace in the
Heart; This is apt to be sick, to faint, and decay; the <hi>Apostle</hi> prayes that it
might be strengthened; how is this to be done? how is it to be renewed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
enlivened? It is, saith he, by the mighty power of the Spirit; and
then gives you particular instances in the Graces which flourish and spring
up effectually, upon that strengthening they receive by the might and power
of the Spirit, as of Faith, Love, Knowledge, and Assurance: the increasing and
establishing of all which, is ascribed there unto him. He who bestowes these
Graces <hi>on</hi> us, and workes them <hi>in</hi> us, doth also carry them on unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Were it not for our inflowings from that spring, our <hi>Cisternes</hi> would
quickly be dry, therefore our Saviour tells us, that he, the Spirit, is unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as <hi>Rivers of living water flowing out of their bowels. Ioh:</hi> 7. 38, 39. A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failing fountaine, that continually puts forth living waters of Grace in
us.</p>
            <p>This may a little farther be considered and insisted on, being directly to our
main purpose in hand: It is true indeed, it doth more properly belong unto
that, which I have assigned for the Second Part of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> concerning
the Ground or Principle of the <hi>Saints abiding with God for ever;</hi> but falling
in conveniently in this order, I shall farther presse it from <hi>Ioh. 4. 14. whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
(saith our Saviour) <hi>shall drink of the water, which I shall give unto him, shall
not thirst for ever: but the water which I shall give unto him, shall be in him a
fountain of water, springing up unto eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion of these words is known;<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> they are part of our Saviours <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie</hi>
with the poore <hi>Samaritan Harlot;</hi> having told her that he could give her
another manner of water, and infinitely better then that which she drew out
of <hi>Jacobs</hi> well, (for which the poore Creature did almost contemne him, and
askt him, <hi>whence</hi> he had that water whereof he spake, how he came by it, or
what he made of himselfe: Did he think himselfe a better man then <hi>Iacob</hi> who
dranke of that well, which shee was drawing water out of) to convince her
of the Truth, and reality of his Promise, he compares the water, that he <hi>would</hi>
and <hi>could</hi> give, with that which she drew out of the Well, especially as to one
eminent effect, wherein the water of his Promise did infinitely surmount that
which she so magnifyed; for <hi>v.</hi> 13. he tells her, for <hi>that water in the well,</hi> though
it allayed thirst for a season, yet within a little while she would thirst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and must come thither to draw; but saith he, <hi>whosoever drinketh of the
Water I shall give him, thirsts no more;</hi> and this he proveth from the Condition
of the Water he giveth, it is <hi>a well of Water,</hi> not a drought, not a <hi>Pitcherfull,</hi>
as that thou carryest away, but it is a <hi>Fountaine,</hi> a Well: yea perhaps in it selfe
it is so, a Fountaine or Well, but he that drinkes of it, he hath but one
draught of that water; Nay saith Christ, it shall become a Well <hi>in him,</hi> not <hi>a
Well whereunto he may goe,</hi> but a Well that he shall carry about in him. He
that hath a continuall spring of living water in him, shall doubtlesse have no
occasion of fainting for thirst, any more; This our Saviour amplifies, and
clears up unto her, from the nature and <hi>energy</hi> of this Well of water, it <hi>spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up unto everlasting life;</hi> in these last words instructing the poore sinfull
Creature in the use of the Parable, that he had used with her. Having taken an
occasion to speake to her of <hi>heavenly things,</hi> from the nature of the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that she was engaged in at present; Two or three things may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59070:130"/>
from the words, to give Light unto their tendency to the Confirmation
of the Truth we have under consideration.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> the <hi>Water</hi> here Promised by our Saviour, is the Holy and Blessed
Spirit: this needs no labour to demonstrate. The Spirit himselfe so interprets
it, <hi>John 7. 38, 39. He who believeth on me,</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>as the Scripture saith
rivers of living Water shall flow out of his belly: But this he said of the Spirit, which
they should receive, who believe on him;</hi> that which in one place he calleth <hi>a Well
of Water springing up to Life in us,</hi> is in the other, in equivalent termes, called
<hi>Rivers of living Water, flowing out of our bellies:</hi> And the Holy Ghost tells us,
that he himselfe, the Blessed Spirit, is signified by that expression. Neither is
there any thing bestowed on us, that can be compared to a <hi>spring of water,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
up, increasing, and flowing out abundantly upon its owne account, but
the Spirit only. It is only the Spirit, that is a fountaine of refreshment, from
whence all Grace doth abundantly flow. It is (I say) the Spirit, whereof we
have been speaking, who is procured for us, and bestowed upon us by Jesus
Christ, which, as an everlasting Fountaine, continually supplies us with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
streames of Grace, and fills us a new therewith, when the <hi>Channells</hi>
thereof in our soules are ready to become dry. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, the state and Condition of them, on whom this <hi>living Water</hi>
is bestowed, in reference thereunto, is described. Saith our Saviour, he that
hath this Spirit of Grace, this well of living Water, shall <hi>never thirst.</hi> It is
most <hi>emphatically</hi> exprest by two Negatives, and an Exegeticall additionall
terme for weight and certainty. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he shall never thirst to eternity:</hi>
or as it is exprssed, <hi>John</hi> 6. 25. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he shall never thirst at any time.</hi> There is a
two fold thirst.</p>
            <p>1. There is a thirst <hi>totalis indigentiae</hi> of a whole and intire want, of that
men thirst after: and this is the thirst, that returnes upon men in their naturall
lives: After they have allayed it once with naturall water, they thirst againe,
and their want of water returnes as intire and full, as if they had never
dranke in their lives: Such a <hi>spirituall Thirst</hi> doth God ascribe to wicked
men <hi>Isa. 65. 13. My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry: my servants shall
drinke, but ye shall be Thirsty.</hi> Their <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> is the <hi>totall want of
Grace,</hi> not that they do <hi>desire</hi> it, but that they <hi>have it not.</hi> And this thirst of
<hi>totall want of Grace,</hi> is that, that never shall, nor can befall them, who have
received the Spirit of Grace, as a Well of Water in them. They can never <hi>so</hi>
thirst, as to be returned againe into the Condition, wherein they were, before
they dranke of that Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. There is also a <hi>Thirst of desire, and complacency</hi> of the good Things
thirsted after. In this sence they are pronounced <hi>Blessed,</hi> who <hi>hunger and Thirst
after Righteousnesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> And <hi>Peter</hi> instructs us to grow in this Thirst more and
more, the 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. As new borne babes desire the sincere milke of the Word,
that ye may grow thereby.</hi> The enjoyment of the Spirit doth not take away
this Thirst, but begin it, and increase it: and by this <hi>Thirst,</hi> as one meanes,
are we preserved from that totall want &amp; <hi>indigency,</hi> which shall never againe
befall us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> our Saviour gives the reason, why, and whence it is, that they, who
drinke of this Water, are made partakers of his Spirit, shall <hi>thirst no more,</hi> or
never be brought to the Condition of totall want of Grace, which they were
in, before they received him: because <hi>the water which I shall give them</hi> (saith
he) the Spirit, which I shall bestow upon them, dwelleth in them (as we have
shewed) shall <hi>be a well of Water,</hi> a fountaine of Grace, <hi>springing up in them to
everlasting Life,</hi> continuing and perpetuating the Grace communicated, unto
the full fruition of God in Glory. There are (among others) three eminent
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59070:130"/>
things in this Reason, to confirme us in the faith of the former Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>1.
The condition or nature of the Spirit in Believers. He is a <hi>Well,</hi> a
<hi>Fountain,</hi> a <hi>Spring,</hi> that never can, nor will be dry to Eternity.</p>
            <p>2. The constant <hi>supplyes of Grace</hi> that this Spirit affords them, in whom he
is: He is <hi>Water alwaies springing up:</hi> so that to say he will refresh Saints and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers
with his Grace, provided that they turne not <hi>profligately wicked,</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
to contradict our Saviour Christ, with as direct opposition to the design
in the words, as can be imagined. This springing up of Grace, which from
him is had and received, which is his worke in us, is that, whereunto this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
wickednesse</hi> is opposed: and whilst <hi>that is, this</hi> cannot be. There is an
everlasting inconsistency be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ween profligate wickednesse, and a never failing
spring of Grace.</p>
            <p>3. His <hi>Permanency</hi> in this worke and efficacy by it; this living Water
springs up to <hi>everlasting Life:</hi> He ceases not, untill our Spirituall Life be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated
in Eternity. This then is the summe of this Promise of our Saviour;
He gives his holy Spirit to his, who lives in them, and gives them such conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
supplies of Grace, that they shall never come to a totall want of it; as
they doe of <hi>Elementary Water,</hi> who have once dranke thereof. And from this
spring doth this Argument flow. They on whom the Spirit is bestowed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
with them for ever, and to whom he constantly yeildes such supplyes of
Grace, as that they shall never be reduced to a totall want for ever, they shall
certainely and infallibly persevere: but that this is the Condition of all that
come to Christ by Believing, or that Christ hath promised, that so it
shall be with them, is cleare from his owne Testimony now insisted on:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto their Argument from the Promise of our Saviour,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
an Answer, Ch. 11. Sect: 10. 11. 12. pag. 232. 233. and in the Preface
of it tells us, <hi>that this Scripture doth but face (if so much) the businesse in hand;</hi>
To <hi>face</hi> it I suppose, is to appeare at first view in its defence; and this indeed
cannot well or colourably be denied, the words of it punctually expressing the
very Truth we intend to prove thereby: And this notwithstanding the allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
qualification (if so much) must needs somewhat prejudice the ensuing
evasions; But we are yet farther confident, that upon the more diligent and
strict examination, it will be found, to speake to the very heart and soule of
the businesse in hand: and the Considerations of his Reasons to the contrary,
doth seeme only to give us farther <hi>light</hi> herein, and <hi>assurance</hi> hereof. He saies
then,</p>
            <p>Here is no Promise made, that they who once believe, how unworthily soever they
shall behave themselves, shall still be preserved by the Spirit of God, or the Spirit of
God in Believing, or that they shall be necessitated alwaies to Believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the old play still: It is not at all our intendment, to produce
any Promise of safe-guarding men in the Love of God, how <hi>vile soever they
may prove,</hi> but of preserving them from all such unworthinesse, as should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them utterly uncapable thereof: And this is plainly here asserted, in the
Assurance given of the <hi>perpetuall residence</hi> of the Spirit in them, with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<hi>supplies</hi> of Grace from him, as shall certainly preserve them from any
such state or condition as is imagined: Of being <hi>necessitated to Believe,</hi> I have
spoken formerly. The expression is neither <hi>used</hi> by us, nor <hi>proper</hi> to the thing
it selfe, about which it is used, nor <hi>knowne</hi> in the Scripture as to this purpose,
and therefore we justly reject it, as to its signifying any thing of the <hi>way</hi> and
<hi>manner,</hi> whereby we are preserved by the power of God, through faith unto
Salvation. If it denotes only the <hi>certainly,</hi> and infallibility of the <hi>event,</hi> as the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59070:131"/>
               <hi>phrase</hi> or <hi>locution</hi> is improper, so to deny, that there is a Promise of our being
preserved, by the Spirit of God in believing, is not to Answer our Argument,
but to beg the thing in Question, yea to deny the positive assertion of the
Lord Christ: But if there be not such a Promise in the words, what then is in
them, what doe they containe? Saith he,</p>
            <p>2. They are only a Declaration and Assertion made by Christ, of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and desireablenesse of that life, which he comes to give unto the World, above
the life of nature, which is common unto all; This, by comparing the words with
those in the former verse, is evident: whosoever Drinketh of this water, shall thirst
againe; but whosoever Drinketh of the water, that I shall give him &amp;c. that is, the
best meanes, that can be had and enjoyed, to render this present life free from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
will not effect it: but whosoever shall Drinke, Injoy, Receive, and
Believe the Doctrine, which I shall administer unto him, shall hereby be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of such a life, which shall within a short time, if men be carefull in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
to preserve it, by reason of the nature, and perfect condition, and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, be exempt from all sorrow, trouble, and inconvenience whatsoever, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eternall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That these words are only an Assertion of the excellency and
desireablenesse of that eternall life, which Christ would give, above the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that the Woman sued to sustaine, and that this appears from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
is said indeed, but no more. It is true, our Saviour doth divert the
thoughts of the Woman, from the naturall life, and care for provision about
it, with an insinuation of a better life to be attained: but is this all he doth, or
is this the intendment of the words under consideration? Doth not the maine
of the opposition, or difference which at present he speakes unto, lye in the
<hi>supplies,</hi> that are given for the two kinds of Life, whereof he speakes? The <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
he tells her, which she drew from that Well, by which he fate, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of her naturall life, was such, that after her drinking of it, she should
quickly returne to the same Condition of thirst, as formerly before she
drank of it; But that which he gave, was such, as that who ever drank of it,
should thirst no more, but be certainely preserved in, and unto the full
fruition of that Life, whereof it is the meanes and supply. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is not between the lives continued, but the meane of consolation, and
its efficacy.</p>
            <p>2. It is not the Condition of the Life naturall, which is subject to dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; not capable of perfection, that is the Reason why they thirst again &amp;
againe that have Water naturall for the refreshment thereof. But 'tis the nature
of the <hi>meanes</hi> it selfe, which is supplyed, that is not fitted nor suited to perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
&amp; abiding usefullnesse, (as the Water, which Christ Promises, is,) that
he insists on. There is not any thing leades us to suppose, that it is the <hi>Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of Life, and not the <hi>Condition</hi> of the meanes of naturall life, that is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
intended in the instituted Comparison: though the frailty, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingnesse
of that <hi>life</hi> also, be afterwards intimated, in the substitution of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life unto the thoughts of the poore woman, in the Roome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>3.
(I say that) it is not the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> but his <hi>Spirit</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
that he is here said to give as Water: and that this is not promised to
make men partakers of Eternall Life, <hi>if in the interim they be carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it;</hi> but to preserve them to it, and to give them that <hi>Care,</hi> which, as a
Grace, is needfull thereunto. The plaine intendment of the Promise is, that
by the water they drinke they shall be kept and preserved in the Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are made partakers, unto the fulnesse and perfection of it; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
by the parenthesis (<hi>if any be carefull in the interim to preserve it</hi>) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59070:131"/>
taken away from the Spirit that Christ promiseth, and assigned to mens
owne care, even in contradistinction to all the benefits, which they receive
by him, being so bestowed on them. The difference then here between
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> is this; Christ saith, <hi>the Water that he shall give,
will be a well springing up to Everlasting Life;</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> That it is the <hi>Care of
men to preserve themselves, that produces that Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The present exemption, which we have by the Waters of Christs gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
is not from sorrow and trouble, but from thirst: that is, from what is
opposed unto, and is destructive of that Life, which he also gives: as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
thirst is unto naturall life. But of this thirst, and our exemption from it, I
have spoken before. It is not then the nature and condition of the <hi>Life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
that he points unto, no farther then as it is coincident with the meanes of
it, here spoken of. Indeed this <hi>meanes of life,</hi> is our life, as to the inchoation
of it here below, and its daily growing up unto perfection. But he adds
<hi>Sect.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>1. That he doth not oppose that Life, which accrues unto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by drinking that Water
which he gives the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> unto the naturall life, which they live, by other means, in respect
of the present Condition, or Constitution of it, or as it is enjoyed by men in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world, is evident from hence, because he asserts it free from thirst, (shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thirst,). Now we know that the Saints themselves, notwithstanding that life of
Grace, which is in them, by drinking that Water that Christ hath given them, are
yet subject to both kinds of Thirst, as well that which is corporeall or naturall, as
that which is Spirituall; yea the Spirituall Thirst, unto which they are now subject,
though it argues a deficiency of what they would farther have, or desire to be; and
in that respect, is troublesome, yet is it Argumentative of the goodnesse of their
Condition. Mat. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans,</hi> 1. The summe of this Answer is; <hi>that the Life here spoken of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
is not that Spirituall life, whereof we are here made partakers, but eternall
life, which is for to come, which, when any attaine, they shall never faile in, or fall
from; but whether they may or shall attaine it or no, here is nothing spoken.</hi> But
here is no notice taken, of the maine opposition insisted on by our Saviour,
between the supplies of the Spirit for life Eternall, which faile not, nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
them to <hi>thirst,</hi> to whom they are given, and the supplies of naturall life,
by Elementary water, notwithstanding which, they, who are made partakers
thereof, doe in a short season, come to a totall want of it againe. Instead of
Answers to our <hi>Argument</hi> from this place, we meet with nothing but perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
diversions from the whole scope and intendment of it, and at last are told,
that the Promise signifies only, that men should not want Grace, when they
come to Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. To prove that there is no Promise of any abiding spirituall Life <hi>here,</hi>
those words <hi>they shall never thirst,</hi> are produced; That we shall have our
life continued to the full injoyment of it unto eternity, because such are the
supplies of the Spirit bestowed on us, that we shall never thirst, is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Saviour: That there is no such life promised, or here to be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
because in it we shall not thirst, is Mr <hi>Goodwins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is not the intendment of our Saviour, to prove that we shall not
<hi>thirst,</hi> because we shall have such a life; but the quite contrary, that we shall
have such a life, and shall assuredly be preserved, because the supplies of the
Spirit which he gives, will certainly take away the thirst, which is so opposite
to it, as to be destructive of it.</p>
            <p>4. It is true, the Saints notwithstanding this Promise, are still liable to
<hi>Thirst,</hi> that <hi>Thirst</hi> intimated <hi>Mat. 5.6. after Righteousnesse;</hi> but not at all to
that Thirst, which they have a Promise here to be freed from; a Thirst of an
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59070:132"/>
universall want of that water, wherewith they are refreshed; and that their
freedome from this <hi>Thirst,</hi> is their portion in this life, we have the Testimony
of Christ himselfe, <hi>he that believes on mee, shall thirst no more. Ioh.</hi> 6. 35. And the
reason of their <hi>not Thirsting,</hi> is the receiving, and drinking in that water, which
Christ gives them, which, as himselfe saies, is <hi>his Spirit, which they receive who
believe on him. Ioh.</hi> 7. 38, 39. neither is that Thirst of theirs, which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
<hi>troublesome,</hi> as is insinuated, it being a grace of the Spirit, and so quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and composing; Though they are troubled for the want of that in its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which they <hi>Thirst</hi> after, yet their Thirst is no way troublesome: That
then which is farther added by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> is exceeding sophisticall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saith he,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 34.</note> by the way, this spirituall thirst, which is incident unto the life which
is derived from Christ, and the waters given by him unto men, as 'tis enjoyed and
possessed by them in this present World, is (according to the purport of our Saviour's
own arguing) an Argument, that for the present, and whilest it is obnoxious to
such a thirst, it is dissolveable and may faile; for in the latter part of the said pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
he plainly implies, that the eternallnesse of that life, which springs from the
drinking of this water, is the reason or cause, why it is exempt from thirst. Let the
whole passage be read and minded, and this will clearly appeare: If then the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
of a life, be the cause or reason, why tis free from the inconveniency of
thirst, Evident it is, that such a life, which is not free from thirst, is not, during
this weaknesse or imperfection of it, eternall, or Priviledged against dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That we cannot thirst under the enjoyment of the Life promised,
proves this life not here to be enjoyed, is proved, because the <hi>eternallnesse of
this life, is the cause of its exemption from Thirst;</hi> But that the plaine contrary
is the intendment of the Holy Ghost, I presume is evident to all men. The
reason of our preservation to Eternall Life, and being carried on thereunto,
is apparently assigned to those supplies of the Spirit, whereby our Thirst is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; The taking away of our Thirst, is the certain <hi>meanes</hi> of our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Life, not a consequent of the Eternity of it. All the proofe of what is
here asserted, is, <hi>Let the whole passage be read, and minded,</hi> in which appeale,
I dare acquiesce before the judgement seat of any Believer in the World,
whose concernment this is. It is here then supposed, that the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the
Life promised, is the cause of their not <hi>thirsting,</hi> in whom it is, which is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi>
the Text; and that they may thirst againe (in the sence spoken of) who
drink of that water of the Spirit, which Christ gives, which is <hi>contrary</hi> unto it:
and of these two supposalls, is this part of this discourse composed.</p>
            <p>The ensuing Discourse, rendring a reason upon the account whereof, Life
may be called eternall, though it be interrupted and cut off, we shall have
farther time, God assisting, to consider, and to declare its utter inconsistency
with the intendment of the Holy Ghost in the expressions now before us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He addes then in the last place Sect.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> That the intendment of Christ is not,
that the water he gives, shall alway end in the issue of Eternall Life, but that it
lies in a tendency thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Which, upon the matter, is all one, as if he had said, <hi>Christ saith indeed,
that the water which he gives, shall spring up unto Everlasting Life, and wholly
remove that Thirst, which is comprehensive of all interveniences, that might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it,</hi> (as God said to <hi>Adam,</hi> In the day thou eatest of that fruit, thou shalt
dye) <hi>but he knew full well, that it might otherwise come to passe:</hi> which, whether
it doth not amount to a calling of his Truth, and credit in his Word and
Promises, into question, deserves (as I suppose) Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
To conclude then, our Saviour hath assured us, that the Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wich he gives us, shall take away <hi>such Thirst,</hi> all such totall want of Grace
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59070:132"/>
and Spirit, (be it to be brought about, not by this or that meanes, but by
what meanes soever) as should cause us to come short of eternall life with
himselfe, which we shall look upon, as a Promise of the Saints Perseverance in
Faith, notwithstanding all the <hi>Exceptions,</hi> which as yet to the contrary hath
been produced.</p>
            <p>Having thus long insisted on this influence of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> into
the continuance of the Love and Favour of God unto Believers, by procuring
the Spirit for them, sending him to them, to <hi>dwell in them,</hi> and abide with
them for ever, (the most effectuall principle of their continuance with God)
give me leave farther to confirme the Truth of what hath been spoken, by
remarking some <hi>inferences,</hi> which the Scripture holds out unto us, upon a
supposition of those Assertions, which we have laid downe concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
of the Spirit,</hi> and the Assistance which we receive from him on that
account, all tending to the end and purpose we have in hand. As,</p>
            <p>1. First,<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> because <hi>the Spirit dwells in us,</hi> we are therefore to consider, and
dispose of our persons, as <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> that is, of this <hi>Indwelling</hi>
Spirit: the Scripture manifesting hereby, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Indwelling
of the Spirit,</hi> is not only a Truth, but a very usefull Truth, being made the
Fountaine of, and the inforcement unto so great a duty. He <hi>dwells</hi> in us, and
we are to look well to his <hi>habitation;</hi> our Saviour tells us, that when the evill
Spirit finds his <hi>dwelling swept and garnished,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.44.</note> he instantly takes possession, and
brings company with him: he will not be absent from it, when 'tis fitted for
his turne. In reference to the Saints, and their <hi>holy Indweller,</hi> this the Apostle
urgeth. 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. Your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, which dwells
in you,</hi> whence he concludes, <hi>whose ye are, not your owne,</hi> and therefore ought
to <hi>glorify God in your Bodies;</hi> From hence is the strength of his Argument, for
the avoiding of all uncleannesse. v. 16. 17. <hi>Know ye not that he who is joyned to
an Harlot, is one body? he who is joyned to the Lord is one spirit: flye Fornication,
know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost?</hi> On this account also
doth he presse to universall holinesse. 1 <hi>Cor: 3. 16. 17. Know ye not that ye are
the Temples of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? if any man desile
the Temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the Temple of God is holy, which
Temple ye are.</hi> In v. 12. 13. 14. the Apostle discovers the fruitlesnesse of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>hay and stubble,</hi> light and unsound Doctrines or practises, upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Faith in Jesus Christ once laid, and tells us, that all such things shall
<hi>burne and suffer losse,</hi> and put the contrivers and workers of them to no small
difficulty, in escaping like men, when the Garments they are cloathed withall,
are on fire about them. On the account of this sad event, of foolish and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
walking, he presses v.16. as was said, earnestly to universall Holinesse,
laying downe as the great motive thereunto, that which we have insisted on,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Indwelling of the Holy Spirit in us: know ye not that ye are the Temple of
God?</hi> The <hi>Temple,</hi> wherein God of old did dwell, was built with <hi>hewen stone,
Cedar, Wood,</hi> and overlaid with <hi>pure Gold;</hi> and will ye now, who are the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<hi>Temple</hi> of God, build up your Soules with <hi>hay,</hi> and <hi>stubble?</hi> Which he
furthers, by that dreadfull commination taken from the zeale of God for the
purity of his <hi>Temple;</hi> so that on each hand, he doth presse to the universall
close keeping of our Hearts in all <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and purity, because of the <hi>Indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Holy Spirit. And indeed, where ever we are said to be <hi>Temples</hi> of
God, or an <hi>Habitation</hi> for him, as it still relates to this cause of the Expression
which we now insist upon, so there is ever some intimation of Holinesse, to be
pursued on that account. <hi>Eph: 2. 21. 22. In whom the whole building fitly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
together, for an habitation of God through the Spirit; being made an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59070:133"/>
of the Lord,</hi> by the Spirits Indwelling in us, we grow up, or thrive in grace,
into an Holy Temple to the Lord, to be a more compleate and well furnished
<hi>Habitation</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>This then is that which I say: The Truth of what hath formerly been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
concerning the manner of the Spirits abode with us, being procured
for us by Jesus Christ, is farther cleared by this inference, that the Scripture
makes thereof. The <hi>Saints</hi> are exhorted with all diligence to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a fit <hi>Habitation</hi> for him, that they may not be uncleane and defiled
lodgings for the Spirit of purity and Holinesse. This is, and this is to be, their
daily Labour, and indeavour; that vaine thoughts, unruly passions, corrupt
lusts, may not take up any Roome in their bosome; that they put not such
unwelcome and unsavory inmates upon the Spirit of Grace; that sinne
may not <hi>dwell,</hi> where God <hi>dwells.</hi> On this ground they may plead with their
owne Souls, and say; Hath the Lord chosen my poore heart, for his <hi>Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
Hath he said, I delight in it, and there will I dwell for ever? Hath he
forsaken that goodly and stately Materiall Temple, whereunto he gave his
speciall presence of old, to take up his abode, in a farre more eminent way,
in a poore sinfull soule? Doth that Holy Spirit, which dwells in Jesus Christ,
who was <hi>Holy, Blamelesse, Vndefiled, separate from sinners, who did no sinne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
was guile found in his mouth,</hi> dwell also in me, that am in, and of my
selfe wholly corrupted and defiled? And shall I be so foolish, so unthankfull,
as willingly to <hi>defile</hi> the <hi>Habitation,</hi> which he hath chosen? Shall I suffer vaine
Thoughts, foolish Lust, distempered Affections, worldly aimes; to put in
themselves upon him there? He is a Spirit of Grace: can he beare a <hi>Gracelesse</hi>
Corruption to be cherished in his <hi>Dwelling?</hi> He is a Spirit of <hi>Holynesse,</hi> and
shall I harbour in his Lodging a frame of <hi>worldlynesse?</hi> He is a Spirit of Joy,
&amp; Consolation: &amp; shall I fill my bosome with <hi>foolish feares,</hi> and devouring
<hi>Cares?</hi> Would not this be a <hi>griefe</hi> unto him? Would it not provoke the eyes
of his Glory? Can he beare it, that, when he is with me before his face, in his
presence, I should spend my time in giving entertainement to his enemyes? He
is the <hi>high</hi> and the <hi>Holy one,</hi> who dwells in Eternity, and he hath chosen to
inhabit, with me also; Surely I should be more <hi>bruitish</hi> then any man, should
I be carelesse of his <hi>Habitation:</hi> And should not this fill my soule with an
Holy scorne, and indignation against sinne? Shall I debase my soule unto any
vile Lust. which hath this exceeding honour, to be an <hi>Habitation</hi> for the Spirit
of God? Hence, upon a view of any defilement of Lust, or passion, nothing
troubles the Saints more, nor fills them with more <hi>selfe-abhorrence</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of face, then this, that they have rendred their hearts an unsuitable
habitation for the Spirit of God. This makes <hi>David,</hi> upon his sinne, cry so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
that the <hi>Spirit might not depart from him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> being conscious to himselfe,
that he had exceedingly defiled his dwelling place; And were this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
alwayes fresh upon the Spirits of the Saints, were it more constant in
their thoughts, it would keepe them more upon their Guard, that nothing
might breake in, to disquiet their gracious <hi>Indweller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> because be the Spirit we have <hi>guidance and direction,</hi> there
is <hi>Wisdome</hi> given unto us, and we are called to a holy discerning between the
<hi>Directions</hi> of the Spirit of Grace, and the <hi>delusions</hi> of the Spirit of the World,
and the <hi>seduction</hi> of our owne Hearts. Christ gives this <hi>character</hi> of his Sheepe,
that they <hi>know his voice, heare him, and follow him;</hi> but <hi>a stranger they will not
follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John</hi> 10. 25. Christ speakes by his Spirit; in his guidance and direction,
is the voice of the Lord Jesus, <hi>He that hath an eare to heare, let him heare what
the Spirit saith to the Churches Rev.</hi> 2. 29. What Christ saith, as to the <hi>Fountain</hi>
of Revelation, he being the great Prophet of the Church, that the Spirit saith,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59070:133"/>
as to the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the Revelation, unto the Hearts of the Saints. And as
the <hi>Vnction teacheth them,</hi> so do they <hi>abide in Christ, 1 John</hi> 2. 27. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
of the Spirit of the world, either immediatly by himselfe, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by others, are the voice of strangers; between these and the voice of
the Spirit of Christ that dwells in them, the Saints have a Spirit of discerning.
This the Apostle affirmes, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 15. He that is Spirituall, judgeth all things.</hi>
He discerneth between things, and judgeth aright of them. He judgeth <hi>all
things;</hi> that is, all things of that nature whereof he speakes, that is, the <hi>things
which are freely given us of God, v.</hi> 12. for the discerning &amp; knowledge whereof,
the Spirit is given them; <hi>For the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God v.</hi> 11. They know also the suggestions of the Spirit of the world, &amp; judge
them. 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. We are not ignorant of his devices.</hi> There is a twofold know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the depths and devices of Sathan: one with <hi>Approbation,</hi> to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing,
and practice of them: the other with <hi>Condemnation;</hi> to their hatred
and rejection. The first ye have mentioned <hi>Rev. 2. 24. As many as have not
knowne the depths of Sathan, as they speake,</hi> Their Doctrinall <hi>depths,</hi> so they
call them: Of them our Saviour there speakes; New Doctrines were broached
by <hi>Sathan, unintelligible notions;</hi> some pretended to attaine an acquaintance
with them, and boasted, it seemes, in them as very <hi>great and high Attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
They called them <hi>depths, such as poore</hi> ordinary Believers, that contented
themselves with their <hi>low formes,</hi> could not reach unto: Saith Christ, they
<hi>are depths, as they speake:</hi> indeed in themselves nothing at all, things of no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
weight, nor Wisdome: but as managed by <hi>Sathan,</hi> they are <hi>depths</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
such as whereby he destroyes their soules. And as some approve his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall
depths,</hi> so some close with his Practicall depths, and imbrace them.
Men that study his wayes, and paths, becoming desperately wicked, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
fcoffing at Religion, and despising the profession of it; But there is a
knowledge also of the <hi>depths,</hi> and devices of Sathan, leading to <hi>judging,</hi>
condemning, rejecting, and watching against them. The suggestions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
in their infinite variety, their Rise, Progresse, Efficacy, and Advantages,
their various aimes, and tendencyes unto sinne, against Grace, I do not now
consider. But this I say, those who are <hi>lead by the Spirit of God,</hi> who have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
from him, and guidance, they discerne between the voice of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which <hi>dwells in them;</hi> and the voice of the Spirit, which <hi>dwells in the
world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because this is not alwaies to be done,<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> from the <hi>manner</hi> of their
speaking, the <hi>Serpent</hi> counterfeiting the voyce of the <hi>Dove,</hi> and coming on,
not only with earnestnesse and continuance of impulse, but with many faire
and <hi>specious</hi> pretences, making good his impressions, labouring to win the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
over to that, wherewith he inticeth the Affections and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, they use the helpe of such <hi>Considerations</hi> as these insuing, to give
them direction in attending to the voice of that <hi>Guide,</hi> which leades them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the paths of Truth, and to stoppe their eares to the songs of Sathan, which
would transforme them into Monsters of disobedience. Thus they
know.</p>
            <p>1. That all the <hi>motions</hi> of the holy Spirit, whereby they are, and ought
to be lead, are <hi>regular:</hi> that he moves them to nothing, but what is according
to the mind of Christ, delivered in the Word, which he hath appointed for
their <hi>Rule</hi> to walke by; to no duty, but what is <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, and what
he hath <hi>revealed</hi> so to be;<note place="margin">1 John 4. 1.</note> So that, as Believers are to <hi>try the spirits of others,</hi> by
that standard, whether they are of God or no, so because of the subtilty of
Sathan, transforming himselfe into an <hi>Angell of Light,</hi> yea into a <hi>spirit of duty,</hi>
what ever immediate motions and impressions fall upon their Spirits, they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59070:134"/>
try them by the Rule. 'Tis no dishonour to the Holy Spirit, yea it is a great
Honour to have his motions <hi>within us,</hi> tryed by the Word, that he hath given
for a Rule <hi>without us.</hi> Yea when any preached by immediate inspiration, he
commends those,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 10.</note> who examined what they delivered by that which he had
given out before; He doth not now move in us, to give a <hi>new Rule,</hi> but a
new <hi>Light and Power,</hi> as was said before. The <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of the
World,</hi> are for the most part unto things, wherein, though the persons with
whom he deales, may be in the darke or blind, and darkened by him, yet
themselves are <hi>against the Rule,</hi> or besides it, in the whole, or in part, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of some such circumstances, as vitiate the whole performance.</p>
            <p>2. They know that the Commands and motions of the Spirit, which
dwells in them,<note place="margin">1 John 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>are not grievous.</hi> The commands of Christ, for the <hi>matter</hi> of
them,<note place="margin">Mal. 11. 30.</note> are not grievous, his <hi>burthen is light, his yoake easy:</hi> and the manner,
whereby we are carried out to the performance of them, is not <hi>Grievous:
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty. 2. Cor.</hi> 3. 17. It carries out the
soule to duty, in a free, sweet, calme, ingenuous manner. The <hi>motions of the
Spirit of the World,</hi> even unto good things, and duties, (for so, for farther ends
of his, it often falls out that they are) are troublesome, vexatious, perplexing,
grievous, and tumultuating. Sathan <hi>falls like lightning</hi> upon the Soule, and
comes upon the powers of it, as a Tempest: Hence acting in any thing, upon
his closing with, and provoking our convictions, is called a being under the
<hi>Spirit of bondage. Rom:</hi> 8. 15. which is opposed to the Spirit of God, the Spirit of
Adoption, of <hi>Liberty,</hi> boldnesse, power, and <hi>a sound mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They know that all motions of the Spirit whereby they are lead, are
<hi>orderly;</hi> as is Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, <hi>ordered in all things,</hi> so the Spirit of God
carries us out unto every duty, in its own <hi>order</hi> and season; when as we see
some poore soules to be in such bondage, as to be hurried up and downe, in
the matter of duties, at the pleasure of Satan. They must runne from <hi>one</hi> to
<hi>another,</hi> and commonly neglect that which they should doe; When they are
at <hi>Prayer,</hi> then they should be at the <hi>worke of their calling;</hi> and when they are
at their <hi>Calling,</hi> they are tempted, for not laying all aside, and running to <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
Believers know that this is not from the Spirit of God, which makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing beautifull in its season.</p>
            <p>4. They know that all the workings of the Spirit of God, as they are
good, so also they <hi>tend unto a good end.</hi> Doth that stirre them up to close
walking with God? It is that God may be <hi>glorified,</hi> his <hi>Graces</hi> exercised in
them, their <hi>soules</hi> strengthened in obedience, and their progresse in Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
furthered. Doth it assure them of the love of God? It is that they may
be more <hi>humble, thankefull, watchfull?</hi> When all the compliances and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and mens corrupt hearts, even when they compell to good
duties, are for false, evill, and corrupt ends: Duty is prest to pacify Conscience;
Peace is given to make men secure; Gifts are stirred up to tempt to Pride;
and indeed it may easily be observed, that the Divell never doth any work,
but he will quickly come for his Wages. By the help (<hi>I say</hi>) of these and such
like Considerations, the Saints of God, in whom this Spirit doth dwell, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to discerne and know the voyce of their <hi>Leader</hi> and Guide, from the
neerest resemblance of it, that the Spirit, which is in the World, doth, or at any
time can make shew of. And this Indwelling of the Spirit yeelds a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
contribution of strength, toward the confirmation of the maine Theses
undertaken to be proved. Our Adversaries dispute about the removall of <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
habits,</hi> but how <hi>infused habits</hi> may be cast out or expelled, they have not
any tolerable measure been able to declare. If moreover it shall be evinced
as it hath been by plentifull Testimonies of Scripture, that the Holy Ghost
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59070:134"/>
himselfe dwelles in Believers, what way can be fixed on <hi>for his Expulsion:</hi> That
he cannot be removed, but by his own will, <hi>the will of him that sends him,</hi> I
suppose will easily be granted: Whilest he abides with them, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
with God, and in Covenant with him. That God, whilest his Children
are in such a state and condition, <hi>doth take away his Spirit</hi> from them, and give
them up to the power of the Divell, is incumbent on our Adversaries to
prove.</p>
            <p>But to returne at length from this digression. Thus farre have wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in manifesting, upholding, and vindicating that influence, which the
<hi>Oblation</hi> of Christ hath into the preservation of the Saints, in the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God unto the end. His <hi>Intercession</hi> being <hi>Eminently</hi> effectuall also to
the same end and purpose, comes in the next place to be considered.</p>

               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 7.</note> and its effectuall influence into
the perfect, compleate Salvation of Believers, so much hath
been spoken by others, and the whole of the Doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
with so much clearnesse, spirituallnesse and strength, that I
shall not need to adde any thing thereunto. That Christ intercedes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Believers in the Love and Favour of his Father, to the end, is that
which I intend to manifest, and which may (as I suppose) be very easily unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
evinced. Some few Considerations will make way for the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Truth, which is under Consideration, or Confirmation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
of Saints, from the Intercession of Christ.</p>
            <p>First, the Intercession of Christ being his <hi>Appearance for us in the presence of
God (Heb.</hi> 9. 24. He is gon into Heaven,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to make a
<hi>legall Appearance,</hi> for our defence, before the Judgment seat of God; &amp; by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is our <hi>Advocate.</hi> I <hi>John</hi> 2:1. he is said to <hi>save us to the utmost. Heb</hi> 7.
25.) There is certainely some thing, or other, that he puts in for, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59070:135"/>
of them, in whose Cause he appeares and sues, that so he may save them
to the utmost. Now this must be, either, that being, and continuing Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
they may be Saved, or that they may believe and continue Believers
unto Salvation. That the <hi>first</hi> is not the sole import and aime of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Christ, may be manifested, from this double Consideration.</p>
            <p>1. From the nature of the thing it selfe. There is nothing but the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the very Law of the Gospell, (<hi>He that believeth shall be Saved</hi>)
wrapt up in this interpretation of the Intercession of Christ. But this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath Christ any need to intercede for, it being ratified, confirmed, and
declared from the beginning, neither is there, or can there any Opposition be
made against it, to shake, weaken, or disturbe it, in the least: it depending
solely on the Truth and Unchangeablenesse of God, not being vested by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Condition whatsoever, in any other subject: nor would this be availing to
his <hi>Militant</hi> Church, whose preservation he aimes at and intends in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:
For the whole of his desires may be granted him to the uttermost, and
yet his whole Church at any time <hi>militant,</hi> perish for ever. Though not one
soule should continue believing to the end, though the gates of Hell should
prevail against every one, that names the name of Christ in the world, yet that
Truth <hi>He that believeth, shall be Saved,</hi> taken in the sence of our Adversaries,
for a Promise to <hi>Perseverance</hi> in believing, and not a promise to actuall true
Believers, might stand firme for ever. To say then, that this is the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of Christ for his Church, is to say, that in his whole Intercession, he
Interceded not at all for his Church:<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 44.</note> 
               <hi>He is heard in his Intercession,</hi> and he
may be heard to the uttermost in this, and yet his whole Church be so
farre from being <hi>saved to the ut most,</hi> as utterly to be destroyed and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>2. Doubtlesse the Intercession of Christ,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> must answer the Representation
of it, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> so much insists on <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9. Of the Oblation of Christ
there were many Types in the <hi>Aaronicall Priesthood</hi> of the Law: Of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
but one principally; namely, that solemne entrance of the high Priest
<hi>with Blood and Incense</hi> into the <hi>Holyest of Holyes,</hi> in the great Anniversary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
on the tenth day of the seventh month; (on the which day also the
great Jubilee, or Joyfull time of deliverance, typifying our deliverance by
Christ, began:) Here unto is added the <hi>Priesthood of Melchisedec:</hi> whereof
there is mention neither of its beginning, nor ending, to secure us of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of our Mediator in the act of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> for ever. Now the end
of the high Priests so entring into this <hi>Holy place,</hi> was to carry on the work of
Expiation and Attonement, to persection, and compleat peace with God, in
the behalfe of them, for whom he offered, without. And therefore the Holy
Ghost saith, that his entrance with Blood, was, to <hi>offer for himselfe, and the
Errours of the people. Heb.</hi> 9. 7. It being but a continuation of his Oblation began
without, unto a compleat Attonement. And therefore there is no reall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the efficacy of the death of Christ, and that of his Intercession,
upon the actuall Accomplishment of it. It being then the compleate taking
away of the sinnes and Errours of the people, as to the guilt of them, and the
Continuance of their peace with God, which was intended by the high Priests
entrance with blood into the <hi>Holyest of Holyes,</hi> that, which answers thereunto,
or the deliverance of Believers from the whole guilt of sinne, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in the Love and Favour of God, is the intendment of Christ in his
Intercession. Let the Effects and fruits of the Oblation of Christ be bounded
and limited to the procuring of a new way of Salvation, without purchasing
for any one person whatever, power and Grace to walke in that way, and then
exclude his Intercession, from any influence into the preservation of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59070:135"/>
them who do enter that way, therein; and perhaps indifferent men will
scarce thinke the Glory and Honour of the Lord Jesus to be of any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
with us.</p>
            <p>3. That this is the import of Christs Intercession for Believers,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> is evident
by that preface, which we have thereof, <hi>John</hi> 17. being a manifest declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on earth of that, which Christ lives for ever in Heaven to do. This was the
<hi>Incense,</hi> wherewith he entred into the Holy place, which he now prepared and
which was afterwards beaten small, in his <hi>Agony,</hi> that it might be ready to
make a sweet <hi>perfume</hi> at his entrance into Heaven, as he was sprinkled with
his owne <hi>Blood.</hi> That Christ Interceded, and for his Elect, for whom he dyed,
that they may believe, our Adversaries deny; but that he Intercedes for actuall
Believers, hath not hitherto been questioned. What it is, which he requests on
their behalfe, the tenor of that Power of his (<hi>John</hi> 17.) will manifest. <hi>v.</hi> 11.
(saith he) <hi>Holy Father keepe through thine owne name, those whom thou hast given
me, that they may be one as we are; keepe them</hi> from sinne and ruine, every thing
that will hinder them from <hi>union</hi> with me. What is it that our Saviour here
prayes for, &amp; for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he so ingaged? that it is for Believers, as such, for whom
he puts up these supplications, our Adversaryes in the cause in hand, do con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tend.
That these may be kept through the Power of God, unto Unity among
themselves, which they have by their Union with him, is his dying request
for them. He prayes not for any such onenesse, as is consistent with their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from him, and his Fathers Love. Where now shall we fix the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
failure those, who effectually and eventually are kept up to Spirituall
Union, cannot fall out of, nor fall of from (totally nor finally) the Love of
God. Either Christ is not heard in his request, or the Father cannot keepe
them by his Power, if these thus interceeded for, are not preserved. Many
Temptations, many oppositions, great Tribulations without, strong Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
within, they must needs meet withall: these they have no power in
themselves to overcome, nor to resist. Should they be left to themselves, they
would never be able to hold out to the end; Saith Christ, I should loose these
poore Sheep, for whom I have <hi>laid downe my life</hi> to bring them unto thee: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father,</hi> do thou therefore <hi>keepe</hi> and preserve them from all these evills,
that they may not prevaile over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And <hi>keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through thy Nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, thy Power,
(for we are kept through the Power of God unto Salvation,</hi>) let thy Power be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
for their preservation. And what is too strong for thy Power? Who
can take them out of thy hand? Lay that upon them for their defence, shew
it out in their behalfe, that all their enemies may feele the weight, and
strength thereof. <hi>Keepe them through thy Name,</hi> thy Grace, let that be <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for them,</hi> let them have such supplyes of Gospell Grace, and pardoning
Mercy, (concerning which, I manifested thy <hi>Name</hi> unto them <hi>v.</hi> 6. and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
thee a Father) that they may be incouraged to trust in that Name of
thine, and to stay themselves upon thee; where the failure is, doubtlesse is not
easy to manifest. In the verse following our Saviour addes many motives
to make his Intercession prevalent in their behalfe.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>v.</hi> 12. he saith, that according to that Commission, that he had received,
<hi>he had faithfully preserved them, whilst that he was in the world;</hi> and now being
ready to leave them, as to his bodily presence, he urges the speciall
preservation of his Father as needfull, that, after all the Care and Cost,
which he had laid out about them, they might not utterly perish. And
then</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>v.</hi> 13. he urges the necessity, that they should have some Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it in the midst of all their troubles and tryalls, that they may have
Consolation upon their confidence in the words, which Christ had spoken to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59070:136"/>
them, that they should be preserved through all difficulties unto the end.
And he farther urges,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>v.</hi> 14. from the certaine Opposition, that they should meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
<hi>the world hates them,</hi> and will without doubt, use all wayes and meanes
possible, for their ruine and destruction; giving also the Reason, why the
<hi>world hateth them,</hi> and will oppose them, which is such an one, as must needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Heart and Goodwill of God for their preservation, to wit, <hi>because
they receive the Word of his deare Sonne,</hi> and upon that account, left the world,
separated from it, and became its enemyes; and shall they now be left to the
rage and fury of the world in this condition? That be farre from thee: <hi>Holy
Father keepe them.</hi> Hereupon</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>v.</hi> 15. he reneweth his prayer in their behalfe, with a farther
opening of his mind, as to what he had last spoken of. <hi>The world,</hi> the world
being vile, wretched, deceitfull, and set upon Opposition against them, a man
would have thought, that the Lord Jesus should have desired, that his Saints
might be taken out from the midst of this world, and set in a quiet place by
themselves, where they might no more be troubled with the baits and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of it. But this is not that which he requests; he hath another worke
for them to do in the world, they are to <hi>beare witnesse</hi> to him and his Truth,
by their Faith and Obedience, to <hi>convince the wicked unbelieving world;</hi> They
are to Glorifie his name by doing, and suffering for him; so that this is no part
of his request; <hi>I pray not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thou shouldest take them out of the world,
but that they may not be prevailed on, nor conquered by the evill, that is in the
world.</hi> That they may be kept, and preserved from the power of evill, which
would separate them from me, and my Love. This he presseth for, and
this he is heard in; and that, not only for his Apostles and present followers,
but as he tells you <hi>v. 20. for all that should believe on him, to the end of the

            </p>
            <p>The things prayed for, the Reason of his <hi>Intercession,</hi> the opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the accomplishment of the things interceded for, the distinction put
between them for whom he Intercedes, and the perishing world, all delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in plaine and expresse termes, evidently evince the intendment of Christ
in his <hi>Intercession,</hi> evidently to regard the safeguarding of Believers in the
Love and Favour of God, by their continuance in Believing, and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Power of temptations, and oppositions, arising against their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in communion with God.</p>
            <p>The result of what hath been spoken,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> as to its influence into the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Truth under Demonstration, amounts unto thus much. That
which the Lord Jesus Christ as Mediator requesteth, and prayeth for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the Father, according to his mind, in order to the Accomplishment of
the Promises made to him, and Covenant with him (all his desires being
bottomed upon his exact perfect performance of the <hi>whole will of God,</hi> both
in doing and suffering) that shall certainly be accomplisht and brought to
passe; But thus, in this manner, upon these accounts, doth the Lord Jesus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for the Perseverance of Believers, and their Preservation in the Love
of the Father unto the end; therefore they shall undoubtedly be so preserved.
It is confessed, that the Persons Interceded for, are Believers, all Believers,
that then were, or should be to the end of the World, (the efficacy of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi>
having commenced from the foundations thereof) the thing pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for is their Preservation in the state of Union with Christ, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the motives used for the obtaining this request in their behalfe, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the work they have to doe, and the opposition they were to meet
withall, and all the <hi>Saints</hi> being thus put into the hand of God, who shall
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59070:136"/>
take them from thence? On what account is it, that they shall not be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
To say they shall be thus preserved, <hi>in case themselves depart not wilfully
from God,</hi> is to say, <hi>they shall be preserved, in case they preserve themselves,</hi> as will
afterwards be farther manifested.</p>
            <p>This Argument is proposed by the Apostle,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> in the most triumphant assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Truth and Certainty of the inference contained in it, that he any
where useth, in any case whatsoever. <hi>Rom: 8. 33, 34. Who shall lay any thing to
the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth?
It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand
of God, who also maketh Intercession for us:</hi> he laies the immunity of <hi>the</hi> Elect &amp;
justified Persons, from just crimination, or Condemnation, on the foundation
of the Oblation and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ; The first part of this Argument,
from the Oblation of Christ, (<hi>who shall condemne? It is Christ that died</hi>) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
the immunity of Believers from Condemnation, upon the account of
the punishing of all their sinnes in Christ, and the perfect satisfaction made by
his death for them, whence the justice of God, in the issue, will not have any
thing to lay to their charge, we have formerly insisted on; The other, which
the Apostle induces emphatically and comparatively, though not in respect of
procurement and purchase made, yet of assurance to be given, with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in respect of his Oblation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that now before us. To make the Assurance of
Believers plentifull, that they may know both the Truth of his first generall
Assertion, <hi>that all things shall work together for good to them;</hi> and this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
conclusion, now laid downe by way of interrogation, rejecting all evill
opposed to their former enjoyments, <hi>who shall lay any thing to their charge?
who shall condemne?</hi> He gives them a threefold consideration of the state, and
actings of the Lord Christ, after the Expiation of their sinnes by this bloud, in
reference to them; 1. <hi>He is Risen. 2. He is at the Right hand of God. 3. Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Intercession for them;</hi> the First denoting his Acquitment, and theirs in
him, (for he died in their stead) from all the sinnes that were charged on him;
For he was declared to be the Sonne of God, accepted with him, and justified
from all that debt, which he undertook, in his Resurrection; and, <hi>if he be risen,
who shall lay any thing to the charge of them whom he died for,</hi> and for all
whose sinnes, in their stead, he was acquitted? The Second is his <hi>Exaltation</hi>
and Power; for, <hi>having purged our sinnes, he is sate downe at the right hand of
the Majesty on High. Heb.</hi> 1. 3. receiving thereby a most plenary demonstration
of his Fathers good will to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> in respect of the work that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
and gone through for them; For, if he had not <hi>made an end of sinne,</hi>
when he was <hi>obedient unto death, the death of the Crosse,</hi> he could not expect
that <hi>God should give him a name above every name,</hi> with fulnesse of power, to
give Eternall Life to all that the Father gave him; This to assure us that he
will doe, having power in his own hand, the Apostle addes, <hi>who also Intercedes
for us;</hi> hereby (thirdly) testifying abundantly his good will and care for our
Salvation; Upon these considerations the Apostle <hi>leads</hi> the Faith of the Saints
of God, to make a conclusion, which is to be believed as a Divine Truth, that
tenders to us the Doctrine we have under Demonstration, triumphant against
all Objections and oppositions that can be made against it: And hence we thus
argue: Those against whom no <hi>Charge</hi> can be laid, who cannot by any means
<hi>be separated from the love of God in Christ;</hi> cannot totally and finally fall away
from Faith, and fall out of Gods Favour: but that this is the condition of all
true Believers, is evident from the Context. It is of all that are <hi>called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Purpose of God,</hi> sanctifyed and justified, the proper description of
all and only Believers, that the Apostle affirmes these things, and to whom he
ascribes the condition mentioned: Now that this is the state and condition of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59070:137"/>
those persons, the Apostle manifesteth from the causes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Oblation</hi>
and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ in their behalfe: For those for whom he Died, and
doth Intercede, are on that account, exempted from any such charge, as
might be of prevalency to separate them from God.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> attempts indeed once more to reinforce the <hi>triumphed over
Enemies</hi> of the Saints,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> and to call them once more to make head against the
Intercession of Christ, but, with what ill successe, the consideration of what
Arguments he useth with them, and for them, will demonstrate: thus then he
addresseth himselfe to his taske Ch. 11. Sect: 33. pag. 248. <hi>I answer, It is no
where affirmed, that Christ Intercedes for the Perseverance of the Saints in their
Faith, or, they who once believed, should never cease Believing, how sinfull and
wicked soever they should prove afterwards; But Christ Intercedes for his Saints, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
such, and so continuing such, that no accusation from any hand whatsoever, may be
heard against them, that no afflictions or sufferings, which they meet with in the
World, may cause any alienation, or abatement in the Love of God towards them:
but that God will protect, and preserve them under them; and consequently, that
they may be maintained at an excellent rate of Consolation in every state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and against all interposures of any Creature to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Answer hath long since ceased to be new to us:<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> It is that indeed
which is the shield, behinde which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> lyes, to avoide the force of all
manner of Arguments pointed against himselfe, though it be the most weake
and frivolous, that ever, I suppose, was used in so weighty a matter; It is here
cast (as he hath many moulds and shapes to cast it in) into a denyall of the
Assumption of our <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> and a Reason of that deniall; First he denies,
that Christ intercedes for Believers, that they may Persevere in their Faith;
<hi>he prayes not for their Perseverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. His Reason of this is two fold; 1. A supposall, that <hi>they may prove so
wicked, as not to continue Believing.</hi> 2. A description of what Christ Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
for, in the behalfe of Believers, <hi>viz. that they may continue in Gods Love,
if they doe continue to Believe, notwithstanding all their affictions: Homo homini
quid interest?</hi> Whether men will or no, these must passe for <hi>Oracular</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. First, for the first: Let what hath been spoken already be <hi>weighed,</hi> and
see if there be not yet hope left for poore soules, that Christ prayes for them,
that their Faith faile not; And, by the way, who will not embrace this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Doctrine, that will assure him in his Agonies, Temptations, and Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that all help and supplies are made out to him, from and by the Lord
Jesus, in whom is all his hope; and that he receives of his Father, upon his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession,</hi>
all the fruits of his Death, and Bloudshedding in his behalfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
that he should Believe, or being tempted should be preserved in Believing,
of that Christ takes no thought, nor did ever intercede with his Father for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such end or purpose; Such consolation might befit <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, <hi>miserable
Comforters, Physitians of no value.</hi> (But of this before.)</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. For that supposall of his, of their proving <hi>wicked</hi> afterwards to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
with believing, it hath often been corrected for a sturdy Begger,
and sent away grumbling and hungry, and, were it not for pure necessity,
would never once be owned any more by its Master; Christ Intercedes not
for Believers, that they may Persevere in the Faith upon such foolish suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls,
whose opposite is Continuance in the Faith, and so is coincident with
the thing it selfe interceded for; To Intercede that they may continue Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
is, to Intercede that they may never be so wicked, as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
they may be. The end of Christs Intercession for the Saints asserted, is,
that they may never wickedly depart from God; Doth Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> indeed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59070:137"/>
take this to be the tenor of the Doctrine he opposeth, and of the Argument
which he undertakes to Answer? <hi>viz.</hi> That the Faith of Believers, and the
continuance of that, is interceded for, without any reference to the worke of
Faith in Gospell Obedience, and communion with God in Christ? Or if he
thinks not so, why doth he so often insist on this calumnious evasion?</p>
            <p>3. In giving the aime of Christ in his <hi>Intercession</hi> for believers,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we have
this new <hi>cogent</hi> Argument against our Position; <hi>Christ Intercedes for the things
here by me mentioned; therefore he doth not Intercede for the Perseverance of the
Saints;</hi> But why so? Is there any inconsistency in these things, any repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in termes, or contrariety of the things themselves? Christ Intercedes, that
Believers may enjoy the Love of God; therefore he doth not Intercede, that
they may be established in Believing?</p>
            <p>2. The summe of all that is here ascribed to the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ, at
the best, is, that God will confirme and ratify that everlasting Law, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
continuing so to the end, shall be saved,</hi> which whether it be the summe
of Christs <hi>Intercession</hi> for his <hi>Church</hi> or no, that <hi>Church</hi> will judge; If there be
any thing farther, or of more importance to them, in what is assigned to it by
M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> it is wrapt up in the knot of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I am not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.</p>
            <p>3.
Those words of the Apostle [<hi>who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
Elect</hi>] do not denote, this is that the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ for them, that no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
be admitted against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whilst they belive; which is no more, but the
confirmation of that generall Proposition of the Gospell before mentioned.
But it is the Conclusion which they make upon the Account of the Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ in the Application of the Promise of the Gospell to their owne
soules: Neither is there any more weight in that which followes, <hi>that there
be no abatement, or alienation of the Love of God from them, upon the account
of their sufferings and afflictions,</hi> which for the most part, are for his sake;
what Saints of God were almost so much as once tempted with a conceit,
that Gods Love should be abated, or alienated from them, because they suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for him?</p>
            <p>And this is the Foundation of that <hi>excellent rate of Consolation at which the
Saints, upon the account of the Intercession of Christ, may be maintained.</hi> Into
Afflictions, Temptations, Tryalls, they may fall: but if they continue in Faith,
and Love, they shall not be rejected. No Creature shall be heard against
them; that Christ takes care for; But for the worst enemies they have, their
owne Lusts, Corruptions, and Unbeliefe, the fiery Darts of Sathan fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their soules, their continuance in Believing, the falling, from whence
is indeed all the danger they are exposed to, (for whilst they continue so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
all other things are lighter then vanity) that Christ takes no care about,
(though he pray, that God would sanctify them and keepe them,) but they
must shift for themselves as well as they can, he will not, doth not Intercede
for them, that from these they may be preserved; Doubtlesse, he that shall
think to be <hi>maintained</hi> long at any high rate of <hi>Consolation,</hi> and laves in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor no better <hi>provision</hi> to live on, then this mentioned, will quickly be
reduced to a <hi>dry morsell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet some Reasons of the foregoing interpretation of this place of the
Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:<note place="margin">§: 9.</note> are offered unto us.</p>
            <p>This to be the tenour and effect of Christ's Intercession for his Saints <hi>(saith he)</hi>
is evident from the first of the three passages cited: And for that demand [who
shall separate us from the love of Christ] It is not meant from the Love, wherewith
we love Christ, but from the Love wherewith Christ loveth us; as we are Saints, and
abide in his love, and keepe his commands: neither is it so to be conceived, as if
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59070:138"/>
sinne, wickednesse, loosenesse, profanenesse, could not unsaint men, and hereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them from them from that love, wherewith Christ sometimes loved them,
(for that Iniquity will separate between men, and their God, is evident from Isa.
59. 2.) But the cleare meaning is, that nothing, no Creature whatsoever, person, or
thing, can make Christ an enemy to those, who shall in Faith and Love, cleave
fast unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. All this respecteth only one expression in this one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ariseth not, with the least power, against our Argument taken
from many places in Conjunction, explicatory one of an other; It runns also
upon the same mistake with the former, taking the exaltation of Believers, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Intercession of Christ in their behalfe, which holds out the Issue of it,
to be expressive of the matter of his Intercession, being only a demonstration
of the event of of it; But grant this to be the tenor and effect of Christs Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
that Believers may not be separated from <hi>his</hi> Love: is he heard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or is he not? Whatsoever be the issue of the question, our procedure
will be facile. But it is said, that it is not the <hi>Love, wherewith we love Christ,
but that wherewith he loveth us, that we shall not be separated from;</hi> take this also
for granted, that it is that, &amp; that only: will this advantage your Cause. If we
be never separated from that Love that Christ bears us, is it possible we
should wholly be separated from that Love, that we beare him? Wherein
consists our separation from that Love, that Christ bears us? How is it caused,
or may it be procured? Is it not by the losse of our Faith and Love to him? Or
at least is it not an inseparable consequence thereof? Or can it possibly come
to passe any otherwise, then on that account? If then he Intercedes that we
may not be separated from that Love he bears us, and that Love inferrs the
continuance of ours, doth he not withall Intercede, that we may never loose
that Love, wherewith we love him, by which we continue in his Love? If
the old shift be not at hand for a reliefe, this young part of the Answer will
instantly suffer losse. It is added therefore, <hi>he loveth us, as we are Saints and
abide in his Love,</hi> that is, (for so we must understand it,) whilst we are so; for
that he beares any effectuall Love to us, to keepe us up to Saintship, that is
denyed; 'tis true, Christ loveth us as Saints, and as abiding in his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
but it is also his Love to keepe us, and he intercedeth that we may
abide in that Condition, wherein alone it is possible for us so to do: Neither
is the Question, whether sinne, loosenesse, profanenesse, do not separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and men, more or lesse; but whether Believers shall not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from such loosenesse &amp; profanenesse, as would make a <hi>totall</hi> separation
between God and them; and if God intercedes, as is added in the close, that
nothing may make him an enemy to us, certainely he must Intercede that no
sinne may do it; For indeed, sinne is something in this businesse; and this must
be, as to the keeping us from it; I suppose no man thinks any thing in all
this Discourse of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s, to looke like the least attempt of proofe, that
Christ doth not Intercede for the Perseverance of Saints. Neither hath
he confidence enough positively to deny it, &amp; therefore spends his whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
hereabout in evasions, and diversions. Let it be directly denyed, that
Christ doth not <hi>intend,</hi> that the Faith of Believers <hi>may not faile,</hi> that his Saints
may be preserved, and Saved; and we know what we have to apply our selves
unto: And if the contrary cannot be proved, the Saints know, what they have
to trust unto, that they may no longer leane on that which will yeild them
no supportment. If this will not be, let it on the other hand be granted, that
he doth so intercede; for, <hi>de unoquo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> affirmare, aut negare, verum est.</hi> As to
this then he proceeds</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:59070:138"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Were it granted, that part of Christs Intercession for his Saints, is,
that their Faith may never faile, yet the intent thereof would not necessarily, nor
indeed with any competent probability,<note place="margin">§.10.</note> be this, that no sinne nor wickednesse what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
that shall, or can be perpetrated by them, might cause them to make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of their Faith, but rather that God would graciously vouchsafe such meanes
and such a presence of his Spirit unto them, as whereby they may be richly inabled,
to keepe themselves in Faith &amp; Good conscience, to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Whether prejudiced men will grant it or no, it is clearly proved,
if the words of Christ themselves may be taken for proofe, that he Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
for his Saints, <hi>that their Faith may not faile,</hi> and that, notwithstanding
the interposition of any such sinnes, as they can or may (<hi>suppositis supponendis,</hi>
amongst which is his <hi>Intercession</hi>) fall into; So he tells <hi>Peter</hi> upon the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his dreadfull fall, that neverthelesse <hi>he had prayed for him, that his Faith
should not faile;</hi> That they may fall into such sinnes, and continue in such, as
are inconsistent with their Acceptation with God, according to the termes
and tenor of the new Covenant, is that, which we have been disproving all
this while; and which our Author ought not, as he doth in all his Reasonings,
to suppose; In the not failing or dying of their Faith, in their preservation
therein, is included their deliverance from the perpetration of the sinnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
or at least from such a manner of committing any sinne, as should
utterly separate them from God. It is the continuance of a living Faith, that
Christ prayes for; and where that is, there will be workes of new Obedience:
and there will be the work of that Faith, in purifying the Heart, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the sinnes supposed. Farther, the way here prescribed and limited to
the Lord Jesus, how he shall intercede for his, and for what, <hi>viz.</hi> not for
actuall Perseverance, and continuance in the Faith, to be wrought in them
by the exceeding greatnesse of the power of God, but for meanes to inable
them to preserve themselves, we are perswaded he walkes not in; And that
much upon this account, that the way, whereby God begins and carries on
Believers, in the way of Faith and Obedience, is not by such a supply of
meanes, as leaves them to themselves to work and effect the things, for which
they are so supplied; but <hi>he himselfe workes in them to will and to doe of his
own good pleasure, fulfilling in them all the good pleasure of his Goodnesse, and the
worke of Faith with power,</hi> giving them all their sufficiency, and <hi>preserving them
by his power, through Faith unto salvation;</hi> To make Faith, and Perseverance
therein, to follow such a supply of meanes, as leaves the production of them,
to the power of the wills of men, so that after God hath done, all that on his
part is to be done or performed, that is, <hi>quickned them being dead, giving them
new Hearts &amp; Spirtis, shone into their mindes, to give them the knowledge of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Face of his Sonne &amp;c.</hi> it is yet uncertaine, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver Faith shall be
wrought in their Soules or no, or rather, whether men so supplied with
means will Believe and Persevere, or no, is an Assertion, that will never be
proved to Eternity; nor whilest Truth is Truth, it is capable of proofe: <hi>The
granting of such meanes, and such a presence of his Spirit, that men may be inabled
to worke for themselves,</hi> is an expression exceedingly unsuited to all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the new Covenant; what ever either of the Spirit of Grace, or the
meanes of it, is given out to Believers, Christ intercedes that his <hi>Father</hi> would
<hi>keepe them,</hi> not that they should keepe themselves: he was too well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with our frame, and our temptations, to desire we might be our own
keepers; God forbid we should be left to our owne preservation, to the
hand of our owne counsell and power, though compassed with all the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
sufficient meanes: that may be, not <hi>eventually</hi> effectually God creates
<hi>a defence upon our Glory,</hi> and doth not leave it to our owne safegarding. Our
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59070:139"/>
salvation is not in our own custody; That the Father doth not keepe us, or
preserve us, that the Sonne doth not Intercede, that we may be so preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Spirit doth not make us <hi>meete for,</hi> and keepe us unto <hi>the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Saints in Light,</hi> but that, in the use of meanes we are, as <hi>Adam</hi>
was, <hi>our own keepers,</hi> are some of the Principles of that new way of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
consolation to Believers, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath found out. This then
is the utmost, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will allow to be (for disputation sake, not
that he really believes it) granted, that Christ intercedes for his Saints, as to
their continuance and preservation in that condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would
give them such meanes, as they may use, or not use, at their liberty, which
may be effectuall, or not effectuall, as their own wils shall choose to make
use of them, which he also takes for granted, to be common to all the World,
and not to be peculiar unto Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is farther argued,</hi> If Christ should simply and absolutely Intercede, that
no sinne or wickednesse whatsoever, may destroy the Faith of any true Believer,
and consequently deprive him of Salvation, should he not hereby become that, which
the Apostle rejects with indignation, as altogether unworthy of him, I meane, a
Minister of sinne? Is therefore Christ the Minister of sinne? God forbid; or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
or wherein, can it lightly be imagined, that Christ should become a minister of
sinne, rather then by interceding with his Father, that such and such men, how
vile and abominable soever they shall become, may yet be precious in his sight, and
receive a Crowne of Righteousnesse from his hand? Or doth not such an Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as some men put upon him, as they who make him to Intercede simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
for the Perseverance of Believers in their Faith, amount to an Intercession of
every whit as vile and unworthy Import as this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans:</hi> That this is the tenor of Christs Intercession with his Father, for
men, <hi>let them become as vile as they will, how vile and abominable soever, yet
that they may be still precious in his sight, and that he would give them a Crowne
of Righteousnesse,</hi> M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> knoweth full well, not to be the Doctrine of
them he opposeth; If he shall otherwise affirme, it will be incumbent on him
to produce some one Author, that hath wrote about this Doctrine, in what
language soever, and so stated it; If he be ignorant, that this is not their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
he ought not to have ingaged into an opposition thereof: if he argue
that it is otherwise, this procedure is unworthy of him. That Christ Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
for his Saints, that they may be kept from all such sinnes, as would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them from the Love and Favour of his Father, for which there is no
Remedy provided in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and that their Faith may not faile
or perish under such sinnes, as they may through Temptation fall into, is the
Doctrine, which he opposeth, or at least ought to oppose, to make good his
undertaking; Now if this be so, <hi>then</hi> (saith he) <hi>is Christ the minister of sinne:</hi>
why so? He sees and foretells, that <hi>Peter</hi> should deny him thrice, yet he
prayes, that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith may not faile under that sinne and wickednesse: is he
therefore <hi>a minister of sinne?</hi> because he Intercedes, that his Saints may not
be given up to the power of sinne, nor every time they are assaulted, lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by sinne, is he therefore <hi>a minister of sinne?</hi> or rather <hi>a deliverer from
sinne?</hi> That very thing, which M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirmes would make him a <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of sinne,</hi> he affirmes himselfe to do in the case of <hi>Peter;</hi> how he will free
himselfe from this charge and imputation, <hi>ipse viderit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What it is to Intercede <hi>simply and absolutely</hi> for Believers, that they
may continue believing, we are not so cleare in; Christ Intercedes, that they
may be preserved by the power of his Father, in and through the use of those
meanes, which he graciously affords them, and the Powerfull presence of the
Spirit of God with them therein; and that, not on any such absurd and foolish
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59070:139"/>
conditions, that they may be so preserved by his Father, provided they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves, and continue Believers, on condition they continue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and, if this be of a <hi>vile and unworthy import,</hi> the <hi>Gospell</hi> is so too, and one
of the most eminent <hi>Graces,</hi> that is inwrapped in the New Covenant, is so too.</p>
            <p>What there is farther in M. <hi>Goodwin Sect. 34. Pag.</hi> 249, 250. unto this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> is either a meere repetition of what was spoken before, or a pressing of
Consequences upon such supposalls, as he is pleased to make, concerning the
Doctrine that he doth oppose; As we cannot hinder any man from making
what supposals they please, and suiting inferences to them, manifesting their
skill in casting downe what themselves set up, so we are not in the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in such <hi>Theatricall contests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What it is,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> that we teach of the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ for Believers, hath
been sufficiently explayned; The end, and aime of it is, that they may be
<hi>kept,</hi> that they may <hi>not be lost,</hi> that <hi>the evill one may not touch them,</hi> that they
may be <hi>Saved to the utmost,</hi> and <hi>kept by the Power of God unto Salvation;</hi> All
that the Lord Jesus hath for his Church, either by bis <hi>Oblation,</hi> or his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi>
procured, or doth procure, being made out unto them by the Holy
and Blessed Spirit, which he sent them from his Father, as the first fruits of
his undertaking for them, by, and in the use of such meanes and wayes, as
he hath appointed for them to walke in, in reference to the end proposed:
He Intercedes that through supplyes of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> their <hi>Faith faile</hi> not, that
no temptation prevaile against them, that they may have suitable helpes in
time of need, and so be preserved, according to the tenor of that Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he is pleased to give them in this life, which is imperfect, not from
all sinnes, (for it is the will of God, to keepe them and walke with them
in a Covenant of pardoning Mercy,) not absolutely, from this, or that great
sinne, as is evident in the case of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> whereof, under such sinnes,
the one lost not the Spirit, nor the other his Faith, but from such sinnes, or
such a course or way, in and under sinne, as would disappoint him, and make
his desires frustrate, as to the end first proposed, of bringing them to Glory;
so that, as the intendment of his <hi>Oblation</hi> is, meritoriously, and by way of
procurement, to take away all our sinnes whatsoever; and yet in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it unto us, as to the taking of them away, <hi>by purifying us to be an Holy
People unto himselfe,</hi> it is not perfected and compleated at once, nor the
worke thereof consummated, but by degrees; so in his <hi>Intercession,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
the same persons and things with his Oblation, he puts in for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from all sinnes, &amp; the power of them, but so and in a such manner,
as the nature of our present condition, whilst we are <hi>in viâ,</hi> and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Covenant, whereunto God hath graciously taken us, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>Through
the Goodnesse of God,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> we have now brought this <hi>first Part</hi> to an
end. They, who are in any measure acquainted, in what straights, under what
pressing imployments, and urgent Avocations, and in what space of time
this <hi>Offering</hi> was provided for the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of God, will <hi>accept</hi> it in him,
whose it is, and from whom it was received.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>1. The Improvement of the Doctrine of Perseverance in reference to the Obedience and Consolation of
the Saints; why its tendency to the promoting of their Obedience is first handled, before their
Consolation. 2. Five previous Observations concerning Gospell Truths in generall, (1.) That
all are to be received with equall reverence. (2.) That the end of them all is, to worke the soule
into a conformity to God; prov'd by severall Scriptures, 2 Tim. 3. 16. Tit. 1. 1. &amp;c. (3.) Some
Truths have a more immediate tendency hereunto them others have. 2 Cor. 5. 14. (4.) Most
weight is to be laid by Believers upon such. (5.) Men are not themselves to determine what
Truths have most in them of this Tendency. &amp;c. 3. Gospell Obedience, what it is, and why so
called. 5. Its nature, (1) In the matter of it, which is All and Only the will of God. 5. (2) In
the Forme of it, which is considered, (1.) In the Principle setting it on worke, Faith. (2.) In
the manner of doing it, eying both Precepts and Promises. (3.) The end aimed at in it, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God as a Rewarder. Heb. 11. 6. Rom. 4. 4. 6. The Principle in us, whence it proceeds, which
is the New man, the Spirit: proved. Eph. 3. 16, 17. &amp;c. 7. What kind of Motives conduce most
to the carrying on of this Obedience, namely, such as most cherish this New man, which they doe
most, that discover most of the Love of God, and his good will in Christ, such as these are alone
usefull to Mortification, and the subduing of the contrary Principle of Flesh, which hinders our
Obedience; proved Titus 2. 12. Rom. 6. 8. What Persons the improvement of this Doctrine
concernes, only true Believers who won't abuse it. 9. How this Doctrine of Perseverance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
so eminently to the carrying on of Gospell Obedience in the hearts of these true Believers.
(1.) By removing discouragements. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Perplexing Fears which impaire their Faith. 11.
(2.) Hard thoughts of God, which weaken their Love, without which two, Faith and Love, no
Gospell Obedience performed. 12. Unspeakable obligations to live to God, hence put upon the
Soules of the Saints. 13. Objection concerning the Abuse of this Truth, to presumption and
carelessnesse discussed, examined, at large and removed. 14. The mortification of the Flesh,
wherein it consists, how it is performed: The influence of the Doctrine of the Saints Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereinto. Dread and terror of Hell not the meanes of mortification: at large proved,
by shewing quite another meanes of mortifying the Flesh, viz, The spirit of Christ, Rom. 8. 13.
applying the Crosse, and Death of Christ. Rom. 6. 5, 6. 15. (3.) This Doctrine is usefull to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Gospell Obedience, in that it tends directly to increase and strengthen Faith and Love, both
towards God, and towards our Lord Jesus Christ. 16. How it strengthens their Love to God,
viz. By discovering his Love to them, in three eminent properties of it, Freedome, Constancy,
Fruitfulnesse. 17. How it strengthens their Love to Jesus Christ, viz. By discovering his Love
to them, in two eminent Acts of it, his Oblation and his Intercession. 18. (4.) This Doctrine
conduces &amp;c. by giving Gospell Obedience its proper place and due order. 19. (5.) By closing
in with the ends of Gospell Ordinances, particularly the Ministry, one eminent end whereof is,
to perfect the Saints. Eph. 4. 12, 13. Which is done by discovering to them the whole will of
God, both Precepts, on the one hand, and Promises, Exhortations, Threatnings on the other.
20. That of the Promises more particularly, and more largely insisted on.</p>

of the worke, which now drawes towards a close, is, the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Doctrine so long insisted on, (having in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vindicated and cleared up the Truth of it) as to the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
influence it hath into the <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> of
them that are concerned therein; And this I shall do in the Order that I have
named, giving the Preeminence unto their <hi>Obedience;</hi> which more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
respecting the Glory of God, &amp; the honour of the Gospell, is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before their Consolation; yea though God should never afford his Saints
any drop of that <hi>Consolation,</hi> which we affirme to streame from the <hi>Truth
discussed,</hi> yet it is <hi>Honour</hi> unspeakable for them, that he is pleased to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them, and inable them, to do him <hi>Service</hi> in this life; and it will be their
infinite Consolation, that they have done so, to Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:59070:140"/>
For the making our way cleare to the demonstration of that influence,
which the Doctrine of the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints</hi> hath into their <hi>Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence,</hi>
and close-walking with God, and so to manifest, what weight is to be lay'd
upon it, on that Consideration; I shall give some <hi>previous Observations,</hi> which
may direct, and give us light in our passage, both concerning <hi>Gospell Truths,
Gospell Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Gospell Motives</hi> thereunto; I hope it will not be
thought amisse, if I looke a little backwards to fortify and cleare this part
of our progresse; there being no concernement of our Doctrine, that is more
clamoured by the Adversaries of it; nor can any respect of it, or any Truth of
God, more causelessly meet with such entertainement; as I hope will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
(in the progresse of our businesse) be evinced, to the consciences of
all, who know indeed, what it is to walke before God, in a course of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
Obedience, and who have their communion with the Father, and his
Sonne Jesus Christ. For the first</p>
            <p>1. Every Truth revealed from God is to be received not only with <hi>Faith,</hi>
and <hi>Love,</hi> but with equall <hi>Reverence</hi> to any that is revealed, though we are
not able to discerne such an <hi>immediate</hi> tendency unto usefullnesse in our
Communion with him, as in some others we may; The formall Reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
our <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> unto the Word of God is resolved, is,
that it is <hi>His:</hi> Now this is common to the whole, for he is the Author of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part, and portion a like; And though perhaps we may want some part of
it, at a lesse fatall price then some other, yet to reject any one <hi>title</hi> or <hi>jot</hi> of
it, as that which is revealed of God, is a sufficient demonstration, that no one
<hi>jot</hi> or <hi>title</hi> of it, is received as it ought; upon whatever this Title &amp; Inscription
is <hi>Verbum Jehovae,</hi> there must we stoope and bow downe our soules before it,
and <hi>captivate our Understandings to the obedience of Faith;</hi> Whatsoever then
may hereafter be spoken, concerning the usefulnesse of the Truth under Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and that comparative regard, which, in respect of others, ought on
that account to be had thereunto, doth not in the least exalt it (as it is in it
selfe, in respect of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> due thereunto) above any other <hi>Truth</hi>
whatsoever, that is in Scripture revealed.</p>
            <p>2. That next to the <hi>Revelation of God,</hi> his Will, and his Grace, the grand
immediate tendency of the whole Scripture is, to worke them, to whom the
Revelation is made, into a conformity to himselfe, and to mould them into
his owne Image: <hi>All Scripture,</hi> (the Apostle tells us. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.16.) <hi>is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for
instruction in righteousnesse, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
unto all Good workes;</hi> Hereunto all Scripture tends, and is <hi>usefull</hi> &amp; <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi>
for this end; And the Gospell is called <hi>the Truth, that is, according to
Godlinesse. Titus 1. 1. As the end of the Law is Charity out of a pure heart, and a
Faith unfained, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 5. That which in respect of the prime Author of it, is

               </gap>

               </gap> 
               <hi>the Word of the Crosse 1 Cor.</hi> 1.18. in respect of its end
and tendency towards us, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Word, or Truth, that is according
to Godlinesse.</hi> The Word is that revealed Will of God, which is our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 3. and the Instrument whereby he workes our Holinesse,
according to that prayer of our Saviour. Sanctifie them by thy Word, thy
Word is Truth. <hi>John</hi> 17. 19. And that, which when we are cast into the mould
of, our Obedience is in some measure wrought. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17 the substance also
or matter being written in our hearts, is the Grace, and Holinesse promised
unto us in the Covenant. <hi>Jere.</hi> 31.33. And that this is the <hi>Improvement,</hi> which
ought to be made by Believers, of every Gospell Truth; or rather that it hath
an Efficacy to this purpose, the Apostle tells us 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. We all with open
face beholding as in a glasse the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59070:141"/>
from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> By apprehensions
of the <hi>glorious</hi> Truths discovered in the <hi>glasse</hi> or <hi>mirror</hi> of the Gospell, we are
<hi>changed</hi> and moulded into the frame and <hi>Image</hi> therein discovered, by the
power of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> effectually accompanying the Word in the dispensation
thereof; And unlesse this be done, whatsoever we may pretend, we have not
received any Truth of the Gospell, as it is <hi>in Jesus,</hi> in the power of it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 20,
21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Ye have not</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>so learned Christ: If so be that
ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the Truth is in Jesus; That ye
put of, as concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the deceitfull lusts: And be renewed in the spirit of your mind: and that
ye put on the new man, which after God is created in Righteousnesse and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi>
Whatsoever men may professe, if we have learned the <hi>Truth, as it is in
Jesus,</hi> it will have these Effects in us, even universall relinquishment, (as to
<hi>sinceritie</hi>) of all ungodlinesse, and a through change, (both as to principles,
and practices) unto Holinesse, and to Righteousnesse, which the Gospell tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
us, which, if we have not learned, we have not yet learn't it, <hi>as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:
Tit. 2. 11, 12. The Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to
all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, we should live
Soberly, Righteously, and Godlily in this present evill world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Some Truths have a more immediate, direct, and effectuall tendency
to the promotion of Godlinesse, and <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> then others; This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
emphatically ascribes, as a priviledge, to that Doctrine, that reveales
the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ unto us. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. the Love of Christ constraines us;</hi> other
things effectually <hi>perswade,</hi> but the Love of Christ <hi>constraines</hi> us to live to
him; it hath an <hi>importunity</hi> with it, not to be denied; an efficacy not to be put
off, or avoided; and what is in the things themselves, as in <hi>the love of Christ,</hi>
that is in <hi>its</hi> manner, in <hi>the Word of Truth,</hi> whereby it is revealed.</p>
            <p>4. That there is, by all that walke with God, great weight to be laid on
those <hi>Doctrines of Truth,</hi> which directly and effectually tend to the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Faith, Love, Feare, Rever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce of God,</hi> with <hi>universall holinesse</hi> in their
hearts and waies: this being that, whereunto they are called, and whereby
God is glorified, Jesus Christ and the Gospell exalted, wherein his Kingdome
in them consists, on which their owne peace in their owne bosomes, their use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
unto others in this World, their being <hi>made meet for the Inheritance
of the Saints of Light,</hi> doth much depend: If these things be of weight or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto them, (as surely they are all, that is, so to Believers) then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
great valuation, and deare esteeme will be entertained of those helps
and Assistances, wich they have, leading and carrying them on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>5.
That a Judgement of what Truths and Doctrines are peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
unto the promotion of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> is not to be made upon
the Apprehensions and reasonings of men, wrested with a thousand Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and prejudices, full of darknesse and vanity, but according to what the
<hi>Scripture</hi> it selfe holds forth, and the nature of the things themselves, (that is,
the <hi>Evidence and Consequence</hi> that is between the <hi>Truth</hi> revealed, and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>)
doth require; If the Testimonies of the Sonnes of men must be admitted
in this case, to determine what Doctrine is <hi>according to Godlinesse,</hi> the cry and
noyse of them, will be found so various, discrepant; confused, and directly
contradictory to it selfe, that none will ever thereby be lead to establishment;
Then <hi>Papists</hi> will cry out for their <hi>Merits, Penance, Vowes, Purgatory;</hi> the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
Familists, Formalists,</hi> all contend upon the foundation of their own
perswasions, as to their tendency to Godlinesse, of their Abominations. That
Doctrine, which hath no other proofe of its Truth and worth, but that men,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59070:141"/>
some men professe, it tends to <hi>Godlinesse</hi> and Holinesse of conversation, I dare
say, is a <hi>lye</hi> and vanity, and did never promote any thing, but vaine, legall,
superstitious, counterfeit Holinesse; Indeed upon a supposition of its truth,
it is of concernement for the Advancement of any Doctrine, in the esteeme
and opinion of the Saints, to manifest, that it leads to Godlinesse: but to
prove it to be true, because men, who perhaps never knew any thing beyond
<hi>Formall, Legall, Pharisaicall</hi> Holinesse all their daies, say, it tends to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of Holinesse, is but to obtrude our Conceptions upon others, that are
no way moulded into the frame of them; That the imbracement of such a
Truth, will further us in our <hi>Obedience,</hi> and walking with God, therefore
value and prize it, is good arguing; but that such a Doctrine will further us
in a way of Godlinesse, therefore 'tis a Truth, when we may be mistaken both
in Godlinesse it selfe, and in the motives to it, and furtherances of it, is but
a Presumption. To commend then the Truth, which we have at large other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
confirmed, to the Hearts and Consciences of the Saints of God, and to
lay a foundation for the full removall of those vaine and weake exceptions,
which on this account are laid against it: I shall manifest what influences it
hath into their <hi>Obedience,</hi> and with what eminent efficacy it prevailes upon
their Soules, to <hi>perfect Holinesse in the feare of God;</hi> For the more cleare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
whereof, I shall give the Reader the summe of it, under the ensuing
Considerations concerning <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> and the <hi>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<hi>thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That which I call <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> wherein the Saints of God are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
by the beliefe of the Truth we have in hand, is variously expressed in
the Scripture; It may in Generall be described to be, <hi>a voluntary orderly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the whole will of God:</hi> I call it <hi>Obedience,</hi> in reference unto <hi>the will of
God,</hi> which is the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Patterne</hi> of it, and whereunto it is a <hi>regular subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
The Psalmist expresses it to the full, both as to the Root and fruit. <hi>Ps.</hi>
40. 8. <hi>I delight to doe thy will O my God, yea thy Law is within my Heart;</hi> the
<hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> gives us to <hi>doe,</hi> and to <hi>delight</hi> in doing the Will of God;
<hi>Peter</hi> calls it, <hi>being holy in all manner of conversation. 1 Pet. 1. 14, 15. Paul a
Cleansing of our selves from all filthinesse of flesh and spirit in the feare of God.</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. or, as it is more eminently described, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1, 2. in that Patheticall
exhortation of the Apostle thereunto; <hi>I beseech you Brethren, by the mercies of
God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service; And be not conformed unto this world, but be yee
transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
that acceptable, and perfect will of God,</hi> as he had formerly at large described it,
<hi>in the sixth Chapter of that Epistle,</hi> throughout. And I call it <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi>
not that it differs in substance, as to the matter of it, from that required by
the <hi>Law,</hi> which injoynes us to <hi>love the Lord our God with all our hearts,</hi> but that
it moves upon <hi>principles,</hi> and is carried on unto <hi>ends</hi> revealed only in the
<hi>Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reference to our designe, there are these four things considerable in
it.</p>
            <p>First the <hi>Nature</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly the <hi>Principle</hi> in us, from whence it proceeds.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the <hi>Motives</hi> that are proper to the carrying it on, the cherishing
and increasing of it in them, in whom it is.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the <hi>Persons,</hi> who are to be moved and provoked to a progresse
therein.</p>
            <p>By a briefe consideration of these things, we shall make way for what we
have undertaken; namely to manifest the efficacy of the Doctrine we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59070:142"/>
on, for the promotion of this <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> being accused and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the cleare contrary tendency; whereof, (God assisting) we shall free
and discharge it in the progresse of this Discouse.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">§: 4.</note> First in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it I shall consider only these two things.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> of it, what it is as it were composed of, and
wherein it doth consist.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Forme</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of its performance; whence it receives its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
being, as such.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> of it containes those things, or duties to God,
wherein it doth consist. Now it consisting, as I said before, in <hi>Conformity</hi> &amp; <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
to the <hi>Will,</hi> that is, the <hi>Commanding</hi> revealed Will of God, the <hi>matter</hi> of
it must lye <hi>in the performance of all these things, &amp; only those things, which God
requireth of Believers, in walking before him:</hi> I say, <hi>all those things, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,</hi>
with an equall respect to <hi>all</hi> his Precepts; The Authority of God
the Commander and <hi>Law Giver,</hi> is the same in every command; And therefore
was the Curse denounced unto every one, <hi>that continued not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Law to do them;</hi> and the Apostle tels us, that <hi>in the transgression of
any one precept, there is included the transgression of the whole Law,</hi> because the
Authority of the <hi>Law giver,</hi> both in the one, and the other, is despised. <hi>James</hi> 2.
10, 11. <hi>Whosoever shall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in any one point, he
is guilty of all; For he that, said Do not commit Adultery, said also Do not kill.</hi>
And</p>
            <p>2. I say, it is <hi>only</hi> to the Command; for <hi>in vaine do men worship him, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
for Doctrines the Traditions of men.</hi> The most stupendious indeavours
of men, the most laborious <hi>drudgery</hi> of their soules in Duties <hi>not commanded,</hi>
are so far from <hi>Obedience,</hi> that they are as high <hi>Rebellions</hi> against God, as they
can possibly ingage themselves into.</p>
            <p>I might farther distinguish the <hi>matter,</hi> or <hi>substance</hi> of this <hi>Obedience,</hi> into the
<hi>internall elicite Act of our soules,</hi> in Faith, Love, and the like Acts of morall,
and everlasting Obedience, which are naturally, necessarily, and indispensably
required in us, upon the account of the first <hi>Commandement,</hi> and the naturall
subjection, wherein we stand unto God, as his Creatures; improved and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the new Obligation put upon us, in being his <hi>Redeemed</hi> ones: (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
indeed the maine of our <hi>Obedience</hi> doth consist) And the <hi>outward instituted
Duties of Religion,</hi> which God hath appointed for those former Acts of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to be exercised in, and exerted by; But the former description of it, with
the Intimation of its <hi>universality,</hi> may suffice.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Secondly the <hi>Formality</hi> (if I may so speake) of this <hi>Obedience,</hi> or that
which makes the performance of Duties commanded, to be <hi>Obedience, consists</hi>
in these three things.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Principle</hi> that begins it, and sets it on worke immediately in us: and
that is <hi>Faith; without Faith it is impossible to please God. Heb:</hi> 11. 6. Could a
man doe all that is commanded, yet if he did it not in Faith, it would be of
no value; hence it is called <hi>the Obedience of Faith. Rom.</hi> 1. 5. not <hi>for Obedience
to the Faith,</hi> but the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> which Faith bringeth forth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are Believers called <hi>Obedient Children. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 14. &amp; we are said to <hi>purifie
our soules in Obedience to the Truth v. 22. Christ dwells in our hearts by Faith, and
without him we can do nothing John</hi> 15. 5. All that we do is no better, seeing
we can no way <hi>draw neare</hi> unto God <hi>with a true heart, but in full Assurance of
Faith. Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Manner</hi> of doing it, which consists in a due <hi>Spirituall</hi> regard to
the Will of God, in those wayes, whereby he calls men out to this <hi>Obedience;</hi>
namely, in his <hi>Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Promises;</hi> There is no <hi>Obedience</hi> unto God, but that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59070:142"/>
which moves according to his direction; it must in every motion eye his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
on the one hand, and his <hi>Promise,</hi> whether of <hi>Assistance</hi> for it, or <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
in it, on the other; Saith <hi>David, I have respect unto all thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Psal.</hi> 119. and saith the Apostle, <hi>having received these Promises, let us
cleanse our selves, from all filthinesse both of flesh &amp; Spirit, perfecting Holinesse in
the feare of God. 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
            <p>3. The principall <hi>End</hi> of it, which is the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> as a <hi>Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
for <hi>he that comes unto God, must believe that he is, and that he is the Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of them that seeke him. Heb:</hi> 11. 6. The end of <hi>Legall Obedience</hi> was the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, as a <hi>Rewarder</hi> according to <hi>Merit,</hi> in strict justice; the end of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
Obedience</hi> is the Glory of God, as a Rewarder according to bounty, free
Grace, and mercy: under which consideration, neither needs the <hi>Obedience</hi>
rewardable to be commensurate to the <hi>Reward,</hi> nor is the <hi>Reward</hi> procured
by that <hi>Obedience;</hi> If it were, then it were <hi>of workes,</hi> and <hi>not of Grace,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
tells us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. So that the end of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> is to exalt God as
a <hi>Rewarder;</hi> yet that being as a <hi>Rewarder</hi> of Grace and bounty, the use of our
Obedience is not to procure that <hi>Reward,</hi> (for that were to worke, and to
have a reward reckoned to us of <hi>Debt,</hi> and not of <hi>Grace,</hi>) but only to make
the Lord gracious, and to exalt him in our present subjection, and in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
guift of Grace, in nature of a free bounteous reward. This I say is that
<hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> which by the Doctrine insisted on, is promoted in the soules
of Believers.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> this being so (as was said) the <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> whereof we
speake, it is evident, what <hi>Principle</hi> it proceedeth from; Whereas there are
two <hi>contrary Principles</hi> in every regenerate man, as shall more fully afterwards
be declared, called in the Scripture <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
sinne</hi> and Grace, which have both of them their Seats and Places in
all, and the same Faculties of the soule, it is most evident, that this <hi>Obedience</hi>
flowes solely and meerely from the latter <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>Spirit, new</hi> or <hi>inner
man,</hi> the <hi>new Creature,</hi> which is wrought in Believers; The strengthning and
heightning of this <hi>Principle,</hi> the Holy Ghost layes at the bottome of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall,
and increase of <hi>Gospell Obedience. Eph: 3. 16. 17. 18. 19. I pray,</hi> (saith the
Apostle) <hi>that God would grant you, according to the Riches of his Glory, to be
strengthned with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in
your hearts by Faith, that yee being rooted &amp; grounded in love may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
with all Saints what is the breadth, &amp; length, and depth, &amp; height, and to
know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the
fulnes of God;</hi> Their <hi>strengthning with might by the Spirit in the inner man</hi> is the
foundation of their acting of, and increasing in <hi>Faith, Love, Knowledge,</hi> and
<hi>Assurance</hi> unto <hi>all the fulnesse of God;</hi> It is the <hi>New man, which after God is Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in Righteousnesse and Holinesse,</hi> that carries men out unto all acceptable
Obedience, as <hi>c.</hi> 4. 23, 24. of the same Epistle. Look whatsoever influences the
other Principle of the <hi>flesh,</hi> hath into our <hi>Obedience,</hi> so farre it is defiled; for
<hi>that which is from the flesh is flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ieh. 3. 6.</note> &amp; all the fruits of it are abominable; Hence
are all the pollutions that cleave to our Holy things. Yea if at at any time,
poore and meere selfish considerations do put men upon dutyes of Obedience,
and abstaining from sinne, as <hi>feare of vengeance,</hi> and destruction, and the like,
(which is made almost the only motive to Obedience, by the Doctrine of
<hi>Saints Apostasie</hi>) their Obedience in doing or abstaining, is but as their feare
of the Lord,<note place="margin">2 Kings 17. 34.</note> who were taught it by <hi>Lions,</hi> &amp; abominable unto him; This then
being the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Gospell Obedience,</hi> and this the <hi>Principle,</hi> from whence it
flowes, it is evident,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:59070:143"/>
3. Thirdly, what are those <hi>motives,</hi> which are suited to the promotion
and carrying of it on, in the hearts of Believers, and what Doctrines have an
<hi>eminent and singular tendency</hi> thereunto,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> is also to be considered: now these
must all of them be such, as are suited to the cherishing of that Principle of
the <hi>new</hi> or <hi>inner man</hi> in the heart, to the nourishing and strengthning of the
<hi>new creature:</hi> such as are apt to ingenerate <hi>Faith</hi> and Love, in the heart, unto
God; such as reveale and discover those things in his nature, mind, and will,
as are apt to endeare and draw out the heart to him in Communion; discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging,
perplexing Doctrines doe but ill <hi>manure</hi> the soyle, from whence the
<hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> are to spring and <hi>grow;</hi> Look then (I say) whatsoever Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
Truth is of eminent usefulnesse, to warme, foment, stirre up, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Principle of Grace in the heart, to draw out, increase, and cherish
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that Doctrine lies in a direct, immediate tendency to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of Holinesse, Godlinesse, and <hi>Gospell Obedience.</hi> Yea and whereas to
the carrying on of that course of Obedience, it is necessary that the contrary
Principle unto it, which we mentioned before, be daily subdued, brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>mortified,</hi> there are no Doctrines whatsoever, that are of
such, and so direct and eminent a serviceablenesse to that end and purpose, as
those which inwrappe such discoveries of God, and his good will in Christ, as
are fitted for the improvement also, of the principle of Grace in us; Hence
the worke of <hi>Mortification</hi> in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> is every where assigned peculiarly
to the Crosse and death of Christ;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> his Love manifested therein, and his Spirit
flowing therefrom.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> The Doctrine of the <hi>Law</hi> indeed <hi>humbles</hi> the soule <hi>for
Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23.</note> but it is the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> that <hi>humbles</hi> the soule in <hi>Christ;</hi> It
is <hi>the Grace of God that hath appeared,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that teaches us effectually to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse
and worldly lusts, to live soberly, and righteously, and Godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world. Tit.</hi> 2. 12. He that will but with a little heed read Cap. 6. to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> will know from whence <hi>Mortification</hi> flowes; which truly (by the
way) makes me admire at the extreame darknesse, and blindnesse of some
poore men, who have of late undertaken to give directions for <hi>Devotion</hi> and
walking with God; who, indeed sutably to the most of the rest of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
all manifesting an <hi>Ignorance of the Righteousnesse of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> and a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
endeavour to establish their owne, coming to propose waies and meanes,
for the mortifying of any sinne or Lust, tell you stories of <hi>biting the tongue,</hi>
thrusting needles under the nailes, with such like Trash, as might have befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Popish <hi>devotions</hi> five hundred years agoe; Were not men utterly ignorant,
what it is to know the Lord Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10.</note> and the <hi>power of his Resurrection, and
the fellowship of his sufferings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and being made conformable to his death,</hi> they
could never <hi>feed</hi> on such <hi>huskes</hi> themselves, nor <hi>make provision</hi> of them, for
those, whose good they pretend to seeke. Unto what hath been spoken
adde</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> who are the <hi>Persons,</hi> that are to be provoked to Holinesse
and Godlinesse by the Doctrine insisted on; Now they are such, as doe <hi>believe</hi>
it, and are concerned in it; We say, the <hi>Truth</hi> under consideration is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
usefulnesse, to farther <hi>Gospell Obedience</hi> in the hearts of Believers and
Saints of God, who are taught of God, not to <hi>turne</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Grace into
wantonnesse:</hi> What use, or <hi>abuse</hi> rather, men of corrupt mindes, and carnall
principles, who stumble at Jesus Christ, and abuse the whole Doctrine of the
Gospell by their prejudices and presumptions, will make of it, we know not,
nor are sollicitous;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>If the Gospell be hid, it is hid to them that perish;</hi> it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that the <hi>food</hi> be good and <hi>wholsome</hi> for them, for whom it is provided. If
some will come and steale it,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16, 27.</note> that have no right to it, and it prove, through
their own distempers, <hi>gravell</hi> in their <hi>mouthes,</hi> or <hi>poyson</hi> in their <hi>bowells,</hi> they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59070:143"/>
must blame themselves, and their own <hi>wormewood</hi> Lusts, and not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which they doe receive; It is provided for them that feare God, and
love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, not for doggs, <hi>swine,</hi> unbelievers; we
shall not marvaile, if they <hi>trample</hi> on this <hi>pearle,</hi> and <hi>rend them that bring it;</hi>
To such as <hi>these</hi> then, I say, the Doctrine of the Perseverance of the Saints, or
the stability or unchangeablenesse of the Love of God unto Believers, and of
their continuation in Faith and Obedience, is full of exceeding effectuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and provocations unto Holinesse, in all manner of Gospell Obedience,
and holy conversation, exceedingly advantaging the soules of men in a course
thereof; Now the influence it hath into the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the Saints, floweth
from it upon a twofold account.</p>
            <p>1. By removing all <hi>discouragements</hi> whatsoever,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> that are apt either to
turne them aside from their Obedience, or to render their Obedience <hi>servile,</hi>
slavish, or unacceptable to God: it setts them (through Christ) at perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
thereunto.</p>
            <p>2. By putting unconquerable and indissoluble <hi>Obligations</hi> upon them, to
live unto God, and the praise of his glorious Grace, and evidently drawes
them forth unto the Obedience required.</p>
            <p>1. It removeth and taketh out of the way all <hi>discouragements</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
all things which are apt to enterpose to the weakning of their <hi>Faith</hi> in
God, or their <hi>Love</hi> to God, which, as hath been said, are at the bottome of
all Obedience and Holinesse, that is acceptable to God in Christ; Now these
may all be referred unto two heads.</p>
            <p>1. Of perplexing anxious <hi>fears,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> which are apt to impaire and weaken the
<hi>Faith</hi> of the Saints. 2. Of <hi>hard thoughts</hi> of God, which assault and shake
their <hi>Love.</hi> That slavish, perplexing, troublesome <hi>feares,</hi> are contrary to the
free and ingenuous state of Children, whereunto the Saints are admitted, and
(however sometimes, yea oftentimes, they are at the bottome, and the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of burthen some, servile, and superstitious Obedience) Impairers of their
Faith, I suppose, I need not labour to prove. That kind of <hi>Feare,</hi> whereof we
speake, (of which more afterwards) is the greatest Traytor, that lurkes in the
soule; To <hi>feare the Lord and his Goodnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 3. 5.</note> is the soules <hi>Keeper;</hi> but this <hi>servile</hi>
perplexing <hi>feare,</hi> is the <hi>Betrayer of it,</hi> in all its waies, and that which sowres all
its duties; A thing which the Lord sets himselfe against, in rebukes, reproofes,
dehortations, as much as any failing and miscarriage in his Saints whatever.
It is the opposite of Faith; hence the <hi>fearefull</hi> and <hi>unbelieving</hi> are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their exclusion from the <hi>new Jerusalem. Rev:</hi> 20. 8. it is that, which is
direct contrary to that, which the Apostle adviseth the Saints unto, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10.
19, 20, 21, 22. it is that which mixeth <hi>Faith</hi> with <hi>staggering, Rom: 4. 20. Prayer</hi>
with <hi>wavering,</hi> making it ineffectuall: <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 6. 7.</p>
            <p>Let us now suppose a man to have attained some assurance of the Love of
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> and <hi>Justified by Faith, to have Peace with him,</hi> (which, as to his present
condition, the Adversaries of the Doctrine of Perseverance acknowledge
that he may attaine, though, how, upon their principles, I understand not)
consider a little, how he can safegard his <hi>Peace</hi> for a moment, and deliver
himselfe from perplexing thoughts and feares, renouncing any interest in
the ingagement of the Love and Faithfulnesse of God, for his preservation. He
may say within himselfe, I am for the present in some good state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but were not the <hi>Angels</hi> so, that are now Devills in Hell? were not they
in a farre better, and more excellent state, then I am? and yet they are now
<hi>shut up under chaines of everlasting darknesse, to the judgment of the great day?
Adam</hi> in Paradise had no lust within him to tempt and seduce him, no World
under the curse to intangle and provoke him, and yet <hi>being in that honour, he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59070:144"/>
had no understanding,</hi> he abode not, but <hi>became like the beast that perisheth;</hi>
was it not in their power to persevere in that condition if they would? Did
they want any meanes that were usefull thereunto? And what hope is there
left to me,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> in whom there dwelleth <hi>no good thing, who am sold</hi> under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of sinne, and encompassed with a world of temptations, that I shall endure
unto the end? I see thousands before mine eyes, partakers of the same hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
calling with my selfe, of the same Grace in Jesus Christ, every day fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into irrecoverable perdition; There is not any <hi>Purpose</hi> of God, that I
should be preserved, nor <hi>Promise</hi> that I shall never depart from him, no <hi>prayer
of Christ,</hi> that my Faith may not faile, but I am rolled upon mine own hand,
and what will be the end of this whole undertaking of mine, in the wayes of
God, I know not. Let, I say, a man be exercised with such thoughts as these,
and then try if any thing under heaven can bring his soule to any possible
composure, untill it be <hi>cast into the mould of that Doctrine, which hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;</hi>
But of this more directly afterwards, when we come to treat of the
<hi>Consolation,</hi> which from the breast of it doth flow.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> It is exceedingly suited to the deliverance of the Soules of the Saints
from all such <hi>hard thoughts of God,</hi> as are apt to impaire and weaken their
<hi>Love</hi> towards him, and delight in him: so setting the two <hi>principles</hi> of all their
<hi>Obedience (Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>) at liberty, and free from their intanglements, to
act in the duties they are called unto; He that had hard thoughts of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Lord,</hi> as <hi>an austere man,</hi> though he was not <hi>excused</hi> in his <hi>disobedience</hi> by
it, yet he was evidently <hi>discouraged,</hi> as to his <hi>Obedience;</hi> When men shall be
taught, that God takes no more care of his Children in his <hi>family,</hi> but that
the Divell may enter in among them, and and take them away, making them
Children of Hell, when he might with the greatest Advantage of Glory
and Honour to himselfe imaginable, prevent it? That the Lord Jesus Christ,
<hi>the great Shepheard of the Sheep,</hi> takes no more care of his flock and fold, but
that the Lion, Beares, and Wolves may enter in, and make havocke, and
spoile at their pleasure? May they not think that God is little concerned in
the Salvation of his? and that all that, which is so Gloriously expressed of his
peculiar and speciall Love, carries nothing but an empty noise, the burthen
of their preservation being thrown soly upon their owne shoulders? And are
not such thoughts fitte only to cast water upon their flames of Love to God,
and insensibly to weaken that delight, which they ought alwayes to take in
the riches of his Grace and Love? Is there any thing possible more indearing
to the heart of a Creature, then to heare such a testimony, as that. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17.

are to be dealt withall, or that God deales with them, as if they were wholly

an unworthy disposition.</p>
            <p>There are two things usually spoken to the prejudice and disadvantage of<note place="margin">§: 13.</note>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:59070:144"/>
the Truth we have under Consideration, much insisted on by Mr <hi>Goodwin,
Cap:</hi> 9. As</p>
            <p>1. That a perswision of the certaine continuance of the Love of God to any one,
is a ready way to make them carelesse, negligent, and to give up themselves to all
manner of abominations.</p>
            <p>But what <hi>Vipers, Snakes,</hi> and <hi>Adders,</hi> do such men suppose the Saints of God
to be, that their <hi>new nature,</hi> their Heavenly Principles (for what the <hi>flesh</hi> in
them, is prone unto, we now consider not,) should conclude, that <hi>it is good to
sinne, that Grace may abound;</hi> that, because God Loves them with an <hi>Everlasting
Love,</hi> therefore they will hate him with a <hi>perpetuall hatred:</hi> that, because he
will assuredly give them Grace to <hi>serve him with reverence &amp; Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they will despise him, and trample on all his Goodnesse; because he will
never forsake them, that they will no more abide with him: What is in the
inner man, what is in the new Creature, what is in the nature of any Grace,
wherewith they are indowed, that is apt, or inclinable to make such hellish
Conclusions? If we heare of any such thing among the Sonnes of men, if we
see a Child, or a servant resolving to be profligate, wicked, stubborne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall,
because his Father, or Master is kind, loving, and will not disinherit
him, or put him away; we looke upon him as a monster in nature, and think
that it would be good service to the interest of mankind to take him off
from the face of earth; And yet such monsters are all the Saints of
God supposed to be, who, if their Father once give them the least
Assurance of the Continuance of his Love, they presently resolve to
doe him all the dishonour, despite, and mischeife they can: I appeale
to all the experience of all the Saints in the world, wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, if any such
thought at any time arise in them, that they may <hi>continue in sinne, because
Grace hath abounded,</hi> that they may live in all filth, and folly, because God
hath promised never to forsake them, not turne away his Love from them,
they doe not looke upon it, as an hellish abuse of the Love of God, which
they labour to crucifie, no lesse, then any other worke of the flesh whatsoever;
Presuppose indeed the Saints of God to be Dogges and swine, wholly sensuall
and unregenerate, that is, no Saints, and our Doctrine to be such, that God
will Love them, and save them continuing in that state, wherein they are, and
you make a bed for Iniquity to stretch it selfe upon; But suppose that we teach
that the <hi>wrath of God</hi> will certainly come upon the <hi>Children of disobedience,</hi>
that he <hi>that Believeth not, shall be damned,</hi> and that God will <hi>keepe</hi> his
owne <hi>by his power through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> and that in, and by the use
of meanes, they shall certainly be preserved to the end: and the mouth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity
will be stopped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. They say</hi> it takes away that strong curbe and bridle,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> which ought to be
kept in the mouth of the flesh, to keepe it from running headlong into sin and folly,
namely the feare of Hell and punishment, which alone hath an influence upon it, to
bring it to subjection, and under Obedience.</p>
            <p>But now, if there be nothing in the world, that is of use for the <hi>mortification</hi>
and crucifying of the flesh, and the lusts thereof, but it receives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
by this Doctrine, this crimination must of necessity vanish into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>1. Then, it tells that the flesh, and all the deeds thereof, are to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
and slaine, <hi>God having ordained good workes for us to walke in;</hi> That for
the workes of the flesh <hi>the wrath of God comes upon the Children of disobedience;</hi>
&amp; if any say, <hi>let us continue in sinne because we are not under the Law, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
power of it for sinne, but under Grace,</hi> it cries out, <hi>God for bid. Rom.</hi> 6.
15, 16. And saith, this is Argument enough, and Proofe snfficient, that <hi>sinne
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59070:145"/>
shall not have dominion over us, because we are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi>
It tells you also, that there is a twofold <hi>feare</hi> of Hell, and punishment of
sinne.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>of Anxietie,</hi> and doubtfullnesse, in respect of the end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Of Care</hi> and diligence, that respecteth the meanes.</p>
            <p>And for the first it saith, that this is the portion of very many of the Saints
of God, of some all their dayes, though they are so, yet they know not that
they are so; and therefore are under anxious and doubtfull feares of Hell, and
Punishment, notwithstanding that they are in the armes of their Father, from
whence indeed they shall not be cast downe; as a man bound with chaines on
the toppe of a tower, he cannot but feare, and yet he cannot fall; He cannot
fall, because he is fast bound with strong chaines: He cannot but feare, because
he cannot actually, and clearely consider, often times, the meanes of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
            <p>And for the latter, a feare of the wayes and meanes leading to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as such, that continues upon all the Saints of God in this life; neither is
there any thing in this Doctrine, that is suited to a removall thereof. And
this, it saies, is more, much more of use for the mortification of the flesh, then
the former.</p>
            <p>2. It sayes, that the great and Principall meanes, of mortification of the
flesh, is not feare of Hell and Punishment, but the Spirit of Christ, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
tells us. <hi>Rom. 8. 13. If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the flesh,
yee shall live.</hi> It is the Spirit of Christ alone, that is able to do this great
Worke; We know, what bondage and Religious drudgery some have put
themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon this account, and yet could never in their lives attaine
to the mortification of any one sinne. It is the Spirit of Christ alone, that hath
soveraigne power in our soules, of killing and making alive; As no man
quickneth his owne soule, so no man upon any Consideration whatsoever, or
by the power of any threatnings of the Law, can kill his own sinne; There was
never any one sinne truly mortified by the Law, or the threatning of it; All
that the Law can do, of it selfe, is but to intangle sinne, and thereby to irritate,
&amp; provoke it, like a Bull in a net, or a beast lead to the slaughter. It is the
Spirit of Christin the Gospell, that cuts its throate &amp; destroyes it; Now this
Doctrine was never in the least charged with denying the Spirit of God to
Believers, which whilst it doth grant &amp; maintaine, in a way of opposition to
that late Opinion, which advanceth it selfe against it, it maintaines the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the flesh, and the lusts thereof, upon the only true, and unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
foundations.</p>
            <p>3. It tells you, that the great meanes, whereby the Spirit of Christ work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the mortification of the flesh, and the Lusts thereof, is the Application of
the Crosse of Christ, and his Death, and Love therein, unto the soule; and
saies, that those vaine endeavours, which some promote and encourage, for
the mortification of sinne, consisting for the most part, in slavish, bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
are to be bewayled with teares of bloud, as abominations, that seduce
poore soules from the Crosse of Christ; For it saies, this work is truly, and in an
acceptable manner only performed, when we are <hi>planted into the likenesse of
the death of Christ, having our old man crucified with him, and the body of sinne
destroyed. Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 6. and thereupon by Faith <hi>reckoning our selves dead unto
sinne, but alive unto God.</hi> v. 11. It is done only by <hi>knowing the fellowship of the
sufferings of Christ, and being made conformable to his death. Phil. 3. 10. by the
Crosse of Christ is the world crucified unto us, and we unto the world.</hi> The Spirit
brings home the power of the Crosse of Christ to the soule, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
of this work; and without it, it will not be done: Moreover it saies,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59070:145"/>
that by the way of motive to this duty, there is nothing comes with that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
upon the soule, as the love of Christ in his death, as the Apostle assures
us. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. for the Love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge, that
if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which
live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him, which died for them,
and rose againe:</hi> now it was never laid to the charge of this Doctrine, that it
took off from the vertue of the Death and Crosse of Christ, but rather on the
contrary, though falsely, that it ascribed too much thereunto; so that (these
importune exceptions notwithstanding) the Doctrine in hand doth not only
maintaine its own innocency, as to any tendency unto loosenesse, but also
manifestly declareth its own usefulnesse to all ends and purposes of Gospell
Obedience whatsoever; For,</p>
            <p>3. It stirres up,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> provokes, and drawes out into action, every thing, that is
free, noble, ingenuous, filiall, and of an heavenly descent in the Saints of God;
thus:</p>
            <p>1. It strengthens their Faith in God, and in Jesus Christ, which is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of all acceptable Obedience whatsoever; All that, which proceedeth
from any other Roote, being but a product of labouring in the fire, which in
the end will consume both Root and Branch. That which prevailes upon,
and drawes out the soule to <hi>Faith</hi> and believing, I meane, as it is peculiar to
the Gospell, and <hi>Justifying,</hi> that is, as it is in God as a Father, and in the Lord
Christ as a Mediator, is the discovery of the good will of God to the soule in
Christ, and his designe to advance his Glory thereby; I speake not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
cause of Faith in generall, but the peculiar motive to Faith, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the sence before mentioned. So our Saviour giving the command in
generall to his Disciples <hi>Ioh. 14 1. ye believe in God, believe also in mee,</hi> in the
whole ensuing Chapter, provokes them to it, with gratious discoveries of the
good will of God; his Fathers, and his own good will towards them; And
indeed, propose what other considerations ye will, provoke the soule by all
the feare and dread of Hell, and the most dismall representation of the wrath
to come, untill it be convinced of this, it will never take one steppe towards
God in Christ; Now <hi>our Adversaries themselves being Judges,</hi> the Doctrine we
have had under consideration, abounds above all others with the discoveries
of the good will and kindnesse of God to poore sinners; yea the great crime,
that is laid to the charge of it, is, that it extends it too farre; it doth not only
assert, that God freely <hi>beginnes the good worke in them,</hi> but that he will also
powerfully <hi>perfect it to the day of Jesus Christ;</hi> It assures the soules of the
poore Saints of God, that he, who lookt upon them <hi>in their bloud, and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them Live, when no eye pittied them; who quickned them, when they were dead
in trespasses and in sinnes, begetting them of his own will, by the word of Truth,
that they should be a kind of first fruits to himselfe, wasting them in the bloud of
his Sonne,</hi> and delivering them from the old Tyrant Satan, that he will not
now leave them to themselves, and to the Counsell of their own hands, to
stand or fall according as they shall of themselves, and by themselves, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to withstand opposition and seduction: but that he will keep them in his
own hand, giving them such constant supplies of his Grace and Spirit; as that
in the use of meanes, they shall waite upon him to the end; And that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
or whensoever, by the power of Temptation, and surprisalls of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
they are carried aside from him, he will <hi>heale their back-slidings, and
receive them freely,</hi> and though they change every day, yet <hi>he changeth not, and
therefore they are not consumed.</hi> And hereby, I say, it confirmes and strengthens
their Faith in God, as a Father in Jesus Christ, taking everlasting care of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59070:146"/>
2. Of their <hi>Love</hi> there is the same reason; Gods love to us is of his free
Grace; he loves us because so it seemes good to him; Our Love to him, is
purely ingenerated by his Love to us, and carried on, and increased by farther
Revelations of his desireablenesse and excellency, to our soules; <hi>Herein is Love,
not that we loved God, but that he loved us first:</hi> There is no Creature in the
least guilty of sinne, that can put forth any acceptable Act of Love towards
God, but what is purely drawn out, upon the Apprehension of his Love and
lovelinesse in his Grace and mercy; A man, I confesse, may love God, when
he hath no sence of his Love to him in particular: but it must all be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an apprehension of his Love to sinners, though he may come short in the
Application; it is the <hi>terrour</hi> of the Lord, that causes us to <hi>perswade others,</hi> but
it is the <hi>Love of Christ that constraineth us</hi> to live to him. Shee loved much, to
whom much was forgiven; Looke then, the more abundant discoveries are
made of the lovelinesse and desirablenesse in the riches of his Grace, the more
effectuall is the sole and only motive we have to love him, with that fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iall,
chast, Holy Love, that he requires.</p>
            <p>For the Love of God to his Saints, our Doctrine of their Perseverance, sets
it forth, with the greatest Advantage, for the indearement of their soules, to
draw out their streames of Love to God; especially doth it give it its Glory in
three things.</p>
            <p>1. In its <hi>freedome;</hi> It setts forth the Love of God to his Saints, as that
which they have no way in the least deserved, as hath been manifested from
<hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 8, 9, 11. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 54. 9, 10. As he first loved them, not because they were
better then others, being by nature <hi>Children of wrath,</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> in their
Blood, <hi>when he said to them Live, quickning them when they were dead in
trespasses and sinnes:</hi> So he doth not continue his love to them, nor
purpose so to do, because he fore sees, that they will so, &amp; so, walke with him
in Holinesse &amp; uprightnesse (for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oresees no such thing in them, but what
he himselfe purposeth effectually to worke, upon the account of his loving
them) but he resolves to do it, meerely upon the account of his owne Grace;
He neither resolves to continue his Love to them, on Condition that they be
so and so holy, at randome, and with uncertainty of the Event, but <hi>freely</hi>
that they may and shall be so.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> And this is the Glory of <hi>Love,</hi> the most <hi>Orient
pearl</hi> in the <hi>Crowne,</hi> of it: 'Tis not mercenary nor selfe-ended, nor deserved;
but, as a Spring and fountaine, freely vents and powers out it selfe upon its
owne account: And what ingenuous, truly noble, Heavenly descended heart
can hold out against the power of this Love? It is effectually constraining to
all manner of sutable returnes; let the soule but put it selfe in to the actuall
Contemplation of the Love of God, as it lyes represented in this property of
it, <hi>every way free, undeserved,</hi> the great Love of <hi>God,</hi> to a poore <hi>worme,</hi> a <hi>sinner,</hi>
a <hi>nothing;</hi> and it cannot but be wrought to a serious Admiration of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in it, and be pained and straitned, untill it make some suitable Returnes
of Love and Obedience unto God; If not, it may well doubt it never tasted
of that Love, or enjoyed any fruits of it.</p>
            <p>2. It gives the Love of God the Glory of its <hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>Unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
This is another <hi>Starre</hi> of an eminent <hi>Magnitude</hi> in the <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi>
It is not a fading, a wavering, an altering thing, but abides for ever; God
rests in his <hi>Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. It is a great thing indeed, to apprehend that the
great God should fixe his Love upon a poore Creature. But adde hereunto,
that he may love them one day, and hate them the next, embrace them one
houre, and the next cast them into Hell, one day rejoycing over them with
joy; another rejoycing to destroy them, as it is dishonorable to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to all his Divine Excellencies, and Perfections: so in particular, it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59070:146"/>
clotheth his Love, with the most uncomly and undesirable Garment, that
ever was put upon the Affections of the meanest worme of the earth; What
can ye say more contemptible of a man? more to his dishonour among all wise
and knowing men, or that shall render his Respects and Affections more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desirable,
then to say, He is free of his Love indeed, but he <hi>abides</hi> not in it?
What a world of Examples have we of those, who have been in his bosome,
and have againe been cast out? Though among men something may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in excuse of this, with respect unto their ignorance, the shortnesse of
their foresight, disability to discern between things &amp; appearances; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God, <hi>before whom all things are open &amp; naked,</hi> in whose eye all inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp; Events lye as clearely stated, as things, that are already passed and gone,
what can be said of such a vaine supposall, for the vindication of his Glory?
It is said, that <hi>men change from what they were, when God loved them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his love changeth also:</hi> But who first made them fit to be Beloved? Did
not the Lord? Do they make themselves differ from others? On what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
did he do it? was it not merely on the acount of his owne Grace? Can
he not as well preserve them in a state of being beloved, as put them into it?
And if he determined that he would not preserve them in that Condition,
why did he set his Love upon them, when himselfe knew that he would not
continue it to them? was it only to give his <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>dishonour</hi> of a <hi>Change?</hi> I say
then, the Doctrine contended for, gives the Love of God the Glory of its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability,
asserts it to be like himselfe, Unchangeable, that there is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
in its selfe, the <hi>least shaddow of turning;</hi> it may be eclipsed and obscured,
as to its beames and influences, for a season: but changed, turned away, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be. And this consideration of it renders it to the soules of the Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimably
precious: the very thought of it, considering that nothing else
could possibly save, or preserve them, is marrow to their bones, and health
to their soules, and makes them cry out to all that is within them, to love
the Lord, and to live unto him.</p>
            <p>3. It gives it the Glory of its <hi>Fruitfulnesse:</hi> A barren Love is upon the
matter no Love. Love that hath no breasts, no bowels, that pitties not, that
assists not, deserves not that Heavenly name: Will ye say shee is a tender,
<hi>loving</hi> mother, who can looke on a languishing, perishing Child, yea see a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous
beast, whom yet she could easily drive away, take it out of her armes,
and devoure it before her face, and not put forth her strength, for its assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or deliverance? Or will ye say, shee is a Tygre, and a monster in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
And shall we faigne such a Love in God towards his Children, which is
such that all the bowells of a tender Parent to an only Child, are but as a
<hi>drop</hi> to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> in comparison of it? As that he lookes on whilest they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and perish, fall, sinke, and dye away into everlasting calamity; yea that
notwithstanding it, he will suffer the Roaring Lyon to come and snatch them
away out of his Armes, and devoure them before his face. That he will look
upon them sinking into eternall separation from him, and such destruction,
as that it had been infinitely better for them never to have been borne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
putting forth his Power, and the efficacy of his Grace for their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Ah foolish people and unwise! shall we thus requite the Lord?</hi> as to render
him so hard a Master, so cruell a Father to his tender ones, the Lambs of his
Sonne, washed in his Bloud, quickned by his Spirit, owned by him, smiled
on, embraced ten thousand times, as to suffer them so to be taken out of his
hands? Is there nothing in his Love to cause his <hi>Bowells</hi> to <hi>move,</hi> and his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings</hi>
to be <hi>kindled together</hi> towards a poore dying Child, that surely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
not, without some sad lookes towards his Father? <hi>Nemo repentè fit tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pissimus.</hi>
Is this the kindnesse, which he exalteth above the Love of a Woman
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59070:147"/>
to her sucking Child, of a Mother to the fruit of her Wombe? Oh that men
should dare thus foolishly to charge the Almighty, to ascribe such a barren
fruitlesse Love to <hi>him, who is Love,</hi> towards his Children, who are as the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his eye,</hi> his deare and tender ones, as would be a perpetuall blot and
staine to any earthly Parent, to have righteously ascribed to him; I say then,
our Doctrine gives the Love of God the Glory of its <hi>fruitfulnesse.</hi> It asserts it
to be such a <hi>Fountaine-love,</hi> as from whence continually streames of Grace,
kindnesse, mercy, and Refreshment doe flow: because he <hi>loves</hi> us with <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Love,</hi> therefore he <hi>drawes us</hi> with <hi>Loving-kindnesse. Ier.</hi> 30. 1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from
that Love proceeds continuall supplies of the Spirit and Grace, by which those,
of whom it is said, they <hi>abide,</hi> are preserved lovely, and fit by him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.
It tells us, that because God loves his people, therefore are they <hi>in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hand. Deut:</hi> 33. 3. It declares it to be such a Love, as is the Wombe of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
whence pardon, healing, recovery from wounds, sicknesses, and dying
pangs doe continually flow; A Love upon the account whereof, the Persons
loved may make conclusion, that they shall <hi>lack nothing. Psal.</hi> 23. 1. A Love
whose fruitfulnesse is <hi>subservient</hi> to its own constancy, preserving the Saints
such, as he may rest in it unchangeably. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. A Love, whereby God
<hi>sings</hi> to his <hi>vineyard, watches over it, and waters it every moment. Isa.</hi> 27. 2, 3.
And now what flint almost in the Rock of stone, would not be softned and
dissolved by this Love? When we shall think, that it is from the Love of God,
that our wasted portion hath been so often renewed, that our dying Graces
have been so often quickned, our dreadfull back-slidings so often healed,
our breaches and decayes so often repaired, and the pardon of our innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
transgressions so often sealed, unlesse we suck the breasts of Tygers, and

               </gap>luences, that it
will have upon our soules; Thus I say, doth the Doctrine, which we have in
hand, set out the Love of God unto us in his eminent endearing properties,
wherein, he being embraced through Christ, a Foundation is laid, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
promotion given unto the Holinesse and Obedience, which he requireth
of us.</p>
            <p>2. This Doctrine renders Jesus Christ lovely to our soules, to the soules of
Believers;<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> It represents him to them, as the <hi>Standard bearer to ten thousand,</hi> as
one <hi>altogether lovely:</hi> As exceeding desireable in the work of his <hi>Oblation,</hi>
lovely and amiable in the work of his <hi>Intercession,</hi> as hath been manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</p>
            <p>1. It imports him as one, who in his death hath <hi>made an end</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy</hi>
between God and our soules. <hi>Dan. 9. 39. Becoming our peace. Eph.</hi> 2.
14. <hi>having obtained for us Eternall Redemption.</hi> That he hath not suffered all
that sorrow, anguish, paine, torment, dereliction, whereunto for our sakes
he was given up, and willingly exposed himselfe, for an uncertaine end, not
<hi>fighting, in his death, as one beating the ayre,</hi> nor leaving his worke in the dust,
to be trampled on, or taken up, as it seemes good to us, in our polluted,
darke, dead estate of nature: But hath filled it with such immortall seed, that
of it selfe, by it selfe, and its own unconquerable Efficacy, it hath sprung up,
to the bringing forth of that whole fruit intended in it, and the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the ends aimed at by it. That is, that it shall certainely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
bring all those to God, for whom he offered, by Sanctifying, Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and preserving them, through the Communication of his owne Spirit
and Grace to them, for that end and purpose, <hi>All his Promises being yea and
Amen, in him,</hi> confirmed by his death. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 20. Heb.</hi> 10. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
Some of those, who indeed abuse the Truth we have insisted on, pretend to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59070:147"/>
grant, <hi>That by his death he made satisfaction for sinne, but only on condition
that men believe on him, and continue so doing; That they shall so believe, and so
continue (though he is said to be the Captaine of our Salvation, and the Author
and finisher of our Faith, though it be given unto us for his sake, to believe on him;
and we are blessed with all spirituall blessings in heavenly places in him,) that he
takes no care about, beyond the generall administration of outward meanes. He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
procured any such thing by his Oblation, nor doth intercede for it; these things
are left unto men to be educed, drawne forth, and exercised by virtue of sundry
considerations, that they may take upon themselves.</hi> Never doubtlesse did men
take more paines, to staine the beauty and comelinesse of our dying Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>2. For his <hi>Intercession,</hi> the Doctrine hitherto insisted on, renders him
therein exceeding lovely and desireable. It tells you, that he doth <hi>pray the
Father,</hi> and thereupon <hi>sends us the Comforter,</hi> the Holy Spirit, for all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
acts and works, ends and purposes before mentioned, with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
other priviledges that the Saints by him are made partakers of, and that
to abide with us for ever, never to leave us, nor forsake us. That he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>appears in the presence of God for us,</hi> interceding that our Faith may not
faile, pleading for us, in, and under all our decayes, making out to us sutable
supplies in all our Distresses, Temptations, Tryalls, Troubles, taking care
that <hi>no Temptation befall us,</hi> but that a <hi>way also of escape be given to us, together
with it.</hi> It tells us his Eye, even now he is in glory, is still upon us, seeing
our wants, taking notice of our weaknesse, and providing for us, as his only
concernment in the World, that we be not lost; That he hath not left one
jot of that kindnesse, which he bare to his flock, his Lambs, his little ones.
But pursues with all his strength, and all the interest he hath in Heaven, the
worke of their Salvation, which he came from his Fathers bosome to enter
on, and returned to him againe, to carry it on unto perfection; That, as the
<hi>High Priest</hi> of old, he beares our names in his breast, and on his shoulders
continually before his Father: So that in all our falls and failings, when wee
are in our selves helpelesse and hopelesse, when there is nothing in us, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us, that can doe us any good, or yeeld us any help or Consolation, yet
on this account we may say, <hi>the Lord is our Shepheard, we shall lack nothing.</hi>
He hath undertaken for us, and will beare us in his Armes, untill he bring us
to the bosome of his Father. Now whether such cosiderations as these, of
the <hi>Oblation</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ, doe not fill his Love in them, with a
more constraining efficacy, and more draw out the hearts of the Saints unto
Faith and Love, then any instruction can doe, informing men of the useles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the one or other of these eminent Acts of his Mediation, for any of
the ends and Purposes mentioned, let Believers judge. That which men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon in their greatest necessities, and for the things of the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement,
thereof they have the greatest valuation, and the thoughts of it
are most fixed in their minds. What is there of so great concernement in this
World unto the Saints, as their abiding with God unto the end? How many,
how great, urging, pressing, are the difficulties, dangers, troubles they meet
withall in their so doing? What then they have most frequent recourse unto,
and what they rest most upon under their pressures, in the things of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement
before mentioned, that will deserve the name of their Treasure,
where their hearts will and ought to be. Now if this (setting aside, as things
of no Consideration in such a case, the <hi>Purposes, Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> of
God, the <hi>Oblation</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Lord Christ) be mens own rationall
Abilities, to consider what is for their good, and what will be hurtfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to them; what can hinder but that men will, (yea and that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59070:148"/>
should) spend the flower and best of their Affections, upon, and about
themselves and their own Wisdome, in and for their preservation; That
doubtlesse will take up their hearts and thoughts; so that there will be very
little roome left for the entertainement of the Lord Jesus Christ, with any
regard or respect on this account. If that then may passe, which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid downe, namely that the Doctrines and things, which are Apt and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the ingenerating, quickning, increasing, and building up of Faith and
Love towards God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, are the most eminent Gospell
motives, to spirituall acceptable Obedience, (as it is an unquestionable
Truth and certainty) doubtlesse that Doctrine which represents the Father
&amp; Sonne, so rich in mercy, so loving &amp; lovely to the soule, as that doth, which
we insist upon, must needs have a most effectuall influence into that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>4. The Doctrine insisted on,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> hath an effectuall influence into the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Saints, upon the account of giving it its proper place, and setting
it aright upon its basis, carrying it on in due order; It neither puts upon it
the fetters of the Law, nor turnes it loose from the Holy and righteous Rule
of it; Let men be as industrious as can be imagined, in the performance of all
commanded duties, yet if they doe it on legall motives, and for legall ends,
all their performances are vitiated, and all their duties rejected; This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
asserts against the Jewes, <hi>Rom: 9. 31. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought for righteousnesse, but as
it were by the workes of the Law,</hi> and therefore he tells them <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 3. That
<hi>being ignorant of Gods Righteousnesse, and going about to establish their own
Righteousnesse, they did not submit to the Righteousnesse of God;</hi> And the <hi>Papists</hi>
will one day find a <hi>fire</hi> proceeding out of their Doctrine of merits, <hi>consuming</hi>
all their <hi>good Workes,</hi> as <hi>hay and stubble.</hi> There are also many other waies and
principles, whereby Obedience is vitiated, and rendred an abomination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Sacrifice, wherein our Doctrine is no sharer; But this I must not enter
into, because it would lead me into other Controversies, which with this I
shall not intermixe.</p>
            <p>5. It naturally and sweetly mixeth with all the Ordinances of Christ,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
for the end under Consideration. In particular, with that great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<hi>The Ministry of the Gospell,</hi> in reference to the great fruit and effect
of it mentioned. <hi>Eph. 4. 12, 13. The perfecting of the Saints, the edifying of the
Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of
the sonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ.</hi> That which the Lord Jesus aimed at, and intended principally,
in giving <hi>Pastors and Teachers</hi> to his Church, was that they might carry on the
worke of the Ministry, for the <hi>Perfecting</hi> of the Saints, and their filling up the
measure alotted unto them; And this they do by revealing the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of God unto them, keeping back nothing that's pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itable for them
as was the practice of <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 20. 27. Of this Councell or Will of God, as
by them managed, there are two parts.</p>
            <p>1. The discovery of God to them, and his Will, as to the state and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
whereto he calls them, and which he requires them to come up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
And this consists in doctrines, revealing God and his Will; which contain
Rules, and Precepts for men to walke by, and yeild Obedience unto.</p>
            <p>2. That which is suited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the carrying on of men in the state and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
whereunto they are called, according to the mind of God, as also to
prevaile with them, to whom the Word doth come, to enter into the state of
Obedience, and walking with God: and this is usually branched into three
generall heads of <hi>Promises, Exhortations,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings;</hi> The management
of these aright with power and efficacy, with <hi>Evidence and demonstration of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59070:148"/>
the Spirit,</hi> is no small part, yea it is the greatest part of the worke of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
the greatest portion of what is Doctrinall in the Word or Booke of
God, relating to these heads; And of this part of that Ordinance of Christ,
the <hi>Ministry of the Word,</hi> the pressing of men into a state of Obedience, and to a
pogresse in that estate, by <hi>Promises, Exhortations,</hi> &amp; <hi>Threatnings,</hi> I shall briefely
speake, either by way of Demonstration and proofe of what lieth before me,
or vindication of what is affirmed in the same kind, from the Objections and
Exceptions of <hi>Him</hi> in particular, with whom I have to doe; aiming still at my
former Assertion, that the Doctrine I have insisted on, naturally and clearly
closeth with those Promises and Exhortations, to help on their efficacy and
energy for the accomplishment of the work intended.</p>
            <p>For the first, let us take a tast of the <hi>Promises,</hi> which are, as it were,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> the very
life &amp; beauty of the Covenant of Grace, and the Glory of the Ministry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto men: and they are of two sorts, both of which have their effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
influence into the obedience of Saints.</p>
            <p>1. There are promises, which expresse only the worke of Gods grace, and
what he will freely doe, in, &amp; upon the hearts of his thereby, as to the working
Holinesse, and Obedience in them, as also of his pardoning mercy, in his free
acceptance of them in Jesus Christ: And these are in a peculiar manner, those
<hi>better Promises</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, upon the account whereof, it is so
exceedingly exalted above that of Workes, which by sinne was broken and
disanulled. <hi>Heb:</hi> 8. 6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>2. There are Promises of what Good and great things, God will farther
doe unto, and for them who obey him. As that he will keepe them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, that they shall not be lost,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> that their labour and Obedience shall
end in the enjoyment of God himselfe, with an immortall Crowne of Glory
which shall never fade away. Now the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance,
and the stability of the Love of God unto them, closeth with the Promises of
both these sorts, as to the end of carrying on, &amp; increasing Obedience &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
in them; Take an instance in the first. The Promises of the worke of
Gods Grace in us and towards us are effectuall, as appointed to this end; so in
that Great word <hi>Gen:</hi> 17. 1. which the Apostle calls <hi>the Promise. Gal. 4. I am
God Almighty,</hi> I am so and will be so to thee, and that for, and to all ends and
purposes of the Covenant whatsoever. The inference is, <hi>walke before me
and be thou perfect;</hi> Walking with God in uprightnesse and sincerity, is the
proper fruit in us, of the Promise of God to us, to be our <hi>all sufficient</hi> God in
Covenant. As <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. our becoming the People of God, in walking with
him in all waies of Obedience, is the effect of his Promise <hi>to be our God, and
to write his Law in our hearts;</hi> not only because by the Grace of the Promise,
we are brought into a state of Acceptance, and made the People of God, but
also upon the account of the ingagement, that is put upon us, by that gracious
Promise, to live unto him; Whence in the close it is affirmed, <hi>we shall be his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
The word of the Gospell, or the word of Faith, doth mainly consist in this:
And what the aime of that is, the Apostle declares. <hi>Titus 2. 11, 12. The Grace of
God, which appeareth unto us, teacheth us to deny all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts,
and to live soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present world.</hi> Which generall
purport of the Promises in this way, is farther asserted 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having
then,</hi> saith he, <hi>these Promises, Let us cleanse our selves from all silthinesse of flesh
and spirit, perfecting Holinesse in the feare of the Lord.</hi> And most eminently, is
this assigned to the Promises of that sort, which we now peculiarly insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1. 3. 4. To know the way, whereby these, or any other Promises are
effectuall to the end and purpose intimated, two things are considerable.
<hi>First,</hi> what is required to make them so effectuall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> wherein, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59070:149"/>
how they doe exert that efficacy that is in them. For the <hi>First,</hi> the Apostle
acquaints us, on what account alone it is, that they come to be usefull in this
or any other kind: <hi>Heb: 4 2. the word of the Gospell,</hi> the Promise Preached to
them of old, <hi>did not profit them,</hi> did them no good at all; And the reason of
this sad successe in the Preaching of the Gospell, and Declaration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
he gives you in the same words; It is, that <hi>the word was not mixed with
Faith in them that heard it;</hi> It is the <hi>mixing</hi> of the Promises with <hi>Faith,</hi> that
renders them usefull and profitable; Now to what ever Faith is required, the
more firme, strong, and stable it is, the more effectuall and usefull it is; That
then, which is apt to establish Faith, to support and strengthen it, to preserve
it from <hi>staggering,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20.</note> that renders the Promise most usefull and effectuall for
the Accomplishment of any worke, whereunto it is designed. Now Faith in
the Promises, respects the Accomplishment of the things promised; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
tells us in that <hi>commended,</hi> and <hi>never enough imitated</hi> Example of the
<hi>Faith of Abraham. Rom 4. 19, 20, 21. Being not weake in Faith, he considered not
his own body, now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the
deadnesse of Sarahs wombe he staggered not at the Promise of God through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
but was strong in Faith, giving glory to God, being fully perswaded that what
he had promised, he was able also to performe;</hi> Laying aside all considerations
that might tend to the impairing of his confidence, he firmely believed, that
it should be to him, as God had promised. That the Doctrine we insisted on,
is clearly conducing to the establishing of Faith in the Promises, cannot tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
be called into Question. Whatsoever is in those Promises, whatsoever
Considerations, or concernements of him whose they are, as his Faithfulnesse,
Unchangeablenesse, &amp; Omnipotency, that are apt to strengthen Faith in them,
it preserves entire and exalteth; It is a wild Assertion, which men scarce
search their own hearts, (if indeed men know what belongs to believing in
sincerity) when they make: that the efficacy of the Promises unto our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
should arise from hence, that the things promised may not be fulfilled:
and that the weaknesse of Faith, (as every such supposall doth at least wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it, yea and tends to its subversion) should render the Promise usefull,
which hath no use at all, but as it is <hi>mixed with Faith;</hi> For instance, those
Promises, that God will be an <hi>All-sufficient</hi> God unto us, that he will <hi>circumcise
our Hearts, and write his Law in them, that we shall feare him,</hi> is, as was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
before, an usefull Meditation, for the ingenerating and quickning of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Holinesse in us; That it may be such a meanes, it is required, that
it be <hi>mixt with Faith</hi> in them that heare it, as was declared. According as
Faith is strong or weake, so will its usefulnesse be; I aske then, whether this
be a way proper to set this Promise on worke, for the end proposed, namely
to perswade them that should believe it, that all this may be otherwise; God
may cease to be their God, their hearts may not be circumcised, nor the Law
mentioned written in them? Is this the way to strengthen their Faith, and to
keepe them from staggering? Or rather to subvert, and cast downe all their
confidence to the ground? The Doctrine we have under consideration, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
sounds in the eares of Believers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 9.</note> that God is faithfull in all his Promises,
that he can, that he will make them good, that his own Excellencies, his own
Perfections require no lesse at his hands; And this it doth, not on any Grounds
that carry any thing with them, that may seeme to incline to the least neglect
of God, or contempt of any Property, Excellency, or word of his, and so be
apt to breed presumption, and not Faith: But on such only, as give him the
Glory of all, that he hath revealed of himselfe unto us: and therefore its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
tendency must be, to beget and increase precious &amp; saving Faith in the
hearts of men, which we conceive to lye in a more direct way of efficacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59070:149"/>
Holinesse, and Obedience, then the ingenerating of servile feares
gendering unto bondage, can do.</p>
            <p>This then we have obtained; first that the Promises peculiarly insisted on,
are motives to, &amp; furtherances of Obedience; secondly, that the way, whereby
they become so, is by being mixed with Faith; and the stronger Faith is, the
more effectuall will the working of those Promises unto Holinesse be; thirdly,
that the Doctrine of the Perserverance of the Saints, and stability of God's
Love to them, giving him the Glory of all his Excellencies, which in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are to be considered, is suited to the carrying on of Faith, in its growth
and increase. Indeed, that which makes our beliefe of the Promises of <hi>Faith
divine,</hi> is the rise it hath, and the bottome whereinto it is resolved; <hi>viz.</hi> The
Excellencies of him, who makes the Promises: As that he is <hi>True,</hi> Faithfull,
Alsufficient; the Glory of all which is given him in Believing, as the Apostle
informes us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20, 21. Yea and all this He must be received to be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the accomplishment of his Promises, or we Believe them not with
divine, supernaturall, (if that terme may be allowed) and saving Faith.
Surely they must needs think us very easie of beliefe, and wholly unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
of any Communion with God, who shall suppose that we will be
perswaded, that the Doctrine which eminently asserts and ascribes unto
God, the Glory of all his Attributes, which he would have us to eye in his
Promises, strengthning Faith on that account, doth annihilate the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the Word of the Ministry, as to their usefulnesse unto our Obedience.
Let us deale by instance: God hath promised to <hi>begin and perfect a good worke
in us:</hi> according as this Promise is <hi>mixt with Faith,</hi> so it will be usefull and
profitable to us; If there be no Faith it will be of no use: if little, of little; if
more, of more; Let a man now be supposed to be wavering about his <hi>mixing
this Promise with Faith,</hi> whereupon the issue of its Efficacy and Fruitfulnesse
(as was said,) doth depend: And let the Doctrine we teach be called in, to
speake in this Case, and let us trye whether what it saies be prejudiciall to
establishment of Faith, or whether it be not all that lookes towards its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
It saies then unto the soule of a Believer, why art thou so cast
downe, thou poore soule? And why are thy thoughts perplexed within thee?
It is true thou art weake, unstable, ready to fall away, and to perish: thy
temptations are many, great, and prevalent, and thou hast no strength to
stand against the power, and multitude of them. But looke a little upon him,
who hath promised, that thou shalt never depart from him; who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to finish the good worke begun; he is Unchangeable in his Purposes,
Faithfull in his Promises, and will put forth the <hi>exceeding greatnesse of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
for the Accomplishment of them, so that though thou failest, he will cause
thee to renue thy strength, though thou fallest, thou shalt not be cast downe:
He hath undertaken to worke, and who shall let him? The Councell of his
heart, (as to the fulfilling of it) doth not depend on any thing in us; what
sinne thou art overtaken withall, he will pardon and will effectually supply
thee with his Spirit, that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thou shalt not fall into, or continue in such sinnes,
as would cut off thy Communion with him; And doth not this mixe the
forementioned Promises with Faith, and so render it effectuall to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of the worke of Love and Obedience, as was mentioned? And as this
Doctrine is suited to the establishment of the soule in Believing, and to the
stirring of men up to mixe the the Promises with Faith, so there is not any
thing that is, or canbe thought more effectuall, to the weakening, impairing,
and shattering of the Faith of the Saints, then that which is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
as shall afterwards be more fully manifested. Tell a soule, that God will
write his Law in him, and put his feare in his inward partes, that he shall
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59070:150"/>
never depart from him, what can ye pitch upon possibly to unsettle him, as
to a perswasion of the Accomplishment of this Promise, and that it shall be
so indeed, as God hath spoken, but only this: according as thou behavest thy
selfe, (which is left unto thee,) so shall this be made good, or come short of
accomplishment; If thou continue to walke with God, (which that thou shalt
do, he doth not promise, but upon Condition thou walke with him,) it shall
be well: and if thou turne aside, which thou mayst do, notwithstanding any
thing here spoken, or intimated, then the word spoken shall be of none effect,
the Promise shall not be fulfilled towards thee? I know not what the most
malicious Devill in Hell (if they have degrees of malice) can invent more sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to weaken the Faith of men, as to the accomplishment of Gods Promise,
then by affirming, that it doth not depend upon his Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but solely on their good behaviour, which he doth not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
provide, that it shall be such, as is required thereunto; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath long since determined this difference, might he be attended
unto.</p>
            <p>What hath been spoken of the Promises of the first sort, might also be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
concerning those of the second; And the like might also be cleared
up, in reference to those other <hi>weapons of Ministers warfare, in casting downe
the strong holds of sinne in the hearts of men,</hi> to wit, <hi>Exhortations</hi> and <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath taken great paines, both in the generall, to
prove the unsuitablenesse of our Doctrine to the promotion of Obedience,
and an Holy Conversation: and in particular, its inconsistency with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
and Threatnings of the Word, managed by the Ordinances of the
Ministry. What is needfull farther to be added, to the purpose in hand, will
fall in with our vindication &amp; rescuing of the Truth from the false crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherewith it is assaulted, and reproached, as to this particular: And
therefore I shall immediately addresse myselfe to the Consideration of his
long Indictment, and charge against the Doctrine of the Perseverance of the
Saints, as to this very thing.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>1. The Entrance into an Answer to Mr G's Arguments against the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance:
His sixt Argument about the usefulnesse of the Doctrine under consideration to the worke of the
Ministry proposed. 2. His pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ofe of the minor Proposition. 3. Considered and Answered.
Many pretenders to promote Godlinesse by false Doctrines. M. G.'s common interest in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
4. His proofes of the usefulnesse of his Doctrine unto the promotion of Godlinesse. 5.
Considered and Answered. The inconsequence of his Arguing discovered. 6. The Doctrine by
him opposed, mistaken, ignorantly or wilfully. 7. Objections proposed by Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> G. to himselfe to
be Answered. 8. The Objection, as proposed, disowned. Certainty of the Love of God, in what
sence a motive to Obedience. 9. The Doctrine of Apostasy denies the unchangeablenesse of
Gods Love to Believers: placeth Qualifications in the Roome of persons. 10. How the Doctrine
of Perseverance promiseth the continuance of the Love of God to Believers. 11. Certainty of
Reward, incouraging to regular Actions. Promises made to Persons qualified, not suspended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those Qualifications. Meanes appointed of God for the accomplishment of a determined end,
certaine. 12. Meanes not alwaies conditions. 13, M. G's strange inference concerning the
Scripture, 14. Considered: The word of God by him undervalued, and subjected to the
judgement of vaine men, as to its Truth and Authority. 15. The pretended reason of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
proceeding, discussed: The Scripture the sole judge of what is to be ascribed to God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
concerning him. 16. The Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance, falsely imposed on, and
vindicated. 17. Mr G's next Objection made to himselfe, against his Doctrine: its unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
as to the Argument in hand, demonstrated. 18. No Assurance of the Love of God, not
Peace left the Saints by the Doctrine of Apostasy. The ground of Peace, and Assurance by it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. 19. Ground of Pauls Consolation: 1 Cor. 9. 27. the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
20. Another Plea against the Doctrine attempted to be proved by M. G. That attempt considered.
Not the weaknesse of the Flesh naturally, but the strength of Lust spiritually pretended. 21. The
cause of Sinne in the Saints farther discussed. 22. The Power ascribed by M. G. to men, for the
strengthning and making willing the Spirit in them, considered. 23. The Aptnesse of the Saints
to performe, what, and whence. The opposition they have in them thereunto. 24. Gospell O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
how easy. 25. The Conclusion. 26. Answer to Chap. 13. of his Book proposed.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Argument,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> wherein Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> exposeth the Doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
contest to the triall, concerning its usefulnesse, as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of Godlinesse, in the hearts and wayes of them, by whom
it is received, he thus proposeth. <hi>Cap. 13. Sect. 32. Pag. 333. That
Doctrine, which is according to Godlinesse, and whose naturall
and proper tendencie, is, to promote Godlinesse in the hearts and lives of men, is
Evangelicall, and of unquestionable comportance with the Truth; such is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which teacheth the possibility of the Saints declining, both totally, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:
Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Argument he goeth about to establish the respective propositions,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note>
so as to make them serviceable to the enforcement of the Conclusion he ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
at, for the exaltation of the <hi>Helena,</hi> whereon he is enamored: and for
the <hi>major Proposition</hi> (about which, rightly understood, we are remote from
contesting with him, or any else, and will willingly and cheerefully at any
time drive the cause in difference to Issue, upon the singular Testimony of the
Truth wrapped up in it) he thus con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irmeth it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Reason of the major Proposition, though the truth of it needeth no light but
its owne to be seen by, is, because the Gospell it selfe is a Doctrine, which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto Godlinesse, a ministry of Godlinesse, is a Doctrine, Truth, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
calculated, contrived, and framed by God with a singular aptnesse, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59070:151"/>
choicenesse of ingredients, for the advancement of Godlinesse in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what particular Doctrine is of the same Spirit, tendency, and import, must
needs be a naturall branch thereof, and bath perfect accord with it; this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then it unquestionable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> According to the principles formerly laid downe, I have something
to say (though not to the proposition it selfe,<note place="margin">§: 3.</note> as in the termes it lyeth, but)
only as to the fixednesse, and stayednesse of it, that it may not be a <hi>nose of
max,</hi> to be turned to and fro at every ones pleasure, to serve their turnes; for
what sort of men is there in the world, professing the name of Christ, that
do not lay claime to an intrest in this Proposition, for the confirmation of
their Opinions It is but as a <hi>Common Exordium</hi> in <hi>Rethoricke,</hi> a uselesse flourish;
<hi>The Doctrine which is according to Godlinesse,</hi> that is, which the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be true, and to serve for the promotion of Godlinesse, (not what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
soever any darke brainesicke Creature doth apprehend so to do) <hi>in the
state and Condition, wherein the Saints of God walke with him, is a branch of the
Gospell:</hi> I adde, <hi>in the state and condition, wherein we walke with God:</hi> for in the
state of innocency, the Doctrine of the Law, as a Covenant of Life, was of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
aptnesse, and usefulnesse to promote Obedience, which yet is not
therefore any branch, or part of the Gospell, but opposite to it, and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of it. All the advantage then Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> can expect from this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his cause, dependeth upon the proofe of the <hi>minor Proposition,</hi>
which also must be effected in aswerable proportion to the restrictions
and qualifications given to the <hi>Major,</hi> or the whole will be void and of none
effect; That is, he must prove it by the Testimony of God, to be according
to Godlinesse, and not give us in (by a pure begging of the thing in Question,)
that it is so in his Apprehesion, and according to the principles whereon he
doth proceed, in the teaching and asserting of Godlinesse: Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
knowes, that there is no lesse difference btween him and us, about the nature
and causes of Godlinesse, then there is aboute the Perseverance of the Saints:
and therefore his asserting any Doctrine to be suited to the promotion of
Godlinesse, that Assertion being proportioned to his other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of his
owne, wherein we accord not with him, and in particular to his notions of
the causes and nature of Godlinesse, with which conceptions of his we have no communion, it cannot be of any weight with us, unlesse he prove his affirmation according to the limitations before expressed; Now this he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth
in the words following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Doctrine</hi> (saith he,) <hi>can there be more proper and powerfull to promote
Godlinesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> 
               <hi>in the hearts and lives of men, then that, which, on the one hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
a crowne of Blessednesse, and eternall Glory to those, that live Godlily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
declining; and on the other hand, threatneth the vengeance of Hell fire, eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against those, that shall turne aside into profanenesse, and not returne by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
whereas the Doctrine, which promiseth, and that withall possible certainty
and assurance, all fulnesse of Blessednesse and Glory; to those that shall at any time
be Godly, though they shall the very next day or hour, degenerate, and turne loose,
and profane; and continue never so long in such a course, is most manifestly destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to Godlinesse, and encouraging above measure unto profanenesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There are two parts of this Discourse: the one (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or)
<hi>confirmatory</hi> of his owne <hi>Thesis;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> the other (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or) <hi>destructive</hi> of that
which he opposeth; For the first, it is upon the matter, all that he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
for the confirmation of his <hi>Minor Proposition,</hi> wherein any singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement
of his opinion doth lye: Now that being, in a sould sence, the
common Inheritance of all that professe the Truth, under what deceits or
mistakes soever; the summe of what is here insisted on, is, that the Doctrine he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59070:151"/>
maintaineth concerning <hi>the possibility of the Saints defection, promiseth a
crowne to them, that continue in Obedience, and threatneth vengeance of fire to
them, that turne to profanenesse,</hi> which taken as a proofe of his former assertion
is lyable to some small exceptions. As</p>
            <p>1. That this doth not at all prove the Doctrine to be a branch or parcell
of the Gospell, it being, is it standeth severally by it selfe, the pure tenor of the
Covenant of Workes, which we confesse to have been of singular importance
for the propagation of Godlinesse &amp; Holinesse, in them to whom it was given,
or with whom it was made; being given and made for that very end and
and purpose; but that this alone by its selfe is a peculiar branch or parcell
of the Gospell, or that it is of such singular importance for the carrying on
of Gospell-Obedience, as so by it selfe proposed, that should here have been
proved.</p>
            <p>2. As it is also a part of the Gospell declaring the Faithfulnesse of God,
and the End and Issue of the proposall of the Gospell unto men, and of their
receiving or refusing of it, so it is altogether forraigne to the Doctrine of Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> under contest: &amp; he might as well have said, that the Doctrine of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy
is of singular import for the promotion of Holinesse, because the
Doctrine of Justification by Faith is so; for what force of consequence is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these two? that God is a rewarder of them that Obey him, and a puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher
of them that rebell against him, is an incentive to Obedience: therefore
the Doctrine that true Believers united to Jesus Christ, may utterly fall out
of the Favour of God, and turne from their: Obedience, and be damned for
ever, there being no Promise of God for their preservation, is also an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Holinesse.</p>
            <p>3. What virtue soever there may be in this truth, for the furtherance
and promotion of Holinesse in the world, our Doctrine laieth as cleare claime
to it, as yours; (that is) there is not any thing in the least in it inconsistent
therewith all; we grant God threateneth the vengeance of Hell fire, unto those
that turne aside from their profession of Holinesse, into profanenesse, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
it selfe becoming thereby unto them <hi>a savour of death unto death;</hi> the
Lord thereby proclaiming to all the world, that the <hi>wages of sinne</hi> and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is <hi>death,</hi> and that <hi>he that believeth not, shall be damned;</hi> but that any thing
can hence be inferred for the Apostacie of true Believers, or how this assertion
cometh to be appropriated to that Doctrine, we see not.</p>
            <p>The latter part of this Discourse,<note place="margin">§: 6.</note> whereby its <hi>Author</hi> aimeth to exclude the
Doctrine hitherto asserted by us, from any claime laid to usefulnesse for the
promotion of Godlinesse, is either a mistake of it, through ignorance of the
opinion he hath undertaken to oppose, or a wilfull perverting of it, contrary
to his owne science &amp; conscience; Is that the Doctrine you oppose? Is it so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by those who through Grace have laboured to explaine, &amp; vindicate it?
Doth not the maine weight of the doctrine turne on this hinge, that God hath
promised to his Saints, true Believers, such supplies of the Spirit and Grace, as
that they shall never degenerate unto such loose and profane courses, as are
destructive to Godlinesse? Doubtlesse that Doctrine is of a most spotlesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
innocency, which its Adversaries dare not venture to strangle, before
they have violently &amp; treacherously defloured it.</p>
            <p>And thus Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> leaveth his Arguments in the <hi>dust,</hi> like the <hi>Estriches
egges</hi> under the feet of men, to be <hi>trampled</hi> on with ease.</p>
            <p>The residue of this Discourse onwards to the next Argument,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> beingspent in
the answering of pretended Objections, put in against himselfe in the behalfe
of the Doctrine of Perseverance, not at all called out by the import of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Arguments &amp; Discourses, I might passe them over: but in as much as that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59070:152"/>
which is spoken thereunto, tendeth to the further clearing of what former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath been evidenced, concerning the suitablenesse of the Doctrine conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, unto the promotion of Holinesse, I shall farther consider what he
draweth forth on this occasion. Sect. 33. he giveth us an Objection; and a foure
fold answer theruuto pag. 333, 334, 335. That which he calleth an Objection
he laieth downe in these words.</p>
            <p>If it be objected and said: yea but Assurance of the Unchangeablenesse of God's
Love towards him, that is Godly, is both a more effectuall &amp; perswading motive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Godlinesse, and more encouraging to a persevering in Godlinesse, then a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
or uncertainty, whether God will be constant in his Affection, to such a
man or no; Certainty of reward is more encouraging unto action, then uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If any one hath been so weake,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> as to make use of this plea in behalfe
of that Doctrine it seemeth to defend, (which I scarcely believe) it will I
doubt not, be an easie taske to undertake, that he shall be no more admitted, or
entertained as an <hi>Advocate</hi> in this cause; The assurance of the Unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes
of Gods Love to them that are Godly, is but one part of the Doctrine in
hand, &amp; that such, as may perhaps be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to it with that W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
competition W<hi rend="sup">th</hi> it: It is the Assurance of the Unchangeablenes of Gods Love
to a man, to keepe him up to Godlines, to preserve him in that state &amp; Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Holines to the end, &amp; of the certainty of the continuance of the Love of
God unto him, on that account &amp; in that way, that is that great Gospell mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Obedience, wherein, as its peculiar, our Doctrine glorieth, as hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been manifested. Perhaps Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth not think, that any man
is bound to lay more blocks in his owne way, then he judgeth himselfe well
able to remove: and therefore he framed that Objection so, that he might
be sure to returne at least a specious answer thereunto, and this he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
accordingly, and telleth us in his first Paragraph three things.</p>
            <p>1. That the Doctrine teaching the Saints defection,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> doth also maintaine the
Vnchangeablenesse of the Love of God, to them that are Godly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But what Love (I pray you) is that, which, when it might prevent it,
will yet suffer those Godly ones, to become such ungodly Villaines and
wretches, as that it shall be utterly impossible for the Lord to continue his
Love to them? Is the Love you mention indeed a Love to their Persons, or
only an Approbation of their Duties and Qualifications? If the First, whence
is it that God ceaseth at any time to love them? Doth he change, and alter
his Love like the Sonnes of Men? Why, they change, therefore he changeth
also; That God changeth not, and therefore we, who are subject to change,
are yet preserved from being consumed, we have heard; But that upon the
change that is in men, God also should change, we are yet to be instructed;
and the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, hath taken greater hold upon our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and in our hearts, then that we should easily receive any thing so <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically</hi>
opposite thereunto; If the Love mentioned be only an Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Qualifications that are in them, and of the Duties that they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
then is it no more a Love to them, or to their persons, then it is to the
persons of the most profligate wretches that live. The object is <hi>Duty,</hi> solely
where ever it may be found, and not any person at all; for it is an Act of
Gods <hi>approving,</hi> not <hi>purposing,</hi> or <hi>determining Will.</hi> This is not our sence of
the continuance of the Love of God, to them that are Godly; so that there is
no comparison betwixt the Doctrines under contest, as to the Asserting of the
Love of God to Believers, or to them that are Godly; Wherefore he saith,</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>the Doctrine</hi> he opposeth,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Promiseth Gods Love, and the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
continuance of it unto men, though they change to Prophanenesse;</hi> Though this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59070:152"/>
is said over and over an hundred times, yet I cannot believe it, because the
Doctrine openly affirmeth the continuance of the Love of God to them that
are Godly, to be effectually and eventually preventive of any such prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as is inconsistent therewithall; and therefore much more vaine is that,
which he affirmeth in the third place.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Namely, that</hi> the Doctrine of the Perseverance of the Saints, doth not so
much absolutely promise the Love of God to them that are Godly, as it promiseth it
conditionally, to them that are prophane, in case they have been Godly: that is, it
teacheth, that God promiseth the certain continuance of his Love to him, that is
Godly, on condition he cease to be so, and turne prophane;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claudite jam rivos pueri</hi>—we have enough of this already.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
               <hi>He addeth yet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> Neither is certainty of reward, in every sence or kind, more encouraging unto Action, then uncertainely in some kind: to promise with all
possible Assurance, the same reward or prize, to him, that shall not runne in the race,
which is promised to him that shall runne, is not more encouraging unto men, thus
to runne, then to promise it conditionally upon their running, which is a promising
of it with uncertainty in this respect, because it is uncertaine, whether men will
runne in the said race, or no; and consequently, whether they shall receive the said
prize or no, upon such a promise. Vncertainty of reward is then, and in such cases,
more encouraging unto action, then certainly, When the certainty of obtaining
or receiving it, is suspended upon the Act, not when it is assured unto men, whether
they Act or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Perswade your servants, your labourers if you can, of that
great encouragement that lyes in the the uncertainty of a reward, above that
which may be had from an Assurance thereof: We are not as yet of that
minde; And yet</p>
            <p>2. We do not lay the only motive unto obedience, tendered by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
we contest for, on the certainty of reward which it asserteth: which yet
is such, that without it all other must needs be of little purpose: but it hath
also other advantagious influences into the promotion of Holinesse, which in
part have been insisted on.</p>
            <p>3. It seemeth, we say that God promiseth <hi>a Reward to them that shall not
runne a Race,</hi> because we maintaine, that he promiseth it to none, but those
who do runne in a Race; promising withall to give them strength, power and
will, that they may do so to the end.</p>
            <p>2. For the close, which amounteth to this, That the certainty of reward,
when it is uncertaine (for so it is made to be when it is suspended on Actions
that are uncertain) is more encouraging to Action, then certainty of reward
not so suspended; I shall adde only, (because I know not indeed how this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
hangeth on the businesse under Consideration,) that we neither suspend
the certainty of Reward upon our Actions, in the sence intimated, neither do
we say, that it is assured to men, whether they act or no; but say, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which is of Grace, through the Unchangeable Love of God, shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them that act in Holinesse, &amp; through the same Love shall all Believers
be kept to such an acting of Holinesse, as God thinketh good to carry them
out unto, for the <hi>fulfilling of all the good pleasure of his Goodnesse in them, and
making them meet for the inheritance of his Saints in Light;</hi> We do not think,
mediums designed of God for the Accomplishment of any End, are such
that conditions of the End, that it is suspended on them in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
in respect of the Issue before its accomplishment. Neither do we
grant, or can it be proved, that God assigneth any medium for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of a determinate End, (such as we have proved the Salvation of all
Believres to be) and leave it in such a Condition, as that not only it shall be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59070:153"/>
effected &amp; produced, suitably to the nature of the immediate cause of which it
is, whether free, necessary, or contingent, but also shall be so farre uncertaine,
as that it may, or may, not be wrought and accomplished.</p>
            <p>The former part of this third Paragraph is but a Repetition of an Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> which upon the Credit of his own single Testimony we have had often ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
(<hi>viz.) That an Assurance given him, that is Godly, of the Love of God, not
depending on any thing in him, which it is uncertain whether he will performe or
no, is no motive to men to continue in the wayes of Holinesse.</hi> This (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
I cannot close withall: That that which is a motive to Faith, and Love,
and eminently suited to the stirring of them up, and setting them on worke, is
also a motive to the Obedience, which is called Love, and Obedience of
Faith, hath been declared. If there be any thing of the <hi>new</hi> and Heavenly
<hi>nature</hi> in the soule, any Quality, or disposition of a Child therein, what can
be more effectuall to promote or advance the Feare, Honour, and Reverence
of God in it, then an Assurance of his Spirit, to continue and preserve
them in those wayes, which are well pleasing unto him. It is confessed, that
in many Promises of Acceptation here, and Reward hereafter, the things
and duties, that are the meanes, and wayes of enjoying the one, and attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the other, are mentioned not as conditions of the Grace and Love,
of God to them, to whom the Promises are made, as though they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on any thing of their uncertaine accomplishment as hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but only as the meanes, and wayes, which God hath appointed for men
to use, and walke in, unto those ends, and which he hath absolutely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to worke in them, and to continue to them.</p>
            <p>4. The close of this Paragraph in the fourth place,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> deserveth a little more
cleare consideration, it containing an Assertion, which some would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
when it was told them, and hath stumbled not a few at the repetition of
it. Thus then he proceedeth.</p>
            <p>Besides, whether any such Assurance of the unchangeablenesse of the Love of God
towards him that is godly, as the Objection speaketh of, can be effectually, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sufficient grounds cleared and proved, is very questionable, yea I conceive there
is more reason to judge otherwise then so. Yea that which is more, I verily believe,
that in case any such Assurance of the unchangeablenesse of Gods Love, were to be
found in, or could regularly be deduced from the Scriptures, it were a just ground, to
any intelligent and considering man, to question their Authority, and whether they
were from God, or no: For, that a God infinitely righteous and holy, should irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versibly
as sure the immortall &amp; undefiled inheritance of his Grace &amp; Favour, unto
any Creature whatsoever: so that though this creature should prove never so abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in his sight, never so outragiously and desperately wicked and prohane, he
should not be at liberty, to with-hold his inheritance from him, is a saying doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
too hard for any man, who rightly understandeth and considereth the nature
of God, to beare:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> The Love mentioned in the foregoing Objection, is that which God
beareth to them that are godly in Jesus Christ, exerting it selfe partly in his
Gracious acceptation of their Persons in the Sonne of his Love, partly in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to them of his Holy Spirit and Grace, so that they shall never depart ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
and wickedly from him, and forsake him, or reject him from being their
God. Whether an assurance of this Love may, on good grounds, be given to
Believers, hath been already considered, and the Affirmative, I hope in some
good measure confirmed. The farther Demonstration of it awaiting its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
season, which the will of God shall give unto it. This Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> saith
to him is <hi>questionable;</hi> yea I suppose it is with him <hi>out of question,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, else surely he would not have taken so much paines in labouring to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59070:153"/>
disprove it; And that this us his resolved judgement, he manifesteth in the
next words, <hi>I verily believe, that in case any such assurance were to be found
in &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>Si Deus homini non placuerit, Deus non erit.</hi> What more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
could the <hi>Pagans</hi> of old have spoken of their <hi>dunghill Deities,</hi> with
their <hi>Amphibolous Oracles?</hi> were it not fitter language for the Indian Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
who beat and afflict their hellish Gods, if they answer not according to
their desires. The whole Authority of <hi>God,</hi> and of his <hi>Word</hi> in the Scriptures,
is here cast downe before the consideration of an intelligent man (forsooth)
or <hi>a vaine man,</hi> that <hi>would be wise,</hi> but is <hi>like the wild Asses colt;</hi> and this <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
man</hi> (it seemes) may contend to reject the Word of God, and yet be
accounted most wise; Of old, the Prophet thought not so. To what end is any
farther dispute? If the Scripture speaketh not to Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> mind, (for
doubtlesse he is an <hi>intelligent and considering man</hi>), he seeth sufficient ground
to question its Authority. By what way possible, any man can more advance
himselfe into the Throne of God, then by entertaining such thoughts and
conceptions as these, I know not. An <hi>intelligent man</hi> is supposed to have from
himselfe, and his own Wisdome and Intelligence, considerations of Gods
nature and perfection, by which he is to regulate and measure all things, that
are affirmed of God, or his will, in the Scripture. If what is so delivered suit
these conceptions of his, that Scripture wherein it is delivered may passe for
Canonicall &amp; Authentick: If otherwise, <hi>eâdem facilitate rejicitur quâ asseritur;</hi>
which was sometimes spoken of Traditionalls; but it seems may now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the written Word. The Scriptue is supposed to hold out things
contrary to what this intelligent Man hath conceived and considered, and
this is asserted, as a just ground to question its Authority. And if this be not a
Progresse in the contempt of the Word of God, to what ever yet <hi>Papists, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi>
or <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> have attempted, I am deceived. <hi>To the Law, and to the
Testimony,</hi> with all the conceptions and notions of the most intelligent man:
if they answer not to this <hi>Rule, it is because there is no truth in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he addeth the Reason of this bold Assertion:<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> for (saith he) <hi>That a God
infinitely righteous and holy, should irreversibly &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither yet doth this at all mend the matter. Neither doth the
particular instance given alter at all, but confirme the first generall Assertion:
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>If there be any thing in the Scriptures contrary to those thoughts of God,
which an intelligent man (without the Scripture) doth conceive of him, he hath
just grounds to question their Authority,</hi> which wholly casts downe the Word of
God from its Excellency, and setteth a poore, darke, blind creature, under
the notion of an <hi>intelligent man,</hi> at liberty from his subjection thereunto,
making him his owne rule, and guide, as to his Apprehensions of God and his
Will: And is it possible, that such a thought should enter into the heart of a
man fearing God, &amp; reverencing his <hi>Word,</hi> which <hi>God hath magnified above all
his name?</hi> There is scarce any one Truth in the whole Booke of God,but
some men, passing in the world for <hi>intelligent and considering men</hi> doe looke
upon it, and professe it to be unworthy of an infinitly Righteous, and Holy
God. So do the <hi>Socinians</hi> think of the Doctrine of the <hi>Satisfaction of Christ,</hi>
the great treasure of the Church; At the rate that men passe at in this world
it will be difficult to exclude many of them from the number of <hi>intelligent &amp;
considering men;</hi> And are they not all absolved here by Mr <hi>G.</hi> in this Principle,
from bowing to the Authority of God in the Scriptures, having just ground to
question, whether they are from God or no. The case is the same with the
<hi>Papists</hi> &amp; others in sundry particulats. Frame the supposition how you will, in
things never so uncouth and strange, yet if this be the position, That in things
which appeare <hi>so</hi> to men, upon their consideration, if any thing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59070:154"/>
be held out, or may be deduced from this to the contrary, they are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
from submitting their understandings to them, and may arraigne them
as false and suppositions their whole divine Authority is unquestionably cast
downe to the ground, and trampled on by the feet of men. (for
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) God will take care for the vindication of the honour of his
Word.</p>
            <p>2. The opposition here made by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 16.</note> and imposed on his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
is as hath been shewed, wretchedly false, not once spoken or
owned by them, with whom he hath to do, nor having the least colour given
unto it by the Doctrine they maintaine: yea is <hi>diametrically</hi> opposite thereunto.
The maine of what they teach, and which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath opposed in this
Treatise, indeavouring to answer that eminent place of the 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. with
many others produced and argued to that purpose, is, that God will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace, so write his Law in the hearts
of his, and put his feare in their inward parts, that they shall never depart
from him, so as to become desperately and outragiously profane, but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
such to the end, as that the Lord with the greatest advantage of Glory
to his infinite Wisdome, Righteousnesse, and Holinesse, may irreversibly
assure the immortall Inheritance of his Love and Favour unto them. So that
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Discourse to the end of this Section, concerning the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of the Love of God to them that are wicked, with an equall measure
of Favour to them that are Godly, according to this Doctrine, is vaine, and
grossly <hi>sophisticall,</hi> and such as he himselfe knoweth to be so. To say, <hi>every one
that doth evill is good in the sight of the Lord, and that he delighteth in him,</hi>
(that is) he approveth wicked and ungodly men, we know is sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable:
to him: but yet to say that he delighted in his Church, &amp; People,
washed and made Holy in the Blood of Christ, notwithstanding their failings,
or their being somtime over taken with great sinnes, when he pleaseth in an
extraordinary way, for ends best knowne to himselfe, to permit them to fall
into them, (which yet he doth seldome and rarely,) is that, which himselfe
affirmeth, &amp; ascribeth to himselfe in innumerable places of Scripture, (if their
Authority may passe unquestioned) to the praise of the Glory of his Grace. But
it seemeth, if we take any care, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> may not call the Authority
of the Scriptures into question, (being fully resolved, that the Doctrine of the
Saints Perseverance is unworthy of a Holy and Righteous God,) we must
give over all attempts of farther deducing it from them; But yet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
we shall consider what he hath farther to object against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> He father objecteth against himselfe and his Doctrine, in the be
halfe of that which doth oppose in these words.</p>
            <p>It is possible, that yet some will farther object against the Argument in hand;
Vnlesse the Saints be assured of the perpetuity of their standing, in the Grace and
Favour of God, they must needs be under feares of falling away, and so of perishing;
and feare we know is of a discouraging and infeebling nature; an enemy unto such
actions, which men of confidence and courage are apt to undertake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What this objection maketh in this place, <hi>I</hi> know not; it neither
asserteth any eminency in the Doctrine by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> opposed, as to the
promotion of Godlinesse, nor immediately challengeth that, which he doth
maintaine of a contrary tendency, but only intimateth, that the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and peace is weakned by unnecessary feares, such as his opinion is
apt to ingenerate in them; But however thus farre I owne it, as to the maine
of the Observation in hand, that the Doctrine of the Apostacy of Believers,
is apt and suited to cut the Saints of God, and heirs of the Promise short of
that strong Consolation, which he is so abundantly willing that they should
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59070:154"/>
receive, and to fill their Soules, and perplex their consciences, with cares,
feares, and manifold intanglements, suited to weaken their Faith, and Love,
and alienate their hearts from that delight in God, which they are called, and
otherwise would be carried forth unto. They being all of them, in some
measure, acquainted with the strength, subtility, and power of indwelling
Sinne, the advantages of Sathan in his manifold Temptations, the eminent
successe, which they see every day the <hi>Principalities, and Powers in heavenly
places</hi> which they wrestle withall, to have against them, and being herewithall
taught, that there is neither Purpose, nor Promise of God for their Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that there is nothing to that purpose in the Covenant of Grace
the Consideration of their Condition must of necessity fill them with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perplexities, and make them their owne tormentors all their daies; thus
farre (I say) I owne the Objection; That is not properly <hi>courage,</hi> or <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
but Faith, Love, and Reverence, that are the Principles of our Actions
in walking with God, hath been declared.</p>
            <p>But what saith Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to the Objection,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> as by himselfe laid
downe? Beside what he relateth, of his conquest of it in other places, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</p>
            <p>That the Saints, notwithstanding the possibility of their finall falling away,
have, or may have, such an Assurance of the perpetuity of their standing, in the
Grace and Favour of God, as may exclude all feare, at least that, which is of a
discouraging or enfeebling nature, The Apostle, as we have formerly shewed, lived
at a very excellent rate both of courage, and confidence; notwithstanding he know
that it was possible for him to become a Reprobate; The assurance he had, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a diligent use of those meanes, which he know assuredly God would vouchsafe
unto him, he should prevent his being a Reprobate, was a Golden foundation unto
him, of that confidence, and courage, wherein he equalized the Holy Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The grounds asserted by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> on which Believers may
build the Assurance pretended of the perpetuity of their standing in the
Grace and Favour of God, notwithstanding the possibility of their defection,
(the assertion whereof costs no lesse, then the denying of all, or any influence
from the Purpose, Promises, Covenant, or Oath of God, or Mediation of
Christ, into their preservation) I have formerly considered: and manifested
them to be so exceeding unable, to beare any such building of Confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as is pretended, that it is almost a Miracle, how any thoughts of such a
structure on such quicksands, could ever finde place in the minde of a man,
any thing seriously acquainted with the wayes of God; The whole of the
Saints preservation in the Love and Favour of God, (as it is also expressed in
this <hi>Section</hi>) is resolved into mens selfe-considerations, and indeavours. Being
weary it seemeth, of leaning on the Power of God, to be kept thereby unto
eternall Salvation, men begin to trust to themselves, and their owne Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to be their owne keepers: But what will they doe in the end thereof?
The summe of what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath formerly said &amp; what he repeateth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the end of this <hi>Section, is, Men need not feare their falling away, though
it is possible, seeing they may easily prevent it, if they will;</hi> Expressions sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contemptive of the Grace of God, and the Salvation that God assureth
us thereby; an assertion, which those Ancients, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> laboureth
to draw into communion with him, would have rejected, and cast out as
<hi>Hereticall.</hi> Mans ability thus to preserve himselfe, in the Grace and Favour
of God, to the end, is either from himselfe, or from the Grace of God? If from
himselfe? Let us know, what that Ability is, and wherein it doth consist, and
how he comes by it? Christ telleth us, that <hi>without him we can do nothing,</hi> and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59070:155"/>
the Apostle <hi>that we are not sufficient of our selves to think a good thought, but that
all our sufficiency is of God:</hi> So that this selfe ability for preservation exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not to the thinking a good thought: indeed is <hi>nothing:</hi> Is it from the
Grace of God? Then the Assurance of it must be, either because God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
absolutely, so to <hi>worke in him to will and to do, of his owne good pleasure,</hi>
as that he should certainely be preserved, which you will not say, (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,)
or because he will so afford him his Grace, as that he may make use of it
to the end proposed, if he please: But now, what Assurance hath he, that he shall
so make use of his Grace, as to make it effectuall for the end designed? And
is this good use of Grace, of himselfe, or of Grace also? If of himselfe, it is
<hi>nothing;</hi> as was shewed from that of our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. Neither can a
man promise himselfe much Assistance, from the Ability of doing nothing at
all. If you shall say it is of Grace, the same Question ariseth as formerly,
manifesting that there is not the least Assurance imaginable of our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Grace and Favour of God, but what ariseth from his Faithfull
Promises (efficaciously overcoming all interveniences) that we shall so
do.</p>
            <p>2. He telleth us,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> that <hi>Paul lived at an excellent rate of Assurance, and yet
knew that it was possible for him to be a Reprobate;</hi> I confesse indeed he lived at
an excellent rate of Assurance, which he manifesteth himselfe to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon such Principles, and Foundations, as were common to him with all
true Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32, 33, 34, 35. That it was possible in respect of the
Event, that He might have been a Reprobate, who was chosen from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is not proved. He saith indeed 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 27. I keepe my body in subjection,
least by any meanes I should be found</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there, any
more is intended, then <hi>not approved</hi> or <hi>accepted in that service be had in hand,</hi>
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> laboureth not to evince; and if that be the sence of the words
(as the scope of the whole manifesteth it to be) then all that <hi>Paul</hi> there express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is, that he endeavoured alwayes to approve himselfe, and by all meanes,
an acceptable workeman not to be rejected, or disallowed in the labour of
Preaching the Gospell which he had undertaken; and we acknowledge that
this thought, and contrivance may well become him, who liveth at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
rate of Assurance, that God affordeth to any here below; yea that such
thoughts &amp; endeavours do naturally &amp; genuinely flow from the Assurance of
the Love of God, we also grant. But yet, supposing that being a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> by a
<hi>Metonymie of the effect,</hi> may here signify to be <hi>damned,</hi> how doth this prove,
that it was possible in respect of the event, that he should be damned? Why,
because he laboured that he might not be so; That is, no man can use the
meanes of avoiding any thing, but he must be uncertaine, whether in the use
of those meanes it may be avoided or no; This looketh like begging the thing
in question; <hi>Paul</hi> labouring and indeavouring in the wayes expressed, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
manifesteth such a labour and indeavour, in such a way, to be the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
meanes of avoiding the Condition of being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That there is an
infallible connexion betwixt the use of such meanes, &amp; the deliverance from
that state, is proved. But that <hi>Paul</hi> had not assurance of the sufficiency of the
Grace of God with him, for his certaine use of those meanes, &amp; certaine infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
deliverance from that end, nothing in the least in intimated in the Text, or
brought in from any place else by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> to give colour thereunto.
But of this Scripture at large afterwards,</p>
            <p>Supposing himselfe to have fairly quit himselfe of the former plea,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> in the
behalfe of our Doctrine, as by himselfe proposed, he addeth another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
in the behalfe of the same plea formerly produced, which he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
also to take out of the way, having in some measure prepared it, in his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59070:155"/>
proposall of it for an ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y removall Thus then he proceedeth. <hi>To pretend that
the weaknesse of the flesh in the best of Saints considered, and their aptnesse to goe
astray, they must needs lye under many trouble some and tormenting feares of peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
unlesse they have some promise or assurance from God to support them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any declinings or goings astray incident unto them, yet they shall not
loose his favour, or perist, is to pret and nothing but what hath been throughly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
already, especially in Cap.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Before I can admit this plea to be put in, in our behalfe, I shall crave
leave a little to rectify, and point it more sharply against the Doctrine it aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to oppose. I say then,</p>
            <p>1. It is not the <hi>weaknesse of the flesh,</hi> or the feeblenesse and disability of
our naturall man to act in, or goe through with great duties and trialls, but
<hi>the strength and wilfulnesse</hi> of the flesh, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) of the corrupted man, even in
the best of saints, continually provoking and seducing them with sometimes
an insuperable efficacy, leading them captive, and working in them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
with a thousand baits and wiles, (as hath been in part discovered) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to turne them aside from God, That fills the Saints of God with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
perplexing feares of perishing, and must needs doe so, if they have
no promise of God for their preservation; Besides all this strength and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of the flesh, they are exposed to the Assaults of other most dreadfull
Adversaries, wrestling with Principalities and Powers in heavenly places, and
contending with the World, as it lieth under the curse all their daies; To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
all the oppositions that Believers meet withall, in the course of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and which may fill them with fears that they shall one day perish,
if not supported by an Almighty hand, and <hi>kept by the power of God through
Faith unto Salvation,</hi> unto the weaknesse of the flesh, which, in the place
where the expression is used, plainly pointeth at the disability of the naturall
man to abide in, and goe through with great duties and trialls, is a most vaine
and empty contemplation. Those who have to doe with God in the matter
of Gospell obedience, and know what it is indeed <hi>to serve him under tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
can tell you another manner or story: and among them M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
could doe so to the purpose, when his thoughts were not prejudiced by any
byasing opinions that must be leaned unto.</p>
            <p>2. We do not say that the Saints of God in the condition mentioned, stand
in need of any Promise of God, that notwithstanding any declinings or goings
astray incident unto them, they shall not loose his favour or perish, but that
they shall have such a presence of his spirit, and sufficiency of his grace with
them all their daies, that they shall never, notwithstanding all the oppositions
and difficulties they meet withall, utterly faile in their Faith, nor be prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against, to depart wickedly and utterly from God. And now I see not
but that supposing that it is necessary, that the Saints be delivered from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
perplexing feares of perishing, and that God hath made provision for
that end and purpose, which that he hath, seemes to be granted by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
I say I cannot see but that this <hi>Plea,</hi> striketh at the very heart of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy
of S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>, though not very fitly brought in, in this place, in reference to the
Argument that occasioned it; but our Author, knowing his faculty to lye more
in evading what is objected against him, than in urging Arguments for his
own opinion, doth every where, upon the first proposall of any Argument, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to other considerations, and to the answering of Objections, though
perhaps not at all to the Plea in hand, nor any way occasioned by it. But
what saith he now, in defence of his dearly beloved, thus attempted, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
it from this sore imputation of robbing and despoiling the Saints of
God, of their Peace and Assurance purchased for them at no lesse rate
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59070:156"/>
then the blood of the Lord Jesus? He telleth you then three things;</p>
            <p>1. That the weakenesse of the flesh, or aptnesse of miscarrying through this,
is no reasonable ground of feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> to any true Believer of his perishing: considering
that no manlooseth, or forfeiteth the Grace and Favour of God, through sinnes of
weakenesse or infirmity: It is only the strength of sinne, and corruption in men, that
exposeth to the danger of loosing the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The latter part of these words plainely discovers the vanity of the
former as produced for any such end and Purpose as that in hand: For though
I willingly grant, that that which is termed <hi>the weakenesse of the flesh,</hi> is
enough to make any man what ever feare, that he shall not hold outin the
course of his Obedience to the end, if he have no Promise of supportment and
preservation by an Almighty power, (notwithstanding it is affirmed that it
draweth men only to sinnes of weaknesse or infirmity, which I thought had
not been called so from the weaknesse of the flesh, but of Grace in Believers)
yet it is the strength, the power the Law, the subtillty of the flesh, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
sinne,</hi> that is the matter of our plea in this case. Not that which <hi>Paul
gloried</hi> in even his <hi>infirmity,</hi> but that which made him cry out, <hi>Oh! wretched
man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8. 1.</note> &amp; from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
by reason whereof he found no deliverance, but only in the Assured
Love of God in Jesus Christ. So that notwithstanding this Reply, shaped to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the minds of men against their failings, upon the account of the weakenes
of Grace, rather then of the flesh, (which yet it is not able to do, for if there
be no Promise to the contrary, why may not the principle which carrieth
men forth to lesser, carry them also forth to greater, &amp; more provoking sinnes,
what boundaries will you prescribe unto these sinnes of infirmitie.) The
pretension from the strength of the flesh, (yea from the weakenesse of it) hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
good against the Saints establishment in Peace and Assurance,
upon the account of their being destitute of any Promise of preservation by
God.</p>
            <p>2. If the Saints be willing (<hi>saith he</hi>) to strengthen the Spirit in them,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> and
make him willing proportionably to the meanes prescribed, and vouchsafed unto
them by God for such a purpose, this will fully ballance the weakenesse of the flesh,
&amp; prevent the miscarriages &amp; breaking out hereof; This I say then (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
walke in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh; and againe,
If you be lead by the Spirit you are not under the Law, and consequently, are in no
danger of loosing the Favour of God, or of perishing for such sinnes, which under
the conduct of the Spirit you are subject unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But that all now must be taken in good part, and nothing called
strange or uncouth, since we have passed the pikes in the last <hi>Section,</hi> I should
somewat admire at the Doctrine of this <hi>Paragraph;</hi> For</p>
            <p>1. Here is a <hi>willing</hi> in reference to a great Spirituall duty supposed in men,
antecedent to any Assistance of him who <hi>worketh to will and to do of his owne
good pleasure.</hi> What he worketh, he worketh by the Spirit. But this is a
<hi>willing</hi> in us, distinct from, and antecedent to, the appearing of the Spirit for
the strengthning thereof.</p>
            <p>2. That whereas we have hitherto imagined that the Spirit strengthneth
the Saints and that their supportment had been from him, as we partly also
before declared (at least we did our minde to be so perswaded) it seemeth
they <hi>strengthen the Spirit in them,</hi> and not <hi>he them;</hi> How or by what meanes,
or by what principles in them it is, that so they do, is not declared. Besides
what is here intended by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not manifested; If it be the <hi>Holy and
Blessed Spirit of God,</hi> be hath no need of our strengthning; he is able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to <hi>make us meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light;</hi> If it be the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59070:156"/>
gracious principles that are bestowed upon the Saints, that are intended, the
<hi>new Creature,</hi> the <hi>inwardman,</hi> called the Spirit in the Scripture, in opposition
to the flesh, if our strengthning this Spirit, be any thing, but the acting of the
Graces intended thereby in us, I know not what you meane. Especially,
in what is or consists their acting to make <hi>the Spirit willing proportionably to
the meanes we do receive,</hi> am I to seeke, to say, that we receave outward
meanes of God, (for so they must be, being distinguished from the Spirit)
and thereupon of our selves do make the Spirit willing, and strengthen him
to the performance of God, surely holdes out a very sufficient power in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, inbred in us, and abiding with us whereof there is not the least
Line or appearance in the whole Booke of God, nor in any Author urged
by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to give countenance to his perswasion, neither</p>
            <p>2. Is the summe of all this Answer any other, but this, <hi>If we are willing &amp;
will prevent all miscarriages from the weakenesse of the flesh, we may.</hi> But how we
become <hi>willing</hi> so to do, and what Assurance we have, that we shall be so
willing, seeing all in us by nature,<note place="margin">John 3. 6.</note> as to any Spirituall duty, is <hi>flesh,</hi> is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in the least; This is strenuously supposed all along, that to be willing
unto spirituall good, in a spirituall manner, is wholly in our owne power, and
an easie thing it is, no doubt; The plea in hand is, that such is the strength of
indwelling <hi>sinne</hi> in the best of the Saints, and so easily doth it <hi>beset them,</hi> that
if they have not some Promise of God to assure them, that they shall
have constant supply of Grace from him, and by his power be preserved, it
is impossible but that they must be filled with perplexing feares, that they
shall not hold out in giving him willing Obedience to the end; Their Will,
being in an especiall manner entangled with the power of sinne: It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>If men be but willing &amp;c. they need not feare this, or any such issue; (i. e.)</hi>
If they do the thing which they feare, and have reasons inviucible to feare,
that they shall not, they need not feare, but that they shall do it: which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a most absurd begging of the thing in Question. Nether is there any
thiug in the Scripture that will give a passe to this <hi>Begger,</hi> or shelter him from
due correction; The Apostle indeed saith that <hi>If we walke in the Spirit, we
shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.</hi> And good Reason there is for it, for as he told
us <hi>these are contrary to one an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther,</hi> and opposite to one another, &amp; bring forth
such divers &amp; contrary fruits, in them, in whom they are, that if we walk in the
one, we shall not fullfill the lusts of the other. But what assurance have we, that
we shall walke in the Spirit, if it be not hence, that God hath promised that
his Spirit shall never depart from us And <hi>if we are lead by the Spirit we are not
under the Law;</hi> Which by the way, letteth us see that the Spirit leadeth us,
(that is) maketh us willing and strengtheneth us, not we him;) But on what
account shall or dare any man promise to himselfe, that the Spirit will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so to do, if God hath not promised that he shall so do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or if his leading
of us, be only on condition that we be willing to be lead, how shall we be in
the least assertained, (supposing us in any measure acquainted with the
power of indwelling sinne) that we shall be alway so willing, let then this
passe with what was said before as <hi>nothing</hi> to the thing in hand.</p>
            <p>3. It is answered then (<hi>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>
               </hi> and lastly) there is no such aptnesse or pronenesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sinne,<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> sinnes I meane of a disinheriting import in Saints, or true Believers as is
pretended: But on the contrary a strong propension or inclination unto Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
raigneth in them; we heard formerly from the Apostle 1 John 3. 9. That he
that is borne of God cannot sinne: and also from the 1 John 5. 3. From these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
with many other of like import, it is evident that there is a pregnant
strong, over powring propension, in all true Believers to walke Holily, and to live
Righteously, so that to refraine sinning in the kind intended, is no such great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59070:157"/>
no such matter of difficulty, unto such men and that when they are overcome
and fall into sinne, it is through a meere voluntary neglect; and thus we see all
things unpartially weighed, and debated to and fro, that the Doctrine which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
a possibility of the Saints declining, is the Doctrine which is according to
Godlinesse, and the corrivall of it an enemy thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We have here an <hi>Assertion,</hi> an <hi>Inference,</hi> and a <hi>Conclusion;</hi> The <hi>Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is, that there is <hi>no such aptnesse and pronenesse to sinne in Believers, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated;</hi>
and <hi>that because there is such a strong propensity in them to Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
which that they have is proved from sundry places of Scripture; That
is, because the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in Believers, the flesh is not in them. Because they have a
new man in them, they have not an old; because they have a principle of <hi>Life,</hi>
they have not a <hi>body of death.</hi> That is, <hi>where the Spirit lusteth against the flesh,</hi> the
<hi>flesh lusteth not against the Spirit.</hi> We thought the Doctrine of <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. Gal.</hi> 5.
and in innumerable other places, with the experience off all the Saints in the
World had laine against this piece of <hi>Sophistry.</hi> It is true, their propension
unto Righteousnesse <hi>raigneth</hi> in them, but it is as true, their propension unto
sinne, <hi>rebelleth</hi> in them. Though the Land be conquered for Christ, yet the
<hi>Canaanites</hi> will dwell in it; &amp; if the Saints leave of but one day, the worke of
<hi>killing, crucifying</hi> and <hi>mortifying,</hi> they will quickly finde an actuall rebellion
in them, not easie to be suppressed. They have indeed a propension to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>ruling in them,</hi> but also a propension unto sinne <hi>dwelling</hi> in them, so that
<hi>when they would do good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vell is present with them, and the good they would do,
they cannot;</hi> But when Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> can prove this consequence, that Saints
have strong inclinations to Righteousnesse, therefore they have not so to
sinne, for my part I will forbeare for ever disputing with him; If he can beat
us, not only from Scripture, but all our Spirituall sence and experience,
doubtlesse it is to no purpose to contend any longer with him; Hence
then</p>
            <p>2. He <hi>inferreth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> 
               <hi>that to abstaine from sinning,</hi> that is, sinning customarily, &amp;
against conscience, so as to endanger the losse of the Favour of God, <hi>is no
such great mastery, no such matter of difficulty to such men.</hi> This abstaining from
such sinnes, (on the one hand) is the whole course of our Gospell Obedience,
which it seemeth however it be compared to <hi>running in a race, striving for
masteries,</hi> called <hi>resisting unto blood, wrestling with principallities and powers,</hi>
requiring for its carrying on the <hi>exceeding greatnesse of the power of God,</hi> with
suitable <hi>help in time of need from Jesus Christ,</hi> who is sensible of the weight of
it, as no small matter, knowing what it is to serve God in Temptations, yet is
it indeed but a <hi>trifling thing,</hi> a matter of no <hi>great difficulty or mastery.</hi> Doe
men Watch, Pray, Contend, Fight, Wrestle with God, and Satan, doth the
Lord put forth his Power, and the Lord Jesus Christ continually intercede
for the preservation of the Saints, <hi>Ad quid perditio haec?</hi> to what end is all
this toile and labour, about a thing of little or no weight? <hi>Egregiam vero lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem!</hi>
We know indeed, the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>easy,</hi> and his <hi>Commandement not
grievous, that we can doe all things through him that inableth us,</hi> but to make
Gospell obedience, so slight a thing, that it is no great <hi>mastery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or matter of
no great commendation, to hold out in it to the end, this we were to learn
till now, and are as yet <hi>slow of heart to receive it.</hi>

weaknesse of his first Argument: The import of it. 3. Answer to that first Argument. Doctrine
may pretend to give God the glory of being no accepter of Persons and yet be false: Justification
by workes, of that rank and order. 4. Acceptation of Persons what, and wherein it consisteth.
No place for it with God: contrary to distributive Justice. 5. The Doctrine of the Saints Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
charged with rendring God an accepter of Persons. 6. Unjustly, what it saies looking
this way. 7. The summe of the charge against it considered and removed. 8. M. G. second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and the weight by him hanged thereon: the originall of this Argument: by whom some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
insisted on. 9. The Argument it selfe in his words proposed: of the use and end of the
Ministry: whether weakned by the Doctrine of Perseverance. 10. Entrance unto an Answer to
that Argument. The foundation laid of it false and when: it falsely imposeth on the Doctrine of
Perseverance, sundry things by it disclaimed: the first considered. 11. The iniquiry of those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
farther discovered. 12. The true state of the difference as to this Argument decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
13. The Argument satisfied. 14. The reinforcement of the Minor attempted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
15. The manner of Gods operations with, and in, naturall and voluntary Agents
compared. Efficacy of Grace and liberty in man consistent. 16. An Objection to himselfe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by M. G. that Objection rectified; Perseverance how absolutely and simply necessary, how
not. 17. The removall of the pretended Objection farther insisted on by M. G. 18. That dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
discussed, and manifested to be weake and sophisticall. The consistency of Exhortations
and Promises farther cleared. 19. The manner of the operation of Grace, in, and upon the wills
of men considered. 20. The inconsistency of exhortations with the efficacy of Grace, disputed
by M. G. 21. That discourse removed, and the use of Exhortations farther cleared. Obedience
to them twofold, Habituall, Actuall: of the Physicall operation of Grace, and meanes of the word:
their compliance, and use. How the one and the other affect the will. 22. Inclination to Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
when wrought in Believers. 23. Of the manner of Gods operation on the wills of men: M.
G. discourse and judgement. 24. Considered. 25. Effects follow as to their kind, their next
causes. 26. The same Act of the will Physicall and Morall upon severall accounts: Those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
considered. 27. God by the reall efficacy of the Spirit, produceth in us Acts of the will,
morally good: that confirmed from Scripture. 28. Conclusion from thence. 29. Of the

Morall causes of Physicall effects. 30. The concurrence of Physicall and Morall causes for
producing the same effect: the efficacy of Grace, and exhortations. 31. Physicall and necessary,
how distinguished. Morall and not necessary. Confounded by M. G. 32. M. G. farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse

by him excluded. 34. M. G's sence of the difference between the working of God and
a Minister on the will: that it is but graduall. 35. Considered and removed. All working of
God on the will by him confined to perswasion: perswasion gives no strength or ability to the
person perswaded. 36. All immediate acting of God to good in men, by M: G. utterly excluded.
37. Wherein Gods perswading men doth consist according to M. G. 1 Cor. 3. 9. considered. 38.
Of the concurrence of diverse Agents to the production of the same effect. 39. The summe of
the 7 Section of Gh. 13. The will how necessitated, how free. 40. In what seuce M. G. allowes
Gods perswasions to be irresistible. 41. The dealings of God and men ill compared. 42. Pauls

places that God is no accepter of persons:</hi> for he that shall hence conclude, that
what ever Doctrine affirmeth, directly, or by consequence, that God is no
Aceepter of persons, what ever other abomination it is evidently <hi>deeming</hi>
with all, is yet true, and according to the minde of God, shall have leave
notwithstanding the <hi>antiquated Statute</hi> of our <hi>Vniversity</hi> against it, to goe
and reade <hi>Logicke</hi> at <hi>Stamford.</hi> On this account do but provide that a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be not gnilty of any <hi>one</hi> crime, and you may conclude that it is guilty
of <hi>none.</hi> For instance, That Doctrine which impeacheth not the <hi>Omnipresence</hi>
of the Diety, is true &amp; according to the Scripture, for the Scripture aboundeth
with cleare Testimonyes of the <hi>Presence</hi> of God in all places. Now the Doctrine
of the <hi>Vbiquity</hi> of the humane nature of Christ, doth no way impeach the
<hi>omnipresence</hi> of the <hi>Diety;</hi> therefore it is true and according to Scripture.</p>
            <p>I might supersede all further considerations of this Argument, having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it altogether uselesse, and unserviceable, in this warfare, by breaking
its right <hi>legge,</hi> or rather <hi>cruteh,</hi> whereon it leaned: but something also may
be added to the <hi>Minor,</hi> because of its reflection in the close of its proofe upon
the Doctrine we maintaine, intimating an inconsistency of it, with
that Excellency of God spoken of, namely, that he is no <hi>Accepter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>

is to determine in causes of righteousnesse, hath respect to personall things, that
concerue not the merit of the Cause in hand, and judgeth accordingly.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
can have no place in God, as to any bestowing of free Grace, Mercy, or
Pardon; There is <hi>Roome</hi> made for it, only when the things that are bestowed,
or wrought, by it, are such, as in Justice are <hi>due;</hi> it being an Iniquity solely
and directly opposed to <hi>distributive Justice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 2, 3 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> that rendreth to every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

If he will dispose of his <hi>pardoning Mercy,</hi> and <hi>free Grace,</hi> to some in
Christ, not to others, who shall say unto him <hi>what dost thou?</hi> May he not <hi>do
what he will</hi> with his owne? So he giveth a <hi>peny</hi> to him that laboureth all day,
he maygive a <hi>peny</hi> also to him that worketh but one houre. Now suppose that
Mr <hi>G</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine</hi> render God free from this, (or rather chargeth him not with
it,) yet if withall it calleth his Truth, Righteousnesse, Faithfulnesse, Oath, and
Immutabillity into question, shall it passe for a Truth, or be embraced ever
the sooner?</p>
            <p>But the <hi>sting</hi> of this Argument lieth in the <hi>Taile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> or close of it, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
insisted on upon the common <hi>Doctrine of Perseverance</hi> as it is called:
<hi>viz.</hi> that it teacheth God to be an <hi>accepter of Persons:</hi> This is Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s
way of Arguing all along; When at any time he hath proposed a proofe of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59070:159"/>
the Doctrine he goeth about to establish, finding that as somthing <hi>heavy</hi>
worke to lye upon his hand, and not much to be said in the case, he instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turneth about and falleth upon his Adversaries, in declaiming against
whom, he hath a <hi>rich</hi> and overflowing Veine. There is scarce any one of his
Arguments, in the pursuit and improvement whereof, one fourth part of it, is
spoken to that head, where in he is engaged.</p>
            <p>But wherein is the <hi>Common Doctrine of Perseverance</hi> guilty of this great
crime?<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> It teacheth, that <hi>He that believeth shall be saved,</hi> and he <hi>that believeth
not, shall be damned.</hi> It teacheth, that God hath allotted equall punishments to
equall Transgressions, and appointed equall Rewards to equall wayes of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
That the <hi>Wages of every sinne is death,</hi> and that every sinner must
dye, unlesse it be those, concerning whom God himselfe saith, <hi>Deliver them,
I have found a Ransome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 33. 24.</note> that he is a like displeased with sinne in whomsoever
it is, and that in a peculiar and eminent manner when it is found in his
owne. Indeed if this be to impute <hi>Acceptation of Persons</hi> to God, to say, <hi>that
he hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will, he hardeneth,</hi> that
he is tender to his owne, as a <hi>Father to his only Child that serveth him,</hi> and
will recover them (being faithfull in his Promises) from their sinnes, and
<hi>heale their backeslidings,</hi> though he suffer others to lye wallowing in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
and pollutions all their dayes; that he will not give pardon to any
finner, but upon Faith and Repentance, but will give Faith and Repentance
to those whom he hath chosen, and given unto Jesus Christ, to be saved: If
this (I say) be <hi>acceptance of Persons,</hi> our Doctrine owneth the imputation
of ascribing it to God, and glorieth in it: we being ascertained that God
taketh all this to himselfe, clearely, and plentifully in the Word of
Truth.</p>
            <p>The summe of what our Author gives in,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> to make good his charge upon
the <hi>common Doctrine of Perseverance</hi> is, That it affirmeth, <hi>that though Saints
and Believers fall into the same sinnes of Adultery and Idolatry, and the like, with
other men, yet they are not dealt withall as other men, but continued in the Love
and Favour of God.</hi> To wave the consideration of the false impositions (by the
way) on the Doctrine opposed (as that is that it teacheth the Saints to fall into,
and to continue in them to the significancy of that expression (<hi>never so long</hi>)
under Abominations) and to joyne Issue upon the whole, of the matter, I
say,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>with</hi> this Doctrine, and in perfect Harmony, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
therewith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 32.</note> we maintaine, that the <hi>judgement of God</hi> is the same in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of every sinne in whomsoever it is, and that he that doth it on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
is <hi>worthy of death;</hi> and</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>sentence of the Law,</hi> is the same towards all, cursing every one
that continueth not in all things written in the Book thereof,<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 26.</note> to doe them.</p>
            <p>3. That in, and under the Gospell, wherein a remedy is provided in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the rigour and severity of both the former Apprehensions, yet the
Judge of all, dealeth with all men <hi>equally,</hi> according to the tenor of it, <hi>He that
Believeth, shall be Saved, and he that Believeth not, shall be damned;</hi> Men in the
same condition, shall have the same recompence of reward: But you will say,
Doe not the same sinnes, put men into the same condition, and deserve the
same punishment in one as in another?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They doe deserve the same punishment: God is equally provoked,
and had not Christ answered for the sinnes of Believers, they could not, they
should not have escaped the wrath due to them. 2. That the same sinnes
doe not argue men alwaies under the Gospell, to be in the same Condition, as
shall be afterwards fully manifested, for (1.) They doe not find them in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59070:159"/>
same state: some are in a <hi>state of Death and sinne,</hi> others of Life and Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
translated from the one to the other, having a Title to the Promise of
Mercy in Christ. (2.) And chiefly, as there is a twofold justification, of the
<hi>Person,</hi> and of the <hi>Fact,</hi> and the one, may be without the other, so there is a
twofold condemnation or dis-approbation, of the <hi>Fact,</hi> and of the <hi>Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> As
to the particular dis-approbation of God, in respect of any <hi>sinfnll Act,</hi> it is the
same in reference unto all Persons, Believers and Unbelievers: As to their
<hi>Persons,</hi> there are in the Gospell, other ingredients to the judgement of them,
beside particular Facts, or Acts, in answer to the Law, or the rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
<hi>viz. Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> which alter the case of the <hi>Person,</hi> even
before the judgement seat of God: To suppose the Saints to fall into the same
sinnes with other men, in the same manner, and to continue in them, without
Faith and Repentance, is to begge the thing in Question. Suppose them to
have (what we affirme God hath promised) those conditions of Evangelicall
mercie, and M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe, will grant it no acceptance of Persons, to
deale otherwise with them, then with others, who have committed like sinnes
with them, in whom those conditions are not wrought or found; that is, <hi>he
that Believeth shall be Saved, he that Believeth not shall be Damned.</hi> This is all
we say in this thing: but of the difference between Believers and unbelievers
in their sining, we shall speake afterwards at large, to the full removall of
this and another Objection. For the present this shall suffice, though Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
fall, or may fall into the <hi>same sinnes</hi> with other men, yet they fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, <hi>in the same manner</hi> with them, and they have a <hi>reliefe</hi> provided, to
prevent the deadly malignity of sinne, which those who believe not, have no
interest in, no right unto.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> second Argument is,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> that which of all others in this case, hee
seemeth to lay most weight upon: and which he pursueth at large in 17 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and as many Sections, treating in it concerning the <hi>Ministry of the Gospell,</hi>
and the usefulnesse of the Exhortations, Threatnings, and Promises thereof.
For an entrance into the consideration of it, I must needs say <hi>Non venit ex
pharetris ista sagitta tuis.</hi> For besides that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath taken very little
paines in the improvement of it (considering how it was provided to his hand
by the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> at the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> and that which he hath done farther,
consisting in a meere uselesse and needlesse stuffing of it, with sundry <hi>Notions</hi>
taken out of their first Argument and fifth (<hi>De modo conversionis</hi>) of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Spirits operation in and upon the Soule, in its first conversion to
God) it was the old song of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> in their dealing
with <hi>Austine, Fulgentius, Hilarius, Prosper,</hi> by them at large confuted, renewed
by <hi>Castallio,</hi> and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> against <hi>Luther,</hi> after it had been sifted and rejected
by the more learned <hi>Schoolemen</hi> in former ages: What ever it be, and how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is now come to hand, being taught to speake out Language, and that in
the best fashion, the consideration of it must not be declined. And thus it is
proposed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the common Doctrine of Perseverance, rendreth the Ministry of the Gospell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> 
               <hi>so
farre as it concerneth the Perseverance of the Saints, vaine, impertinent, and void,
then is it not a Doctrine of God, but of men, and consequently, that which oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it is, the truth: But certaine it is, that the said Doctrine, is of this unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
tendency and import; Ergo.</hi> The first part of the consequent of the <hi>Major</hi> is
granted. <hi>The Work of the Ministry, being for the edification of the body of Christ,
and the perfecting of the Saints, (Ephes.</hi> 4. 12, 13.) that which frustrateth the
End whereunto of Christ himselfe it is designed, can be no Truth of his. Of
the farther inference, <hi>That the Doctrine which opposeth it,</hi> or is set up in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<hi>to</hi> it, <hi>is the Truth,</hi> more will be spoken afterwards. For the present I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59070:160"/>
but insist upon the former observation; That notwithstanding Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
pretence of proving, and arguing for the Doctrine he maintaines, yet
upon the matter, he hath not any thing to say, in the carrying on of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
but instantly falls to his old work of <hi>raising Objections,</hi> in their very
setting up prepared to be cast downe, (for the most part) which with all his
might he laboureth to remove.</p>
            <p>The stresse of the whole, (as farre as we are concerned in it) lieth on the
<hi>Minor,</hi> which is thus farther attempted to be made good: The <hi>Minor</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is Demonstrated thus, <hi>The Doctrine which rendreth the Labour and
Faithfulnesse of a Minister in pressing such Exhortations, Threatnings, and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which tend to the preservation of the Saints, in Faith and holinesse to the end,
uselesse, rendreth the Ministry of the Gospell, as farre as it concerneth the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
or inabling of the Saints to Persevere, needlesse and vaine: but guilty of
such a tendency as this, is the commonly received Doctrine of Perseverance:</hi>
Ergo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This labour might have been saved, and both these <hi>Syllogismes</hi> very
easily reduced to one: but then another seeming Argument (as we shall find
afterwards) insisted on, would have been prevented. Our trade in such cases
as this is by <hi>weight,</hi> and not by <hi>number:</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi> then, is still to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
which he laboureth thus to doe.</p>
            <p>The common Doctrine of Perseverance, requireth and commandeth all Saints or
true Believers, to be fully perswaded, and this with the greatest and most indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
certainty of Faith, that there is an absolute and utter impossibility, either of a
totall, or finall defection of their faith: that though they should fall into ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
enormous and most abominable sinnes, and lyewallowing in them, like a swine
in the mire, yet they should remaine all the while in an estate of Grace, and that
God will by a strong hand of irresistible grace, bring them off from their sinnes, by
Repentance, before they dye: but the Doctrine which requireth and commandeth
all this, and much more of like import, to be confidently believed by true Believers,
rendreth the pressing of all Exhortations, Threatning, Promises upon them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to prevaile with them, or make them carefull to Persevere, bootlesse and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> What weight M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> (with all those with whom as to his
undertaking under consideration He is in fellowship) doth lay upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is known to all. The whole foundation of what is afterwards at large
insisted on, for the establishment of it being laid upon the proofe of the <hi>Minor</hi>
Proposition formerly denied, here laid downe; It will easily be granted, that
it was incumbent on him to make sure worke here, and not to leave any thing
liable to any just Exception. An errour, or a mistake in the <hi>foundation,</hi> is not
easily recoverable; All that is afterwards heaped up, beareth it selfe on a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Truth of what is here delivered. If this faile in the least, we
may spare our Labour, as to any farther consideration of what followeth;
Now the maine of the proofe here insisted on, lieth in the Declaration of that
which he calleth, the <hi>Common Doctrine of Perseverance,</hi> and concerning this
he informeth his Reader.</p>
            <p>1. That it commandeth all Saints to he fully perswaded, and that with the
gseatest and most indubitable certainty of Faith, that there is an absolute and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
impossibility either of a totall, or finall defection of their Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What is the intendment of these Aggravating expressions of,
[<hi>fully perswaded, greatest and most indubitable certainty of Faith</hi>] I know not.
Will it please you, if it should require them to be <hi>perswaded,</hi> but not <hi>fully
perswaded, Believe</hi> it, but with <hi>little and dubitable cetainty of Faith,</hi> or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
rather? <hi>Full perswasion, greatest certainty, without doubting</hi> or <hi>staggering,</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:59070:160"/>
are all of their perfections of Faith, and of the Saints in believing: which
without doubt, they are in all that they are to Believe, to presse after: so that
all this is no more, but that this Doctrine requireth men to believe what it
affirmeth God to have promised. It requireth men to mixe the Promises of
God with Faith,) <hi>Crimen in auditum.</hi> But though the <hi>manner</hi> of Believing
which it requireth, be not blameable, yet the thing which it proposeth to
be believed is false. What is that? That there is an <hi>Absolute or utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
either of a totall or finall defection of the Faith of true Believers.</hi> Its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
this to be Believed is the <hi>bottome,</hi> &amp; also <hi>corner stone,</hi> of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s
insuing Argument: if it doth not do this, he hath nothing in this place to say
to it; Let him then produce any <hi>one</hi> that ever wrote in the defence of it, that
hath in Termes, or by just consequence, delivered any such thing, and on
<hi>Herbam;</hi> there shall be an end of this dispute; I presume Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what is meant by an <hi>absolute and utter impossibility.</hi> An absolute Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
unto being, in the nature of the things themselves concerning which
any Affirmation is, and not any externall or forraigne consideration doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
any thing to an <hi>absolute &amp; utter Impossibility;</hi> did ever any one affirme,
that in the nature of the thing it selfe, the defection of the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> is <hi>absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible?</hi>
Is it not by them that believe the Perseverance of the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> constantly
affirmed that in themselves they are apt, yea prone to fall away, and their
Faith to decay and dye, which in it selfe possibly may be done, though Mr
<hi>Goodw:</hi> cannot tolerably shew how. The whole cerrainty of their continuance
in, and of the preservation of their Faith, depends meerely on supposition
of something that is <hi>extrinsecall</hi> in respect of them, and of their state, which
as to their Condition might, or might not be. Farther, the <hi>Perseverance of
the Saints,</hi> is by the same persons, constantly affirmed to be carryed on, &amp; to
be perfected in, and by the use of meanes. It is their keeping, by the power of
God <hi>through Faith</hi> unto Salvation; And can then an <hi>absolute impossibility</hi> of
their defection be asserted, or only that which is so upon <hi>supposition, viz.</hi> of
the <hi>Purpose of God</hi> &amp;c. There was no <hi>Absolute Impossibility</hi> that the <hi>bones of
Christ should not be broken,</hi> they being in themselves as lyable to be broken as
his flesh to be pierced; yet in respect of the event, it was impossible they
should be so. I cannot well imagine that Mr <hi>Grodwin</hi> is not fully perswaded
with the <hi>greatest and most indubit able certainty</hi> that a Perswasion in things of
this kind, will admit, that the <hi>Common Doctrine of Perseverance,</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Saints to believe, that there is an absolute impossibility of their defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but only that God hath promised to Preserve them from that, which
in themselves and in respect of any thing in them, they are obnoxious unto,
in, and by the use of meanes, suited and appointed by him, to the carrying on
of that worke, and compassing of the end proposed. But yet it pleaseth him
here to make shew of a contrary Apprehension, and to shew his confidence
therein, he aggravates it, with this annexed supposition and case: <hi>It doth so,</hi>
(saith he) <hi>though they should fall into 10000 enormous and most abominable
sinnes, and lye wallowing in them like Swine in the mire, yet that they shall remaine
all the while in an estate of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Truly this is such an <hi>enormous</hi> and abominable Calumny,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> that I
cannot but admire how any sober and Rationall man, durst venture upon
the owning of it; The question now is, what Faith the Doctrine insisted on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates
in particular persons, that should enervate and make void the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
&amp;c. of the Ministry? Now though the Doctrine should teach this
<hi>Indefinitely,</hi> that though men did sinne <hi>so,</hi> and <hi>so,</hi> as is here exprest, yet they
should be kept in a state of Grace, as is mentioned, (which yet is lowdly and
palpably false, as hath been declared) yet that it doth require particular men
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59070:161"/>
to Believe for themselves, and in reference to the Guidance of their owne
Wayes, that they may <hi>lye and wallow in their sinne like swine in the mire, and
yet continue in a state of Grace and Acceptation with God,</hi> is so notoriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the whole tenour of the Doctrine, the <hi>genius</hi> and nature of it, with
all the Arguments whereby it is asserted and maintained, that if conscience
had but in the least, been advised with all in this contest, this charge had been
without doubt omitted; All that is produced for the confirmation of this
strange imposition on the perswasion under consideration, is his owne Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that makes the charge, <hi>that it is the knowne voice of the common Doctrine
of Perseverance,</hi> and that being said, is laid as a Foundation of all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
The whole Discourse still relating to a supposition that this is the
Doctrine which it opposeth, from the very next words to the end. Nor is
there the least farther attempt for the confirmation of this grand Assertion;
But is this the knowne voice of our <hi>Doctrine of Perseverance?</hi> Who ever
heard it but Mr <hi>G.</hi> and men of the like prejudicate Spirits aganist the Truth?
The worst that can be charged with looking this way, is its asserting the
promised efficacy of the Grace of God, for the preserving of Believers by the
use of meanes, from such wallowing in abominable sinnes, as is supposed
that it affirmes they may be exposed unto. In briefe! it saies not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That all Believers are certaine of their Perseverance; Nor</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That any one can be certaine of it upon such supposals as
are here mentioned: such a perswasion would not be from him that calls
them; Nor</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the End can be obtained, without the use of meanes, though
by them, it shall certainely be so; But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all the hope of their Perseverance, is built on the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of God, to preserve them by, and in the use of meanes; So that in Truth
there is no need of any farther processe for the removing of the Argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, but only a <hi>disclaimer</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> by it oposed, if it be that which
is here exprest:</p>
            <p>That indeed which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to dispute against,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> if he will deale
fairely and candidly in the carrying on of his designe, is this, <hi>That the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of an end to be obtained by meanes suited thereunto, doth not enervate nor
render vaine the use of those meanes, appointed for the accomplishment of that
end;</hi> The Perseverance of the Saints is the thing here proposed to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished:
that this shall be certainely effected and brought about according to
the Promises of God for the effectiug of it, God hath appointed the meanes
under debate, to be managed by the <hi>Ministry of the Gospell:</hi> that the Promise
of God, concerning the Saints Perseverance to be wrought and effected, as
by others, so by these meanes in their kind, doth not invalidate or render
uselesse and vaine the use of those <hi>meanes,</hi> but indeed establishes them, and
ascribes to them their proper efficacy, is that which in this Doctrine is asserted,
and which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ought to have disprooved, if he would have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe as a faire <hi>Antagonist</hi> in this cause; The Promse (we say) that
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> had of the continuance of his Life,<note place="margin">Isa. 33. 5. 21.</note> did not make uselesse but
called for the <hi>plaister of figges</hi> that was appointed for the healing of his
<hi>sore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might then (as I said) save my selfe the labour of farther ingaging,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> for
the casting downe of this Fabricke, built on the sandy foundations of <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
and mistake. But because something may fall in, of that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
more indeed to the purpose, than an orderly pursuit of these Assertions
laid downe in the entrance would require, that may more directly rise up
against the cause in whose defence I am ingaged, I shall consider the whole
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59070:161"/>
ensuing Discourse which without doubt will administer farther occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the Illustratihn or Confirmation of the Truth in hand; He proceeds
then,</p>
            <p>The reason of the Minor is,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> because a certain knowledge and perswasion, that
God will by an irresistable hand of power, preserve a man, in the state of Grace,
how desperately carelesse, negligent or wicked so ever he shall be, clearely disolves
the usefulnesse, and necessity of all other meanes whatsoever, in reference to this end.
If I know certainely that the corne which I have sowen in my field will whether I
wake or sleepe grow and prosper, would it not be a very impertinent addresse, for
any man to come to me, &amp; admonish me in a serious &amp; grave manner, to take heed,
I sleepe not, but keepe my selfe waking, least my corne should not grow, or prosper, or
that it may grow &amp; prosper, if my corne growes, thrives, &amp; prospers, by the irresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
hand of God, by the course of a Naturall &amp; standing providence, my watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in order to a procurement of these things is absolutely vaine &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That this is not the Doctrine which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath undertaken
to oppose, hath been more than once already declared; That he is not able
with any colonr of Reason to <hi>oppose</hi> it, unlesse he first <hi>impose</hi> his owne false &amp;
vaine inferences upon it, &amp; them upon his Reader for the Doctrine it selfe from
his constant course of proceeding against it, is also evident; What advantage
this is like in the close, to prove to his cause in the Judgment of considerate
men, the event will discover: The Assertion of the stability of the Promises
of God in Jesus Christ given to Believers concerning his effectuall preserving
them to the End, from such sinnes as are Absolutely inconsistent with his
Grace and Favour according to the tenour of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> or such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in any sinne as is of the same importance by his Spirit and Grace, in
the use of meanes, doth no way tend to the begetting in any, a certaine
Knowledge, Assurance and perswasion, that God will continue them
in a state of Grace, how <hi>desperately carelesse or wicked soever they shall
be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is intended by the frequent repetition of this grosse <hi>Sophistry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> or
what successe with the intelligent Christian ponderers of things he can hope
for thereby, I am not able to guesse; Neither is any improvement in the least
given to what the intendment of this Argument is, so farre as the <hi>Common
Doctrine</hi> of Perseverancc is concerned therein, from the comparison insuing
instituted between the <hi>growth of Corne,</hi> and the walking of Believers in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
before God; For notwithstanding the Identity in respect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of that expression [<hi>Irresistible</hi>] which indeed is proper to neither,
there is a wide difference betweene the <hi>growing of corne</hi> in a meere naturall
way, and the <hi>morall actings</hi> of an Intelligent, Rationall Creature; What ever
operations of God are about, and in the one, or the other, yet they are suited
to their Subejects about which they are; God carryes on the <hi>growth of corne</hi> by
a way of Naturall and necessary causes, but his acting of Rationall Agents is
by such wayes and meanes, as may entirely preserve their Liberty: that is,
preserving them in their being, and leaving them to be <hi>such</hi> Agents. As then
God causeth the <hi>corne to grow by the shining of his sunne,</hi> and the <hi>falling of his
raine,</hi> so he causeth Believers to persevere in Obedience, by <hi>Exhortations,
Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> and such wayes and meanes, as are suited to such
Agents as they are. The fallacy of this Discourse lyes in an insinuation that
God by his Effectuall (or as they are called irresistible) operations for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Believers in Gospell Obedience, (a thing he hath undertaken
over and over, to performe) doth change their nature, and render them not
<hi>free</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi> Agents, fit to be wrought upon by the proposall of suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and desirable Objects to their understandings, but meere bruit and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59070:162"/>
principles of all operations flowing from them; a conceit as grosse and
ridiculous, as certainely destructive to all the efficacy of the Grace of God. All
the rest of this <hi>Section</hi> as farre as it concernes us is only an affirming <hi>this</hi> way,
and <hi>that,</hi> that an Assurance of the <hi>End</hi> to be obtained by the use of <hi>meanes,</hi>
renders those meanes altogether uselesse; which when he proves, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
may be nearer to an issue, than otherwise he hath any Reason to
hope that tis or will be, to his advantage.</p>
            <p>Sect. 4. Leaving the farher confirmation of his Argument he enters upon the
removeall of a <hi>plea</hi> insisted on,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> to the Justification of the Doctrine opposed
and vindication of it from the crime wherewith here by him tis charged:
this he tells you is, that the Exhortations, Comminations, and Promises, spoken
of, are <hi>meanes</hi> appointed of God for the accomplishing and effecting of the
Perseverance of the Saints, which he hath made simply and Absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
by his decree. <hi>This</hi> (he saith,) <hi>hath neither any Logicall, nor Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
virtue in it, for the purpose for which tis produced: but is a notion
irrelative to the businesse the accommodation whereof it pretends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It may be so, suffer you to frame the Objection, and who will
doubt of your Abilityes of giving an Answer; But who (I pray) saies that
God by his Decree, hath made the Perseverance of the Saints simply and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary; that tis certaine in respect of the event, from the Decree
of God, we grant; and do we thereby overthrough the meanes whereby tis
to be accomplished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, we <hi>establish</hi> them; We are of the mind that God
hath purposed, and thereupon Promised, the Accomplishment of many
things, (as the selling of <hi>Joseph</hi> into Egypt, the bringing of the Children of
Israel from thence, and the like) which yet were to be carryed on to their
Accomplishment, and brought about through innumerable contingences,
by the free rationall, deliberative actings of men; If by <hi>simply and Absolutely
necessary,</hi> you intend that the thing Decreed is to be wrought of men, <hi>simply
and Absolutely necessarily</hi> by their operations, as to the manner of them, we
<hi>simply and Absolutely</hi> deny any such Decree; If by those expressions you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
intend only the certainty of the Event, or Accomplishment of the
thing decreed with respect to the <hi>meanes</hi> appointed and fitted thereunto, we
say this establisheth those meanes, neither have they the nature of meanes
to an End from any Reason what ever, but as so appointed of God thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
But he proceeds in the proofe of his former Assertion, and saies</p>
            <p>First that the Exhortations whereby the Saints are exhorted to Perseverance,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note>
are no meanes by which the Promises of Perseverance made, as our Adversaries sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to them are Accomplished or effected, is thus clearely evinced; Whatsoever is
a meanes for the bringing of any thing to passe, ought not to containe any thing in
it, Repugnant or Contrary unto that which is intended to be brought to passe by it,
for meanes ought to be subordinate to their ends, not repugnant; But the Scripture
Exhortations unto perseverance, containe that which is repugnant to the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Perseverance if supposed such as our Adversaries suppose them to be, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can by no meanes effect those Promises; the Minor is evident by the light
of this consideration; such Exhortations as these to the Saints, take heed least at
any time there be an evill heart of unbeliefe in you, least you be hardened through
the deceitfulnesse of sinne; least you fall from Grace, least you receive the Grace of
God in vaine, least you fall from your owne stedfastnesse; in their natve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
tendency import a danger, and serve to raise a feare in men, least the danger
imported, should come upon them; whereas such Promises as these made unto the
same persons, and that not conditionally as is supposed, that there shall never be
an heart of unbeliefe in you, that they shall never be hardened through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of sinne, that they shall never fall away from the Grace of God, exclude all
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59070:162"/>
danger or possiblity of falling away, and tend directly to prevent or extinguish all
feare in men of any such danger; therefore such Exhortations are in their Nature
and genuine import, contrary to such Promises in theirs, and consequently can be
no meanes of bringing them to passe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Exhortations are not so properly the <hi>meanes</hi> whereby the Promises
are accomplished,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> as the <hi>meanes</hi> whereby the things mentioned in the
Promises are wrought; God by, and through them, stirring up those
Graces, which he promises to worke, continue, and to increase in his
Saints.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Exhortations divine,</hi> must be so apprehended as to be subservient to
an End, in respect of God, fore-knowne and determined; `Tis true, we
Exhort men (or may) to those things of whose Event we are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine;
but to God this cannot be ascribed: He doth fore-know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
hath fore-determined the End and Issue that every one of his <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
shall have; and therefore such a nature and no other is to bee
ascribed to them, as is consistent with, and subservient to, a determined
end.</p>
            <p>3. To the confirmation of his <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition, the Answer is easie,
from the consideration; first of the end of the Exhortations insisted on unto
Perseverance; And then of the Promises of Perseverance, themselves, which
are no way inconsistent therewith. For the first, (I say) those Exhortations
<hi>take heed least there be in you an evill heart of unbeliefe,</hi> and the like, are not
given to ingenerate a feare of falling away, (which is a thing in it selfe evill
and opposite unto that <hi>stedfastnesse of Faith,</hi> and full Assurance, which we
should presse unto, so farre is it from any Act of Faithfull Obedience, that
God should aime to worke in the hearts of his, and apply meanes thereunto)
but only to beget an <hi>holy Care and Diligence</hi> in them to whom they are made
or given for the using of the meanes appointed of God, for the avoiding of the
evill threatned to follow upon a neglect of them; which directly falls in, and
sweetly conspires with the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Vse</hi> of the Promises of Perseverance by
us urged and insisted upon. Nothing is imported by them, but only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
that is between the things mentioned in them: as unbeliefe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
from God. This God aimes at in those Exhortations, in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
respect unto Believers, that by them, they may be stirred up to the use
of those meanes, which he hath appointed for them, to be by them preserved
in the Grace, and Mercy which he hath infallibly promised to continue to
them.</p>
            <p>And 4. The end of the Promises of <hi>Perseverance</hi> on which we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fisted,
being their mixing with Faith to establish the soules of the Saints, in
believing the kindnesse and Faithfulnesse of God in his Covenant in Jesus
Christ, they do not take away, nor prevent all danger of perishing, and
so consequently not that feare in any measure which stirres them up so to the
use of meanes that they may not perish, but only are effectuall for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of those dangers which are apt and able of themselves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them: As our Saviour himselfe praies for them <hi>John 17. 15. I pray not
that thou shouldest take them out of the world</hi> (where whilst they are, they will be
sure to meet with dangers and perplexityes enongh) <hi>but that thou shouldest
keepe them from the evill,</hi> wherewith they must reckon to be exercised. There
is not then the least contrariety, or diverse Aspect, between the <hi>Assurance</hi> of
Faith about the <hi>end,</hi> which the Promises tend unto, and the <hi>care</hi> and Godly
feare about the <hi>meanes</hi> instituted and appointed with respect to the end,
which Exhortations do beget, and will notwithstanding those Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:59070:163"/>
5. The greatest inconsistency that can be imagined between <hi>Exhortations</hi>
and <hi>Promises,</hi> as by us explained, is no more than this, that in one place God
<hi>promiseth</hi> that unto us, as his Grace, which in an other he <hi>requires</hi> of us, as
our duty, between which two, who ever feignes an Opposition, he doth his
endeavour to set the Covenant of Grace, as to us proposed and declared, at
variance with it selfe.</p>
            <p>The whole ensuing Discourse unto <hi>Sect</hi> 12.<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> drawing deepe upon an other
Controversy (<hi>viz. the manner of the Operation of Grace</hi>) and being for the
most part borrowed from what is delivered on that head in the <hi>Arminian</hi>
writings,<note place="margin">Acta Synodal.</note> might be past over, as not of any necessary consideration in this place.
What we assigne to the Exhortations of the Word and their consistency with
whatever else we teach of the Saints Perseverance being already heard, this
Argument is at its properissue. But the taske undertaken is not to be waved
or avoided, I shall therefore proceed to the discussion of it. Thus then he
goes on,</p>
            <p>If (<hi>saith he</hi>) such Exhortations as we speake of, be a meanes to effect the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance,
which our Adversaryes suppose to be Promised in the Saints, then must
the Act of Perseverance in the Saints, necessarily depend upon them; so as that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cannot, nor will not be effected without them, i.e. without the Saints submitting
themselves to them. But persevering upon these tearmes clearely supposeth a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of non-persevering, for whatsoever dependeth upon a mutable condition, and
which possibly may not be performed, may be also possible never to come to
passe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Exhortations are improperly said to be a meanes to <hi>effect Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance:</hi>
We say only that they are meanes to stirre up, quicken and increase
those Graces in the exercise whereof, the Saints according to the <hi>Purpose</hi> and
<hi>Promise</hi> of God do persevere.</p>
            <p>2. The Perseverance of the Saints doth consist in the abiding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of those Graces in them, which those Exhortations do so stirre up,
&amp; further or increase. And in that regard, there is a connexion between the
<hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> and the Exhortations mentioned: yea a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the one on the other. But this dependance ariseth not from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things themselves, whence such a Certainty as is asserted would
not arise, but from the purpose and Appointment of God that they should be
effectuall to that end: And therefore</p>
            <p>3. A Perseverance on these termes supposeth a possiblity of non-perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
if you regard only the nature of the things themselves, and set aside
all Consideration of the Purpose, and Promises of God concerning the end,
which is to begge the thingin hand; yea the Promise of God extends it selfe,
to the certaine Accomplishment, of the Saints submission to those exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
So that the end aimed at doth not depend on a <hi>mutable condition</hi> (If I
understand any thing of that Expression, so unsuited to the businesse in hand)
the performance of the condition (or the yeilding of such Obedience as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to the essence of the Saints Perseverance,) being certaine also from the
Promises of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His fift Section is as followeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> If it be said, that the said Exhortations are
meanes of the Saints persevering in this respect, because God by his Spirit, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly
and infrustrably drawes and perswades the Saints to obey these Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as meanes of their persevering: I Answer, It cannot be proved that God doth
draw, or perswade his Saints upon any such tearmes to obey these Exhortations,
Nay frequent experience sheweth, and our Adversaries Doctrrne frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
expressely granteth that the Saints many times are so farre from obeying
these Exhortations, that they walke for a long time, in full opposition to them, is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59070:163"/>
in security loosenesse, vile practices: nor have they yet proved, nor (I believe) ever
will prove, but that they may walke, yea and that many have thus walked, I
meane in full opposition to the said exhortations to their dying day. Secondly,
If God by his Spirit irresistibly drawes his Saints to obey the Exhortations we
speake of, he thus draweth them, either by such a force or power immediately acted
upon their wills by which they are made willing to obey them; or else he maketh use
of the said Exhortations so to worke or affect their wills that they become willing
accordingly; If the former be asserted. Then first, the said Exhortations are no
meanes, wereby the Perseverance of the Saints is effected, but God alone irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
by his Spirit; for if the Will be thus immediately affected by God after such a
manner and wrought to such a bent and inclination, as that it cannot but obey
the said Exhortations or do the things which the said Exhortations require, Then
would it have done the same things whether there had been any such Exhortations
in beeing or no, and consequenly these Exhortations could have no manner of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
about their Perseverance; For the Will according to the common saying
is of it selfe a blind faculty, &amp; followes its owne predominant bent &amp; inclination
without taking knowledge whether the wayes and actions towards which it stands
bent be commanded or exhorted unto by God or no: 2. If the will of a <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
so affected by God that it stands inclin'd &amp; bent to do the things which are
proper to cause them to Persevere; then is this bent &amp; inclination wrought in the
Will of such a person, after his being a S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> &amp; consequently, is not essentiall to him as
a <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>,</hi> but meerely Accidentall, &amp; Adventitious: &amp; if so, then is there no inclinations
or bent in the Will of a S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as such or from his first being a S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to Persevere, or to do
the things which accompany Perseverance, but they come to be wrought in him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
Which how consistent it is with the principles either of Reason or Religion,
or their owne, I am content that my Adversaries themselves should judge. 3. If God
doth immediately &amp; irresistibly incline, or move the wills of the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> to do the things
which accompany Perseverance, the said Exhortations can be no meanes of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
this Perseverance; for the will being Physically &amp; irresistibly acted &amp;
drawne by God, to do such &amp; such things, needeth no addition of Morall meanes,
such as Exhortations are (if they be any) in order hereunto; What a man is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to, he needeth no farther helpe or meanes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o do it. 4. The things which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
Perseverance, import a continuance in Faith &amp; Love to the end; If then
the wills of the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> be immediately and irresistibly moved by God thus to continue, I
meane, in Faith &amp; Love to the end, what place is there for Exhortations to come
in with their efficiency) towards that Perseverance? Need they be exhorted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in Faith &amp; Love, or to Persevere after the end? Thus then we clearely see, that
the former of the two Consequents mentioned cannot stand; God doth not by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
irresistibly draw or move the wills of the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> to do things which are necessary for
the procuring their Perseverance immediately, or withont the instrumentall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of the said Exhortations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> the intendment of this, as also of some following <hi>Sections,</hi> is to
prove and manifest, that the use of Exhortations cannot consist with the
efficacy of <hi>Internall Grace,</hi> and the worke of the Spirit in producing and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
those Graces in us, which in those Exhortations we are provoked and
stirred up unto. A very sad undertaking, truely, to my apprehension, &amp;
for w<hi rend="sup">eh</hi> the Church of God will scarce ever returne thankes to them that shall
ingage in it; He was of an other minde, who cryed <hi>Da Domine qvod jubes, &amp;
jube quod vis;</hi> yea, &amp; the Holy Ghost hath in innumerable places of Scripture
exprest himselfe of another mind, promising to <hi>worke</hi> effectually <hi>in us,</hi> what
he <hi>requires</hi> earnestly <hi>of</hi> us; by the one manifesting the efficacy of his Grace, by
the other the exigeney of the Duty which is incumbent upon us. Nay never
any Saint of God once <hi>pray'd</hi> in his life, seeking any thing at the hand of God,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59070:164"/>
but was of another mind, if he understood his owne supplications: To
what is here urged against this Catholicke Faith of Believers, I say.</p>
            <p>That Exhortations are the <hi>meanes of Perseverance,</hi> in as much as by
them in their place and kinde, and with them the Spirit of God effectually
workes this Peseverance or the matter of it in the Saints. Those cloudy
expressions [of <hi>irresistibly and unfrustrably</hi>] we owne no farther then as they
denote the certainty of the <hi>event,</hi> and not the <hi>manner</hi> of the Spirits operation,
which also they do very unhandsomely. We leave out then in the proposall
of our Judgement about the use of Exhortations, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
those tearmes, and adde in their Roome, <hi>by and by with those Exhortations</hi>
which he omitts.</p>
            <p>He saith then, <hi>This cannot be proved, because the Saints live, and dye often
times in opposition and disobedience unto these Exhortations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Obedience is twofold; First, as to the generall frame of the heart,
Obedience in the habit; and so 'tis false that the Saints live at any time in an
ordinary course, much lesse dye in opposition to those Exhortations; the Law
of God being written in their hearts, and they delighting in it in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, they abide therein; the fruit of Obedience for the most part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought forth by them; And this sufficeth as to their Perseverance</p>
            <p>Secondly, It regardeth particular acts of Obedience, and in respect of them
we all say, that yet they all sinne, (<hi>Optimus ille est, qui minimis urgetur</hi>) but
this prejndiceth not their Perseverance, nor the generall end of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
afforded them for that purpose.</p>
            <p>But he adds Secondly, <hi>If God by his Spirit irresistibly drawes his Saints to
persevere, ut supra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is sorry Sophistry, which may be felt (as they say) through a paire
<hi>of</hi> mittins, For</p>
            <p>First who saies that God workes by <hi>force</hi> immediately upon the wills of men?
Or who makes <hi>force</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to be tearmes equivalent? Or that God cannot
put forth the <hi>exceeding greatnesse of his power in them that believe,</hi> but he
must force or compell their wills: or that he can not work in us to will and
to do of his owne goodpleasure, immediately working in and with our wills,
but he must so force them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whence ariseth the disjunctive force of this Argument? <hi>Either by
immedate actings upon their wills, or he makes use of those Exhortations?</hi> As
though the one way were exclusive of the other, and that the Scripture did
not abundantly and plentifully ascribe both these unto God; both that he
exhorts us to know him, love him, believe in him, and gives us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and an heart so to do; working Faith and Love in us, by the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
efficacy of his power and Spirit: I say then that God workes immediately
by his Spirit, in, and on the wills of his Saints: that is, he puts forth a reall
Physicall power that is not contained in those exhortations, though he doth
it by, and in, and with them: The impotency that is in us to do good, is not
amisse termed <hi>Ethico-physica:</hi> both Naturall and Morall; and the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God to the soule in their doing good, are both Really and <hi>Physically</hi>
efficient, and Morall also; the one consisting in the efficacy of his Spirit, the
other lying in the exhortations of the Word; yet so as that the efficacy of the
Spirit is exerted by, and with the Morall efficacy of the Word; his workes
being but Grace or the Law in the heart, the Word, being the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
so that all the ensuing Reasonings are bottomed upon things
<hi>Male divisa,</hi> that stand in a sweet harmony and compliance with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:59070:164"/>
               <hi>But Mr</hi> Goodwin <hi>tells you</hi> That if God worke by his Spirit &amp; his Grace immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
on the wills of men, to cause them to persevere, then are Exhortations no
meanes of their Perseverance.</p>
            <p>Why so I pray? It seemes we must have no <hi>internall effectuall Grace</hi> from
God, or no <hi>outward Exhortations</hi> of the Word; But he tells you it must be so
because, <hi>If the will be Physically and Irresistibly acted and drawne by God, to do
such and such things, it needeth no adition of Morall meanes, such are Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
thereunto:</hi> That is, if the will be effectually inclined to the wayes
of God, by his Grace, there is then no need of the Exhortations of the
Word. But yet</p>
            <p>First, the Spirit of God though he have an immediate efficacy of his owne, by
&amp; with those Exhortations, yet by those Exhortations he also inclines the will;
&amp; as he workes on the will as <hi>Corrupt</hi> &amp; impotent, by his <hi>Grace,</hi> so he workes on
the <hi>will</hi> as the <hi>will</hi> (or as such a faculty is apt to be wrought upon by a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the understanding) by Exhortations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>to say Obedience would have been produced and wrought had there
been no Exhortations,</hi> is not required of us, what efficacy soever we ascribe to
Grace, unlesse we also deny Exhortations to be appointed of God, and to be
used by the Spirit of God, for the producing of that Obedience. Neither</p>
            <p>Thirdly, doth God worke upon the <hi>will</hi> as a distinct faculty alone of it selfe
without suiting his operations to the other faculties of the soule; Nor is
Grace to be wrought or carryed on in us, meerely as we have Wills but as
we have Understandings also, whereby the Exhortations he is pleased to use,
may be conveyed to the will and affect it in their kind; in a word, this is but
repeating what was said before; If there be any effectuall Grace, there is no
use of Exhortations; If exhortations be the meanes of continuing or increase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace, what need the efficacy of Grace or immediate actings of the Spirit,
working in us <hi>to will and to do of Gods good pleasure;</hi> what validity there is in
these inferences, will be easily discerned; God worketh Grace in men, as men,
and as men <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> by sinne; As men he workes upon them by
meanes suited to their Rationall being, by Precepts and exhortations: but as
men <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> by sinne, they stand in need of his effectuall power,
to worke that in them, which he requireth of them: Of the termes wherewith
his arguing in this case is clowded and darkened, enough hath been remarked
already.</p>
            <p>His second Argument to this purpose,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> 
               <hi>viz. That the Inclination of the will
to good, and to persevere in a Saint, must be after his being made a Saint;</hi> is as
weake and no lesse <hi>Sophysticall</hi> than the former; That inclination is <hi>radically</hi>
wrought in every Believer at his Conversion, the Spirit being bestowed on him,
which shall abide with him for ever, and the <hi>Seed of God</hi> laid in his heart that
shall remaine, and never utterly faile, with an habituall inclination to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of all those Graces wherein their persevering doth consist. <hi>Actually</hi> this
is wrought in them according to the particular dutyes, and actings of Grace,
that are reqnired of them, which they are carryed forth unto, by the daily
influence of Life, Power, and Grace, which they receive from Christ their
head, without whom they can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Neither is the third Exception of any more validity, being only a Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what was spoken before, rendred something more impedite, darke, and
intricate, by the termes of <hi>Physically, Irresistibly,</hi> and <hi>Necessitated,</hi> which how
farre, and wherein we doe allow, hath been frequently declared. The summe
of what is spoken amounts to this, <hi>Gods reall worke in and upon the Soule by his
Spirit, and Grace, is inconsistent with the exhortations to Obedience:</hi> which we
have before disproved, and do reject it as an Assertion destructive to all the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59070:165"/>
efficacy of the Grace of God, and the whole worke of it, upon the Soules of
Men.</p>
            <p>What his Fourth Argument also is, but a Repetition of the same things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
crudely Asserted in other termes, let them apprehend that can; <hi>If God
worke Faith and Love, in the hearts of his Saints, and support them, in them, to
the end, what place is left for Exhortations?</hi> I say their own proper place, the
place of <hi>meanes;</hi> of meanes appoynted by God to stirre up <hi>his</hi> to Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and which himselfe makes by his Spirit, and the immediate efficacy
thereof, effectuall to that end and purpose; And I know no use of that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Are exhortations effectuall to perswade men to Persevere after the end?</hi> being
built only on his false <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and begging of the thing in Question, <hi>viz.</hi>
That if God worke Faith and Love, and continuance of them in our hearts
effectually by his Grace, there is no need, no use of exhortations, though God
so work them, by, and with those exhortations; And this is his first Attempt,
upon the first member of the Division made by him selfe, wherein what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
he hath obtained is left to the judgement of the Reader; And, but that I
shall not, having now the part of one that Answers incumbent on mee, turne
aside unto the proofe of things denied, I should easily confirme what hath been
given in, for the removall of his Objections, from the Testimony of God, by
innumerable places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds then Sect. 6. and saies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> Secondly, Neither can the latter of the said
consequences stand, God doth not make use of the said Exhortations, to influence or
effect the Wills of the Saints upon any such termes, as hereby to make them Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
Infrustrably, Necessitatingly willing to Persevere, or to do the things upon
which Perseverance dependeth.</p>
            <p>For first, If so, then one and the same act of the Will should be both Physicall
and Morall, and so be specifically distinguished in, and from it selfe; for so farre as
tis produced by the irresistible force or power of the Spirit of God, it must needs be
Physicall, the said irresistible working of the Spirit, being a Physicall action, and
so not proper to produce a Moralleffect; Againe, as farre as the said Exhortations
are meanes to produce or raise this Act of the Will, or contribute any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, it must needs be morall, because Exhortations are Morall causes, and so
not capable of producing Physicall, Naturall, or Necessary effects; Now then if it be
impossible that one and the same Act of the Will should be both Physicall and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that is Necessary &amp; not Necessary, impossible also it is, that it should be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the irresistible working of God, and by exhortations of this joynt effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</p>
            <p>It may be Objected, they who hold or grant such an influence, or operation of the
Spirit of God, upon the Will which is frustrable, or resistible, do, or must suppose it
to be a Physicall action, as well as that which is irresistible; If so, then the act of
the Will, so farre as tis raised by the meanes of this action, or operation of God,
must according to the tenor of the former Arguments be Physicall also, and so the
pretended Impossibility, is no more avoided by this opinion then by the other.</p>
            <p>I Answer. Though such an operation of God upon the Will, as is here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
be in respect of God, &amp; of the manner of its proceeding from him Physicall, yet
in respect of the Nature and Substance of it, tis properly Morall, because it impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and affecteth the Will upon which tis acted, after the manner of Morall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
properly so called, that is, Perswadingly, not Ravishingly, or Necessitatingly.
When a Minister of the Gospell in his preaching presseth or perswadeth men to such &amp;
such dutyes or actions, this act as it proceedeth from him, I meane as 'tis raised by
his naturall abilityes of under standing or speaking, is Physicall or Naturall, but in
respect of the substanceo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> native tendency of it, 'tis clearely Morall, viz. because
it tendeth to incline or move the wills of men, to such or such Elections, without
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59070:165"/>
necessitating them thereunto; and so comports with those Arguments or Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in their manner of efficiency by which he presseth or moveth them to such
things; By the way, to prevent stumbling and quarrelling, it no way followes from
the Premises, that a Minister in his preaching or perswading unto duty's should doe
as much as God himselfe doth in or towards the perswading of men hereunto, it
only followes that the Minister doth cooperate with God, which the Apostte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
affirmes in order to one &amp; the same effect, (i.e.) that he operateth in one &amp; the
same kind of efficiency with God, Morally or perswadingly, not necessitating, for
where one necessitates, &amp; another only perswades they cannot be said to cooperate,
or worke the one with the other, no more than two, when the one runnes &amp; the other
walkes a soft pace, can be said to goe or walke together. But when two perswade in
one and the same action, one may perswade more effectually by many degrees
than the other, may have a peculiar Act or method of perswading above the
other.</p>
            <p>That which is now undertaken to be proved is,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> That God doth not make
use of Exhortations, as meanes for the establishing of the Saints in believing,
and confirming their Perseverance; This is that which by us is assigned unto
them, and this all that the Nature of them doth require, that they should be
used unto: the certainty of the event whereunto they are applied depending
not on their Nature, as such meanes, but on the purpose of God, to use them
for that end which he hath designed, and promised to bring about and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish.</p>
            <p>Before
he ventures on any opposition to the intendment of this Assertion,
he phraseth it so, as either to render it <hi>unintelligible</hi> to himselfe and others, or
(if any thing be signified by the expressions he useth) to divert it wholly from
the mind of them, and their sence, with whom he hath to doe: Who ever said
that God by Exhortations, doth influence the Wills of men upon such termes,
as to make them <hi>Infrustrably, and necessitatingly willing to Persevere.</hi> Or, can
he tell us what's the meaning of those termes, [<hi>Infrustrably, Necessitatingly
willing to Persevere;</hi>] Though tis easy to guesse at what he here intends, yet
tis farre above my shallow capacity, to reach the sence of these expressions.
How any of these termes, relating to the event and issue of things, and in
what sence they may be used, I have often shewed; As relating either to the
manner of Gods operation in, and upon the Will, or the Wills <hi>elicitation</hi> of
its own act, (any farther then by relation to that Axiome, <hi>Vnumquod<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> quod
est, dum est, necesse est</hi>) they expresse neither our sence, nor any bodies else that
I know; That which I shall make bold to take up for M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is; That God doth not by Exhortations effectually cause the Saints to
Persevere; To be willing to Persevere, is to Persevere: to be <hi>Necessitatingly</hi>
willing, is, I know not what; Now if such an efficacy be ascribed to Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as teaches the certainty of the effect, so that the certainty of the effect,
as to the event, should be asserted to depend on them as such meanes, this is
nothing to us; we ascribe an efficacy to them <hi>in proprio genere,</hi> but the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that event to whose production they concurre, we affirme, as hath been
abundantly declared, to depend on other causes.</p>
            <p>But the proofe of what is here Asserted, outrunnes for uncouth strangenesse,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note>
the Assertion it selfe, <hi>equis albis,</hi> as they say: For, saith he, <hi>if this be so</hi> (that is,
as you have heard above, how, neither he nor wee know) <hi>then the same Act
of the Will should be both Physicall and Morall;</hi> And</p>
            <p>First, Why so? Because <hi>Physicall</hi> &amp; <hi>Morall</hi> meanes are used for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of it; as though sundry causes of severall kinds, might not concurre to
produce one uniforme effect, farre enough from a necessity of receiving so
much as a Denomination from each of them; In the concurrence of severall
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59070:166"/>
causes, whereof some may be Free and Contingent, others Naturall and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
the Effect Absolutely followes, its next and immediate cause alone;
God causes the <hi>Sunne</hi> to <hi>shine</hi> freely; yet is the shining of the Sunne, a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Effect of the Sunne, and not any way free or contingent. God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the <hi>peircing of Christs side,</hi> and so as to the event made it necessary, but
yet was the doing of it in then that did it, <hi>free,</hi> as to the manner of its doing
&amp; no way <hi>necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> suppose the same act of the will, should be said to be both
<hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>Morall</hi> upon severall accounts;; And what if every Act of the <hi>will</hi>
in, and about things <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> be so? And it be utterly impossible it
should be otherwise? Yea, <hi>But then the same Act should be specifically distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in, and from it selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, but who told you so? The tearmes of <hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>Morall,</hi> as related
to the Acts of the will, are very farre from constituting different <hi>kinds</hi> or <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of Acts; being only severall <hi>Denominations</hi> of the same individuall acts
upon severall regards and accounts; The acts of the will as they flow from
that Naturall faculty, or are elicited thereby, are all <hi>Physicall:</hi> but as they
relate to a Law, whence they are good, or evill, they are <hi>Morall;</hi> the one
tearme expresseth their <hi>beeing,</hi> the other their regularity and conformity to
some Rule whereunto their Agents are obliged: <hi>Quid dignum tanto?</hi> If by
<hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>Morall,</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> intends <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Free,</hi> being the first
that ever abused those words, and in that abuse of them not consistent with
himselfe, (affirming afterwards, the act of a <hi>Ministers</hi> preaching as proceeding
from his Abilityes of Understanding and speaking to be <hi>Physicall</hi> or <hi>Naturall,</hi>
which yet he will not averre to be <hi>Necessary,</hi> but <hi>Free,</hi>) he should have told us
so, and then though we would not grant that the same Act, may not in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
respects be both <hi>Necessary,</hi> &amp; <hi>Free,</hi> the latter in respect of the <hi>manner</hi> of
its performanee, and nature of its imediate cause, the former in respect of the
<hi>Event</hi> &amp; the determination of its first Causes, yet its consequent, is so palpably
false as to the advancing of his former Assertion that t'would have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
denyed without any farther trouble.</p>
            <p>But he adds;<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> 
               <hi>It must needs be Physicall, because it is produced by the Physicall
working of the Spirit of God, which being a Physicall Action cannot produce a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> By <hi>Physicall Operation</hi> of God on and with the will, we understand
only that which is really and effectually so, as different from that which is
only <hi>Morall,</hi> and by way of motive and perswasion; Now this we say is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.
The first consisting in the <hi>Concourse</hi> of God as the first cause, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all Beeings to the producing of every entity; such as the acts of the
wills of men are; &amp; this in such a way, as is not only consistent with the Liberty
of the VVill, in all its Acts and Actings whatever; but also, as, is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the <hi>Liberty</hi> that the will hath in its actings; And in respect of
this Influence of God, the effect produced is only Phisicall or Naturall, having
such a being as is proper to it; as also tis in respect of the will it selfe, and its
concurrence in operation. The other is that which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> here calls
<hi>The irresistible force or power of the Spirit:</hi> destinguishing the efficacy of the
Spirit and Grace of God, in their working in us, <hi>to will, and to do,</hi> producing
those effects, as they are good and Gracious, in reference to their <hi>Rise, End,</hi>
and <hi>Rule,</hi> whereunto they are related. This then is that which by Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
is here asserted; That if there be such an effectuall, reall working of the
Spirit and Grace of God in us, to the producing of any act of the VVills of
men, they cannot be Morall. That is, they cannot-have any goodnesse in them
beyond that which is entitative; And so farre, are we now arrived. All effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59070:166"/>
working of the Spirit of God on us, must be excluded, or all we do, is
good for nothing; Away with all <hi>Promises,</hi> all <hi>Prayers,</hi> yea the whole <hi>Covenant</hi>
of Grace, they serve for no other end, but to keepe us from doing good; Let
us heare the Scripture speake a little in this cause; <hi>Deut. 30. 6. The Lord thy
God will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed, to Love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, that thou maist live. Jere.</hi> 31. 33. &amp; the
32. 39. <hi>This shall be the Covenant that I will make with the House of Israel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those dayes saith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts and write
it in their Hearts, and will be their God and they shall be my people; Chap.</hi> 32. 39.
<hi>I will give them one heart and one way that they may feare me for ever, for the
good of them, and their Children after them. Ezek. 36. 26. A new heart also will I
give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony
heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my Spirit
within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes and ye shall keepe my Judgements
and do them; Act. 16. 14. God opened the heart of Lydia, that shee attended to the
things spoken of Paul; Phil. 1. 29. It is given to you in the behalfe of Christ not
only to Believe on him but also to suffer for his sake;</hi> and <hi>Chap. 2. 13. For it is
God which worke the in you both to will and to do of his owne good pleasure;</hi> as also
<hi>Ephs. 1. 19. That ye may know what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power to us
ward who Believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought
in Christ when he raised him from the dead.</hi> and 2 <hi>Thess. 1. 11. We pray alwayes
for you that our God would fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodnesse &amp; the worke
of Faith with power;</hi> So also in 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Christ he is a new
Creature:</hi> for <hi>Ephes. 2. 4, 5. God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he Loved us, even when we were dead in sinnes hath quickned us together
with Christ; Causing us Chap: 4. 24. to put on that new man which after God is
Created in Righteousnesse and true Holinesse;</hi> with the like Assertions. <hi>John</hi> 3. 3:
<hi>James 1. 18. 1 Pet. 1. 23. John 5. 21. 2 Cor. 3. 5. &amp;c:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What may be thought of these and the like expressions?<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> Do they hold
out any <hi>reall, effectuall, internall</hi> Worke of the Spirit and Grace of God, distinct
from Morall perswasions, or do they not? If they do how comes any thing so
wrought in us, &amp; by us to be <hi>Morally</hi> good? If they do not we may bid farewell
unto all <hi>Renewing, Regenerating, Assisting,</hi> Effectuall Grace of God; That God
then by his Spirit and Grace cannot enable us to act <hi>Morally,</hi> and according
to a Rule, is not yet proved; VVhat followes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saith he</hi> So farre as Exhortatious are meanes to produce these Acts,<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> they must
be Morall, for Morall causes are not capable of producing Naturall or Physicall
effects.</p>
            <p>But if Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> think that in this Controversy, <hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>Necessary</hi>
as applyed to effects are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he is heavenly wide. <hi>Physicall</hi> denotes
only their being <hi>Necessary,</hi> a manner of being as to some of them which have
<hi>Physically</hi> a beeing. The tearme <hi>Naturall</hi> is ambiguous, and sometimes used
in the one sence, sometimes in the other; sometimes it denotes that which <hi>is</hi>
only, sometimes that which <hi>is</hi> in <hi>such a kind;</hi> By a <hi>Physicall effect,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
an Effect with respect to tis <hi>reall existency,</hi> as by a <hi>Morall effect,</hi> an effect
in respect of its <hi>Regularity.</hi> And now, why may not a <hi>Morall cause</hi> have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in its owne kind, to the production of a Physicall effect? I meane an
influence suited to its owne Nature and manner of operation by the way of
motive and perswasion? What would you think of him that should perswade
you to lift your hand above your head, to try how high you could reach,
or whether your Arme were not out of joynt?</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> It hath been sufficiently shewed before, that with these
Exhortations, which worke as <hi>appointed meanes, Morally</hi> God exerteth an
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59070:167"/>
effectuall power for the reall production of that wherento the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
tends, dealing thus with our whole soules suitably to the Nature of all
their faculties, as every one of them is fitted and suited to be wrought upon,
for the accomplishment of the End he aimes at, and in the manner that he
intends; Briefely, to every Act of the VVill as an act <hi>in genere entis</hi> there is
required a really operative and <hi>Physicall concurence</hi> of the Providentiall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God in its owne order, as the <hi>first</hi> Cause. To every Act; as <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
the operative concurrence, and influence of the Spirit of Grace; which
yet hinders not but that by Exhortations, men may be provoked and stirred
up to the performance of <hi>Acts</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> and to the performance of them, as
<hi>good and gracious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being not the direct Controversy in hand,<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> I do but touch upon it;
Concerning that which followes, I should perhaps say, we have found <hi>Anguem
in herba,</hi> but being so <hi>toothlesse</hi> and <hi>stinglesse</hi> as it is to any that in the least
attend to it, it may be only tearmed, the <hi>padde in the straw. Physicall</hi>
and <hi>Morall</hi> are taken to be tearmes, it seemes, Equipollent to <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and <hi>Not-necessary;</hi> which is such a wresting of the tearmes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their knowne use, as men shall not likely meet withall: Hence
is it that Acts Physicall and Necessary are the same; Every Act of the most
free agent under Heaven, yea <hi>in Heaven or Earth,</hi> is in its owne Nature, and
Being, <hi>Physicall;</hi> Acts also are Morall, <hi>i. e.</hi> good or evill, consequently in order of
Nature to their existence, (of which <hi>Necessary</hi> or <hi>Not-necessary</hi> are the Adjunct
manner,) in reference to the Rule, or Law, whereunto their conformity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
How <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Not-necessary</hi> come to be tearmes of the same import,
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will declare perhaps heareafter, when he shall have leisure to
teach as much new <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as he hath already done <hi>Divinity;</hi> In the meane
time we deny that any influence from God on the wills of men, doth make
any Act of them Necessary as to the manner of its production; And so this first
Argument for the Inconsistency, of the use of <hi>Exhortations</hi> with the reall <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of the Grace,</hi> and Spirit of God, is concluded.</p>
            <p>That which followes in this <hi>Section</hi> to the end,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> is a pretended <hi>Answer</hi> to an
Objection of our Authors owne framing; being only introduced, to give
farther Advantage, to expresse himselfe against any reall efficiency of the
Spirit, or Grace of God, <hi>in</hi> the hearts or <hi>on</hi> the wills of men; Not to insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his darkening the Discourse in hand, from his miserable confounding of
those tearmes <hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>Morall,</hi> formerly discovered, I shall as neare
as I can, close with his aime in it, for the more cleare consideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>he tells us,</hi> That the operation of God on the will of man, is in respect of
its proceeding from him, Physicall, but in respest of its nature, and substance, tis
properly Morall.</p>
            <p>But First,<note place="margin">§: 33.</note> if a man should aske Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> what he intends by this <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of God on the will of man, to the end intended, I feare he would be
very hard put to it, to instance in any particular: It is sufficiently evident, he
acknowledgeth none in this kind, but what consists in the Exhortations of the
VVord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, having told us before, that <hi>Physicall,</hi> is as much as <hi>Necessary,</hi> and
<hi>Morall</hi> as <hi>Not-necessary:</hi> How comes it about that the same operation of God,
the same Act of his Power is become in severall regards <hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>Morall?</hi>
That is, <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Not-necessary?</hi> is Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> reconciled to the Assertion,
That the same thing may be said to be Necessary, and Not-necessary, in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
respects?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:59070:167"/>
Thirdly, how comes the same Act or Operation in respect of its <hi>manner</hi> of
proceeding from its Agent, to be Physicall, and in respect of its <hi>Substance</hi> to
be Morall; Or, is any act Morall in respect of its substance, or is its Morality
an <hi>Adjunct</hi> of it, in respect of the regard it hath to some Rule, &amp; farther
End: It is an easy thing for any to heape up such crude Assertions, &amp; in the
meane time not to know <hi>what they say, nor whereof they do affirme;</hi> But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why the Acts of God intimated are <hi>Morall,</hi> is because <hi>they perswade the
Will only, or work perswadingly, not ravishingly, or necessitatingly:</hi> that is in
plain termes, There is no operation of the Grace or Spirit of God, in the
working of any good in the Heart or Wills of men, but only what consisteth
in perswasion of them thereunto. For any reall efficiency, as to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of strength, inworking in us <hi>to will and to do,</hi> tis wholly excluded;
God only perswades, men have the power in themselves, and of themselves
they do it, let the Scripture say what it will to the contrary; For those
termes of <hi>Ravishingly,</hi> or <hi>Necessitatingly,</hi> which are opposed to this <hi>Morall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,</hi>
whereunto the operations of God, for the production of any good in
us, are tied up and confined, wee have been now so inured to them, that they
do not at all startle us; When M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> shall manifest, That God cannot
by the greatnesse of his power, work in us <hi>to Will,</hi> without ravishing our wills,
if we guesse aright at the intendment of that expression, he will advance to a
considerable successe in this contest, not only against us, but God himselfe.</p>
            <p>But an objection presents its selfe to our Author,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> which he sees a Necessity
to attempt the removall of, least an Apprehension of its truth, should prove
prejudiciall to the receiving of his dictates; And this it is, <hi>That if it be so, that
God worketh on the will of man by the way of perswasion only, he doth no more
then the Ministers of the Gospell do, who perswade men by the Word to that which
is good;</hi> To this he tells you, <hi>That it indeed followes, that God &amp; Ministers work
on the Will of man, in the same way, with the same kind of efficiency, but yet in
respect of degrees, God may perswade more effectually than a Minister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all really efficient,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> internall working grace of God, was denied by M.
<hi>Goodwin,</hi> was before discovered; there only tis more plainely asserted. All the
workings of God on the Wills of men unto good, are meerely by perswasion:
Perswasion we know gives no strength, addes no power, to him that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to any thing; it only provokes him, and irritates him, to put forth,
exert, and exercise the power which is in himselfe, unto the things whereunto
he is perswaded, upon the motives &amp; grounds of perswasion proposed to him;
and the whole effect produced on that account, is <hi>in Solidum,</hi> to be ascribed
to the really efficient cause of it, howsoever incited, or stirred up; whereas
then, men by Nature are <hi>dead, blind, unbelieving,</hi> enemies to God, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
them only to exert the power that is in them, &amp; thereby to <hi>live, see,
believe,</hi> and be <hi>reconciled</hi> to him, And this is to exalt the free grace of God
by Jesus Christ; We know full well who have gone before you in these paths,
but shall heartily pray, that none of the Saints of God may follow after you,
into this contempt of the work of his Grace. But Secondly;</p>
            <p>If nothing but Perswasion be allowed to God in the work of mens Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<note place="margin">§: 36.</note>
&amp; in the carrying on of their obedience to the end, Wherein doth the
<hi>Perswasion</hi> of God consist, in distinction from the <hi>Perswasion</hi> used in, &amp; from
the Word by Ministers, which it is pretended that it may excell (though tis
not affirmed that it doth) <hi>many degrees;</hi> Let it be considered (I say) in what
Acts of the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of God his perswasion, so distinct as above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
doth consist: Let us know what Arguments he useth, by what Meanes he
applies them, how he conveyes them to the Wills of men, that are not coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
with those of the Ministry; I suppose at last 'twill be found, that there
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59070:168"/>
is no other operation of God in Perswading men, as to the ends under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
but only what lies, or consists in the perswading of the Word, by
the <hi>Ministers</hi> thereof; God looking on, without the exerting of any efficacy
whatever, which is indeed that which is aimed at, &amp; is really exclusive of the
Grace of God, from any hand in the <hi>Conversion</hi> of sinners, or <hi>Preservation</hi> of
Believers.</p>
            <p>3. He doth not indeed assert any such Perswading of God;<note place="margin">§: 37.</note> but only tels you,
that from what he hath spoken, it doth not follow, <hi>that God doth no more then
Ministers in Perswading men; And that when two perswade to one and the same
Action, one may be more effectuall in his perswading than another:</hi> but that God
is so, or how he is so, or wherein his peculiar perswasions do consist, there is
not in his discourse the least intimation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is in men a different power as to Perswasion; some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a faculty that way, farre more eminent, and effectuall than others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their skill and proficiency in Oratory and Perswasive Arts; this
only is ascribed to God, that he so excells us, as one man excells another; But
how that <hi>Excellency</hi> of his is exerted, thats not to be understood; But there is
proofe tendered you of all this, from 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3. 9. Where Ministers are said,
<hi>to cooperate with God, which they cannot do, unlesse it be with the same kind of
efficiency;</hi> (well said) <hi>And that when one workes Necessitatingly, and another by
Perswasion; they cannot be said to cooperate, no more then one that runnes, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that walkes, can be said to walke together:</hi> Certainly our Author never
dreamed that any man whatever, would put himselfe to the trouble of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
these dictates, or he would have been more wary of his asserting them,
and we had not had so much not only new and strange <hi>Divinity,</hi> but new
and uncouth <hi>Philosophy,</hi> heaped up without any considerable endeavour of
proofe or confirmation.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> That two Agents cannot concurre, or cooperate to the producing of
the same effect, but with the same kind of efficiency, is a rare notion indeed;
Was he never perswaded to doe any thing in his life? What thinks he of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's,</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Amorites</hi> killing of <hi>Vriah?</hi> of a Judge, &amp; an Executioner slaying
a Malefactor; of God &amp; Satan, moving <hi>David</hi> to <hi>number the People;</hi> of God &amp;
<hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, sending him to Egypt? But what need I mention Instances?
Who knowes not that this so confounds all causes <hi>Efficient,</hi> &amp; that principall,
&amp; Instrumentall, <hi>Materiall, Finall, Formall,</hi> which in their production of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
have all their distinct efficiency, and yet their cooperation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The proofe from the Scripture mentioned, extends only to the
interesting of Ministers in the great honour of <hi>Cooperating with God,</hi> in the
work of begetting, &amp; increasing Faith in their own spheare, according to the
work to them committed. But that God, and they, do work with <hi>the same
kind</hi> of efficiency, 'tis the maine intendment of the Apostle in the place cited,
1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3. to disprove; He tells you indeed, there is <hi>a work of Planting and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,</hi>
committed to the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospell; but the <hi>giving of increase,</hi>
(a peculiar working with a distinct kind of Efficiency) that is alone to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to God; It is (I say) his designe, (who every where abundantly informes
us, that <hi>Faith is the gift of God wrought in us by the exceeding greatnesse of his
Power,</hi>) to prove in this place, that though the dispensation of the Word of
the Gospell be committed unto men, yet their whole Ministry will be vaine,
and of none effect, unlesse by an immediate efficacy, or working of his Spirit,
giving &amp; bestowing Faith on his Elect, God <hi>do give an increase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the terme of [<hi>Necessitating</hi>] put upon the reall effectuall
work of Gods Grace on the wills of men, giving them power, assistance, and
working in them to <hi>will and to do,</hi> as different from that which is purely <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59070:168"/>
or <hi>Perswasive,</hi> only which communicates no strength or power, I shall need
no more, but to reject it with the same facility, wherewith 'tis imposed on us;
The similitude of <hi>one walking, and another running,</hi> wherewith the inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a Reall efficient work of Grace, with perswasions, so farre as that they
should be said to cooperate to the producing of the same effect, doth not in
the least, illustrate what 'tis intended to set off; for though one <hi>runne,</hi> and
another <hi>goe</hi> softly, (as suppose one carrying a <hi>little loafe,</hi> another a great <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
of meat for a supper, and both going to the same place, Why may not they
be said to <hi>cooperate</hi> to the providing of the same supper? Must all Agents that
cooperate to the producing of the same effect, be together in one place? You
may as soone bring Heaven and Hell together as prove it: And why must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
efficiency, be compared to <hi>running,</hi> and Perswasion to <hi>soft walking?</hi> As
though one were supposed to carry on the work faster than the other: when
we say only, That in the one there is a distinct power exerted from what is
in the other; which that it may be done, might be proved by a thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and illustrated by as many similitudes, if any pleasure were taken to
abound in <hi>causâ facili;</hi> God or man then cooperate in respect of the <hi>tendency</hi>
of their working unto the event, not in respect of the kinds of their efficiency.</p>
            <p>Of the seventh <hi>Section</hi> (whereon we shall not need long to insist)<note place="margin">§: 39.</note> which in
the entrance frames an Objection, and pretends an Answer to it, there are
three parts In the first he sayes that we affirme, <hi>That though the will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
by God, yet 'tis free in her Election, which how it may be he understands
not;</hi> But if this were all the inconvenience that Mr <hi>G.</hi> could not understand
how to salve the Operation of God in man, with the Liberty of his will, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as wise men as himselfe, have herein beene content to <hi>Captivate their Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
to the Obedience of Faith,</hi> it were not much to be stumbled at;
but the truth is, the <hi>Chimaera</hi> whose nature he professeth himselfe unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
withall, is created in his owne imagination, where 'tis easy for every
man to frame such notions as neither himselfe nor any else can bring to a
consistency with Reason or Truth: Of <hi>Necessitating the Will to Election,</hi> wee
have had occasion more than once already to treat, and shall not burthen the
Reader with needlesse Repetitions.</p>
            <p>In the second division of the <hi>Section,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 40.</note> he gives you his judgement of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the worke of God upon the soule unto the doing of that which is good,
and the effect produced thereby; Whereof the <hi>one</hi> as was said before consists
in perswasions, which he sayes <hi>are thus farre irresistible, that they who are to be
perswaded cannot hinder but that God may perswade them or exhort them, though
he prevaile not with them;</hi> Which doubtlesse is a notable Exaltation of his
Grace. Thus Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> workes <hi>irresistibly</hi> with one or other, perhaps every
day; <hi>And the effect of this perswasion is</hi> (that is, when it is effectuall,) <hi>that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
which it leaves upon the soule to the things whereunto it is perswaded:</hi> As
the case is in the dealing of men one with an other, for my part, I see no
reason why our Author should so often, so heedfully, deliver his Judgment
concerning this thing, especially without the least attempt of any Scripturall
proofe, or indeavour to answer those innumerable cleare and expresse places
of Scripture, which he knowes are every where and on all occasions produc'd
and insisted on to prove a real efficient acting of God in and with the wills of
men for the producing, working and accomplishing that which is good in a
way distinct from that of perswasion, which contributes no reall strength to
the Person perswaded, concurring only <hi>Metaphorically</hi> in the producing of
the effect. Let this at last then suffice; we are abundantly convinced of his
deniall of the worke of Gods Grace in the <hi>Salvation</hi> of soules.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 41.</note> In the third place we have a <hi>Rhethoricall</hi> flowrish over that which he hath
been laying out his strength against all this while being a meere repetition of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59070:169"/>
what hath been already tendered, and given into consideration over, and
over; If God cause the Saints effectually to persevere (his tearmes of <hi>irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
and <hi>Necessitating,</hi> have been long since discharged from any farther atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
or service in this warfare) by Exhortations, then are all his Promises of
Perseverance in vaine; But why so? May not God injoyne the use of <hi>meanes,</hi>
and promise by them the attainement of the <hi>End?</hi> May he not Promise that
<hi>to</hi> us, which he will worke himselfe effectually <hi>in</hi> us? If God effectually
worke <hi>in</hi> us, to give us by what meanes so ever a <hi>new heart,</hi> may he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to give us a new heart? <hi>Yea but amongst men this would be incongruous, yea
ridiculous that a Father should Promise his sonne an inheritance &amp; then perswade
him to take heed that he may obtaine it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But First, If this be <hi>Incongruous,</hi> yea <hi>ridiculous</hi> amongst men in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with one another, doth it therefore follow, that it must be so as to Gods
dealings with men? <hi>Are his thoughts as our thoughts,</hi> &amp; <hi>his wayes as our wayes?</hi>
Is not the wisdome of God foolishnesse with men, and theirs much more so
with him? Are men bound in their dealings with others to consider them not
only in their <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Civill</hi> relations, but as <hi>impotent</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> men,
as God in his dealings with them doth?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither is this course so Ridiculous amongst men, as Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
imagineth; that a Father having promised his sonne an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and
instated it on him, or assured it to him, should exhort &amp; perswade him to be
have himselfe worthy of his kindnesse, &amp; to take heed that he come to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the Inheritance which he hath provided for him, by the meanes
that he hath appointed, (for the prescription of meanes for the injoyment of
the Inheritance must be supposed to go along with the promise &amp; assurance)
is farre from being a course so ridiculous as is pretended.</p>
            <p>Neither Thirdly, is this similitude <hi>Analogous</hi> with that which it is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to illustrate. For</p>
            <p>1. A man may know how, and when, and on what account an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is setled on him by his Father; Of what God promiseth we have Faith
only not <hi>Knowledge,</hi> properly so called; nor alwaies the <hi>Assurance</hi> of Faith as
to the injoyment of the thing promised, but the <hi>Adherence</hi> of Faith, as to the
Truth and Faithfulnesse of the Promiser. Nor</p>
            <p>2. Can a Father worke in his Sonne that Obedience which he requireth
of him, as <hi>He</hi> can do who <hi>Creates a new heart in us and writes his Law and
Feare therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This Absolute ingagement to bestow an Inheritance, whether the
meanes of obtaining it be used, and insisted on or no, is a thing most remote
from what we ascribe to the Lord in his Promises of Perseverance, which are
only that Believers shall Persevere by the use of meanes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> meanes he exhorts
them to use, &amp; yet dealing with them in a Covenant of Grace &amp; Mercy, entered
into upon account of their utter insufficiency in themselves to do the things
that are well pleasing to him, whereunto they are so exhorted, He himselfe
effectually and Graciously, according to the tenour of that Covenant workes
in them what he requires of them, bearing them forth, in the power of his
Grace, to the use of the meanes appointed.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Sections</hi> 8,<note place="margin">§: 42.</note> &amp; 9, containe an endeavour for the taking off, an Instance usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
given of <hi>pressing to the use of meanes,</hi> where the end is infallibly promised
to be accomplished and brought about, in and by the use of those meanes.
And this is in the passage of <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 27. whereof something formerly hath
ben spoken; <hi>Paul</hi> receives a Promise from God <hi>That none of the lives of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with him in the ship should perish;</hi> this he declares to his company and how
deeply he was concerned in the accomplishment of the Promise, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59070:169"/>
thereupon, upon the account of the <hi>undertaking</hi> wherein against al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the World, he was then ingaged, &amp; the cause for which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their company and custody, was formerly declared. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this, he afterwards exhorts them, &amp; directs to the use of all meanes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
that were suitable for the fulfilling of the <hi>Promise</hi> he had, &amp; the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
he had made. Evident it is then, that there is no <hi>Inconsistency,</hi> nor any
thing unbecoming any perfection in God, in that compliance of Promises, &amp;
Exhortations which we insist upon: He having directed <hi>Paul,</hi> to walk in that
very way and path. God (we say) in the Covenant of Grace, hath promised
that his Saints <hi>shall never leave him, nor forsake him;</hi> that he will abide in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
constancy to <hi>be their God;</hi> that he will preserve them, and keep
them in his hand unto the Kingdome of his Sonne in glory, saving his <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ones,</hi> with an everlasting Salvation, to the accomplishment of the <hi>End</hi>
Promised, which he will upon the account of his Truth and Faithfulnesse
bring about, by <hi>Meanes</hi> suitable unto, and instituted by him for that end. In
the compassing and effecting of this great work, God dealeth with men under
a twofold consideration.</p>
            <p>First, As <hi>Rationall</hi> creatures; So he discovers to them the end promised,
with its Excellency, Lovelinesse, and Satisfaction. thereby stirring up in them
desires after it, as that eminent, &amp; proportioned good, which they in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
issue of their thoughts and desires aime at. Farther on the fore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
account, that they are Rationall Creatures, endued with a rationall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
or <hi>Will,</hi> for the choosing of that which is good, and an <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> to
judge of it, &amp; of the meanes for the attainment of the end, God reveales to
them the meanes conducing to the end, proposing them to them to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and embraced, and closed withall for the compassing of the end propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
And that they may be yet dealt withall agreeably to their Nature, and
those principles in them, which they are created withall, that God might
have glory by their acting suitably to such a Nature, &amp; such principles, He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,
and provokes them to choose those waies &amp; meanes, which he hath so
allotted, (as before mentioned) for the end aimed at; And that they should
be thus dealt withall, their very Naturall condition <hi>of being free intellectuall
Agents</hi> doth require.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As <hi>Sinners,</hi> or Agents <hi>disenabled</hi> in themselves for the work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to them, and required of them, for the attaining of the end they aime
at, namely, in Spirituall things: And on that account, he puts forth towards
them, and in them the <hi>Efficacy of his Power,</hi> for the immediate and speciall
working of those things in them, and by them, and which as Rationall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
bound unto an orderly obedience, they are <hi>Pressed and Exhorted</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
To manifest the inconsistency of such a procedure, and the unanswerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it, to the infinite Wisdome of God (though the Scripture expresly
deliver it in innumerable places, as hath been shewen) is that which by Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> is in this discourse attempted; His particular endeavour in the place
under Consideration is, to manifest that, when God promiseth to bring about
&amp; effect any thing <hi>infallibly</hi> (by the use of meanes) 'tis in vaine altogether,
that any Exhortation should be urged on them, who are to use the meanes so
appointed, for the accomplishment of it. And to the instance above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
concerning <hi>Paul</hi> he replies Ch. 13. Sect: 8.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> It is the generally received opinion of Divines, that Promises of Temporall
good things, are still Conditionall, and not Absolute; which Opinion they maintain
upon grounds not easily shaken; Now evident it is, that the Promise under Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was a Promise of this Nature and Kind, relating only to the preservation of the
Temporall Lives of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59070:170"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That all Promises of <hi>Temporall things</hi> without exception, are <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall,</hi>
that is, so as to be suspended on any Conditions, not promised to be
wrought with equall Assurance to that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> depends on them, is not the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any Divine I know, unlesse it be of Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and those of the
same perswasion with him in the matter of our present Controversy; Who
ever but they will say, (if they will) that the Promise of bringing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was Conditionall? Let them that do say so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
the condition on which the Accomplishment of that Promise was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended:
The Promise made to the Parents of <hi>Sampson</hi> of his birth, and
mighty actions, what Condition was it suspended on? And yet was it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of a Temporall thing; Though this may be accounted a generall rule
because for the most part 'tis so, yet may not God make a particular excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereunto? Did he not so in the case of <hi>Hhezekiah,</hi> as to his living 15.
yeares, as also in those cases before mentioned? 'Tis true all such Promises
have <hi>appointed meanes</hi> for their Accomplishment, but not <hi>Conditions</hi> whereon
their fulfilling is Absolutely suspended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he adds</hi> Those words of Paul to the Centurion and Souldiers lately menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note>
(except these abide in the ship ye cannot be safe) undeniably prove the said
Promise to have beene not Absolute, but Conditionall; for in case God should have
Promised Absolutely &amp; without all exception that they should have been safe, Paul
had plainly contradicted the truth of it by affirming, not that they should not, but
that they could not be safe otherwise than upon the Condition of the Mariners abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is boldly ventured; God promiseth that the <hi>End</hi> shall be
accomplished; <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteh to the use of the <hi>meanes</hi> for the attainment of
that End, and in that contradicts the Truth of Gods Promise, if it be not
Conditionall; And why so? Who ever said that God promised that they
should be safe and preserved in the neglect of meanes; They were <hi>men,</hi> and
not stones that God promised so to safegard. And it was by his blessing upon
meanes that he intended to preserve them; therefore he that stirred them up
to the use of meanes, contradicted the promise, unlesse it were Conditionall,
<hi>Paul</hi> saies indeed, <hi>they could not be safe unlesse the Mariners abode in the ship;</hi>
not suspending the <hi>certainty</hi> of Gods Promise upon their continuance in the
ship, but manifesting the <hi>meanes</hi> whereby God would bring about their
safety.</p>
            <p>That which insues in the two following Exceptions, (as <hi>Paul</hi>'s perswading
them <hi>to take meat,</hi> which conduced to their safety, and their <hi>casting the
wheat into the sea</hi> for the same end) amounts no higher than the <hi>Affirmations</hi>
already considered, Asserting an infallible Promise of an end to be attained
by meanes, and an Exhortation to the use of meanes with the actuall use of
them on the account of their necessity as <hi>meanes,</hi> are inconsistent; which is
plainely without the least shew of proofe or truth, to begge the thing in
Question.</p>
            <p>Neither is his Case in hand at all promoted, by comparing this <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Promise given at such a time and season, with those <hi>generall</hi> Promises of
Earthly Blessings made to the Obedience of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Of that which Sixtly followes in the ninth Section, being a marvilous pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Discourse about the Promise here made, as though it should be only this,
that though the <hi>ship</hi> were lost and miscarried, yet none of them in it should
perish thereby (meerly upon the account of the ships miscarrying) though
on some other account, they might be <hi>drowned</hi> at the same time; Which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
narrow scanning he hath at last found out to be the sence of the place, may
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59070:170"/>
well deserve the consideration of them who have nothing else to do; for my
part I have other imployment.</p>
            <p>That which we affirme concerning the <hi>Words</hi> of God by his <hi>Angell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 45.</note> to <hi>Paul,</hi>
is, That that they were such a Promise as could not but infallibly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
according to the tenour of what is in those words exprest, nor
in respect of the Faithfulnesse of God could it otherwise be, but that it must
so fall out and come to passe as was appointed, although the accomplishment
of it was to be brought about by the eminent Blessing of God, upon the
meanes that were to be used by them to whom, and concerning whom it was
given.</p>
            <p>For first, the <hi>Promise</hi> was not only concerning the Mariners and the rest
in the ship, for the preservation of whom the means formerly mentioned were
used, but of <hi>Paul</hi>'s apearance before <hi>Caesar,</hi> a great and eminent worke
whereunto he was designed <hi>Acts 9. 15. Fear not Paul thou must be brought before
Caesar,</hi> Looke then what infallibility in respect of the Event there was, as to
<hi>Paul</hi>'s appearance before <hi>Caesar,</hi> the same there was in the preservation of
the lives of the rest with him; Now although the staying of the <hi>Mariners</hi> from
going out of the ship, was a meanes that <hi>Paul</hi> was kept a live to be brought
before <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet can any one be so forsaken of common sence as to say, that it
was the Condition of the purpose of God concerning the fulfilling of that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
which according to his appointment <hi>Paul</hi> was to make at <hi>Rome,</hi>
with all the mighty and successfull travell for the propagation of the Gospell,
which he after this was ingaged in, VVas it all now cast upon the fall of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
condition not at all determined of God as to its accomplishment?
Doth the infinitely wise God delight to put the purposes of his heart, and
those of so great concernement to the Kingdome of his Sonne and his owne
Glory in the everlasting wellfare of innumerable soules to such uncertaine
hazards, which by various wayes obvious and naked before his eyes, he
could have pretended.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> It is part of the prediction of <hi>Paul</hi> from the promise he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
(and therewith a Revelation thereof) that they should be cast upon
a <hi>certaine Island,</hi> God having some worke for him there to do; Now was this
part of the Promise <hi>Conditionall</hi> or no? If it be said that it was, Let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
on which it depended be assigned. Nothing can be imagined unlesse it
be that the <hi>Wind</hi> sate in such or such a quarter; 'Tis then supposed that God
promised <hi>Paul</hi> and his company should be cast on an <hi>Island</hi> for their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
provided the <hi>Wind</hi> served for that end or purpose: But who I pray
commands the VVinds and Seas? Doth the Wind so <hi>blow where it listeth,</hi> as
not to be at the command of its Maker? Is it not enough that we cast off his
yoake and soveraignty from men, but must the residue of the Creation be
forced so to pay their homage to our free wills as to be exempted thereby
from Gods disposall? If this part of the Promise were infallible and Absolute,
as to the certainty of its accomplishment, why not the other part of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Paul</hi> makes confession of his Faith to his Company, concerning
the Accomplishment of this Promise.<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> 
               <hi>I believe God</hi> (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
It shall <hi>so come to passe in the same manner as it was told
me;</hi> clearely ingaging the Truth and Faithfulnesse of that God which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
(for his Testimony to whose Truth he was then in bonds) for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of what he had spoken to them: <hi>viz. that not one of them should
be lost:</hi> Now supposing that any one person had by any accident fallen out of
the ship, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> tells you there had been no opportunity or possibility
left unto God to have fulfilled his Promise; true, for it had bin wholly frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59070:171"/>
He having undertaken for the lives of every one of them; but supposing
that ingagement of his, he that sayes any one might have so perished, is more
carefull doubtlesse to defend his owne <hi>Hypothesis</hi> than the honour of the
Truth, and Faithfulnesse of God.</p>
            <p>Evident then it is notwithstanding the Tortures, Rackes, and Wheeles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to this Text, with the confession pretended, (and but
pretended) to be extorted from it, (which but that it hath gotten Sanctuary
under his name &amp; wing, would be counted ridiculous,) that here is a Promise
of God making an Event infallible and necessary in respect of its relation
thereto, by a cleare consistency with Exhortations to the use of free, and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
meanes, for the Accomplishment of the thing so promised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 48.</note> 10. He Objects farther to himselfe, <hi>That in sundry places of Scripture, as</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 10. 12, 13. Phil. 2. 12, 13. Heb. 6. 4, 5, 9. there are Promises of Perseverance,
and Exhortations unto it joyned together, and therefore men who deny a regular
and due consistency between them do impute folly and weakenesse to the Holy
Ghost;</hi> Whereunto he Answers sundry things to the end of the <hi>eleventh
Section.</hi> As,</p>
            <p>First they are many degrees neerer to the guilt of the crime specifyed, who affirme
the conjunction mentioned to be found in the said Scriptures, than they who deny
the Legitimacy of such a conjunction; the incongruity of the conjunction hath
been sufficiently evinced, but that any such conjunction is to be found either in the
Scriptures coted or in any others is no mans vision, but his who hath darkenesse for
vision.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If our Adversaryes <hi>ipse dixit</hi> may passe current we shall quickly have
small hopes left of carrying on the Cause under consideration. All our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
must be look't upon as cashired long since from attending any longer
on the tryal in hand, &amp; all our Arguments as blown away like flyes in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
The very things here in Question. <hi>viz.</hi> That there is an <hi>Inconsistency</hi>
between Promises of Perseverance, &amp; Exhortations to the use of the Meanes
whereby it may be effected; that God hath made no such Promises, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no such Exhortations, an that those who appehend any such things <hi>have
darkenesse for vision,</hi> are all confirmed by the renewed stampe of <hi>teste meipso;</hi>
to which proofe, I shall only say <hi>Valeat quantum valere potest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he addes,<note place="margin">§: 49.</note> 
               <hi>That in none of the places cited, is there any Promise of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
is evident to him that shall duly consider the tenour and import of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For First, 'tis one thing to say and each, that God will so limit as well the force
as the continuance of temptations, that the Saints may be able to beare; another
to make a Promise of Absolvte Perseverance; yea those very words, That yee may be
able to beare it, clearly import that all that is here promised unto the Believing
Corinthians, is an exhibiting of meanes to Persevorance, if they will improve them
accordingly, not an infallible certainty of their Perseverance; And that caveat
Let him that thinketh he stands take heed least he fall, plainely supposeth a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his falling, Who thinketh upon the best grounds that he standeth sure;
for that this caveat was not given to Hypocrites or unsound Believers, or to such
who please themselves with a loose and groundlesse conceit of the Goodnesse of their
condition Godward is evident, because t'were better that such men should fall from
their present standing of a groundlesse conceit than continue their standing; nor
would the Apostle have ever cautioned such to take heed of falling away, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was more like to be made better than worse by their falling; And besides to
understand the said caveat of loose believers overthrows the pertinency of it to their
cause who insist upon it, to prove a due consistency between Exhortations to Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and Promises to Perseverance, as is evident; If then it be directer to true
and sound Believers, it clearly supposeth a possibility at least of their falling, in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59070:171"/>
case they shall not take heed, or else their taking heed would be no meanes at least
no necessary meanes of their standing; And farther it supposeth also a possibility
at least of their non-taking heed, or that they might possibly not take heed hereof
otherwise the caveat or admonition had been in vaine; men have no need of being
admonish't to do that which they are under no possibility to omit; If then the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or persevering of the Saints depends upon their taking heed least they fall,
and their taking heed in this kind be such a thing which they may possibly omit,
evident it is that there is a possibility of their non-persevering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 50.</note> This last divison of the tenth Section labours to evince that in the
first of the places above mentioned, <hi>viz. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 12, 13. There is not a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
of Perseverance, in Conjunction with Exhortations unto the use of
meanes unto that end. The words are, <hi>Wherefore let him that standeth take
heed least he fall, There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
man but God is Faithfull who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are
able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to
beare it.</hi> But</p>
            <p>First, 'tis not in the least measure Necessary, or can be upon any account
whatever required of us, that we should produce Texts of Scripture in an
immediate dependance and coherence in the same place, containing both the
<hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Exhortations</hi> mentioned; they being for the most part proposed
upon most different accounts, and for immediately different ends and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
the one (namely) as in the Revelation of them, respecting of our <hi>Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the other our <hi>Obedience;</hi> Nor can they ever the more be denyed to bee
in a <hi>Conjunction</hi> and consistency, though they were not to be found but in <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
places</hi> of Scripture, (which that they are, (especially as to that case which
is Questioned) hath been abundantly declared) than if they were still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
in the same Coherence and connexion of words. But yet</p>
            <p>Secondly, I say there is in the place forenamed a most <hi>patheticall Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the use of the meanes</hi> whereby we may persevere, &amp; a most <hi>infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
that we shall so persevere, and not by any Temptation whatever, bee
utterly cast downe or separated from God in Christ; The first in <hi>v.</hi> 12.
<hi>Wherefore let him that thinkes he standeth take heed least he fall:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 14.
<hi>Wherefore my dearely beloved flee from Idolatry;</hi> the latter in <hi>v. 13. There hath
no temptation taken you &amp;c.</hi> First that there is an Exhortation to the use of
<hi>meanes</hi> for Perseverance, is not denyed by our Author, but granted with an
attempt to improve it for the furtherance of his owne designe: That there is a
Promise also of Perseverance is no lesse evident; the <hi>diversion</hi> and turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of any Believer from God must be by temptation; Temptations are of
various sorts, both in respect of their immediate Rise, Nature and Efficiency;
What ever (whence euer it proceed) turnes from God, more or lesse, in
part or in whole, as is imagined, is temptation; Now the Apostle here ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Faithfulnesse of God in the preservation of Believers from the power
of <hi>Temptations,</hi> so as it shall not prevaile against them to the ends before <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified;
God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is Faithfull;</hi> And there is no need of his mentioning
that property of God, which is his immutable constancy in the performance
of his Promises, but only to assure Believers that he will preserve them as he
hath spoken; the thing promised by the Apostle in the name of God, is (not only
that the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> 
               <hi>may be able</hi> to bear temptations that shall befall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> having quite another importance than what is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in the expression <hi>may be able,</hi> in <hi>Capitall</hi> letters) that he will not suffer
any <hi>Temptation</hi> to come upon them, that shall be above that strength (&amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
against it) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he will communicate to them: &amp; for those w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> do befall
them he will make <hi>way for their escaping,</hi> that with, &amp; by the strength received
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59070:172"/>
they may beare them. So that not only <hi>sufficiency</hi> of meanes to persevere,
but Perseverance it selfe by those meanes, and Gods ordering all things so in
his Faithfulnesse, that no assault shall befall them above the power of the
strength given them to beare, is here asserted. Now the Promise here given is
either <hi>Absolute</hi> or <hi>Conditionall.</hi> If Absolute, that is, so farre as that it shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
be accomplished, not so depending on any thing that in respect of the
Event may, or may not be, as to be left at uncertainty for its fulfilling, It is
all that is of us desired. If it shall be said that it is Conditionall, I desire that
the Condition from whence it is so said to be, may be assigned; If it shall be
said (as tis) that it is, <hi>in case they willingly suffer not themselves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Temptations;</hi> I aske whether the strength and Ability that God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
to his Saints to resist Temptations, be not in the strengthning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
their <hi>Wills</hi> against them? And if so, whether this Promise so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
doth not resolve it selfe into this proposition, <hi>I will not suffer my Saints
to be overborne by Temptations, above the strength I will give them to beare, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be not pressed with Temptations above the strength I give unto the.</hi> The
Promise then is <hi>Absolute,</hi> either that no Temptations shall befall Believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
that they have received, or that strength not to be overcome, shall
be afresh communicated to them upon the assaultes of any new Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>3. This being established that here is a firm Promise of Perseverance, against
which M. <hi>G.</hi> opposeth scarce any thing at al, &amp; nothing at all to the purpose, his
whole insuing Discourse falls of it selfe; for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>caveat</hi> used at the entrance
of this Promise, and the Exhortation at the close, both tending to stirre up the
Saints, to whom the Promise is, made (many of whom have no distinct Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their interest in this, or any other Promise) to be heedfully carefull in
using the meanes of Perseverance, and avoiding the sinnes that in their owne
Nature tend to the interruption of it; no other possibility of falling away
can be concluded, but such as may have a Consistency with the Faithfulnesse
of God in the Promise he hath given: that is, a possibility as they say <hi>in sensu
diviso,</hi> without respect had to the infallibly preventing Causes of it; not <hi>in
sensu composvo.</hi> A possibility in reference to the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelves,
which is a sufficient bottome for <hi>caveats</hi> to be given, and <hi>Exhortations</hi>
to be made to them concerned in them; not at all in respect of the purposes
and Promises of God, infallibly preventing the reducing into Act, of that
possibility; These exceptions then notwithstanding it appeares in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10, 11, 12, 13, &amp; 14. <hi>verses,</hi> there is a Conjunction of a gracious <hi>Promise</hi> of
Perseverance, with effectuall <hi>Exhortations</hi> to the use of meanes whereby we
may persevere; and consequently they who deny a due consistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, do impute folly or weakenesse to the Holy Ghost; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>He proceedes to the next place pointed to by himselfe,<note place="margin">§: 51.</note> to prove a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
between Promises and Exhortations under Consideration: to wit <hi>Phil.</hi>
2. 12, 13. <hi>Wherefore my beloved as ye have alwayes obeyed, not as in my presence
only, but now much more in my absence, worke out your own Salvation with Feare
and Trembling; For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
pleasure:</hi> Evident it is that you have here conjoyed by the Holy Ghost as
weighty and patheticall an Exhortation, as He almost any where useth in the
Scripture, with an Assertion of Grace, as eminently operative and effectuall, as
by any meanes can be exprest.</p>
            <p>But saith he <hi>'Tis one thing to affirme that God worketh in man as to will, so to
do, i. e. to enable men to do or put in execution what they first will, or to assist in
the doing or executing it selfe, another to Promise or worke infallibly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59070:172"/>
all possibility of frustration in men, Perseverance; There is little or no affinity
between these: But how and in what sence God is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, working in
men both to will and to doe of his good pleasure, we shall have occasion to open more
at large in the latter part of this Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I dare say, an <hi>Indifferent Reader</hi> will conclude, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> was
very hard put to it for an Answer, finding him contenting himselfe with such
sorry shifts, and evident pervertings of the words of the Text, as those here
mentioned. For first, How come the words to be changed into a working,
<hi>as to will, so to doe,</hi> that is, perhaps neither the one nor the other? who taught
him to render <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as to will, so to doe?</hi> But Secondly, the
chiefe of the <hi>sport</hi> made with the words, consists in the Exposition given of
them, as they lye in this new Translation, <hi>to work in them as to will, so to doe,</hi>
that is, <hi>to do, what they first will, not that he workes in them to will, but that he
assists them in doing what they first will;</hi> but what is now become of the <hi>tàm,
quàm,</hi> above mentioned? how doth he work in them <hi>as to will, so to do,</hi> if he
only assists them in <hi>doing,</hi> what of themselves without his assistance they first
<hi>will?</hi> Rather than it shall be granted, that God by his grace works effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the Wills of men, to the producing of their elicite acts of Believing and
Obedience, any course may be warranted for the perverting of the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where such an operation seems to be held out. Perhaps this perswasion
also of the efficacy of the grace of God on the wills of men is such, that if it be
found in any place of Scripture, to be declared or asserted, it is enough to
make wise and considering prudent men to question their Authority. But
Thirdly, (saith he) <hi>This is not infallibly to work Perseverance.</hi> I say, shew what
else is required to Perseverance, but <hi>to will and doe,</hi> according to the mind of
God, which of his own good pleasure, he promiseth effectually to work in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and you say something that may render your reasonings considerable;
but it seems we must be kept in abeyance for an answer to this, untill his <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisme</hi>
be ready to manifest, how God is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>working in men,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
what is never wrought without any such effect as is imagined; What
may by him be brought forth to this purpose, time will shew; But if he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>God is working in you to will and to doe,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
from the <hi>Participall</hi> expression of the <hi>verbe,</hi> he will manifest more skill
in <hi>Greeke,</hi> then he hath hitherto in <hi>Divinity,</hi> in all his Learned Treatises: So
that here is a Second instance of a conjunction of <hi>Promises</hi> of Perseverance,
with <hi>Exhortations</hi> to use the meanes suited thereunto; which who so denies
to have a just and sweet consistency, doe <hi>charge the Holy Ghost with folly or
weaknesse;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> The verses pointed to out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 9. doe not so directly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the conjunction insisted on, as those places already considered doe; only
the discourse there used by the <hi>Apostle</hi> is peremptory, that men may without
any disparagement to their wisdome or reason, earnestly deale with others
and exhort them to avoid <hi>falling away</hi> from God, though they are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that those whom they so exhort, by the help of those Exhortations,
and upon other considerations, shall abide with God to the end, or be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>with things accompanying Salvation.</hi> But had Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> been pleased to
look to the following verses, wherein the Apostle gives an account of the
ground of this perswasion of his, he might have found somthing to exercise the
best of his skill upon. The words are, <hi>Beloved we are perswaded better things of
you, &amp; things that accompany Salvation, though we thus speake; for God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
to forget your work &amp; labour of Love which you have shewne towards his
name, in that ye have Ministred to the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> &amp; do Minister, and we desire that every
of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;</hi> he tels
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59070:173"/>
them <hi>v.</hi> 10. it is upon the account of the <hi>Righteousnesse of God,</hi> in carrying on
the worke of their Labour of Love which was begunne in them, and which
they had shewen or manifested, that he had this perswasion concerning them,
which in the insuing verses, he farther pursues, clearing up the ingagement
of the <hi>Rightcousnesse of God</hi> in his <hi>Oath,</hi> of which else where; So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing attempted to the contrary, evident it is that in carrying
on the worke of our Salvation, the Holy Ghost doth make use of <hi>Promises</hi> of
effectuall Grace for Perseverance, and eminent <hi>Exhortations</hi> to abide with
God, in such an harmony and consistency, as is well suited to the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in a course which takes Sanctuary under the shade of his wisdome
from all the charges of folly and weakenesse, which poore weake and foolish
men may under their Temptations, and <hi>in</hi> their darkenesse rise up against
it withall; whether there are expresse Promises of Perseverance in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
some advantage I hope will be given to the pious Reader to judge,
from what hath been spoken, and what by the Lords Assistance, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on to that purpose.</p>
            <p>Unto this debate about the <hi>Exhortations</hi> of the word we find a Discourse
of the same nature &amp; importance subjoyned about the <hi>Threatnings</hi> that are
therein,<note place="margin">§: 53.</note> which as it is asserted are rendered uselesse &amp; ineffectuall for the end
whereunto they are of God appointed, by that Doctrine of Perseverance, w<hi rend="sup">eh</hi>
is opposed; We freely acknowledge, That if any Doctrine whatever, do <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te</hi>
and render vaine any Ordinance or institution of God as to the Ends
and purposes wherereunto itis of him appointed, that, that Doctrine is not of
God, whose pathes are all plaine and equall, and whose commands do not
<hi>enterfere</hi> one with an other; Now that the principles of the Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
do destroy the efficiency of <hi>Threatnings,</hi> is attempted to be proved
by an Induction of observations which being the summe of all that is spoken
to this head, must be transcribed at large, and is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.<note place="margin">§. 54.</note> If the principles of the Doctrine we speake of, dissolve the efficiency of
the said Threatnings towards the end, for the accomplishment whereof they are
given, then they render them unsavoury, uselesse and vaine; But the principles of
this Doctrine are guilty of this offence: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The tearmes of the Major proposition
are sufficient witnesses of the truth thereof; in order to the proofe of the Minor,
we suppose first that the end intended by God in such Threatnings, which threaten
those that shall Apostatize, with eternall death, is to prevent Apostacy in the Saints,
&amp; to worke or cause them to persevere; 2. That this is one of the principles of the
common Doctrine of Perseverance, God hathabsolutely promised finall Perseverance
unto the Saints; and this another, God will certainely, infrustably, &amp; infallibly
worke this Perseverance in the Saints. These two things only supposed, the light of
the truth ef the said Minor proposition breakes forth from between them with
much evidence and power: For First if the said Threatnings be intended by God
for the prevention of the Apostacy of the Saints, and consequently to effect their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
the way and manner wherein this end intended by God is to be effected by
them, must needs be by their ingenerating or raising a Feare, or Apprehension in
the Saints of Eternall Death; it being the native property of Feare, mixed with hope
to awaken and provoke men to the use of such meanes which are proper to prevent
the danger or evill feared; there is no otherway imaginable how or whereby the
Threatnings we speake of should operate towards the Perseverance of the Saints for
the preventing of their Apostacy, but that mentioned, viz. by Working in them a
feare or dread of the evil threatned. Therefore Secondly evident it is that such
Promises made, and made knowne unto the Saints by which they are made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peable
of any such Feare, are absolutely destructive of the efficiency, which is proper
to the said threatnings, to exhibit towards the prevention of Apostacy in the Saints,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59070:173"/>
or for the causing of them to Persevere. And Lastly, 'tis every whit as evident,
that such Promises whereby God should assure the Saints, that they shall not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize,
but Persevere, are apt and proper to render them uncapable of all feare of
Eternall Death, and consequently are apperently obstructive of, and destructive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the native tendency of the said Threatnings towards, and about the Perseverance
of the Saints; these Threatnings can doe nothing, contribute nothing towards the
Perseverance of the Saints, but by the mediation of the Feare of evill in them, upon
their nonpersevering; therefore whatsoever hardens them against this feare, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them uncapeable of it, supersedes all the virtue and vigour which are to
be found in these Threatnings, for or towards the effecting of their Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 55.</note> First, be it granted that one end of God in his threatnings, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Apostacy</hi> in the S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>, by stirring them up to take carefull heed to the wayes
and meanes whereby they may persevere, and that they no otherwise worke
or cause Perseverance, but as they so stirre up and provoke men to the things
wherein they are to abide; But this is not their only end. They are also disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veryes
to all the world of the <hi>severity</hi> of God against sinne, and that it is his
<hi>Judgement, that they who commit it are worthy of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If by <hi>Absolute Promises</hi> of <hi>Finall Perseverance,</hi> you intend such
Promises of Perseverance, in, and by the use of meanes, instituted and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God himselfe for the accomplishment of the end promised, which are
not made or given, upon the Consideration of any worth in them to whom
they are made, nor do depend as to their Accomplishment, on any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in them as in the event and issue may not be fulfilled, this observation
also is granted. You may adde also, that God will certainely, effectually and
infallibly worke in them an abiding with him to the end, <hi>or put his Law in
their hearts that they shall never depart from him;</hi> If by <hi>infrustrably</hi> also, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
only that he will so worke it as that his Counsell and Purpose shall not
in the end be <hi>frustrated</hi> or disappointed, we grant that also, for he hath said
<hi>his Counsell shall stand and he will do all his pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things being thus supposed, let us try the inferences from them, that
must make good the former Assertion concerning the frustration of the use
of <hi>Comminations</hi> by them, for they are singled out to beare the weight of this
charge.</p>
            <p>To the first <hi>Assumption</hi> then and <hi>Inference</hi> I say, there is a twofold feare of
eternall death and destruction. 1. An <hi>Anxious perplexing Feare,</hi> in respect
of the <hi>End</hi> it selfe; 2. A <hi>Watchfull carefull Feare</hi> in respect of the <hi>meanes</hi>
leading thereunto; In respect of the first, it is utterly denyed, that the use
and end of the <hi>Threatnings of God,</hi> in respect of his Saints, are to ingenerate any
such Feare in them, it being directly opposed to that Faith, Assurance,
Peace, Boldnesse Consolation, and Joy, that God is pleased to afford to them
and abundantly exhorts them to live up unto; Yea an <hi>Anxious abiding Feare
of Hell,</hi> is fully contrary to that very <hi>Conditionall</hi> Assurance of Salvation,
which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hinselfe in respect of their present Condition allowes to
them; Nor hath the Lord instituted his Ordinances at such a difference and
Opposition one to another, as that at the same time towards the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they should be effectuall to beget opposite and contrary frames and
principles. For the other, or a <hi>Watchfull heedfull Feare</hi> for the avoiding of the
way &amp; <hi>meanes,</hi> that <hi>would</hi> lead them, and <hi>do</hi> lead others to destruction, that is
not in the least inconsistent with any Assurance, that God is pleased by his
Promises to give to his Saints of their Perseverance. God will have them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
their Perseverance in the way wherein he hath promised it; that is, by the
use of such and such Meanes, helpes, and Advantages, as he hath appointed for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59070:174"/>
the effectuall Accomplishment thereof. And therefore nothing is in vaine, or
useleslly applied to them, which according to his appointment is suited to the
stirring of them up to the use of the meanes ordained for that end, as before
mentioned. Therefore to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s second Assertion which he calls <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:</hi>
I say</p>
            <p>First that it is not the <hi>making,</hi> or the bare <hi>making knowne</hi> to the Saints of the
Promises of God, that will worke the end for which they are given to them,
or enable them to mixe them with Faith; and according to the strength of
that, and not according to the Truth that is in the Promises themselves, is
their Assurance of the things promised; And therefore notwithstanding all
the cleare Promises of Perseverance which are <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>made knowne</hi> to them
we see very many of them not to come up to any such Assurance thereof, as
to be freed from the <hi>First</hi> sort of Feare mentioned, which yet is the proper issue
of <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> to the begetting whereof in them, God hath not instituted any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
            <p>Secondly that none of the Saints of God are by the Promises of Grace
which we assert, freed from that Feare which is the proper product and effect
of Gods Comminations in respect of them, and therefore by them there is no
obstruction laid in the way of the proper efficiency of those threatings; What
is added in the <hi>third</hi> and last <hi>place,</hi> is only a Repetition of what was before
spoken, without any attempt of Proofe; unlesse he would have it look't upon
as a <hi>Conclusion</hi> from the <hi>premises,</hi> whose weakenesse being discovered as to
the intent and purpose in hand, we need not farther trouble our selves with
it. Instead of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s now considered, take these few <hi>Observations</hi> which
will give so much light into the whole matter under debate, as may <hi>supersede</hi>
his whole insuing Discourse.</p>
            <p>First then,<note place="margin">§: 56.</note> it may be observed (as it was by the way in the foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
that notwithstanding the <hi>Promises of Perseverance</hi> which are given to
the Saints, yet many there are, who are not enabled all their dayes to mix
them with Faith (although their interest &amp; portion lyes in them, no lesse than
theirs who through Grace attaine the greatest Assurance) and on that
account do never all their dayes get free from some bondage by reason of
the <hi>Feare of Death</hi> and destruction: And in respect of such as these, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
and threatnings insisted on, may have much of that End accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
which by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is assigned to them; not that such a frame is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
aimed at in them, Christ dying to deliver them, who, <hi>by reason of Death
were in bondage all their dayes,</hi> from that bondage which the Feare of Death
for since doth keepe the soules of men in and under, but that it followes and
will follow upon their darkenesse and weaknesse of Faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Promises of Perseverance being of the effecting and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of it, by and in the <hi>use of meanes,</hi> do not, nor will give delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to them to whom they are made from feare of death and Hell, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whilst they conscientiously use the <hi>meanes</hi> appointed for them to walke in:
so that upon their deflexion from the <hi>Rule</hi> which is <hi>attended with Mercy and
Peace,</hi> the threatnings of God to sinne and sinners, to Apostacy and Apostates,
do lay hold on them in their full force and efficacy; especially to the ingene
rating in them a <hi>Terrour of the Lord</hi> (as the Apostle speakes) &amp; an abhorrency
of their wayes, a loathing of them <hi>as not good,</hi> that would cause them to fall
into the hands of the Living God; So that all Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Arguings, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
levied against the <hi>certaintey</hi> of Perseverrance but mens Certainty that
they shall Persevere (which some never attaine unto some loose either in
whole, or in part, oftentimes) are not to the businesse in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:59070:174"/>
Thirdly, that eternall death and destruction is not the only subject of
God's <hi>Threatnings,</hi> nor all the evill that <hi>they</hi> may have a feare of, whom he
deals withall by them; Desertion, Rejection, Rebukes, sharpe and keene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
blowes of Gods hand, Temporall death it selfe, with the like, are also
threatned; yea and so often in an eminent and dreadfull manner, have been
inflicted, that though they might be supposed to have alwayes some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Assurance of Deliverance <hi>from the wrath that is to come,</hi> yet the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
of God may be suited to beget in them this feare of evill to such an
heigth, as may make their <hi>bowels to flow like water, rottemesse to enter into their
bones and all their joynts to tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the end of the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God, being to discouer to men
the connexion that is by his Appointment, between the <hi>sinnes</hi> exagitated and
the <hi>punishment</hi> threatend, whence the <hi>Feare</hi> mentioned doth consequently
insue, they may obtaine their full &amp; primary effect, though that Feare be not
ingenerated, If they be prevailed on, by any other Considerations, so that the
sinne be avoided.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that when The Saints do walke orderly, regularly, and closely with
God, in the use of meanes by him appointed, and so doing, from the Promises
of Perseverance do receive a comfortable Assurance that they shall be kept
by the <hi>power of God through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> the begetting in them of
<hi>Feares of Death and Hell,</hi> is neither usefull in it selfe, nor are they intended of
God to be their portion. But if at any time they <hi>turne aside from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
and thereby faile of the perswasion of their Perseverance (as
their Faith will be by such meanes impaired) though the certainty of the
thing it selfe be no lesse infallible than formerly, yet by the Threatnings of
God to them it may be needfull, to rouze them (by the terrours of the Lord
in them) from the Condition whereinto they have cast themselves.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but that from the light of these and the like Considerations
which might farther be insisted on, it will appeare that there may be, and
is an harmonious consistency between the Promises and Threatnings of the
Scripture, notwithstanding the mist that is raised in a long and tedious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to interrput the evidence thereof.</p>
            <p>In the 13 Section,<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> under pretence of Answering an Objection, a long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is drawen forth farther to varnish over what was before spoken, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of importance to my best observation being added; It may be reduced
to these foure heads.</p>
            <p>First an Assertion, <hi>hat the Threats against Apostacy do not belong to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
that is, to them that are not really Regenerate, let their profession be what
it will; for Hypocrites ought not to Persevere in the way wherein they are to the
end, and therefore there is no danger of their falling away from it:</hi> Which is a
Ridiculous peice of <hi>Sophistry;</hi> For though they may not be exhorted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> which corrupts and vitiates their profession, yet they
may in their <hi>profession,</hi> which in it selfe is good. And though there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of leaving their <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> yet there is of their waxing worse and worse,
by falling from the beginnings of Grace which they have received, the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which they have made, and the Regular Conversation which they have
entred upon; So that notwithstanding any thing sayd to the contrary, the
comminations under consideration may principally belong to some kind of
professours, who notwithstanding all their guifts and common Graces which
they have received, yet in a large sence may be termed <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> as they are
opposed to them who have received the Spirit, with true and saving Grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly he saies <hi>It is evident that they belong unto true Believers from Heb.</hi>
6. 4, 5, 6, and 9. and Heb. 10. 26, 27, and 29. but if there were no better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59070:175"/>
of the concernment of true Believers in the threatnings made to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
than what can be drawne from the places mentioned, I dare undertake
that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> shall never prove any such concernment of theirs
therein, whilst his eyes are open; but about this I shall not at present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he tells us; <hi>That the end and aime of God in these threatnings is the
good of Believers;</hi> Of which as farre as they are concerned in them, I much lesse
doubt, than I do of the clearenesse of the proofe of this Assertion, from <hi>Psal.</hi>
85. 8. <hi>I will heare what God the Lord will speake, for he will speake peace to his
people and to his S<hi rend="sup">ts</hi> but let them not turne againe to folly;</hi> A place that I presume
was hooked in here violently, for want of a fitter opportunity to wrest it
with a by interpretation, because it lookes so hardly on the Doctrine which
our Author hath undertaken to defend; But let this passe also.</p>
            <p>His fourth Assertion which he pursues at <hi>large,</hi> or rather with <hi>many words,</hi>
is, <hi>That these Threatnings have no tendency to the good of Believers, but only by
begetting in them a feare of Hell and Destruction; which that they ought to do is
strongly proved from Luke</hi> 12. 4, 5. Where we are bidde to feare <hi>him who can
cast both body and soule into Hell-fire;</hi> Now though the <hi>Logicke</hi> of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth scarce appeare to me, or the strength of the inference from the
text, there being a great difference between <hi>fearing him who can cast both body
and soule into Hell-fire,</hi> and fearing of <hi>Hell-fire;</hi> between fearing God for his
Severity and Power, in Opposition to the weakenesse and limitednesse of
Persecutors, (even whilst we <hi>feare not their feares, but sanctify the Lord of
hosts in our hearts, making him our dread and our feare</hi>) and such a feare of
punishment as is inconsistent with the Promises of God that we shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in Obedience, &amp; so be free from it; Yet I shall consider the following
Discourse that is built thereon. Supposing all that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> observes from
this Text, and that the reason of the feare here injoyned, is taken from the
power of God to cast into Hell, yet the whole of the Argument thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
but thus farre, because such who are threatned to be persecuted by
men who can only <hi>kill their bodyes,</hi> ought rather to feare God who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his power of punishing to the <hi>destruction of body and soule:</hi> of those that
offend him, therefore there is such a feare ingenerated in the Saints by the
Threatnings of the Word as is inconsistent with the truth of Gods sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse
in his Covenant with them, to keepe them up to Obedience unto the
end.</p>
            <p>Sect.<note place="margin">§. 59.</note> the 14. he farther pleades from <hi>Heb. 11. 7. 2 Kings 22. 19, 20. That the
eminentest and Holyest men that live may do many things from a principle of feare
or of being afraid of the Judgments of God that they should come upon them,
and upon that account have beene put upon wayes that were acceptable to
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We know that the <hi>Feare of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdome:</hi> and
that the Feare <hi>of the Lord and his Goodnesse,</hi> is a great Mercy of the Covenant
of Grace; This is not the thing here pleaded for: it is a thing quite of another
nature, even that ascribed to the strange nations that were transplanted into
<hi>Samaria,</hi> by the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> upon the captivity and removeall of the ten
tribes, and frightened by <hi>Lyons</hi> that destroyed some of them, who did yet
continue to worship their owne Idolls, under the dread of God which was
upon them, which is called the <hi>Feare of the Lord.</hi> To compleat this feare 'tis
required that a man have such an Apprehension of the comeing of Hell and
Wrath upon him, as that he be not relieved against it, by any interposall
of Promise, or ought else from God, that he should be preserved in the way
and path whereby he shall assuredly finde deliverance, from that which he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59070:175"/>
feares; How farre this kind of Feare, the feare of Hell, not as declarative of
the terrour of the Lord, but as probable to betide, and befall the persons so
fearing it, and that solely considered as an evill to himselfe, may be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of any act of acceptable Gospell Obedience is not cleared by Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
nor easily will be so. For</p>
            <p>1. That it is not the intendment of any divine <hi>Threatnings</hi> to beget such
a Feare in reference to them that believe, hath beene declared.</p>
            <p>2. It is no fruit or product of the Spirit of Life and Love, which as hath
beene showne is the principle of all our Obedience and walking with
God.</p>
            <p>3. It holds out a frame of Spirit directly contrary to what we are called
ond admitted unto under the Gospell; For <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of
feare, but of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>We have not received the Spirit of bondage unto feare, but the Spirit of Adoption
whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> The Spirit of this Feare and Dreade, and the
bondage that attends it, is at open variance with the Spirit of Liberty, Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Power, Adoption, and a <hi>sound minde</hi> wherewith Belivers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.
And</p>
            <p>4. It is that which the Lord Christ intended to remove and take away
from his, by his death, <hi>Heb. 2. 15. He dyed that he might deliver them, who for
feare of death were in bondage all their dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This feare then I say, which is neither Promise of the Covenant, nor fruit
of the Spirit, nor product of saving Faith, will scarce upon strict inquiry be
found to be any great furtherer of the Saints Obedience; what use the Lord is
pleased to make of this dread and terrour in the hearts of any of his, for the
<hi>hedging up their wayes</hi> from folly, and staving them off from any Actuall evill
when through the strength of Temptation they do begin to cast off the Law
of Life and Love whereby they are governed, is not in the least prejudiced
by any thing asserted in the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance; Toward
some who though they are perswaded of the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints</hi> Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
yet have no perswasion, or at least no <hi>prevailing chearing Assurance</hi>
that themselves are Saints (which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinkes to be the condition of
far the greatest part of Believers) it hath its full power &amp; extent, its whole
efficacy depending on the Apprehensions of the minde wherein it is. Towards
the residue, who upon abiding grounds and sure foundations have obtained
a comfortable, Spirituall perswasion of their owne <hi>Interest</hi> in the Promises
of God, That the consideration of Hell and Judgement as the due debt of sinne
and necessary vindication of the Glory of God hath also its Effects and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as farre as God is pleased to exercise them therewith, acquainting them
continually with his Terrour, and filling them with an abhorrency of those
wayes which in and of themselves, tend to so dismall an end and issue, hath
beendeclared.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 60.</note> the places of Scripture mentioned by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> doubtlesse
will not reach his intendmend. Of <hi>Noah</hi> it is said, that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after he
was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Being <hi>warned of God</hi> of that <hi>floud</hi> that was for to come upon
the World of ungodly men, and the Salvation of himselfe and his Family
by the <hi>Arke;</hi> being filled with the Reverence of God and assured of his owne
preservation, he industriously sets himselfe about the use of the <hi>meanes,</hi>
whereby it was to be accomplished. That because a man assured of an end
from God himselfe, in and by the use of meanes, did with a Reverentiall
Feare of God, not of any evill threatned which he was to be preserved from,
set himselfe to a conscientious use of <hi>meanes</hi> whereby the promised end of
God's owne institution is to be brought about; Therefore the Feare of Hell,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59070:176"/>
(such a Feare as hath been decribed) is one principle of the Obedience of
the Saints in their walking with God, and such as they ought to cherish, as
being a meanes appointed of God for that end and purpose, is an Argument
of no great value <hi>here</hi> with us. Neither surely will the Conclusion intended
be more evidently educed, from the <hi>tendernesse of the heart of Josiah</hi> under the
preaching of the Law, mentioned in the second place, and therefore I shall
not need to call it into Examination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is added farther Sect. 14. p.</hi> 314. The present state and frame of the
hearts and soules of the Saints duly considered,<note place="margin">§: 61.</note> which are made up as well of flesh
and corruption, as of Spirit and Grace, the former having need of bridles for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
as well as the latter of spurres for quickning, evident it is that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or motives drawne from feare of punishment, are as necessary and proper for
them in respect of the one, as incitements from Love, in respect of the other. A
whip for the Horse (saies Solomon) a bridle for the Asse, and a rod for the Fooles
backe; The flesh even in the wisest of men, is a foole, and would be unruly without
a rod ever and a non shaken over it; nor should God have made such gracious,
bountifull and effectuall provision, for the Perseverance of the Saints, as now he
hath done, had he not ingaged as well the passion of Feare within them, as of Love
to be their guardian keeper. 'Tis true perfect love casteth out Feare, but who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Saints themselves can say either that his heart is cleane, or his Love
perfect? Perfect Love casteth out flesh, as well as Feare, yea true Love untill flesh be
cast out preserveth feare, for its Assistant and fellow helper; the flesh would soone
make Love, a wanton and intice her unto folly, did not feare dissolve the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and protect her Chastity:</p>
            <p>Of this last Division of the 34. <hi>Section,</hi> there are two parts; The first <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative</hi>
of what was spoken before, concerning the usefullnesse of the <hi>Feare</hi>
of <hi>Hell</hi> &amp; punishment for the furthering of the Saints Obedience. The other
<hi>Responsatory</hi> to what is urged to the contrary from 1 <hi>John 4. 18. Perfect Love,
casteth out Feare:</hi> For the first, it is granted, that there are those two contrary
principles of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> Corruption and Grace, in the hearts of all, even
even the best and most eminent Saints; whilst they continue here below. But
that these two, should be principles acting themselves in their Obedience,
the one moved, incited, and stirred up by <hi>Love,</hi> the other from the <hi>Feare</hi>
whereof we are speaking, is a Fleshly, Darke, <hi>Anti-evangelicall</hi> conceit;
That the principle in Believers which the Scripture calls <hi>Flesh,</hi> &amp; Corruption,
needs incitement to Obedience, or is to be incited there unto, as is affirmed,
is no lesse corrupt than what was before mentioned. Looke whatsoever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Corruption</hi> hath into any of our Obedience, so far that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is vitiated, corrupted, rendered <hi>uncleane</hi> and unacceptable before
God; The Flesh is to be <hi>crucified, slaine, destroyed,</hi> not stirred up, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to Obedience, being indeed Disobedience in the Abstract? <hi>enmity to God.</hi>
You may as well perswade <hi>darkenesse</hi> to <hi>shine,</hi> as the <hi>Flesh</hi> to <hi>Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y;</hi> It is not a
<hi>foole</hi> (as that Allusion bespeakes it from <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 3.) that would ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
be unruly, were not a <hi>rod</hi> shaken over him; but it is <hi>folly it selfe,</hi> that is
not to be cur'd, but kill'd, not stirred up, but mortifyed. How that is to be
done, hath been formerly at large declared: It is by the <hi>Spirits</hi> bringing the
<hi>Crosse</hi> and power of the death of Christ into the heart of the sinner, and not
by any consideration of Hell, and punishment, that we can take upon our
selves (which never did, nor never will fortify any sinne, to the end of the
world) that this worke is to be wrought.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that which is added of God's bountifull provision for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
of the Saints by ingaging the passion of <hi>Feare,</hi> as well as <hi>Love,</hi> is of
no better a frame, or Constitution than that which went before. That our
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59070:176"/>
gratious Father hath made <hi>fuller, larger,</hi> and more certaine provision for our
Perseverance, than any can be afforded by the ingaging of <hi>our passions,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of punishment or reward, I hope, hath been sufficiently demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And if Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> intend no more by his <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Feare</hi> of God, than
the ingaging of <hi>those naturall passions</hi> in us, by the cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>derations intimated, I
shall not be Rivall with him in his Perswasion; The Love we intend is a <hi>Fruit
of the Spirit</hi> of God in us, and the <hi>Feare</hi> contended about, of the <hi>Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:</hi>
which though it be not pressed on us as our duty, yet we hope that
bountifull provision is made for our Perseverance, as shall effectually support
and preserve us to the end: Blessed be his name, his Saints have many better
Guardians and keepers, then a bondage frame of Spirit, upon the account of
the wrath to come, from whence they are delivered by Christ; They are <hi>in his
own hand,</hi> and in the <hi>hand</hi> of his Sonne, and are <hi>kept through Faith by his power
to Salvation.</hi> If this be the end of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Preaching the threatnings of
God at any time, <hi>viz.</hi> that the naturall <hi>passion of Feare,</hi> being stirred up with
the apprehensions of Hell, the Flesh that is in Man, may be incited to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I hope he hath not many consenting with him in the same intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, To an Objection framed from</hi> 1 Ioh: 4. 18. That perfect Love casts
out feare,<note place="margin">§. 62.</note> 
               <hi>First,</hi> That it may be so, but whose Love is perfect. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
That Love cherisheth Feare, untill the Flesh be quite cast out. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
the Flesh would make Love wanton, and intice it to folly, did not Feare dissolve the
inchantment: <hi>But,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Though Love be not <hi>perfect</hi> to all degrees of Perfection here, yet it
<hi>may</hi> have, yea it <hi>hath</hi> in the Saints the perfection of Uprightnesse and Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is all that is here intended, and all that is required to it, for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
out of that <hi>Tormenting Feare</hi> of which the Apostle speaks. <hi>Feare</hi> (saith
he) <hi>hath torment:</hi> And if our Love cannot amount to that perfection, as to
cast it out, it being only to be cast out thereby, it is impossible we should ever
be freed from <hi>Torment</hi> all our daies, or be fill'd with joy &amp; Consolation in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
which would frustrate the glorious designe of God, which he hath
sworne himselfe willing to pursue, <hi>Heb:</hi> 6. 13. and the great End of the death
of Christ, which he hath perfectly accomplished, <hi>Heb:</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is true; there is a <hi>Feare,</hi> that Love cherisheth; the Feare that
God hath promised in the Covenant of Grace, to preserve in our hearts all
our daies; But to say, it cherisheth the Feare we speake of, and which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost in this place intendeth, is expressely to make the Holy Ghost a <hi>lyar,</hi>
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> contradict him to his face.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; What Love in us, is that, that the <hi>Flesh can</hi> or may <hi>intice to folly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
Are the <hi>fruits of the Spirit of God,</hi> Graces of his own working and creating in
us, of such a Temper and Constitution, as that they may be <hi>inticed to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and folly?</hi> And is it possible that such a thought should enter into the
heart of a man, professing the Doctrine of the Gospell? that <hi>inke should staine
paper,</hi> with such filth cast upon the Spirit and Grace of God? <hi>The Feare of
Hell</hi> ere-while was suited to the use <hi>of the Flesh,</hi> but now (it seems) it serves
to keep the Love of God it selfe in order, that otherwise would wax <hi>wanton,
fleshly,</hi> and <hi>foolish. Foolish Love,</hi> that will attempt to cast out this <hi>tormenting
Feare,</hi> not being able to preserve it selfe from folly, without its assistance.</p>
            <p>Sect: 15. is spent in an Answer endeavoured to an Objection, placed in the
beginning of it, in these words.</p>
            <p>If it be farther demanded, But doth it not argue servility in men, to be drawn
by the Iron cord of the Feare of Hell, to doe what is their duty to doe? Or doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59070:177"/>
other Service or Obedience become Sonnes and Children, but only that which is
free and proceedeth from Love?</p>
            <p>Hereunto you have a threefold Answer returned.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That God requires that it should be so;</hi> which is a downeright begging
of the Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, He puts a difference between</hi> the Obedience of Children to their
Parents, and of the Saints unto God; <hi>The discourse whereof discovering some
mysteries of the</hi> new Doctrine <hi>of Grace, much pressed and insisted on, take as
followes.</hi> There is a very different consideration of the Obedience of Children to
their Naturall Parents, &amp; of the obedience of the Children of God unto their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father; The Obedience of the former, is but by the Inspiration of Nature, and is
an act not so much raised by Deliberation, or flowing from the will, by an interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of judgment, and conscience to produce the Election, as arising from an innate
propension in men, accompanying the very constituting principles of their Nature
and being; Whereas the latter, the Obedience of the Children of God, is taught by
Precepts, and the Principle of it, I mean that Rationall frame of Heart, out of
which they subject themselves to God, is planted in the soules of men by the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reason, Judgement, and Conscience to consider those grounds, arguments,
and motives, by which their Heavenly Father judgeth it meet to work and fashion
them unto such a frame; So that though the obedience of Naturall Children to their
Naturall Parents, be the more genuine and commendable, when it flowes freely from
the pure instinct of Nature, and is not drawn from them by feare of punishment, yet
the Obedience of the Children of God is then most genuine and commendable, and
like unto it selfe, when it is produced, and raised in the soule, by a joynt influence
and contribution, not of one or of some, but of all those Arguments, Reasons, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
Inducements whatsoever, and how many soever they be, by which their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father useth to plant and work it in them; for in this case, and in this only,
it hath most of God, of the Spirit of God, of the Wisdome of God, of the Goodnesse
of God: in and upon this account it is likeliest to be most free, uniforme, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>
            <p>The summe of this Answer amounts to these three things.</p>
            <p>First that there is an <hi>Instinct</hi> or inspiration of Nature in Children to yeild
Obediedce to their Parents.</p>
            <p>Secondly that there is no such <hi>Spirituall Instinct</hi> or inclination in the Saints
to yeild Obedience to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Obedience of the Saints ariseth meerely and solley from
such Considerations of the Reason of that Obedience, which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in contradiction to any such genuine principles as might incline their
hearts thereunto.</p>
            <p>For the first, That the obedience of Children to their Parents, though it be
a prime dictate of the Law of Nature wherewith they are indued, proceedeth
from a <hi>pure Instinct,</hi> any otherwise than as a principle suiting &amp; inclining them
to the Acts of that Obedience, so as to exclude the promoting and carrying of
it on, upon the Morall condsideration of <hi>Duty, Piety &amp;c.</hi> it is in vaine for Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> to goabout to perswade us, unlesse he could not only <hi>corrode</hi> the
Word of God where it presseth that Obedience as a <hi>Duty,</hi> but also charme us
into beasts of the feild, which are acted by such a bruit instinct, not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
stirred up or drawne forth into exercise by Deliberation or Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
There is, it is true in Children an impresse of the power of the Law
of nature, suiting them to Obedience (which yet in many hath been quite
cast out and obliterated, being not of the constituting principles of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which whilst they haue their being as such, cannot be throwne out of
them) and carrying them out unto it with Delight, Ease, and Complacency,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59070:177"/>
(as habits do to suitable actings,) but withall that this principle is not
regulated and directed as our Obedience to God by a Rule, and stirred up to
exert it selfe, and they in whom it is, provoked by Rationall and Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
considerations, to the performance of their duty, in that Obedience, is so
contrary to the experience I suppose of all sharers with us in our Mortality,
that it will hardly be admitted into debate. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>worst</hi> part of this <hi>Story</hi> lyes in the middle of it, in the exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any such <hi>Spirituall principle</hi> in Believers, as should carry them out unto
Obedience, at least to any such as is not begotten in their minds by <hi>Rationall
considerations;</hi> What ever may be granted of <hi>acquired habites of Grace</hi> (which
that the first should be, that a Spirituall habit should be <hi>acquired</hi> by naturall
actings, is a most ridiculous fiction,) all <hi>infused</hi> Habits of Grace that should
imprint upon the soule a new naturall inclination to Obedience, that should
fashion and frame the hearts of men into a state and Condition suited for, and
carry them out, unto Spirituall Obedience, are here decryed; All it
seemes that the Scripture hath told us of our utter <hi>Insufficiency, Deadnesse,
Disability</hi> &amp; indisposednesse to any thing that is good, without a <hi>new Life</hi> and
principle, all that we have apprehended, and Believed concerning the <hi>new
Heart,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> given us, the <hi>new Nature, new Creature, divine Nature, inward
man, Grace in the Heart,</hi> making the Roote good that the Fruit may be so:
All that the Saints have expressed concerning their <hi>Delight</hi> in God, <hi>Love</hi> to
God upon the account of his writing his <hi>Laws in their hearts</hi> and Spirits, is a
meere delusion. There is no principle of any Heavenly, Spirituall Life, no
new Nature with its bent and instinct lying towards God and Obedience to
him, wrought in the Saints, or bestowed on them by the Holy Spirit of Grace;
If this be so we may even fairely shut our <hi>Bibles,</hi> and go learne this new Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of such as are able to instruct us therein; Wherefore I say</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that as in Children there is an <hi>instinct,</hi> an inclination of nature, to
induce them and carry them out to Obedience to their naturall Parents,
which yet is directed, regulated, provoked, and stirred up, and they thereby,
to that Obedince, by Motives and Considerations suited to worke upon their
Minds and Consciences, to prevailewith them thereunto, so also in Believers,
the Children of God who are <hi>begotten of the will of God,</hi> of the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi>
and <hi>borne againe not of the Will of the flesh but of the will of God,</hi> there is a new
<hi>Spirituall principle, a constituting principle</hi> of their <hi>Spirituall</hi> Lives wrought &amp;
implanted in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Spirit of God: a principle of Faith, Love, enabling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for, suiting them unto, &amp; inciting them to that Obedience which is acceptable
and well pleasing to their Father which is in Heaven: In which Obedience, as
they are regulated by the Word, so they are stirred up unto it by all those
<hi>motives,</hi> which the Lord in his infinite wisdome hath fitted to prevaile on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
indued with such a principle from himselfe, as they are; It is not incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on me to enter upon the proofe and demonstration of a <hi>Title</hi> to a Truth,
which the Saints of God have held so long in unquestionable possession, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all being brought to invalidate it, but only a bare insinuation that
it is not so. Then</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I deny not but that the Saints of God are stirred up to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by all the Considerations and inducements which God layes before
them, and proposeth to them, for that end &amp; purpose; And as he hath spread
a principle of obedience over their whole soules, all their Facultyes &amp; Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so he hath provided in his Word, <hi>motives</hi> &amp; <hi>inducements</hi> to the Obedience
he requires, which are suited unto, &amp; fit to worke upon <hi>all that is within them</hi>
(as the Prophet speakes) to live to him; Their Love, Feare, Hope, Desires are
all managed within, and provoked without to that end and purpose. But how
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59070:178"/>
it will thence follow, that it is the intendment of God by his Threatnings, to
ingenerate <hi>such a Feare of Hell</hi> in them, as is inconsistent with an Assurance of
his Faithfulnesse in his Promises <hi>not to leave them, but to preserve them to his
Heaveuly Kingdome,</hi> I professe I know not: The Obedience of the Saints, we
looke upon to proceed from a principle wrought in them with an higher
<hi>Energy</hi> and efficacy, than meere <hi>desires of God</hi> to implant it by Arguments and
Motives; that is by perswading them to it, without the least reall contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of strength or power, or the ingrafting the Word in them, in, with,
and by, a new principle of Life; And if this be the <hi>Phyllis</hi> of our Authors Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>Solus habeto.</hi> Such a working of Obedience, we cannot think to have
any thing of God, of the Spirit of God, of the Wisdome of God, or the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God in it, being exceedingly remote from the way and manner
of Gods working in the Saints, as held out in the Word of Truth, and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
to the end proposed, in that Condition wherein they are. The true use
of the <hi>Threatnings of wrath</hi> in reference to them who by Christ are delivered
from it, hath been before manifested and insisted on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the last division of this Section,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 64.</note> 
               <hi>he labours to prove that what is</hi> done
from a principle of Feare may be done willingly and chearefully, as well as that
which is done from a principle of Love. <hi>To which briefely I say</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Neither <hi>Feare</hi> nor <hi>Love</hi> as they are meere naturall Affections, are any
principle of Spirituall Obedience as such.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we are so farre from denying the usefulnesse of the <hi>Feare
of the Lord</hi> to the Obedience of the Saints; That the continuance thereof in
them to the end, is the great Promise for the certaine Accomplishment
whereof, we do contend.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Feare of Hell</hi> in Believers, as a part of the wrath of God,
from which they are delivered by Christ, being opposed to all their Grace of
Faith, Love, Hope, &amp;c. is no principle of Obedience in them, whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
it may have on them as to restraint when managed by the hand of
Gods Grace.</p>
            <p>Fourthly That yet Believers can never be delivered from it but by Faith in
the Bloud of Christ, attended with <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> walking with God;
which when they faile of, though that Feare supposed to be predominant in
the soule, be inconsistent with any <hi>comfortable chearing Assurance</hi> of the favour
of God, yet it is not with the <hi>certaine continuance</hi> to them of the thing it selfe,
upon the account of the Promises of God.</p>
            <p>Section the sixteenth containes a large Discourse in answer to the Apostle,<note place="margin">§. 65.</note>
affirming that <hi>Feare hath torment,</hi> which is denyed by our Author upon sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Considerations; The Feare he intends is a <hi>Feare of Hell,</hi> and wrath to
come; This he supposeth to be of such predominancy in the soule, as to be a
principle of Obedience unto God; That this can be without <hi>Torment,</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
Bondage and vexation he will not easily evince to the consciences of
them, who have at any time been exercised under such a frame; What Feare is
consistent with Hope, What incursions npon the soules of the Saints are made
by dread and bondage, and Feare of Hell, and the use of such feares, How
some are, though true Believers, scarcely delivered from such Feares, all their
dayes, I have formerly declared: and that may suffice as to all our concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the seventeenth Section, somwhat is attempted as to</hi> Promises,<note place="margin">§: 66.</note> 
               <hi>answerable
to what hath been done concerning</hi> Exhortations <hi>and Threatnings; the words
used to this end are many, the summe is,</hi> That the use of Promises in stirring
men up to Obedience, is solely in the proposall of a good thing, or good things to
them to whom the Promises are made which they may attaine, or come short off.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59070:178"/>
Now if men are assured as this Doctrine supposeth they may be, that they shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttaine
the end whether they use the meanes or no, how can they possibly be incited
by the Promises to the use of meanes proposed for the injoyment of the end promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
<hi>That this is the substance of his Discourse, I presume himselfe will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and it being the winding up of a tedious Argument, I shall briefely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
its usefullnesse, and lay it aside. I say then,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, what is the True use of the Promises of God, and what Influence
they have into the Obedience and Holinesse of the Saints, hath been formerly
declared. Neither is any thing there asserted of their genuine &amp; naturall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to the ends expressed, enervated in the least by any thing here insisted
on, or intimated by Mr <hi>Goodwin;</hi> so that without more trouble I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the <hi>Reader</hi> thither to evince the falsenesse of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Assertions,
concerning the uselessnesse of the <hi>Promises</hi> unto <hi>Perseverance,</hi> upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that there are Promises of Perseverance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though we affirme that all true Saints shall <hi>Persevere,</hi> yet we do
not say, that all that are so, do know themselves to be so; and towards them
at least the Promises may have their Efficacy in that way, which Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
hath by his Authority confined them to worke in.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we say that our Saviour was fully perswaded, that in the issue of
his undertakings and sufferings, he should be <hi>Glorified with his Father,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Promise:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> and yet upon the account of that Glory which he was so
assured of, being set before him, he addressed himselfe to the sharpest and
difficultest passage to it, that ever any one entred on; <hi>He indured the Crosse, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised
the shame, for the Gloryes sake,</hi> whereof he had assurance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 And
why may not this be the state of them to whom in his so doing he was a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Salvation?</hi> Why may not the Glory and Reward set before them,
though injoyed in a full Assurance of Faith, in the excellency of it when
possessed, as promised, stirre them up to the meanes leading thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>4.
The truth is, the more we are assured with the assurance of <hi>Faith,</hi> (not of
Presumption) that we shll certainly obtain &amp; enjoy the <hi>end</hi> whereunto the
meanes we use do lead (as is the Assurance that ariseth from the Promises of
God,) the more eminently are we pressed in a Gospell way, if we walke in
the Spirit of the Gospell, to give up our selves to Obedience to that God, and
Father, who hath appointed so pretious and lovely <hi>meanes,</hi> as are the pathes
of Grace, for the obtaining of so Glorious an end as that whereunto we are
appointed. And thus I doubt not but that it is manifest, by these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Mr <hi>Goodwins Objections</hi> to the contrary, that the Doctrine of
the Perseverance <hi>of the Saints,</hi> asby us taught and delivered, doth
not only fall in a sweet Compliance withall the meanes of Grace, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
those appointed by God to establish the Saints in Faith and Obedience,
that is, to Worke Perseverance in them, but also to be eminently usefull to
give Life, Vigour, Power and Efficacy in a peculiar Gospell manner, to all <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
Threatnings</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> appointed and applyed by God, to that
end and purpose.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S to the matter in hand,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> about the usefulnesse of the Doctrine
of the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> in, and unto the Ministry of
the Gospell, and the obstruction pretended to be laid unto it
thereby, It may be somewhat conducing and of Concernment
to consider who the <hi>Persons</hi> are, and were, and what hath been
and is the presence of God with them, in their Ministry who
have been Assertors and Zealous maintainers of this Doctrine: And withall

of the Word committed unto them, who have risen up in opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
How also those different Partyes have approved their <hi>Profession</hi> to the
World, and acquitted themselves in their Generation in their walking with
God, may be worth our Consideration; doubtlesse, if the Doctrine, whose <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
and defence we have thus far ingaged in, be of such a <hi>pernicious
tendency,</hi> as is pretended, so destructive to Gospell Obedience, and so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
rendering that great <hi>Ordinance of the Ministry uselesse,</hi> it may be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to its product of these effects, in some measure, in the Lives, Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Ministry of those, who have most zealously espoused it, most earnestly
contended for it, and been most given up to the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>mould</hi> thereof. It
were a thing every way miraculous if any <hi>Roote</hi> should for the most part
bring forth <hi>fruite</hi> disagreeing to the nature of it.</p>
            <p>A Taske this is,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> (I confesse) which were we not necessitated unto, I could
easily dispence with my selfe from ingaging therein. But (Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> having
voluntarily entred the list, as to this particular and instated a comparison,
between the Abbettors of the severall Doctrines under Contest, (Chap. 9. of
his Booke, (a matter we should not have expected, from any other man) it
could not, but be thought a grosse neglect, of duty, and high ingratitude, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those <hi>great &amp; Blessed Soules,</hi> who in former and latter dayes, with inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59070:179"/>
pains and eminent successe watred the <hi>Vineyard of the Lord,</hi> with the
<hi>dew</hi> of this Doctrine, to decline the Consideration of the comparison made,
and dressed up to our hand. Now because it is a peculiar taske allotted to
us, to manifest the imbracement of this Truth, by <hi>those</hi> who in the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> were of greatest note and Eminency for Piety, Judgement, and skill
in dividing the Word aright, with the Professed Opposition made unto it, by
such, as those with whom they Lived, and succeeding Ages, have branded for
men <hi>unsound in the Faith,</hi> and leaving the <hi>good old Paths,</hi> wherein the Saints
of old found peace to their Soules: As also to manifest the receiving &amp; propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of it, by all (not any one of name excepted) those <hi>Great</hi> &amp; <hi>Famous Persons</hi>
whom the Lord was pleased to imploy in the Reformation of his Church,
walking in this, as in sundry other particulars, closer up to the Truth of the
Gospell, than some of their Brethren, that at the same time fell off from that
Church, which was long before fallen off from the Truth, I shall in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
inquiry, confine my selfe to those of our owne Nation, who have been
of <hi>Renowne in their Generation</hi> for their Labour in the Lord, and of <hi>name</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Saints</hi> for their worke in the service of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>For the one <hi>halfe</hi> of that small space of time,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> which is passed since the
breaking forth of the light of the Gospell in this Nation, we are disenabled
from persuing the Comparison instituted: The one <hi>part</hi> being not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
or at least not being considerable; The time when first Head was
made against the Truth we professe, and <hi>Criminations</hi> like those managed by
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hatched and contrived to Assault it withall, was, when it had
been eminently delivered to the Saints of this Nation, and all the Churches
of Christ, by <hi>Reinolds, Whitakers, Greenham</hi> and others like to them, their
fellow labourers in the Lords Vineyard. The poore weake Wormes of this
present Generation, who imbrace the same Doctrine with these men of name,
are thought to be free (some of them at least) from being destroyed by the
<hi>poysonous</hi> and <hi>pernicious</hi> embracing of it, by their owne weakenesse and disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to discerne the naturall genuine Consequences and Tendency, in the
progresse of that, which in the Roote and Foundation they imbrace. Their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of their owne Doctrine in its compas, &amp; Extent, is the <hi>Mother</hi> of that
<hi>Devotion,</hi> which in them, is nourished thereby. So our <hi>great Masters</hi> tell us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whose <hi>Kingly Authority</hi> in these things there is no rising up. For the
Persons formerly named, the like reliefe cannot be supposed. He that shall
provide an <hi>Apology</hi> for them, Affirming that they understood not the state,
nature, consequences, and tendences of the Doctrines they received, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
preached contended for, will scarce be able by any following defensative,
to vindicate his owne credit, for so doing. In the <hi>lives</hi> then and the <hi>Ministry</hi>
of those men, and such as those, if any where are the fruits of this Doctrine
to be seene. If it corrupted not their <hi>lives,</hi> nor weakned their <hi>Ministry,</hi> if it
turned not them aside from the pathes of Gospell Obedience, nor weakened
their hands in the Dispensation of the Word, in the <hi>Promises, Threatnings</hi> and
<hi>Exhortations</hi> thereof, to the Conversion of soules, and building up of those
who by their <hi>Ministry</hi> were <hi>called, in their most holy Faith,</hi> it cannot but be a
strong presumption, that there is no such <hi>venomous infectious quality</hi> in this
Doctrine, as of late some <hi>Chimicall Divines</hi> pretend themselves to be able to
extract out of it: Now what I pray were these <hi>men?</hi> What were their <hi>Lives?</hi>
What was their Ministry? All those who now oppose Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
do it either out of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or to <hi>Comply</hi> with Greatnesse, and men in
Authority, thereby to make up themselves in their Ambitious and worldly
aymes, and to prevaile themselves upon the opinion of men: for what cause
else in the world can be imagined why they should so ingage? what though
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59070:180"/>
they really believed, the whole fabricke of his Doctrine wherein he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the Faith, he once (as they say) professed, to be a <hi>lye;</hi> A lye of
dangerous and pernitious Consequence to the soules of men, a lye derogatory
to the Glory of God, the efficacy of Grace, the <hi>merit</hi> of the Death of Christ,
and the honour of the Gospell, and full of disconsolation to poore soule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being in and under Temptation. What though they suppose it secretly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the maine <hi>fundamentals</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and covertly to
substitute another Covenant in the Roome thereof, what though they have
observed that the Doctrine they have received, was <hi>Imbraced,</hi> Preached, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
by all those great and blessed soules, which in the last Generation, God
magnified with the conversion of so many thousands in this Nation, given into
their Ministry whilst they spent their dayes under continuall Aflictions &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions?
what though they have the generall known consent of all the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches</hi> beyond the Seas with them, in their zeale for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> under
consideration? What though under these &amp; the like apprehensions, they profes
in the presence of God, his holy Angels and men, that the eternall Interest of
the precious soules of men, is more valuable to them ten thousand times than
their owne lives, and that that is the sole Reason of their opposition to M. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
in his attempts against the Doctrine they have so received and imbraced,
yet it is meet for us to Judge, and for all <hi>to whom evill surmises are not esteemed
to be among the workes of the flesh,</hi> that all their opposition, is nothing but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with, and pursuit of those worldly low and wretched aimes, that they
are filled withall. But as to those Persons before mentioned, what shall we
say? Their <hi>Piety, Literature, Zeale, Diligence, Industry, Labour</hi> with successe in
the worke of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> (and that under manifold discouragements) are
so renowned in the world, that how or wherewith they shall be shifted of,
from being considerable in their Testimony, I cannot imagine. If ever Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in these latter Ages had written upon their <hi>breasts, Holynesse to the Lord,</hi>
If ever any bare about, a <hi>conformity to the Death and resurrection of our Lord
Jesus Christ,</hi> they may put in for an eminent esteeme, and name among them;
&amp; will doubtlesse be found at last to be of the <hi>thirty,</hi> if they attaine not to the
<hi>first Ranke</hi> of the Worthyes of Christ in these ends of the world. How is it that
they were not retarded, in the course of their Gospell Obedience, by their
entertainement of this wretched Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance? But
what though they kept themselves Personally from the <hi>pollution</hi> of it yet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
their Ministry was defiled and rendered uselesse by it. And who I pray
is it that in this Generation can so support himselfe with successe in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi>
as to rise up with this accusation against them? Many thousands who
were their <hi>Crowne,</hi> their <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> in Christ, are fallen a sleepe,
and some Continue to this day. Of the Reasons given by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> why
all the <hi>Zealous, Fruitfull, Faithfull Preachers,</hi> of former dayes, imbraced this
Doctrine, we shall instantly undertake the Consideration. In the meane time
this seems strange, that God should magnify, and make famous the <hi>Ministry</hi>
of so many, throughout the world, and give in that visible blessing to their
Labours therein, which hath filled this Island with such an increase of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to <hi>Sion,</hi> as that she hath not <hi>lengthned the cords of her Tabernacle,</hi> to such
an extent and compasse, in any proportionable spot of earth under Heaven,
if any one eminent part of their Doctrine, and that whereon they lay'd great
weight in their Ministry, which they pressed with as much fervency and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of Spirit as any head of the like importance, should indeed be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
destructive of Holinesse, and of such a direct and irresistible efficiency
to render uselesse that great Ordinance of the Ministry committed to them,
as this is clamoured to be. What will be the successe of them, in their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:59070:180"/>
who shall undertake to deny and oppose it, I hope the People of God in
this Nation, will not have many Instances to Judge by: The best conjecture,
we can for the present make of what will be hereafter, must be taken from
what hath already come to passe; and the best guesse of what events will be,
are to be raised from the consideration of what hath been; from a like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Causes, to an Answerablenesse of Events.</p>
            <p>What Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to plead in this Case he insists on,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Chap. 9. Sect.</hi> 24,
25, 26, 27. <hi>Pag.</hi> 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172. The summe and aime of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
is to <hi>Apologize</hi> for his Doctrine against sundry Objections, which in
the Observations of men it is lyable and obnoxious unto. Now these are such
as whatever the Issue of their Consideration prove, doubtlesse it can be of
no Advantage unto his Cause, that his Doctrine is so readily exposed to
them.</p>
            <p>The first of these is,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> that the Doctrine he <hi>Opposeth,</hi> and in <hi>Opposition</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
that is set up, which he so industriously asserts, hath generally been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and imbraced, by men eminent in <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> famous on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in their Generations, with the generality of the People of God, with
them. And this is attended with that which naturally insues thereon, <hi>viz.</hi>
The <hi>Scandalousnesse</hi> of the most of them (yea of them all of this Nation is it
spoken, who have formerly asserted the Doctrine which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath
lately espoused; Whereunto in the third place an Observation is subjoyned,
of the <hi>Ordinary defection of men to loose and unsavory practises, after they have
once drunke in the principles of that opinion, which he now so industriously mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and tempereth for them;</hi> It is usually said there is no <hi>smoake,</hi> but where there
is some <hi>fire;</hi> It would be strange if such Observations as these, should be readily
and generally made by men, concerning the Doctrine under Contest, unlesse
there were some evident occasion Administred by it thereuto. And I must
needs say, that if they prove True, and hold under Examination, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as urging a <hi>prejudice,</hi> as can lightly be laid against any cause in Religion
whatsoever. The Gospell being <hi>a Doctrine according unto Godlinesse,</hi> severall
perswasions pretending to be parts and portions thereof, if one shall be found
to be the constant Faith, and profession of those, who also have the life and
power of Godlinesse in them; the other to be maintained by <hi>evill men aud se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi>
who upon their receiving it, doe also <hi>wax worse and worse;</hi> it is no
small advantage to the first, in its plea for admittance to the right and title of
a truth of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>To Evade this charge Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> premises this in Generall.<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The experience Asserted in the Objection, is not so unquestionable in point of
Truth, But that if the Asserters were put home upon the proofe, they would (I seare)
(<hi>doubtlesse he rather hopes it</hi>) accompt, more in presumption than in reasonablenes
of Argument: For if Persons of the one judgement, &amp; of the other, were duly compared
together, I verily believe there would be found every whit, as full a proportion of
men, truly Conscientious and Religious, amongst those whose judgements stand,
and have stood for a possibility of falling away, As on the other side: but through a
foolish and unsavoury kind of partiality, we are apt, on all hands, according to the
Proverb, to account our own Geese for Swannes, and other mens Swannes Geese;
Certaine I am, that if the writings of men of the one judgement, and of the other,
be compared together, and an estimate made from thence of the Religion, Worth,
and Holinesse of the Authors respectively, Those who oppose the common Doctrine of
Perseverance, doe account it no Robbery to make themselves every way equall in this
honour with their opposers; The truth is, If it be lawfull for me to utter what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
apprehend, and judge in the case, I doe not find that spirit of holinesse, to
breath with that Authority, height or Excellency of power, in the writings of the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59070:181"/>
latter, which I am very sensible of in the writings of the former; These call for
Righteousnesse, Holinesse, and all manner of Christian conversation, with every
whit as high a hand as the other, and adde nothing to check, obstruct, or infeeble
the Authority of their demands in this kind; when as the other, though they be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
many times in their exhortations, and conjurements unto holinesse; yet other
while render both these and themselves in them, contemptible, by avouching such
principles, which cut the very sinews, and strength of such their exhortations, and
fully ballance all the weight of those motives, by which they seek to bind them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Consciences of men. And for men truly holy and Conscientious, doubtlesse
the Primitive Christians for three hundred years together and upwards, next after
the times of the Apostles, will fully ballance with an abundant surplusage, both for
numbers, and truth of Godlinesse, All those in the Reformed Churches; who since
<hi>Calvins</hi> daies, have adhered to the common Doctrine of Perseverance: And that
the Churches of Christ more generally during the said space of three hundred years
and more, held a possibility of a totall and finall defection, even in true and soun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To let passe M. <hi>Goodwins Proverb,</hi> with its Applycation, (it being very
<hi>facile</hi> to returne it to its Author, there being nothing in the World by him
proposed, to induce us to such an estimation of his associates, in the work of
teaching the Doctrine of the Saints Apostasy, and their labours therein, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other undertaking of theirs, as he labours to beget, in guilding over their
Worth and Writings, but only his own judgment, &amp; an overweening <hi>of their
Geese for Swans,</hi>) Let us see what is offered by him to evince the <hi>Experience</hi>
Asserted, not to be so unquestionable as is pretended. He offers First, his
own Affirmation, <hi>That if an estimate may be made of mens Worth and Holinesse
by their writings, Those who oppose the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance, will
be found in the promotion of Holinesse, and the practice of it, to out goe their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</hi>
Their writings, he tells us, breath forth a spirit of holinesse, such as he
cannot find in the writings of others; But first, for this you have only M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins
naked single Testimony:</hi> And that, opposed to the common experience of
the people of God; What weight this is like to beare with men, the event will
shew. It is a hard thing for <hi>one man</hi> upon his <hi>bare word,</hi> to undertake to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
a multitude, that what their eyes see, and their eares heare, is not so;
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had need have <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Disciples for the imbracing of these
dictates of his; The experience of Thousands, is placed to confirme the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
insisted on: saith M. <hi>Goodwin, It is not so, they are in my judgement all
deceived.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§: 7.</note> who are they in whose writings Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath found <hi>such a
Spirit of Holinesse,</hi> breathing with Authority, as is not to be found out, nor
perceived in the writings of them, that assert the Doctrine of the Perseverance
of the Saints. <hi>Calvin, Zanchius, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> (and to confine our selves home)
<hi>Reynolds, Whitaker, Perkins, Greenham, Dodde, Preston, Boulton, Sibbs, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Collverwell, Cotton, &amp;c.</hi> (whose fame upon this very account, of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and effectuall breathing of a Spirit of Holynesse in their writings, is gone
out into all the Nations about us, and their Remembrance is blessed at home
and abroade,) are some of the men who have as hath been shewed, laboured
in <hi>watering the Vineyard of the Lord,</hi> with the <hi>dew</hi> and raine of this Doctrine:
Who, or where are they who have excelled them in this undertaking? Let
the <hi>men</hi> be named, and the <hi>writings</hi> produced that Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> may have
some joyned with him, in a search after, and Judgement of that Spirit that
breathes so excellently in them, that we be not forced to take his Testimony
of we know not what, nor whom; Those amongst our selves of cheifest name,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59070:181"/>
who have appeared in the Cause that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath now undertaken, are
<hi>Tompson, Mountagu &amp;c.</hi> with an obscure <hi>Rabble</hi> of that Generation. I shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
allow Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to be a man more <hi>sharpe sighted</hi> than the most of those
with whom he hath to do, in this present contest; as also to have his sences
more exercised, in the Writings of those eminent <hi>Persons</hi> last named; But yet
that he is sensible of such a Spirit of Holines, breathing in their writings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
for the most part are stuffed with <hi>cruell scoffings</hi> at the Professours of it, and
horrible contempt of all close walking with God) I cannot easily &amp; readily
believe; should he adde to them <hi>Arminius,</hi> with all that followed him, in the
Low Countryes, their most Learned <hi>Corvinus, Drunke and Sober;</hi> As also such
among the <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as are his Companions in this worke, and
swell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all with the Rethorick of his commendations <hi>untill they breake,</hi> I dare
say he will never be able before indifferent Judges, to make out his Assertion
of the excellency of their writings, for the futherance of Holinesse, compared
with the Labours of those great and holy Soules, who have both among our
selves, and abroad; Laboured in the worke I am at present ingaged in. The
World of men professing the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> have long since in their
Judgments determined this difference, nor doth it deserve any farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That those who maintaine the Perseverance of the Saints, are sore
indeed in their Exhortations to Holinesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 8.</note> 
               <hi>but contemptible in their Principles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they should build those Exhortations,</hi> Is an insinuation that Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
sometimes makes use of, handsomely to <hi>beg the thing in Question,</hi> when he
despaires to carry it by any convincing Argument in a faire dispute: That the
Principles of this Doctrine are eminently serviceable, to the furtherance and
promotion of <hi>Holinesse,</hi> hath been formerly evinced beyond all possibility of
Contradiction from them, who in any measure understand what <hi>true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
is, and wherein it doth consist. Neither ought Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> if he would
be esteemed as a man <hi>disputing</hi> for his perswasion, so often to <hi>begge</hi> the thing
in Question; knowing fullwell, that he hath not so deserved of them with
whom he hath to do, as to obtaine any thing of this nature, on those tearmes
at their hands.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> what was the judgement of the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> as in others,
so in and about this head of Christian Religion, is best known from that rule
of Doctrine, which it is confessed they attended unto, being delivered unto
them; and in the defence whereof, and to give Testimony whereto, so many
Thousands of them, <hi>loved not their lives unto death.</hi> Of those that committed
over to posterity, any thing of their thoughts, in that space of time limited by
M. <hi>Goodwin, (viz.</hi> three hundred years,) he names but two; of whom I shall
not say, that if they failed in their Apprehensions of the Truth in this matter,
It is not the only thing wherein they so failed; And yet that it can be evident
in the least, that they were consenting in judgement with M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
wherewith from us he differs, is absolutely denied. This elsewhere is already
farther considered. It is a common observation, and not destitute of a great
evidence of Truth, that the Liberty of Expression which is used by men in the
delivery of any Doctrine, especially if it be done <hi>obiter</hi> by the way, before
some opposition hath been framed, and stated thereunto, hath given advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to those following of them, (when death hath prevented all possibility
for them to explaine themselves, and their own thoughts) to draw them into
a participation with them, in that, which their Soules abhorred. The plea of
<hi>Arius</hi> and his Associats, concerning the judgement of the Doctors of the
Church, in the daies before him, about the great Article of our Faith, <hi>The
Diety of Christ,</hi> is known. That there are in many of the Ancients, sundry
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59070:182"/>
expressions seemingly varying from that Doctrine we Assert, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their different apprehensions of the tearmes, of <hi>Faith, being Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
Holinesse,</hi> and the like, (which are all of them still with us, as in the
Scripture, of various significations, and not clearely expressive of any one
sence intended by them, untill distinguished) is not denyed. Speaking of all
those who had been <hi>Baptized,</hi> and made profession of their Faith as <hi>Believers,</hi>
it is no wonder if they granted that some Believers might fall away. But yet
in the meane time the most eminent of them, constantly affirmed that there is
a sort of Believers, who upon the matter with them, were the only true and
Reall Believers (being such as we formerly described) that could not fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>totally</hi> or finally; but as for this I hope full satisfaction is tendered, the
Learned Reader in the Preface of this Discourse. So that these Exceptions
notwithstanding, the prejudices that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Doctrine labours under,
from the opposition made to it, and against it, in the defenee of that which
it riseth up to overthrow, by that Generation of the Saints of God, lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the shoulders thereof, as a burthen to heavy for it to beare.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> farther proceeds, Sect. 27 to informe us of some
other mistakes in the instance given, to make good the former observation,
For as for <hi>Calvin, Musculus, Martyr, Bucer,</hi> with the Ministers of this Nation
who in the last Generation so Zealously opposed, the persecutions and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of some returning with speed and violence to <hi>Rome,</hi> He tells us
<hi>they were very farre from having their Judgments settled, as to the Doctrine
under contest so as resolvedly to have imbraced the one, and rejected the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should willingly walke in the heigh way for the manifestation and cleare
eviction of the untruth of this suggestion: <hi>viz.</hi> by producing their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
in abundant plentifull manner to, confirme their clearenesse and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Truth we professe, with their Zealous indeavours for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
confirmation and propagation of it, but that some few Considerations,
delivered me from ingaging in so <hi>facile</hi> a taske. For</p>
            <p>First I am not able to perswade my selfe, that any man who ever read the
writings of the first sort of men mentioned, and knowes the constant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to this day, of the Churches which they <hi>planted and watered,</hi> or
ever did <hi>heare</hi> of the latter, will entertaine this Assertion of Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
with any thing but Admiration, upon what grounds he should make
it. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, Himselfe discovering in part on what account he doth it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because of their Exhortations to <hi>watchfulnesse, carefulnesse,</hi> and close wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with God, with their denuntiations of threatnings to them, that abide
not in the Faith, which he fancyes to be inconsistent with the Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance,
so as by him opposed (which inconsistency we have long since fully
manifested, to be the issue &amp; offspring of his owne imagination, begotten of it
by the cunning <hi>Sophystry</hi> of his <hi>Pelagian</hi> Friends) I know not why I should far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
insist upon the wiping away of this Reproach, cast upon those Blessed
Soules whom God so magnified in the worke of the Gospell of his Sonne in
their Generation; I remember <hi>Navaret</hi> a Dominican Fryer, upon his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the subtiltyes of the Jesuits, to wrest many sayings of the Ancients
in favour of their Opinions, in those Doctrines wherein those two Orders are at
variance, Affirmes <hi>That he was afraid that when he was dead, although he had
written &amp; disputed so much against them, they would produce him for a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Witnesse on their side.</hi> What he feared concerning himselfe, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
hath attempted, concerning many more worthy Persons: cutting off sentences
from what goes before, and followes after, restrayning generall expressions,
imposing his owne <hi>Hypothesis</hi> on his Reader, in making application of what he
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59070:182"/>
quotes out of any Author, he hath spent one whole Chapter to perswade the
world, that men of as great Abilityes &amp; Judgments, as any in the world, since
the Apostles fell a sleepe, have usually exprest themselves, in a direct contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to what they are eminently and notoriously knowne, as their professed
deliberate Judgments, to have maintained.</p>
            <p>Secondly He farther informes us,<note place="margin">§: 11.</note> how this Doctrine of the Perseverance of
the Saints, came to be so generally entertained by the Godly, Zealous &amp; Able
Ministers of this Nation, that when we see how they fell into it, their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
given thereto, may be of the lesse validity withus.</p>
            <p>This (<hi>he telleth you</hi>) was the Permission of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Judgment, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruled
by the Texts of Scripture commonly insisted on for the proofe of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the great worth of the Person commended therefore the worth of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; he verily believeth, as men were then induced to receive this Opinion, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
a relinquishment of it, they went nothing but the countenance and Authorty of so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Person of popular acceptance to go before them; And the Reason he giveth of this
his Faith is, the Observation of the Principles they usually hold forth, especially in
the Applicatory part of their Sermons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What,<note place="margin">§: 12.</note> and who they were, who are thus represented by Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
in their receiving and imbracing of that Doctrine, which with the great
travell of their Soules all their dayes they Preached and pressed to, and upon
others, is knowne to all. The <hi>Persons</hi> I named before, (one of them only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
with all those eminent, burning, and shining Lights, which for so many
yeares have laboured with Renowne and successe, to the astonishment of the
world in the Preaching of the Gospell in this Nation, are the men intended.
Doubtlesse such thoughts have not in former dayes been entertained of them,
however the contemplation of any mans owne ability may now raise him to
contempt of them. M. <hi>Perkins</hi> received this Doctrine, and therefore all the
Godly Ministers of this Nation did so to. If any one of the like esteeme with
him did fall off from it; (Now whom they should obtaine to lead them, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
reputation and acceptance with him who hath in vaine attempted it,
I know not,) they would quickly follow, (not like Shepheards but Sheep) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an opposition thereunto. Those who have not very slight thoughts of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which doubtlesse they that are fallen a sleep did not deserve, will scarcely
suppose that they entertained a Truth of so great importance as this upon so
easie tearmes as these insinuated; or that they would have parted with it, at
so cheape a rate.</p>
            <p>Farther,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> why the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> should be thought to entertaine this
Doctrine meerely upon the Authority and countenance of Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> given
thereunto, when the <hi>universality</hi> of the Teachers of all other <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
of the same confession in other things with them, did also embrace the
same Doctrine, and do continue in profession of it to this day, what reason
can be assigned? Had there been a particular inducement to the Ministers
of <hi>England</hi> for the receiving of it, which was altogether forraigne unto them,
who as to our Nation are forraigners, whence is it that there should be such a
a coincidence of their Judgments with them therein? Or why may not ours
be thought to take it upon the same account with them, upon whose Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; understandings the Authority of Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> cannot be supposed to
have any influence? Is M. <hi>G.</hi> the only Person, who, in this Nation hath impartially
weighed all things of concernement, to the refusing or imbracing any matters
or Doctrines in Religion? Have no other in the sincerity of their hearts <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earched
the Scriptures,</hi> &amp; earnestly begged the guidance of the Spirit, according to that
incouraging Promise left by their Master, <hi>that they should receive him</hi> so doing?
The good Lord take away from us all high thoughts of our selves, and all
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59070:183"/>
contempt of them that professe the Feare of the Lord, with whom we have to
do. For the Reason of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Faith in this thing, concerning the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
of the Godly Ministers of this Nation, to <hi>Apostatize</hi> from the <hi>Doctrine
of the Saints Perseverance,</hi> namely, their manifesting themselves to be possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of many Principles of a contrary tendency unto it, in the applicatory parts
of their Sermons; the vanity of it hath been long since discovered; so that
there is no farther need to lay open the unreasonablenesse thereof.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> mistrusting his ability to perswade men,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> that the Persons of
whom he hath discoursed were not cleare in their Judgments, as to an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to that Doctrine which he positively owneth, and zealously contendeth
for, and knowing that it cannot be denyed but that they were men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
for Godlinesse, and close walking in Communion with God all their
dayes: Yet he excepteth as his last refuge, <hi>That it cannot be manifested,
that this Opinion had the least influence in their pious conversation, which is wholly
to be ascribed to other commendable Principles that they embraced.</hi> This indeed
may be said of any part of the Doctrine whatsoever that they received, &amp; some
of them suffered for. Atheists may say it, of the whole profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
&amp; ascribe the goodnes of the lives of the best of them that professe it, to
some other principles common to them with the residue of mankind, &amp; not at
all to any of those whereby they are distingunished, as such. This they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to have a powerfull Efficacy to prevaile with them for that exactnesse
in walking with God, which by his Grace they attained unto. And why they
should not be believed herein, as farre a sany men whatever, bearing the like
Testimony to any Doctrine whatever, I know not. Besides the intendment of
this instance of the Persons and their <hi>Piety</hi> who formerly Believed, and spake
forth this Doctrine, was, to manifest by an eminent experiment, that there <hi>was</hi>
not in it, nor <hi>is,</hi> any tendency to a contrary frame unto Piety &amp; Holines, which
it is injuriously charged withall; &amp; if by the consideration thereof, we do not
obtaine that it hath a proper and direct serviceablenesse to the promotion of
Godlinesse, yet at least we have a convincing demonstration that it is no way
obstructive to it.</p>
            <p>Nextly,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> Sect. 26. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> entreth upon his defensative to the charge
against his Doctrine, whose Foundation is laid in the unworthinesse of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
in this Nation before it fell upon his hand. These he confesseth to be <hi>the
worst of our late Bishops, with such as Romanized, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yrannized among them, with
their Clergie creatures &amp; favorites, Persons many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of superstition, loosenes &amp;
much profanenes.</hi> Of the <hi>Apologie</hi> shaped for the clearing of the Doctrine he
maintaineth from aparticipation with them in their unworthinesse, there are
three parts. In the 1. whereof, he denieth, <hi>that this Doctrine did any way induce
them to the loosenesse that was found upon them:</hi> In the other two, <hi>giveth as many
Reasons</hi> of their receiving of it, and cleaving to it.</p>
            <p>As for the first part, I shall willingly assent to him that the Holinesse or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holinesse
of Professors: is not to be charged on the Religion they professe
(I meane appearing Holinesse in the profession of it,) unlesse there be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a connexion betwixt their principles &amp; practises; which in this case, to
us &amp; our apprehension of them who charge this Doctrine with the miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of those men, there is; At least we may insist on this, that there is a suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of the Doctrine, whereof the <hi>Apostacy of the Saints</hi>
is an eminent parcell, to that frame of Spirit which is in men of loose and
superstitious wayes, enemies of the Grace of God and power of Godlinesse.
Neither can there any other reason be tollerably assigned or alledged, for the
embracement of that Doctrine, by those Persons formerly mentioned, but only
their ignorance of, &amp; envy to the great Misteryes of the Gospell, the Covenant
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59070:183"/>
of Grace with union, communion and close walking with God. A designe
was upon them written with the beames of the Sunne, to cry up a barren,
outside, light and loose profession, with a vaine, superstitious, <hi>selfe-invented</hi>
Worship of God, instead of the Power of a Gospell-conversation and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Christ according to his appointment; Seeking after a Righeousnesse
<hi>as it were by the workes of the Law,</hi> and being ignorant of the Righteousnesse
of Christ, they found the whole Doctrine whose defence M. <hi>G.</hi> hath lately
undertaken, suited to their principles and aimes; and therefore with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
drunke it downe like water, untill they were swelled with the <hi>Dropsy</hi>
of Pride and selfe conceit, beyond what they could beare, whatever be now
pretended, it was little disputed then, and in those dayes which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>
pointeth unto, but that loosenesse of Life, inclination to Popery, enmity to
the power of Godlinesse, were at the bottome of the entertainement of the
<hi>Arminian</hi> Principles, by that generation of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Mr</hi> G. <hi>proceedeth to alleviate this charge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; informes us thus,</hi> That if
the soundnes &amp; rottennes of Opinions, should be esteemed by the goodnes or badnes
of the Lives of any parcell or number of Persons professing the same, as well the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Atheisme which denyeth the being of any God, as the opinion of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme
which affirmeth a plurality of Gods, must be esteemed better and more
sound, than that which maintaineth the being of one God and of one only; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is that there have been many Heathens Professours some of the one, &amp; some
of the other of those Opinions, who have quitted themselves upon fairer tearmes of
honour and approbation in their lives than many Christians professing of the last
opinion have done.</p>
            <p>I am not willing to <hi>wring this</hi> Nose too farre least bloud should follow; The
lives of many <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> are preferred before the lives of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Christianity. By <hi>Professors of Christianity,</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> intendeth those
who are so <hi>indeed,</hi> and seasoned with the Power of the Principles of that
Religion, or such only as making an outward profession of it are indeed acted
with Principles quite of another nature, which notwithstanding all their
Profession rendreth them in the truth of the thing it selfe, <hi>enemies of the crosse
of Christ, their God being their belly, their glory being in their shame, and their
end being destruction, Philip.</hi> 3. 18, 19. If the former be intended, as the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is most false, the Gospell only effectually <hi>teaching men to deny all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and to live soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present world,</hi> so it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
directly to the highest derogation from the honour of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and of his glorious Gospell. He that would be throughly acquainted
with the notorious untruth of this insinuation, let him a little consult <hi>Tertullian,
Arnobius, Lactantius, Austin,</hi> &amp; others, handling the Lives &amp; Conversations of
the best of the <hi>Polytheists</hi> and Heathens, before &amp; in their dayes, if he be not
contented to take a shorter course, and rest in the Authority of the Apostle,
or rather of the Holy Ghost describing them and their conversations to the
Life, as they lay under the just hardening Judgements of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.
to the end. If the latter sort of men called <hi>Christians</hi> be intended, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
instituted between them and Atheists, is to no purpose; they themselves
being disclaimed and disowned by Christ &amp; his Gospell, and reckoned among
them with whom they are compared; So that upon the matter this is but the
comparing one sort of Atheists, with an other, and giving in a Judgement,
that of all, those are worst, whose <hi>practises</hi> are so, and yet pacifie their owne
Consciences, and deceive the world, with a pretence &amp; flowrish of a glorious
profession.</p>
            <p>I shall not now enter upon any long enquiry what influence the ungodly
and profane lives of any ought to have upon the Judgements of men, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59070:184"/>
and discerning of the Doctrines that they bring, especially if such as
consent in any Doctrine, do also concurre in a dissolutenesse of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That it will be of no small consideration, the experience of all Ages hath
evinced. The <hi>Athenians</hi> refused a <hi>virtuous</hi> Law, because the Person was <hi>vicious</hi>
who proposed it; and it is generally esteemed that there is a correspondency
betwixt the principles &amp; practices of those men, who earnestly profes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of those principles, so that they are mutuall producers or advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
one of another. This is all at present that was aimed at in the charge
upon Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Doctrine, which he undertakes to wave. It was generally
embraced at its first broaching in our world, by men only of a loose &amp; scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Conversation, supersticious in their wayes of worship, and enimies of
the power of Godlinesse: which being confessed, for the Argument from
thence, <hi>valeat quantum valere potest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But M.</hi> Goodwin <hi>giveth us two Reasons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> 
               <hi>why this Doctrine of his was so
gladly received, and zealously asserted by that Generation of men. The first
which he telleth you is plaine and easy to be given in, is this.</hi> Being professed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the most Religious and Zealous Preachers and Ministers of the I and,
with their adherents, whom they termed Puritans, whom they both hated and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as a generation of men, by whom rather than any other they apprehended
themselves in danger of being dethroned, Nec eos fefellit Opinio. Vpon this ground
they judged it a very materiall point of their interest to oppose and keepe vnder
this faction, as they termed them; In order thereunto they studied and cast about
how to weaken their intrest, and repute, with the generality of the people, or at
least with all those that were intelligent and in that respect considerable; to this end
wisely considering that nothing was like to prejudice them more in their esteeme
with most men, than to detect them of errour and unsoundnesse in their Doctrine,
and perceiving withall (as with halfe an eye they might, being so fully disengaged
as they were from all high thoughts of those that held them) that they were not in
any Doctrine besides, which they were generally knowne to hold and teach, more
obnoxious to such a detection, than in those which they held &amp; taught in opposition
to the Remonstrants, hereupon they politickly fell to professe and teach Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strantisme,
that so they might have the more frequent occasion and opportunity to
lay open the Puritan Doctrine, before the people, and to shew the inconsistency of it
with the Scriptures, as also with many of the most manifest principles as well of

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That this is a most vaine and groundlesse conjecture,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> I presume
any one that will but cast back his thoughts upon the posture of Affaires du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the reigne of that Generation of men, and a little consider the wayes and
meanes whereby they were through the righteous Hand of God, reduced to
that condition and state wherein they now are, will quickly determine. The
truth is, they were so far from advantaging themselves against their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes,
and prevailing upon them, in the esteeme of the most <hi>rationall and
knowing men in the Nation,</hi> by their entertaining the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, that
utterly on the other side they dishonoured their cause of <hi>Ceremonys,</hi> discipline,
&amp; conformity, which with succes they had so long carryed on with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Nation, &amp; exposed themselves to the power of the people of the
<hi>Land</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence as to all other differences they were sheltered
by an appearance of <hi>Legall Constitutions;</hi> so that after some forward Person of
that faction, (the most contemptible indeed as to any reall worth, one or two
<hi>individualls</hi> only excepted, of the whole tribe) had upon the grounds fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
taken up &amp; made profession of the Opinions and Doctrine we are
speaking of, they fell daily before their Adversaries, as to the esteeme of all, or
at least the greatest part of those who cordially &amp; throughly adhered to them
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59070:184"/>
as to the <hi>discipline,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> then established. Certainely the Prelaticall
party themselves, will not say, they prevailed on that hand, as to any ends
and purposes for the establishment of their interest, or making good
their ground against their opposers. Nay the most sober and
Learned of that sort of men, do to this day ascribe in no small measure the
downefall of the whole fabricke whereof they were parts and members
to the precipitating rashnesse, and folly of some few, in advancing and press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Arminian errours</hi> that they themselves were given up unto. As for the
zealous and Godly Ministers of the Nation, usually termed <hi>Puritans,</hi> (who
are here acknowledged by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to have all generally opposed the
Doctrine he striveth to build up,) though they had in many <hi>Parliaments</hi>
wherein the most intelligent and rationall men of the Nation are usually
<hi>convened,</hi> made by their friends sundry attempts for their reliefe against the
Persecutions of the other as is evidenced by their <hi>Peritians,</hi> and <hi>Addresses</hi> still
on Record, yet were never able to attaine the least redresse of their <hi>grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
nor to get one step of ground against their Adversaries, untill the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their <hi>Arminianisme</hi> was administred unto them, on which by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
degrees they prevailed themselves in the issue to the utter breaking of the
Yoke of their Taske-masters. It is true, He who <hi>takes the crafty in their owne
imaginations, and mixeth the councell of the Wise with madnesse and folly, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to erre in their wayes as a drunken man in his vomit,</hi> doth oftentimes
turne the devices of men upon their owne heads, and make those things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to their ruine, which they fixed upon as the most expedient <hi>mediums</hi>
for their establishment and continuance, such perhaps was the case with them
in their <hi>Canonicall Oath</hi> attempted to be imposed, in one of their last <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
But that the taking up, and asserting of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine was a
designe of that party of men, to get upon the Judgements &amp; Affections of the
people, and to expose the <hi>Puritanicall</hi> Preachers to their contempt and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
is an imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cannot likely fall upon any one, who had his eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the dayes wherein those things were publikely <hi>acted</hi> on the <hi>stage</hi> of this
Nation. For that insinuation in the close of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Discourse, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Advantages given that sort of men, by the inconsistency of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Puritans</hi> (which they opposed) with the Principles of <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Reason,</hi> I shall only say that it being once more through the Providence
of God, called forth to a publicke debate, it neither <hi>standeth,</hi> nor <hi>falleth</hi>
to the Judgement of any single man, muchlesse of one who is professedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in an opposition thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Reason of the same evidence with the former,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> 
               <hi>is tendred in these
words,</hi> It is generally known that the Cathedrall generation of men throughout
Christendome, were generally great admirers of the old Learning (as some call it)
I meane the Writing, and Tenents of the Fathers, and of <hi>Austine</hi> more especially,
and that they frequently made Shield and Buckler of their Authority to defend
themselves, against the Pens and Opinions of later Writers, whom their manner
was according to the exigency of their interest (at least as they conceived) to slight
and vilify in comparison of the other. Now the judgments of the Fathers more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
and of Austine more particularly, stood for the possibility of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
both totall and finall, wherein it seemeth the greater part of our Moderne
Reformed Divines have departed from them.</p>
            <p>That this pretence is no whit better than that that went before, will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
by the light of this one consideration. <hi>viz.</hi> That those among the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
and their adherents, who were indeed most zealous of, and best versed
in the Writings of the Fathers, were generally of the same judgement about
the <hi>Grace of Christ, and the Will of Man,</hi> &amp;c. with the residue of the reformed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59070:185"/>
Churches, and the Puritan Preachers of our own Nation. They were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Sciolists</hi> in comparison, and men of Nothing, who <hi>Arminianized:</hi>
Men, as the <hi>Bishop of Lincolne</hi> once told them, whose <hi>Learning lay in a few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Liturgies:</hi> It is true; they had gotten to such a Head, and to such a
<hi>Height,</hi> not long before their fall, that they were ready to accuse, and charge
their Associates as to <hi>Discipline, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> of <hi>Puritanisme,</hi> who
failed not to retort <hi>Arminianisme</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> back againe to them. We know
who said of the other, that they were <hi>Tantum non in Episcopatu Furitani;</hi> and
who returned to him and his Associates, <hi>Tantum non in Vxoratu Pontificii.</hi> The
truth is, those among them, as there were many among them, both <hi>Bishops,</hi>
and men, (as they speak and think) of Inferior Orders, who were solidly
Learned, especially in the writings of the Ancients (of whom many are yet
alive, and some are fallen a sleepe) were universally, almost to a man of the
same judgement with <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the heads of our Religion under considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Jewell, Abbot, Morton, Vsher, Hall, Davenant,</hi> and <hi>Prideaux,</hi> (great
names among the World of Learned men) with a considerable retinue of men
of repute for Literature and Devotion, (with whom on no account whatever
the <hi>Arminianizing</hi> party of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and their followers, are to be named
the same day) have sufficiently testified their thoughts in this matter to all the
World. From what Ambiguity of expression it is, that any sentence is stolne
from <hi>Austine,</hi> and others of the Ancients, seeming to countenance the Doctrine
of the Saints <hi>Apostacy,</hi> hath been elsewhere discovered, and may farther be
manifested as occasion shall be administred; And without pretence, to any
great skill in the old Learning, this I dare assert, (whereof I have given some
account in the Preface to the Reader) that not one of the Ancients (much
lesse <hi>Austin</hi>) did ever maintaine such an <hi>Apostacy</hi> of Saints, and such a Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
as that which M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> contendeth for.</p>
            <p>This being that which M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to offer for the clearing of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
he maintaineth,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> from the two first parts of the charge exhibited against
it, he applieth himselfe in the last place, to contend with a common Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
made by Christians, weighing and pondering the principles and wayes
of men in the daies wherein we live; Namely, the <hi>degeneracy of the most of
men, who at any time embrace it from their former Profession, and their turning
aside to the paths of loosenesse and folly.</hi> An observation which if true, (though
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is pleased to assert that any considering man (like himselfe) will
laugh it to scorne,) will not easily be digested in the thoughts of them, that are
willing to weigh aright the usuall presence of God with his Truths, especially
at the first embracement and entertainement of them. Neither will this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
be diverted from pursuing the Doctrine against which it is lifted
up, by comparing it with that of the <hi>Vnhappinesse of Marriages made between
Cousen-Germans,</hi> there being nothing in that Relation, that should be a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
cause, to any such issue as is pretended; much lesse with that farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
That some <hi>Apostatise from the Protestant Religion, yea from Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it selfe;</hi> there being not the least <hi>Parity,</hi> or indeed <hi>Analogy</hi> in the instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
If it might be affirmed of men, that after their embracing of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or the Protestant Religion, they generally decline, and grow worse, (as to
their Morall Conversation,) then they were before, I doe not know at present
what <hi>Apology</hi> could be readily fixed on, that might free the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from grievous Scandall. To fall from a Profession of any Religion, or
any head or part of a Religion, upon the account of the corruption that is in
them, that so fall from it, is rather an honour, then a reproach to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
so deserted. But in, and upon the embracement of any Religion, or any
Doctrine in Religion, for men to decline from that, which is the proper end
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59070:185"/>
of all true Religion (which is the observation that riseth up against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> asserteth in reference to very many that embrace it) doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
is not the Crowne and Glory of that which they professe. Neither is this
observation built on so slight experience, as to be muzled with <hi>Proverbs of
Swallowes and Woodcocks.</hi> The streets of our Cities, and paths of our Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
being full of those fowles, or rather <hi>fowle spirits,</hi> that give strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>This is the whole of what M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thought good to tender for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of his Doctrine,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> from the charge laid downe at the entrance of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;
on the consideration whereof, I doubt not but it is evident how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
he is to shield it from the wound intended unto it thereby. And shall we
now? Can we entertaine any other thoughts of it, but that, (having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
hitherto been denied and opposed by the most <hi>zealous, painefull, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
successefull Preachers of the Gospell,</hi> that these latter Ages, have been
through the goodnesse of God blessed withall, entertained chiefely by Men
of loose, dissolute principles and practises, enemies to the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the profession thereof, and strongly suspected to corrupt the minds
and conversations of Men that doe embrace it) it is the only serviceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
and assistance for the making of the <hi>Ministry of the Gospell usefull</hi> and
fruitfull, ingenerating holinesse and obedience in the Lives and wayes of
Men.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Third Argument is proposed <hi>Sect. 18. Cap.</hi> 13. in these words,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note>
               <hi>That Doctrine which representeth God as weake, Incongruous, and
In coherent with himselfe, in his applications unto men, is not
from God, and consequently that which contradicteth it, must
needs be the truth: but the Doctrine of Perseverance opposed by
us, putteth this great dishonour upon God, representeth him weake,
Incongruous, &amp;c. Ergo.</hi> For the proofe of the <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition, to make
good the charge in it exhibited against the Doctrine of Perseverance, there is a
<hi>Drammaticall scheme</hi> induced, to whose framing and Application M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
contributed no more but the paines of a Translator, taking it from the <hi>Anti-Synod:</hi>
p. 276. 277. in these words. <hi>You that truly Believe in my Sonne, and have
beene once made partakers of my Holy Spirit, and therefore are fully perswaded &amp;</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:59070:186"/>
assured from my will and command given unto you in that behalfe, yea according
to the infallible word of Truth which you have from me, that you cannot possibly,
no not by all the most horrid sinns and abominable practices, that you shall, or can
commit fall away either totally or finally from your Faith; for in the midst of your
foulest actions &amp; courses there remaines a seed in you which is sufficient to make you
true Believers, &amp; to preserve you from falling away finally, that it is impossible you
should dye in your sinnes; you that know &amp; are assured, that I will by an irresistible
hand worke Perseverance in you, &amp; consequently that you are out of all danger of
condemnation, and that Heaven and Salvation belong unto you, and are as good as
yours already, so that nothing but giving of thankes appertaines to you which also
you know that I will, do what you will in the meane time, necessitate you unto;
you I say that are fully and throughly perswaded and possessed with the truth of all
these things, I earnestly charge, admonish, exhort, and beseech, that yee take heed
to your selves, that yee countinue in the Faith, that there be not at any time an
evill heart of unbeliefe in any to depart from the Living God, that you fall not
from your owne stedfastnesse, yea I declare and professe unto you that if you shall
draw back, my soule shall have no pleasure in you, that if you shall deny me, I will
deny you, that if you be againe overcome of the lusts of the world, and be intangled
here with, that your latter end shall be worse than your beginning, that if you shall
turne away, all your former Righteousnes shall not be remembred, but you shall dye in
your sinnes, and suffer the veugeance of Eternall fire. On the other hand if you shall
continue to the end, my Promise is, that you shall be Saved; therefore strive to enter
in at the straite gate, quit your selves like men, labour for the meat that indureth
unto Everlasting Life, and be not sloathfull, but followers of them, who through
Faith and Patience inherit the Promises. He that shall duly weigh and consider,
what a sencelesse and indeed ridiculous incongruity there is, between these Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
Adjurations, Threatnings, and latter Promises, and those Declarations,
Applications, and former Promises doubtlesse will confesse that either the one, or the
other of them are not from God, or according to the mind of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> The incongruity of this fiction, with the Doctrine it is framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
is so easily manifested that it will not much concerne us, to consider
the incongruity that the severall parts of it have one with an other. For</p>
            <p>First the whole Foundation of this <hi>fanatick Fabrick,</hi> is ridiculous in it selfe,
and ridiculously imposed on the Doctrine of Perseverance. For whereas it
sayes not that all Saints have any comfortable <hi>Assurance</hi> of their Perseverance
and so may by all Gospell wayes whatever, by Promises, and Threatnings,
be stirred up to the use of those meanes whereby Perseverance is wrought,
and Assurance obtain'd, so it saies that no one Saint in the world, ever had,
can have, or was taught to expect his <hi>Perseverance</hi> or the least sence, or <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of it under such an uncouth supposition, <hi>as falling into &amp; continuing in
sins &amp; Abominations;</hi> the Promises they have to assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their inseparable
abode with God to the end, are, that he will <hi>write his Law in their hearts, &amp; put
his Feare in their inward parts; that they shall never depart from him;</hi> and they
shall be kept up thereto, by the use of meanes suitable as appointed of God
for the attaining of the end proposed, <hi>being kept by the power of God,</hi> but <hi>throngh
Faith unto Salvation.</hi> God doth not call (nor doth the Doct: of Perseverance
of the Saints, or of the stability and Unchangeablenesse of his Promises in
Christ to Believers assert it) any to Believe that they shall never fall away from
him, what <hi>sinnes and Rebellions so ever</hi> they fall into, neither hath he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
any such things unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only that he will through his Grace preserve
them in the use of meanes from such Rebellions, as are inconsistent with his
Love and free acceptation through Christ according to the Tenor of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
of Grace; so that instead of the first part of this fiction, whose inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59070:186"/>
with the latter is after Argued, let this acording to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of our
Doctrine be instituted.</p>
            <p>You that truly Believe in my Sonne Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">§: 3.</note> and are made partakers of my
Holy Spirit, who being heirs of the Promises, and so have a Right to that abundant
Consolation, that Joy in believing, which I am willing all of you should receive; I
know your Feares, doubts, perplexityes and Temptations, your failings, sinnes and
back-slidings, and what sad thoughts on the account of the evill of your owne
hearts and wayes you are exposed to, as that you shall never abide, nor be able to
continue with me, and in my Love to the end: let the feeble knees be strengthned
and the hands that hang downe be lifted up: behold I have ordained goodworkes
for you to walke in, as the way wherein you are to walke for the attainement of the
end of your Faith the Salvation of your soules; And to quicken you and stirre you
up hereunto, I have provided and established Effectuall Ordinances, revealed in the
Word of my Grace, whereunto you are to attend, and in the use of them according
to my mind, to grow up into Holinesse, in all manner of holy conversation, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Fighting, Resisting, Contending with, and against all the Spirituall Enemy's
of your soules; And as for me, this is my Covenant with you, that my Spirit which
gives Efficacy to all the meanes, Ordinances and Advantages of Gospell Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which I have afforded unto you, by whom I will fulfill in you all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of my Goodnesse, and the worke of Faith with Power, so making you meet
for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, and Preserving you to my Heavenly
Kingdome, shall never depart from you; so that you also having my Law written
in your hearts, shall never utterly and wickedly depart from me; And for such sinnes
and follies as you shall be overtaken withall, I will graciously heale your backslidings
and receive you freely.</p>
            <p>This is the Language of the Doctrine we maintaine, which is not (we full
well know) obnoxious to any <hi>Exceptions</hi> or <hi>Consequences</hi> what ever, but such
as bold and prejudiced men, for the countenance of their vaine conceits and
opinions, will venture at any time to impose and fasten on the most pretious
Truths of the Gospell; That God should say to Believers, as is imposed on
him,, <hi>fall into what sinnes they will, or abominations they can, yet he will have
them believe, that by an irresistible hand, he will necessitate them to Persevere;
that is, in and under their Apostacy,</hi> (which is evidently implyed in their fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into sinnes and abominations in the manner insisted on) is a ridiculous fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to the imagination whereof the least colour is not supplied, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
intended to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raduced thereby.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> for the ensuing <hi>Exhortations, Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> as farre
as they are really <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> whose use and tendency is argued to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Doctrine before proposed, I have formerly manifested. What
is their proper use and efficacy in respect of Believers, and their consistency
with the truth we maintaine, apprehended as it is indeed, and not visarded
with ugly and dreadfull appearances, will I presume scarcely be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
by any, who having received a <hi>Kingdome that cannot he shaken,</hi> doe
know what it is to <hi>serve God acceptably with reverence and Godly feare;</hi> It is
true, they are made unto, and have their use in reference unto them that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
and shall <hi>Persevere</hi> therein: but they are not given unto them, as men
<hi>assured</hi> of their Perseverance; but as men <hi>called</hi> to the use of meanes for the
establishing of their soules in the wayes of obedience; They are not in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of the Gospell, <hi>irrationally happed</hi> on such intimations of unchangeable
Love, or proposed under such wild <hi>Conditionalls,</hi> and <hi>Suppositions,</hi> as here by
our Author; but annexed to the Appointment of those wayes of Grace and
Peace, which God calls his Saints unto, being suited to worke upon the new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wherewith they are indued, as spreading it selfe over all the facultyes of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59070:187"/>
their Rationall Soules, wherein are Principles fit to be excited to Operation
by Exhortations and Promises.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> all that is indeed <hi>Argumentative</hi> in this Discourse is built on this
Foundation; that a Spirituall Assurance of attaining the <hi>end</hi> by the use of
meanes, is discouraging and disswasive to the use of those meanes; A Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
so uncouth in it selfe, so contradictory to the experience of all the Saints
of God, so derogatory to the Glory and Honour of Jesus Christ himselfe,
(who in all his Obedience had doubtles an Assurance of the end of it all) as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that can well fall into the imaginations of the Hearts of men;
Might not the Devill have thus replyed upon our Saviour, when he tempted
him to turne <hi>Stones into Bread,</hi> &amp; cast himselfe from a <hi>pinacle of the Temple,</hi> &amp;
received Answer <hi>that man lives not by Bread alone but by every word that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
out of the mouth of God</hi> but alas! <hi>thou Jesus the Sonne of the Living God, that
art perswaded thou art so, and that God will preserve thee, whether thou usest any
meanes or no, that thou shalt never be starved for want of Bread, nor hurt thy selfe
by any fall, whatever thou clost, the Angells having charge that no evill shall come
nigh thee, nor thy foot be hurt against a stone, thou maist now cast thy selfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the Temple, to manifest thy Assurance of the Love and Faithfullnesse of
God with his Promises to thee;</hi> If our Saviour thought it sufficient to stop the
mouth of the Devill, to manifest from Scripture, that notwithstanding the
Assurance from God that any one hath of the <hi>end,</hi> yet he is to use the <hi>meanes</hi>
tending thereunto, (a neglect whereof is a sinfull tempting of God;) we shall
not need to goe farther for an Answer to the same kind of Objections in the
mouth of any Adversary whatever.</p>
            <p>His 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section containeth his fourth Argument,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> in these words;</p>
            <p>If there be no possibility of the Saints falling away finally, then is their Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
uncapable of reward from God. But their finall Perseverance is not uncapable
of reward from God; Ergo, The minor Proposition I presume containes nothing
but what is the sence of those who deny the conclusion: or how ever it containes
nothing but what is the expresse sence of the Lord Christ, where he saith, that he
that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved; Therefore I suppose we shall bee
excused from farther proofe of this, without any prejudice to the cause in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I grant, <hi>Eternall Life</hi> may be called the <hi>Reward</hi> of Perseverance in the
sence that the Scripture useth that word, applyed to the matter in hand; It is
<hi>afterward</hi> neither procured by (properly and Morally as the deserving cause)
nor proportioned unto the obedience of them by whom it is attained; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it is, that withall, is the <hi>free gift of God,</hi> and an <hi>Inheritance</hi> purchased
by Jesus Christ; a Reward of <hi>Bounty and not of Iustice,</hi> in respect of them upon
whom it is bestowed, but only of faithfulnesse in reference to the promise of
it. A Reward, by being a gratious incouragement, as the <hi>end</hi> of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
not as the procurement or desert of it; so we grant it a <hi>Reward</hi> of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
though those words of our Saviour, <hi>he that endureth to the end, the
same shall be saved,</hi> expressed a consequence of things only, and not a connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of causality of the one upon the other: of the foundation of this discourse
concerning a possibility of declining, immediate consideration shall be had.
He proceeds then.</p>
            <p>The consequence of the Major Proposition,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> stands firme upon this foundation; No
act of the Creature whereunto it is necessitated, or which it cannot possibly decline,
or but doe, is by any Law of God, or rule of Iustice rewardable; therefore if the
Saints be necessitated by God to Persevere finally, so that he leaves unto them no
possibility of declining finally, their finall Perseverance is not according to any Law
of God, or man, nor indeed to any principles of Reason or Equity, capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
no whit more than actions meerely naturall are: Nay of the two, there seems
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59070:187"/>
be more reason why acts meerely naturall (as for example, Eating, Drinking,
Breathing, Sleeping,) should be rewarded, in as much as these flow in a way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
yet from an inward principle and connaturall to the Agent, than such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whereunto the agent is constrain'd, necessitated, &amp; determined, by a principle
of power from without, and which is not intrinsecall to it.</p>
            <p>And this is the strength of the Argument which will quickly appeare to be
very weakenesse. For</p>
            <p>First the efficacy of these Expressions (<hi>whereunto it is necessitated, and from
which they cannot possibly decline</hi>) as to their influence into this Argument,
ariseth clearely from their Ambiguity; we deny any to be <hi>necessitated to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe,</hi>
or that our Doctrine affirmes any such thing taking that expression
to hold out a power upon their wills, in their operations, inconsistent with
the utmost liberty whereof in Spirituall things having received a Spirituall
principle) men are capable; They are not so necessitated to Persevere as
that all the Acts of their Obedience, whereby they do Persevere should not
be <hi>free,</hi> but <hi>necessary,</hi> indeed they are not at all, nor in any sence necessitated
to persevere: There is no Necessity attends their Perseverance, but only in
respect of the event, with reference to the <hi>Vnchangeable</hi> purpose and <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Promise of God; the like may be said of that other expression (<hi>possibility
of declining,</hi>) God leaves in them a <hi>possibility of declining,</hi> as to their way and
manner of walking with him, though he leaves not to them a <hi>possibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining</hi>
or falling totally from him, as to the issue and event of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which doth not in the least necessitate them to, or in any of their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> the proposition must be cast into an other mould, before it will
be of any determinate signification in opposition to the Doct: it opposeth, &amp;
tuned to an other mood before it will give a certaine sound to any battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; &amp; this is, that no <hi>Act</hi> of the Creature that is wrought in order to the
obtaining of any end promised to be certainely attained thereby, is rewardable
of God; (though for Perseverance it is not any act of the Creature, but only
<hi>a modus</hi> of its Obedience) and thus it lookes towards the concernement of
this Doctrine; yet before this proposition passe, to omit sundry other things
that would gladly rise to the destruction of it, I desire one <hi>query</hi> may be assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
concerning the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Jesus Christ, Whether it were not necessary
that the end of his Obedience should follow? and Whether it were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
he should decline from his Obedience? And if it were, whether it
were impossible that God should give a Reward thereunto?</p>
            <p>But thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> the intendment of this Proposition, as farre as it concernes us,
(and that indeed is with a respect to our Doctrine of the <hi>Efficacy of Grace,</hi> and
not this of Perseverance) is this, <hi>That which is wrought in us, by the Effectuall
Grace of God is not capable of Reward from God;</hi> A Proposition which though
capable of some plea and colour, taking <hi>Reward</hi> in a pure <hi>Legall sence;</hi>
supposing the Persons seeking after it, to do it by a service, and dutyes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
unto it, yet is so openly and directly contradictory to the tenour &amp;
designe of God in the Covenant of Grace by Jesus Christ, with the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the Spirit given to abide with Believers, for all the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
as to their Obedience, as I shall content my selfe to deny it expecting
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s proofes of it; When <hi>rivers runne backward, heavy things as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, for the <hi>flourish</hi> added to these Assertions, by comparing the acts
of the Saints Obedience upon a supposition of the Grace of God <hi>working them
in them,</hi> with their Naturall actions of <hi>eating, drinking, sleeping</hi> as to their
tendency to exalt the Glory of God in rewarding, it proceedes either from
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59070:188"/>
grosse ignorance of the Doctrine opposed, or willfull prevaricating from
that Light of it which he hath who ever taught that God's operations in and
towards Believers, as to their Perseverance in Faith and Obedience did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in an outward constraint of an unwilling principle. God gives a principle
of Obedience to them, he <hi>writes</hi> and implants <hi>his Law in their hearts,</hi> and
moves them effectually to act suitably to that inward principle they have so
received; which though <hi>Spirituall</hi> &amp; <hi>Supernaturall</hi> in respect of its rise &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of bestowing, yet is connaturall to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in respect of its being a <hi>Principle of
Operation;</hi> we are not then in the least beholding to our Author for his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
concession; <hi>That as a Prince may give great things to them that eat
and drinke and breath, but not as rewards, so God may give Eternall Life to them
that are so necessitated by him to Persevere, though not as a reward;</hi> For although
we will not contend with God about Eternall Life; that he give it us under
the notion of a Reward, and desire to be much affected with the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, as a <hi>free guift of Grace,</hi> an eminent purchase of the Bloud of God,
and looke upon it meerely as a Reward of <hi>bounty,</hi> so called as being the end
whereunto our Obedience is suited and the rest of our Labours, yet we say,
in an <hi>Evangelicall</hi> sence and acceptation, it is properly so proposed to that
Obedience and Perseverance therein, which is wrought in us by the efficacy
of the Grace of God, as it lyes in a tendency unto that end, which to be at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained
by those meanes, he hath infallibly determined.</p>
            <p>He proceeds therefore to inforce his Argument with a new Consideration.<note place="margin">§. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If we speake of Rewards Promised in order to the mooving or inclining of the
wills of men towards such or such actions and wayes, of which kind also the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mentioned in the Scriptures, as yet remaining to be conferred by God upon
men, are, the case is yet more cleare, viz. That they are appropriate unto such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
aud wayes, unto the Election and choice whereof men are not necessitated in
one kinde or other; especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot by any Physicall or forreigne power; For to what
purpose should a Reward be Promised unto me, to Perswade or make me willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in such or such a course, or to performe such &amp; such a service in case I be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssitated
to the same ingagement or performance otherwayes? Or what place is there
left for a Morall inducement, where a Physicall necessity hath done the execution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or
if the Morall inducement hath done the execution, &amp; sufficiently raised &amp; ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the will to the action, with what congruity of Reason, yea or common sence, can a
Physicall necessity be superinduced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What there is more in this than what went before, unlesse <hi>Sophystry</hi>
and <hi>Falsity,</hi> I see not. For first, though I conceive that <hi>Eternall Life</hi> is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Scripture as our Reward rather upon the account of supporting &amp;
chearing our Spirits in the deficiency's, Temptations, and intanglements at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
our Obedience, than directly to ingage into Obedience (though
consequently it doth that also) whereunto we have so many other unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ingagements and inducements yet the consideration there of in that
sence also, as it moves the wills of men to Actions suitable to the attainement
of it, is very well consistent with the Doctrine in hand; That old Calumny
an hundred times repeated and insisted on in this contest, of <hi>our wills being
necessitated and deprived of their choise and Election,</hi> unlesse it could be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
made good, will be of no use to M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> as to his present purpose.
The whole strength of this Argumentation, is built on this supposall. That
the effectuall Grace of God in its working the <hi>will</hi> &amp; <hi>deed</hi> in Believers, or the
Spirits doing of it by Grace, with Gods fore determination of events, doth take
away the Liberty of the will inducing into it a necessary manner of Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
determining it to one, antecedently in order of time to its own determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it selfe, which is false &amp; nowise inferred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Doctrine under Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59070:188"/>
Yea as Gods <hi>Providentiall</hi> concurrence with men and determination
of their wills, to all their Actions as Actions is the Principle of all their naturall
Liberty so his <hi>Gracious</hi> Concurrence with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or operations in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as unto Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Effects, working in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to will, is the Principle of all their true Spirituall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
<hi>when the Son makes us free then are we free indeed;</hi> the Reward then is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to an understanding enlightned, a will quickned &amp; made free by grace, to
stirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up to actions suitable to them who are in expectation of so bountifull
a close of their Obedience: (which actions are yet wrought in them by the
Spirit of God, whose <hi>fruits</hi> they are) and this to very good purpose, in the
hearts of all that know what it is to walke with God and to serve him in the
midst of Temptations unlesse they are under the power of some such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
errour, as turnes away their eyes from believing the Truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> The opposition here pretended between <hi>a Physicall necessitating,</hi>
and a <hi>Morall inducement,</hi> for the producing of the same effect, is in plain tearms
intended between the <hi>Efficacy of Gods internall grace,</hi> and the use of <hi>Externall
exhortations and motives;</hi> If God give an Internall Principle, or Spirituall Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
fitting for, inclining to spirituall actions and duties, if he followes the
work so begunne in us, (who yet of our selves <hi>can doe nothing,</hi> nor are <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to think a good thought</hi>) with continuall supplies of his Spirit and Grace,
working daily in us according to the <hi>exceeding greatnesse of his power,</hi> the
things that are well pleasing in his sight, then, though he worke upon us, as
Creatures endued with Reason, Understandings, Wills, and Affections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
glory from us according to the Nature he hath endued us withall, all
Exhortations and Incouragements to Obedience required at our hands, are
vaine and foolish; Now because we think this to be the very <hi>Wisdome of God,</hi>
and the opposition made unto it, to be a meere invention of Satan, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
corrupted nature, and decry all the Efficacy of the Grace of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
we must have something besides, and beyond the naked Assertion of
our Author, to cause us once to believe it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The great <hi>Execution that is made by Morall inducements solely,</hi>
without any internally efficacious grace, in the way of Gospell Obedience is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
supposed, but not once attempted to be put upon the proofe or Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
It shall then suffice to deny that any perswasions, outward motives
or inducements whatever, are able of themselves to raise, ingage, and carry
out the will unto Action, so that any good spirituall Action should be brought
forth on that account, without the effectuall influence, and Physicall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of internall grace; And M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is left to prove it, together with such
other Assertions derogatory to the free Grace of God, <hi>Dogmatically</hi> imposed
upon his Reader in this Chapter, whereof some have been already remarked,
and others may in due time. The residue of this Section (the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) spent to
prove <hi>that Eternall Life is given as a Reward to Perseverance,</hi> having already
manifested the full consistency of the Proposition, in a Gospell acceptation of
the word <hi>Reward,</hi> with whatever we teach of the Perseverance of the Saints,
I suppose my selfe inconcerned in: And therefore passing by the triumphant
conclusion of this Argument asserting an Absolute power in men to exhibite
or decline from Obedience, I shall goe on to that, which in my apprehension,
is of more importance, and will give occasion to a Disconrse, I hope, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usefull
or unprofitable to the Reader; I shall therefore assigne it a peculiar
place and Chapter to it selfe.</p>

            <p>They who are in a capacity, or possibility of perpetrating the workes

falling away, and that finally from the Grace and favour of God, in case they be

they are in a possibility of perishing, and so of falling away from the Grace and

to wit, They who are in a possibility of perpetrating, or customarily acting
the workes of the Flesh, are in a possibility of perishing, is clearely proved from all
such Scriptures which exclude all workers of iniquity, and fulfillers of the Lusts of
the flesh from the Kingdome of God; of which sort are many; Of the which saith
the Apostle, speaking of the Lusts of the flesh, Adultery, Fornication, &amp;c. I tell
you, as I have also told you in times past, that they who do such things shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdome of God; so againe, For this ye know, that no Whoremonger or

yet againe, know ye not that the nnrighteous shall never inherit the Kingdome of
God? Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters shall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God; from such passages as these, which are very frequent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it is as cleare as the light of the Sunne at noone-day, That they who may

            <p>A foundation of this discourse we have laid in <hi>Iames.</hi> 1. 14. 15.<note place="margin">§: 3.</note> 
               <hi>Put every man
is tempted,</hi> saith the Holy Ghost, <hi>when he is drawn away of his own Lust, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed;
Then when Lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sinne, and sinne when it
is finished, bringeth forth death.</hi> The Holy-Ghost discovers the <hi>fountain</hi> of all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59070:190"/>
sinne, and pursues it in the <hi>streames</hi> of it into the <hi>dead sea,</hi> whereinto it falls;
All sinne whatever, is from temptation, that which tempts to sinne is the
cause of it, and that which tempts to all sinne is the cause of all sinne; This
<hi>Fountaine</hi> of sinne is here Discovered, the principle, proper, criminall cause of
sinne, in the beginning of the 14. verse. The Adversative <hi>but,</hi> is exclusive of any
other faulty cause of sinne, that should principally fall under our Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
especially of God, of whom mention was made immediately before; now
this is affirmed to be every mans lust. The generall way and meanes that
this Originall of all sinne useth for the production of it is also discovered,
and that is <hi>Temptation:</hi> every mans owne <hi>lust tempts him;</hi> The progresse also
it makes in carrying on of sin whereunto it tempts is farther described in the
severall parts &amp; degrees of it. 1. <hi>It drawes away and intices,</hi> &amp; the persons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
whom it exerts this efficacy, are <hi>drawne away or inticed.</hi> 2. It <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
Lust conceives,</hi> the subject being prepared, answering its <hi>drawing away
and inticing,</hi> without more adoe, it <hi>conceives</hi> sinne, and then it <hi>brings</hi> it forth
into Action; that is, either into open perpetration, or deliberate determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its accomplishment, and then it <hi>finisheth sinne,</hi> or comes up to the
whole worke that sinne tends to: Whereuuto is subjoyned the dismall end
and issue of this progresse of sinne which is <hi>Death;</hi> Eternall <hi>Death</hi> is in the
wombe of <hi>finished sinne</hi> and will be brought forth by it.</p>
            <p>This being the <hi>progresse</hi> of sin from the first <hi>Rise</hi> which is <hi>Lust,</hi> to the last <hi>end</hi>
which is <hi>Death</hi> the way and path that the best and most refined Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
men in the world do never throughly forsake, though they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
step out of it, or be stopt in it, a way wherein who ever walkes to the
end, may be sure to find the end. I shall consider the severall particulars
laid downe, and shew in them all at least the most materiall, the difference
that is betweene <hi>Believers</hi> &amp; <hi>Vnbelievers,</hi> whilest they do walke or may walke
in this path, and then manifest where, and when all Saints breake out of it
forever; so that they come not to the close thereof; and therein shall give a
full Answer unto the whole strength and designe of the Argument in hand,
which consisteth as was said in a comparison instituted between the <hi>sins</hi> and
<hi>demerits</hi> of Believers, and Unbelievers.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Fountaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> principle &amp; cause of all sin whatever in all persons whatever
is <hi>Lust,</hi> every ones <hi>owne Lust</hi> is the cause of his <hi>owne sin;</hi> This is the mother,
wombe, &amp; <hi>fomes</hi> of sin, which <hi>Paul</hi> sayes he had not been acquainted withall
but by the Law, <hi>Rom. 7. 7. Nay I had not knowne sin but by the Law, for I had not
knowne Lust except the Law had said thou shalt not Covet;</hi> That which in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
he calls sin indefinitely, in the close he particularly termes <hi>Lust;</hi> as being
the hidden secret cause of all sinne, and which once discovered swallowes up
the thoughts of all other sin, it being altogether in vaine to deale with them,
or to set a mans selfe in opposition to them, whilst this sinfull wombe of them
is alive and prevalent; this is that which we call <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> as to that part
of it which consists in the universall alienation of our hearts from God, and
unconquerable, habituall, naturall inclination of them to every thing that is
evill; for this sinne workes in us <hi>all manner of concupiscence Rom.</hi> 7. 8. This I
say is the wombe, cause, and principle of sinne, both in <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi>
The Roote on which the bitter fruit of it doth grow where ever it is;
no man ever sinnes but 'tis from his owne lust. And in this there is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the sinnes of <hi>Believers,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> they are all from the same
<hi>Fountaine,</hi> yet not such an agreement but that there is a difference herein also;
for the clearing whereof observe.</p>
            <p>First that by nature this <hi>Lust,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> which is the principle of sinne, is seated in
all the facultyes of the Soule, receiving divers <hi>Appellations</hi> according to the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59070:190"/>
variety of the subjects wherein it is; and is sometimes exprest in tearmes of
<hi>Privation, Want</hi> and <hi>Deficiency,</hi> sometimes by <hi>Positive</hi> inclination to evill. In
the Understanding tis <hi>Blindnesse, Darkenesse, Giddinesse, Folly, Madnesse.</hi> In the
Will <hi>Obstinacy</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> In the Heart and Affections, <hi>Pride, Stubborne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Hardnesse, Sensuality:</hi> In all <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Privatively, Death:
Positively, Lust, Corruption, Flesh, Concupiscence, Sinne, the Old man,</hi> and the
like; There is nothing in the soule of a man that hath the least influence into
any Action as Morall, but it is wholly possessed with this depraved vicious
habit, and exerts it selfe <hi>alwayes,</hi> and <hi>only,</hi> in a suitablenesse thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly thar this <hi>Lust</hi> hath so taken possession of men by Nature, that in
reference to any Spirituall Act or duty they are nothing else but <hi>Lust</hi> and
<hi>Flesh;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> that which is <hi>borne of the flesh is flesh, John</hi> 3. 6. It is all so, it is all <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Flesh;</hi> That is, it is <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>habitually</hi> corrupt, as to the doing any
thing that is good. If any thing in a man might seeme to be exempted, it
should be his <hi>minde</hi> the seat of all those things which are commonly called
the <hi>Relickes of the Image of God,</hi> but that also is <hi>flesh</hi> as the Apostle at large
Asserts it <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and <hi>enmity to God;</hi> Neither is it of any weight, which is
Objected. That there is in Unregerate men, the <hi>knowledge of the Truth</hi> which
they retaine in ungodlinesse, <hi>Rom. 1. 18. Conscience</hi> accusing, and excusing
<hi>Rom</hi> 2. 14. The knowledge of sinne which is by the Law with sundry
other endowments which they say doubtlesse are not <hi>flesh.</hi> I Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
they are all <hi>flesh,</hi> in the sence that the Scripture useth that word;
The Holy Ghost speakes of nothing in man, in reference unto any duty of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
unto God, but it is either <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> these two comprehend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man in the world; every man is either <hi>in the flesh,</hi> or <hi>in the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.
The utmost improvement of all naturall facultyes whatever, the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
subjection whereunto they are brought by convictions yet leaves the
same impotency in them to Spirituall good, as they were borne withall the
same habituall inclination to sinne, however entangled and hampered from
going out to the Actuall perpetrating of it; neither are they themselves any
thing the better, nor hath God any thing of that Glory by them, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from the willing Obedience of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> it being the state of every mans <hi>proper Lust,</hi> which is the Fountain
of all sinne, two things will follow.</p>
            <p>First, That in whomsoever it is, in its compasse and power as above descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
as' tis in every <hi>unregenerate Man,</hi> how ever convinc'd of sinne, he sinnes
with his full and whole consent; all that is within him consents to every sinne
he commits; Unregenerate men sinne with their whole hearts and soules. In
every act their <hi>carnall minds are not,</hi> will not be subject to the Law of God;
their <hi>wills</hi> and all their <hi>Affections</hi> delight in sinne; and this because there is no
principle in them, that should make any opposition to sinne, I meane such a
spirituall opposition, as would really take off from their full consent; It is true
<hi>Conscience</hi> repines, witnesses against sinne, reprooves, rebukes, excuses or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
but Conscience is no reall principle of operation, but either a <hi>Judge</hi> of
what is done, or to be done, or a morall <hi>inducer</hi> to doing or not doing; and
whatever Conscience doth, however it tumultuate, rebuke, chide, perswade,
trouble, cry, and the like, whatever conviction of the guilt of sinne may shew
into the judgement, yet sinne hath the <hi>consent</hi> of the whole soule. Every thing
that hath a reall influence into operation, consents thereto, originally and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically,
how ever any principle may be dared by Conscience. To take off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing from full consent, there must be something of a spirituall Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
in the mind and will, which when Lust is thus enthroned, there is
not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:59070:191"/>
Secondly, That sinne <hi>reigneth</hi> in such persons, Many have been the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Learned men about reigning of sinne. As <hi>What</hi> sinnes may be said to
reigne,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and what not? Whether sinnes of ignorance may raigne, as well as
sinnes against knowledge? What little sinnes may be said to reigne, as well
as great? Whether frequent relapses into any sinne, prove that sinne to be
<hi>reigning?</hi> Whether sinne may reigne in a Regenerate person? Or whether a
Saint may fall into reigning sinne, whereabout <hi>Divines</hi> of great note and
name have differed; all upon a false bottome and supposall; The Scripture
gives no ground for any such inquiries or disputes, or <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> as
some men have raised hereupon: And indeed I would this were the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
of mens creating <hi>Cases</hi> of Conscience, and answering them, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and in truth, there are no such things; so insnaring the Consciences of
Men, and intangling more by their <hi>Cases,</hi> than they deliver by their <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
The truth is, there is no mention of any <hi>reigning sinne,</hi> or the <hi>Reigning of
any sinne</hi> in the whole Book of God, taking sinne for this or that particular
sinne; But of the <hi>Reigne</hi> of this <hi>Indwelling</hi> originall <hi>Lust,</hi> or fountaine of all
finne there is frequent mention. Whilest that holds its power and universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the soule, and is not restrained, nor straitned by the Indwelling spirit of
grace, with a new vitall principle of no lesse extent, and of more power than
it, be the Actuall sinnes <hi>few</hi> or <hi>more, knowne</hi> or <hi>unknowne, little</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> all is
one; sinne <hi>reignes,</hi> and such a person is under the power and dominion of sinne:
so that in plain termes, to have <hi>finne reigne,</hi> is to be <hi>unconverted:</hi> and to have
sinne <hi>not to reigne</hi> is to be <hi>converted,</hi> to have received a new principle of Life
from above; This is evident from the 5. and 6. Chapter of the Epist. to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>seate</hi> of this Doctrine of <hi>reigning sinne;</hi> The opposition insisted
on by the Apostle is between the Reigne of <hi>Sinne</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and in pursuit
thereof he manifests how true Believers are tanslated from the one to
the other. To have <hi>sinne reigne</hi> is to be in a state of sinne; to have <hi>Grace
reigne,</hi> is to be in a state of Grace. So <hi>Chapter 5. 21. %As sinne reigned
unto death, so Grace reignes through Righteousnesse unto eternall Life by
Jesus Christ our Lord;</hi> The sinne he speakes of is that whereof he treates in all
that Chapter; the sinne of Nature, the Lust wherof we speake, this by nature
reigneth unto Death, but when <hi>Grace</hi> comes by Jesus Christ, the soule is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the power thereof, so in the whole 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> It is our change of
state and Condition that the Apostle insists on in our delivery from the reigne
of <hi>sinne,</hi> and he tells us, this is that that destroyes it, our being under <hi>Grace
v: 14. Sinne shall not have dominion over you because you are not under the Law,
but under Grace;</hi> Plainely then there are <hi>two</hi> Lords and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and these are
Originall or Indwelling <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> or the Spirit of it; The first <hi>Lord</hi> the
Apostle discovers with his entrance upon his Rule and Dominion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
and this all men by nature are under; The second he describes <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. which
sets out the Rule &amp; reigne of Grace in Believers by Jesus Christ. And then</p>
            <p>Thirdly the place that both these <hi>Lords</hi> have in this life in a Believer, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.
This then is the only <hi>reigning sin</hi> &amp; in whomsoever it is in its power &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas
as it is in all unregenerate men, in them, &amp; in them only doth sin reigne,
&amp; every sin they commit is with <hi>full consent,</hi> (as was manifested before) in
exact willing Obedience to the <hi>soveraigne Lord</hi> that reignes in them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> observe that the <hi>Grace, new Creature,</hi> Principle or Spirituall Life
that is Given to, bestowed on, and wrought in all, and only Believers, be it
in the <hi>lowest</hi> and most <hi>remisse</hi> degree that can be imagined, is yet no lesse
universally spread over the whole soule, than the contrary <hi>habit</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Lust and sinne, whereof we have spoken; In the Understanding it is
<hi>Light in the Lord,</hi> in the Will <hi>Life,</hi> in the Affections <hi>Love, Delight, &amp;c.</hi> those
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59070:191"/>
being reconciled, <hi>who were alienated by wicked workes.</hi> Where ever there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, the <hi>least</hi> of grace, there something of it is in every thing of the soule,
that is a capable seat for good or evill habits, or dispositions; He <hi>that is in
Christ is a new creature, 2 Cor:</hi> 5. 17. not renewed in one or other particular,
<hi>he is a new Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, that where ever true Grace is, in what degree soever,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> there it bears
Rule; though sinne be in the same subject with it; As <hi>sinne reignes</hi> before
grace comes, so <hi>Grace reignes</hi> when it doth once come: And the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>sinne</hi> having the first Rule, and Dominion in the heart, abiding there,
there is neither Roome nor place for <hi>Grace,</hi> but what is made by conquest.
Now who ever enters into a possession by right of Conquest, what resistance
soever be made, if he prevaile to a Conquest, he <hi>reignes.</hi> In every regenerate
man, though Grace be never so <hi>weake,</hi> and Corruption never so <hi>strong,</hi> yet
properly the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> belongs to Grace. Having entered upon the soule,
and all the powers of it by <hi>Conquest</hi> so long as it abides there, it doth reigne;
So that to say a Regenerate man may fall into <hi>reigning sinne,</hi> as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exprest, (though as we have manifested no sinne reignes, but the sinne of
Nature, as no good Act reigneth, but the spirit and habit of Grace) and yet
continue Regenerate, is all one as to say, he may have, and not have true
Grace at the same time.</p>
            <p>Now from these considerations,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> some farther inferences may be made;
First, That in every regenerate person, there are in a spirituall sence, two
<hi>Principles</hi> of all his actings: Two <hi>Wills;</hi> There is the <hi>Will of the Flesh,</hi> and
there is the <hi>Will of the Spirit;</hi> a Regenerate man is spiritually, and in Scripture
expression <hi>two men,</hi> a <hi>new man,</hi> and an <hi>old:</hi> an <hi>inward</hi> man and a <hi>body of
Death;</hi> and hath <hi>two Wills,</hi> having two Natures, not as <hi>Naturall</hi> faculties, but
as <hi>Morall</hi> principles of operation; and this keepes all his actions as Morall,
from being perfect, absolute, or compleate in any kind. He doth good with
his <hi>whole heart</hi> upon the account of <hi>sincerity,</hi> but he doth not good with his
whole heart upon the account of <hi>perfection;</hi> and when he doth evill, there is
still a <hi>non-submitting,</hi> an unconsenting principle; this the Apostle complains
of, and declares, <hi>Rom. 7. 19. 20. The good that I would, I doe not, but the evill
which I would not, that doe I; now if I doe that I would not, it is no more I that
doe it, but sinne that dwelles in mee; I find then a Law, that when I would doe
good, evill is present with mee; For I delight in the Law of God after the inward
man:</hi> There is an [I] and an [I] at opposition, a <hi>will</hi> and not <hi>willing;</hi> a <hi>doing</hi>
and <hi>not doing;</hi> a <hi>delighting</hi> and <hi>not delighting,</hi> all in the same person; so that
there is this difference at the entrance, between what sinne soever of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons, and others, though the principle of sinning be the same for the
kind and nature of it, in them and others; all sinne, every mans sinnes, be who
he will be, believer or unbeliever, being <hi>tempted by his own Lust:</hi> yet that <hi>Lust</hi>
possesseth the whole soule, and takes in the vertuall consent of the whole
man, notwithstanding the controwle and checks of conscience, the light of
the judgement, in him that is unregenerate; but in every Regenerate person,
there is an <hi>unconsenting principle,</hi> which is as truly the man himselfe, that doth
not concurre in sinne, that doth expressely dissent from it, as the other is, from
whence it flowes.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> That sinne neither can, doth, nor ever shall reigne in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Persons. The reason of this I acquainted you with before, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
thinks this a sufficient proofe of this assertion, because <hi>they are under grace.
Rom.</hi> 7. 14. Whilest the principle of Grace abides in them, which <hi>reignes</hi>
where ever it be, or the free acceptance of God in the Gospell is towards
them, it is impossible upon the account of any actuall sinne whatever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59070:192"/>
they may fall, that sinne should reigne in them: nothing gives Sinne a
<hi>Reigne</hi> and dominion, but a totall defect of all true grace whatever, not only
as to the exerting it selfe, but as to any habituall relicts of it; It may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
sometimes with Temptations and corruptions, but it is Grace still,
as the least sparke of fire is fire, though it should be covered with never so
great an heape of ashes, and it reignes then.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Regenerate persons sinne not with their <hi>whole and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> Consent may be taken two wayes; First <hi>Morally,</hi> for approbation of the
thing done; so the Apostle saies, that in the inward man, he did <hi>consent to the
Law, that it was good. Rom.</hi> 7. 16. that is, he did <hi>approve</hi> it as such, like it, delight
in it as good; and thus a Regenerate man never <hi>consents</hi> to sinne; no nor <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate</hi>
persons neither, unlesse they are such as being <hi>past feeling are given
up to work lasciviousnesse with greedinesse;</hi> a Regenerate person is so farre from
thus <hi>consenting</hi> to sinne, that <hi>before</hi> it, <hi>in</hi> it, <hi>after</hi> it, he utterly condemnes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowes,
hates it as in himselfe, and by himselfe committed. Secondly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
may be taken in a <hi>Physicall</hi> sence, for the concurrence of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and acting principles of the soule unto its operations: and in this sence an
unregenerate man sinnes with his <hi>full consent,</hi> and his whole will; a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man doth not, cannot doe so; For though there is not in that consent to
sinne, which his will, inclined by the remaining disposition of sinne in it, doth
give, an actuall sensible Reaction of the other principle, yet there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
<hi>not consenting;</hi> and by the power that it hath in the soule, (for habits
have power in, and over the Subjects wherein the are) it preserves it from
being wholly ingaged into sinne; and this is the great intendment of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19 20. 21. 22.</p>
            <p>From what hath been spoken will easily appeare what Answer may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the former Argument, to wit, That notwithstanding any sinnes that
either the Scripture or the experience of men, do evince that the Saints may
fall into, yet that they never sinne or perpetrate sinne with their <hi>full and whole
consent,</hi> whereby they should be lookt upon, in and under their sinnes,
in the same state and condition with unregenerate persons, in whom sinne
reigneth, committing the same sinne, and how insufficient any thing produced
by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in defence of the argument layd downe at the entrance of
this Chapter, is to remove the Answer given unto it from Believers not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with their whole consent may easily be demonstrated; This he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth.</p>
            <p>Some
to mainetaine this position, That all the sinnes of true Believers are sinnes
of infirmity, lay hold on this shield, such men, they say never sinne with their whole
wills, or with full consent, therefore they never sinne but through infirmity; that
they never sinne with full consent, they conceive they prove sufficiently from that
of the Apostle, for the good that I would I do not, but the evil that I would not
that I do, Now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it, but sinne that
dwelleth in me. I Answer, first that the Saints cannot sinne but with their whole
wills or full consents is undeniably proved by this consideration; viz. Because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
there should be not only a plurality or diversity, but also a contrariety of
wills in the same perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at one &amp; the same instant of time, viz. when the supposed act
of evill is produced, now it is an impossibility of the first evidence that there should
be a plurality of acts &amp; these contrary one to the other in the same subject or agent,
at one or the same iustant of time; it is true between the first movings of the flesh in
a man towards the committing of the sinne, and the compleating of the sinne by an
Actuall and Externall patration of it, there may be successively in him not only
a plurality but even a contrariety of Volitions or Motions of the will according to
what the Scripture speaketh concerning the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59070:192"/>
Spirit against the flesh; But when the flesh having prevailed in the combate, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth her desire into act the Spirit ceaseth from his act of Lusting; otherwise
it would follow that the flesh is greater aud stronger in her lusting; than the Spirit
of God in his; and that when the flesh lusteth after the perpetration of such or such
a sinne, the Spirit as to the hindering of it lusteth but in vaine, which is contrary
to that of the Apostle, greater is he that is in you (speaking as tis cleare of the
Spirit of God unto true Believers) than he that is in the world, meaning Sathan and
all his Auxiliaries Sinne, Flesh, Corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What we intend by the Saints not sinning with their <hi>whole wills</hi> hath
been declared;<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> that there is not a consistency in the explanation we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> asserts; because it would inferre <hi>a plurality yea a contrariety
of wills in the same person at the same time;</hi> That there is a <hi>plurality</hi> yea a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of wills in the Scripture sence of the expression of the will of a man
was before from the Scripture declared; not a <hi>plurality</hi> of wills in a <hi>Physicall</hi>
sence, as the will is a <hi>naturall faculty</hi> of the soule, but in a <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall</hi>
sence as 'tis taken for a habit or principle of good or evill; The will is
a naturall faculty, one nature hath one will, in every Regenerate man there
are <hi>two natures,</hi> the new or divine, and the <hi>old</hi> or corrupted. In the same sence
there are in him two wills as was declared; But saith he <hi>It is an impossibility
of the first evidence that there should be a plurality of Acts in the same subject at
the same time and these contrary one to another.</hi> But</p>
            <p>1. If you intend acts in a Morall Consideration, unlesse you adde about
the same Object which you do not, this Assertion is so farre from any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of truth that it is ridiculously false; May not the same person love God
and hate the Divell at the same time. But</p>
            <p>2. How passe you so suddenly from a plurality of wills to a plurality of acts;
by the will we intend in the sence wherein we speak of it an <hi>habit,</hi> not any <hi>act;
i.e.</hi> The will as habitually invested with a new principle &amp; not as actually will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thence, &amp; by vertue thereof; <hi>Arminius</hi> from whom our Author bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
this Discourse fell not into this <hi>Sophystry,</hi> he tels you <hi>There cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wills or volitions about the same Act;</hi> But is it with M.G. or <hi>Arminius</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
that there should be a <hi>mixt action</hi> partly voluntary, &amp; partly invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary;
actions whose principles are from without by perswasion may be so, a
mans throwing his goods in the Sea to save his owne life; Now the principles
whereof we speak <hi>Flesh</hi> &amp; <hi>Grace</hi> are <hi>internall</hi> &amp; contrary, &amp; shall not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that proceed from a faculty wherein such contrary principles have their
residence, be partly voluntary, partly involuntary.</p>
            <p>3. But he tells you, <hi>That though there might be lusting of the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the flesh before the act of sinne, yet when it comes to the acting of it then it
ceaseth &amp; so the act is wrought with the whole will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First though this were so, yet this doth not prove but that the Action is
<hi>mixt</hi> and not absolutely and wholly voluntary; Mixt Actions are so esteemed
from the antecedent deliberation and dissent, though the will be at length
prevailed upon thereunto, and I have shewed before that in the very action
there is a vertuall dissent, because of the opposite principle that is in the
will. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, How doth it appeare that the Spirit doth not <hi>lust against the flesh</hi>
though not to a prevalency even in the exertion of the acts of sinne; In every
good act that a man doth, because <hi>evil is present with him,</hi> though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
be of the part of the Spirit, and the principle of Grace, yet the flesh
also with its lustings doth alwayes in part corrupt it; Thence are all the spots,
staines, and imperfections of the holy things and dutyes of the Saints; and if
the <hi>flesh</hi> in its <hi>lusting</hi> will immix it selfe with our good Actions to their defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59070:193"/>
and impairing why may not the Spirit in the ill, not immix its selfe and
its lustings threwith, but beare off from the full influence of the will into
them which otherwise it would have.</p>
            <p>But saith he <hi>If the spirit doth not cease lusting before the flesh bring forth the
act of sinne, then is the Spirit conquered by the flesh, contrary to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
1 John. 4. 4. %Stronger is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> But</p>
            <p>First, If from hence the <hi>flesh</hi> must be though &amp; conceived to be <hi>stronger</hi> than
the Spirit, because it prevailes in any act unto sin, notwithstanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
of the Spirit, how much more must it be judged to prevaile over it
and to <hi>conquer</hi> it if it cause it <hi>utterly to cease,</hi> and not to strive at all; He that
restraines an other that he shall not oppose him at all, hath a greater power
than he who conquers him in his resistance; But why doth Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> feare
least the flesh should be asserted to be stronger in us than the Spirit? Is not
his whole designe to prove that it is, or may be so, so much stronger and more
prevalent than it, that whereas it is confessed on all hands, that the Spirit
doth never wholly conquer the flesh that it shall not remaine in the Saints in
this life, yet that the flesh doth wholly prevaile over the Spirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it to an utter expulsion of it, out of the hearts of them in whom it
is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the prevalency of the flesh, it is not the Spirit himselfe that is
conquered, but only some <hi>motions</hi> &amp; <hi>actings</hi> of him in the heart; Now though
some particular actings and motions of his may not come out eventually unto
successe yet if he <hi>generally beares Rule</hi> in the heart, he is not to be said (even
as in us and acting in us) not to be <hi>stronger than the flesh;</hi> He is, as in us, on this
account, said to be <hi>stronger than he that is in the world,</hi> because notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the opposition that is against us, he preserveth us in our state and
condition of Acceptation with God and walking with him with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
heart in good workes and dutyes for the most part, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the flesh prevailes unto sinne, from which yet he recovers us by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
To speake a little to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s sence; By the <hi>Spirits insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi>
it is manifest from the Text urged and from what followes in the same
place, that he intends not a <hi>Spirituall vitall principle</hi> in the will, having its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
there, with its contrary principle the flesh (perhaps he will grant no
such thing) but the Spirit of God himselfe. How now doth this Spirit lust?
Not <hi>formally</hi> doubtlesse, but by causing us so to do; and how doth it do that
in Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s judgement? Meerely by perswading of us so to do; so that to
have the flesh prevaile against the Spirit, is nothing in his sence, but to have
sinne prevaile, and the motives of the flesh above the motives used by the
Spirit, which may be done, and yet the Spirit continue unquestionably stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the flesh.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The summe is, If the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>flesh,</hi> Lust and Grace, may be
lookt on as habituall qualityes and principles in the wills of the same persons
so that though a man hath but one will, yet by reason of these contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes,
He is to be esteemed as two diverse principles of operation, it is evident
that having contrary inclinations continually, the will hath in its actings a
Relation to both these principles, so that no sinne is commited by such an one
with his <hi>whole will and full consent;</hi> That contrary qualityes in a <hi>Remisse degree</hi>
may be in the same subject is knowne, <hi>Lippis &amp; Tonsoribus;</hi> These adverse
principles the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are as those contrary qualityes of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and the inclinations, yea and the <hi>elicite</hi> acts of the will, are of the same
nature with them; so that in the same act they may both be working though
not with equall efficacy. Notwithstanding any thing then said to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59070:193"/>
it appeares that in the sinnes which the Saints fall into, they do not
sinne with their <hi>whole wills and full consent;</hi> which of it selfe is a sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the foregoing Argument.</p>
            <p>Sect. 25. containes a discourse,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> too long to be imposed upon the Reader by
a transcription: There are three parts of it, the first rendring a Reason,
whence it is, that if the <hi>Spirit be stronger than the flesh, yet the flesh doth often
prevaile in its lustings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second,</hi> The way of the Spirits returne, to act in us after its motions have
been rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third endeavours a proofe of the Proposition denied,</hi> That the Saints
sinne with their full and whole consent, by the example of David.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the first, he tells you,</hi> That the spirit acts not to the utmost efficacy of its
vigour and strength, but only when his preventing motions are entertained: and
Seconded, with a suitable concurrence in the hearts and wills of men: through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
and neglect whereof, he is said to be grieved, and quenched: <hi>i. e.</hi> to cease
from other actings, or movings in men. This Truth, is the ground of such, and
such sayings, in the sayings of Paul: for if you live after the flesh, ye shall dye: but
if ye through the spirit, doe mortify the deeds of the Body, ye shall live: for as many
as are led by the spirit of God, they are the Sonnes of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> here intended by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> is the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Blessed spirit
of Grace.</hi> What his actings to the <hi>just efficacy of his vigour and strength</hi> are M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
doth not explaine. nor indeed notwithstanding the seeming <hi>signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi>
of that expression is able; It must be to act, either as much <hi>as he can,</hi> or as
much <hi>as he will.</hi> That the Holy Spirit in opposing sinne, acts to the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of his <hi>Omnipotency</hi> in any, I suppose will not be affirmed. If it be as much
<hi>as he will,</hi> then the sence is, <hi>he will</hi> not in such cases, act as much <hi>as he will;</hi>
what that signifies, we want some other <hi>expressive phrase</hi> to declare. To let
this passe; let us see in the next place, what his actings to this <hi>just efficacy</hi> are
suspended upon, it is them in cafe, <hi>his first preventing motions be received, and
seconded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then secondly; What are these <hi>first preventing motions</hi> of the spirit?<note place="margin">§. 18.</note>
And what is it to entertaine them with a suitable concurrence of the Will? For
the First, M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> tells us in this Section, they are <hi>motions of a coole and
soft inspiration;</hi> such <hi>clowdy expressions,</hi> in a thing of this moment, are we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to embrace: <hi>preventing motions of the spirit,</hi> are either <hi>Internall Physicall</hi>
Acts in, with, and upon the Wills of men, working in them to will and to doe,
(called preventing from the actings of the wills themselves) or they are <hi>Morall</hi>
insinuations, and perswasions to good, according to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath espoused: it is the latter only, that are here intended.
The preventing motions of the spirit, are his Morall perswasions of the Will,
to the good proposed to its consideration.</p>
            <p>See then in the next place, what it is to <hi>second, &amp; entertane these motions with
a sutable concurrence in the heart and Will;</hi> Now this must be, either to yeeld
Obedience to these motions, and to doe the good perswaded unto, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; if any thing else, we desire to know of M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> what it is, and
wherein it consists; if it be to doe the good perswaded too, then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
(I pray you) of those <hi>subsequent Helps,</hi> which are suspended upon this
obedience, when the thing it selfe is already performed, which their help and
assistance is required unto: They may well be called <hi>subsequent motions,</hi> which
are never used nor applyed, but when the things, whereunto they move, and
provoke, are before hand accomplished and performed, yea they are suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on that condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:59070:194"/>
Farther wherein do these <hi>subsequent helps</hi> as it is expressed, which move at
a more high, and <hi>glorious</hi> rate consist? We have had it sufficiently argued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to a thorough conviction of what is Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> judgment in this
matter; <hi>viz.</hi> That he acknowledgeth no operations in, or upon the wills of
men, but what are <hi>Morall,</hi> by the way of perswasion; contending to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
efficacy of his vigour, and strength in disputing; that there is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
between <hi>Physicall</hi> internall operations, in or upon the Will of men,
and Morall exhortations, or perswasions, as to the production of the same
effect; This then is the frame of this fine Discourse. If upon the Spirits first
perswasion to good, men yeild Obedience and do it accordingly, the Spirit
will then with more power, and vigour, move them when they have done it,
and perswade them to doe it; That this discourse of his doth readily admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
occasion, and advantage to retort upon him his third Argument for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
considered, of imposing incoherent and inconsistent reasonings, and
actings upon God in his dealings with men, the intelligent Reader will
quickly find out; and it were an easy thing to erect a <hi>Theater,</hi> and upon Mr
<hi>Goodwins</hi> principles, to <hi>personate</hi> the Almighty, with an incongruous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent
discourse; but we feare God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Spirit is <hi>grieved with the sinnes of Believers,</hi> and their
walking unworthily of, or not answerable to, the grace they have received, is
cleare. (<hi>Ephesians</hi> 4. 31.) The Apostle admonisheth Believers to abstaine from
the sinnes he there enumerates, and consequently others of the like import,
having <hi>put on,</hi> and <hi>learned Christ,</hi> unto sanctification, that <hi>they doe not grieve
the Spirit,</hi> from whom they have received that great mercy, and priviledge
of being <hi>sealed to the day of Redemption;</hi> But that therefore the <hi>subsequent</hi> and
more effectuall motions of the spirit, are not <hi>free</hi> as the <hi>first,</hi> but supended on
our performance of that, which he first moves unto, and so consequently,
that there is neither <hi>first</hi> our <hi>second</hi> motion of the Spirit, but may be rendred
uselesse, and fruitlesse, or be for ever prevented, is an Argument not unlike
that of the Papists, <hi>Peter feed my sheep, therefore the Pope is head of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ensuing discourse also is not to be passed without a little Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 20.</note>
               <hi>thus then he proceeds.</hi> Believers <hi>(saith he)</hi> doe then mortify the deeds of the
body by the spirit, when they joyne their Wills unto his, in his preventing motions
of grace, and so draw, and obtaine farther strength, and assistance from him, in
order to the great, and difficult work of mortification, in respect of which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
also with the spirit in his first, and more gentle applications of himselfe to
them, they are said to be led by the Spirit, as in their comportments with him, in
his higher, and farther application, they become filled with the spirit, according
to the expression of the Apostle, Be ye filled with the spirit, i.e. follow the spirit
close in his present motions, and suggestions within you, and you shall be filled with
him, i.e. ye shall find him moving and assisting you upon all occasions at a higher
and more glorious rate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, what this <hi>joyning of our Wills of the spirit</hi> is, was in
part manifested before; The Will of the spirit is, that we be mortified. His
motions hereunto are his perswasions, that we be so; To joyne our Wills to
his, is in our Will, to answer the Will of the spirit; that is, upon the spirits
motions we <hi>mortify our selves.</hi> By this also (he tells us) we draw or obtaine
farther strength, or assistance from the spirit, for that worke which we have
done already; but how so? why he tells you afterward, that this is the <hi>Law of
the Spirit:</hi> It seems then, that by doing one thing, we obtaine or procure the
assistance of the spirit for <hi>another,</hi> and that by a <hi>Law;</hi> I aske by what <hi>Law?</hi> by
the <hi>Law of workes?</hi> by that Law the Apostle tells you, that we doe not at all
<hi>receive the spirit,</hi> therefore by a <hi>parity</hi> of Reason, we obtaine not any farther
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59070:194"/>
supplies from him, by that Law; By the Law of Faith, or Grace? that Law
knows nothing of such termes, as that we should by any acting of ours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God, which he freely bestowes, according to the maine
tenour of that Law. Farther; How is this second grace obtained, and what is
the Law of the Spirit therein? is it obtained <hi>ex congruo,</hi> or <hi>ex condigno?</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Rule of Gods proceeding with his Saints, or any of the sonnes of
men, in the matter of any gratious behovement of his, and you will out-doe
what ever your Predecessors, whether <hi>Pelagians, Papists, Arminians,</hi> or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
could yet attaine unto. Our Lord hath told us, <hi>that without him we can
doe nothing:</hi> yea all our <hi>sufficiency is of God,</hi> and without him <hi>we cannot think
a good thought;</hi> that <hi>he workes in us to will and to doe;</hi> not only <hi>beginning, but
perfecting every good worke, fulfilling in us, all the good pleasure of his goodnesse,
and the work of Faith with power,</hi> ascribing the whole of the great work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to Himselfe, and his Holy Spirit, working freely and gratiously, as he
wills, and pleaseth; Of this order of his dealing with men, that his <hi>first,</hi> or
<hi>preventing Grace</hi> should be free, but his <hi>subsequent Grace</hi> procured by us, and
bestowed on us, according to our working, and cooperation with his first
grace, invented by <hi>Pelagius, Iulianus,</hi> and <hi>Celastinus,</hi> and here introduced a
new by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> he informes us nothing at all. In briefe, this whole
discourse, is the meere <hi>Pelagian</hi> figment, wrapt up in generall clowdy expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
with allusions to some Scripture Phrases (which <hi>prophane,</hi> as well as <hi>err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
spirits are prone to) concerning the bestowing of the Grace of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the differing deportments, and deservings of men, differencing
themselves from others, and in comparison of them, holding out, <hi>what they
have not received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> 
               <hi>to Answer the first and gentle motions of the spirit, is to be led
by him, and then we shall be filled by the spirit;</hi> But how doth M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> prove,
that to be <hi>led by the spirit,</hi> is to <hi>answer his first gentle motions,</hi> and <hi>thereby to
obtaine his farther, and more glorious actings and perswasions?</hi> Is it safe, thus to
make bold with the word of God? or is not this to wrest it, as <hi>ignorant,</hi> and
<hi>unstable</hi> men doe unto perdition? Saints, <hi>being led by the spirit of God,</hi> and
<hi>walking after the spirit,</hi> are in <hi>Rom:</hi> 8. expressions of that Effectuall sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
exerting it selfe in their conversation, and walking with God, which the
spirit of God worketh in them, and which is their duty, to come up unto, in
opposition to <hi>living,</hi> or <hi>walking after the flesh.</hi> If this now be attained, and
the Saints come up unto it, antecedently to the <hi>subsequent Grace</hi> of the Spirit,
what is that subsequent grace, which is so gloriously expressed, and wherein
doth it consist? Neither doth that expression of <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> hold out the
concurrence, or <hi>comportment of their Wills,</hi> as it is phrased, with the gentle
motion of the spirit, but the powerfull and effectuall Operation of the spirit,
as to their Holinesse, and walking with God; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is not, <hi>they
comport, or concurre with the Spirit in his motions,</hi> but by the spirit, they are
<hi>acted,</hi> and carried out to the things of God: Neither hath this any relation to,
or coherence with that of the <hi>Ephesians 5. 18. %Be filled with the spirit,</hi> neither
is there any such intendment in the expression, as is here intimated of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of receiving more of the spirit, on condition of that compliance, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and comportance with his motions, as is intimated. That the spirit is
sometimes taken for his Graces, sometimes for his Gifts, <hi>habitually,</hi> sometimes
for his <hi>actuall operations,</hi> is known; The Apostle in that place disswading the
<hi>Ephesians</hi> from turning aside to such carnall, sinfull Refreshments, as men of
the world went out unto, bids them, <hi>not be drunke with Wine, wherein is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,</hi>
but to be <hi>filled with the Spirit:</hi> to take their refreshment in the joyes of
the spirit, speaking to <hi>themselves in Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> v.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59070:195"/>
20. Could I once imagine that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> had the least thought, that indeed
there was any thing in the Scripture, looking towards his intendment in the
producing of it, I should farther manifest the mistake thereof; To play thus
with the word of God, is a liberty we dare not make use of yet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly he concludes</hi> That the reason why Believers are overcome by the
Lustings of the flesh is not because the Spirit is not stronger than the flesh, but
because men have more will to harken to the Lusts of the Flesh, than to the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Fortunam Priami cantabo, &amp; nobile bellum.</p>
            <p>This is the issue of all the former swelling Discourse, mens sinnes are from
their owne willes, and not because the Spirit is not stronger than the flesh;
And who ever doubted it, the Conclusion you were to prove, is, <hi>That Believers
sinne with their whole will and full consent of their wills, and that the new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that is in them, doth not cause their wills to decline from acting in sinne to the
just efficacy of all their strength and vigour;</hi> But of this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for the insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that expression of the <hi>Will hearkening to the lusts of the flesh, and not
the lusting of the Spirit,</hi> in a sovereigne indifferency to both, and a liberty for
the performance of either, in a way exclusive of good, or vicious habituall
Principles of operation in the will it selfe, I shall not now divert to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of.</p>
            <p>What else remaines in this Section,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> either doth not concerne the businesse
in hand, as the fine notions of the <hi>Spirits returne to move Believers when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been rejected, with the manner,</hi> whereof according to his conception,
must be afterwards considered apart, as the <hi>fall of David into Adultery and
Murther;</hi> if there be need to go forth to the consideration of his <hi>examples</hi> and
<hi>instances:</hi> and therefore I shall not longer insist upon it; only the close of it
consisting of an inference made from some words of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> deserves
consideration; <hi>Vpon Davids sinne</hi> (saith he) <hi>Peter Martyr, makes this observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That the Saints themselves being once fallen into sinne, would alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the pollution of it, did not God by his mighty Word bring them out of it;
which saying of Martyr clearely also implyes that the Saints many times sinne with
their whole wills and full consents, because were any part of their wills bent against
the commiting of the sinne at the time, when it is committed, they would question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
returne to themselves and repent immediately after the beat and violence of the
Lust being over, by reason of the satisfaction that hath been given thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
The close insinuation in <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s words, of the Saints sinning
with their <hi>whole wills,</hi> and the Logicke of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s inference from them
I believe is very much hidden from the Reader; To the <hi>Theology</hi> of it, I say,
that the Saints <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, do immediately returne to God by Repentance,
(as <hi>Peter</hi> did) upon their surprisalls into sinne; nor have they any rest in a
condition, of the <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the countenance of God from them, as upon
sinne it is alwayes more or lesse; of <hi>Davids</hi> particular case, mention may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be made; But the proofe, <hi>that they sinne with their whole wills and
full consent because they would continue in sinne, did not the Lord relieve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them by his word and Grace,</hi> is admirable; I would adventure to cast
this Argument into as many shapes, as it is tolerably capable of, had I the
least hope to cause it to appeare any way <hi>Argumentatives;</hi> we deny then that
Believers have any such power habitually residing in them, as whereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Which supplyes of the Spirit, and Grace, we say and have proved are freely

promised to them in the covenant of Graces; But what will here follow to the
supportment of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that therefore in all their sinnes or
in any of their sinnes, they <hi>sinne with the full and whole consent of their wills,</hi> I
suppose he alone knowes.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 23</note> 26. <hi>He endeavoures to take off that of the Apostle Rom. 7. 19, 20.
from appearing against him in this cause of the Saints finning with their whole
wills and consents; not</hi> not-willing <hi>the things they do, to this end he tells us</hi>
That when the Apostle saith the evill which I would not that I do, his meaning is not
that he did that which at the same time, that he did it, he was not willing either
in whole or in part to do, but that he sometimes did that upon a surprisall by
temptation or through incogitancy, which he was not habitually willing or disposed
in the inward man to do; But this no wayes implyes but that at the time when
he did the evill he speakes of, he did it with the full and entire consent of his
will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is probable the Apostle knew his owne meaning, and also how
to expresse it, having so good a teacher to that end and purpose as he had;
now he assures us in the person of a Regenerate man that as <hi>what He would He
did not,</hi> so <hi>what He did He would not, He</hi> hated it <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. And againe he did that
which he would not, and <hi>therein consented to the Law</hi> by his not willing of that
he did) <hi>that it was good;</hi> which whether it expresse not a <hi>Renitency</hi> of the
will, to that which was done in part, and so farre as to make the Action it selfe
<hi>remisse</hi> and not to enwrappe the whole consent of the will, he farther declares
<hi>v.</hi> 17. telling us that there is a perfect <hi>unconsenting I,</hi> or internall principle in
the very doing of evill; <hi>Is is no more I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Apostle doth not say, what he was not <hi>habitually willing</hi> to, but
what he was <hi>habitually unwilling</hi> to; that is, what the bent of his will lay ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
against, having actuall inclinations, and <hi>elicite acts</hi> alwayes to the
contrary, though sometimes overcome; Neither in his discoursing of it, doth
he mention at all the <hi>surprisall of sin upon incogitancy,</hi> &amp; <hi>inadvertency</hi> but the
constant frame &amp; temper of a regenerate man, upon the powerfull acting, &amp;
striving of the principle of lust and sin dwelling in him, and remaining with
him; which saith the Apostle, doth often carry them out to do those things,
which are contrary to the principle of the inward man, which habitually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
and actually <hi>wills not,</hi> or rather <hi>nills</hi> the things that are so done, even
in their doing. And this doth manifest sufficiently that when he <hi>did</hi> the <hi>evil</hi>
he speakes of; he did it not with the <hi>full and entire consent of his will</hi> as men
do, in whom there is no such principle opposite to sinne, and sinning, as is in
him that is Regenerate; there being very much taken off by the habituall
principle of Grace that is in them, and its constant inclinations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But
he farther argues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> If we shall affirme, that the contrary bent or motions
of his will, at other times, is a sufficient proofe, that when he did the evill, we
speake of, he did it not with his whole will, or fulnesse of consent, in such a sence
is a distinguishing Character betwixt men Regenerate and unregenerate, we shall
bring Herod, and Pilate, and probably Judas himselfe into the list, of men Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
with a thousand more whom the Scripture knowes not, under any such name
or relation; <hi>viz.</hi> all those whose Judgments and consciences stand against the evill
of the wayes and practises wherein they walke.</p>
            <p>And this he proves at large to the end of the Section, in the instance of <hi>Herod,</hi>
and <hi>Pilate</hi> proceeding against their owne Judgements and Consciences in the
killing of <hi>John</hi> and of our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:59070:196"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, we do not only assert a <hi>contrary bent</hi> and inclination in the
Wills of Believers at other times, but also that in and under the prevalency
of <hi>indwelling</hi> sinne, there is in them an <hi>I</hi> that doth it not, and a not-willing it
from a Principle, though by reason of the present prevalency of the other, its
actings and stirrings are not so sensibly perceived. So that though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
not, to the totall prevention of the will, from exerting the Act of sinne,
yet they prevaile to the <hi>impairing, weakening,</hi> and <hi>making remisse</hi> its consent
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The residue of this Paragraph is intolerably <hi>Sophisticall,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the <hi>Renitencie</hi> of the <hi>inward man,</hi> the <hi>principle of grace</hi> that is in the
wills of Believers, with the Convictions of the judgements and consciences of
unregenerate persons, and their striving against sinne on that account. The
judgements and consciences of wicked men, tell them what they ought to do,
and what they ought not to doe without respect to the principle in their wills
that is predominant. But the Apostle mentions the actings of the <hi>will</hi> it selfe,
from its owne regenerate principle. We wholly deny that any <hi>unregenerate
man</hi> hath any vitall principle in his will not consenting to sinne, what ever the
dictates of his judgement and conscience may be; or how effectuall soever to
prevaile unto an abstinence from sinne. To discover the differences that are
between the contest, that is between the wills in unregenerate men, wholly
set upon sinne, on the one hand, and their judgements and Consciences en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
to an apprehension and approving of better things on the other, and
the contest that is between the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> lusting to contrary things, in
the same <hi>will,</hi> as it is in regenerate men, is a <hi>common place;</hi> that I shall not goe
forth unto. We grant then, that in unregenerate men, there may be, there is,
and was in some degree, perhaps in <hi>Herod,</hi> in <hi>Pilate,</hi> a conviction of conscience
and judgement, that the things they doe are evill; but say withall, that all
this being forraigne to their <hi>wills,</hi> it hinders not but that they sinne with <hi>the
full uncontrouled consent of their wills,</hi> which are at perfect Liberty, or rather
in perfect bondage unto sinne. That the <hi>Spirit</hi> should <hi>lust</hi> against the <hi>flesh,</hi> and
the <hi>flesh</hi> against the <hi>spirit,</hi> both in the same will. (as it appears they doe. <hi>Gal.</hi>
5. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. for the fruits that they both bring forth, are acts of the
will) in any unregenerate man, we deny; and this is that, and not the former,
which abates, and takes off from the wills consent to sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He concludes the whole;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 25.</note> And to the passage of the Apostle, mentioned Rom. 7.
I answer farther, that when he saith, the evill which I would not, that doe I, he
doth not speake of what he alwaies, and in all cases did, much lesse of what was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him to doe, but of what he did ordinarily and frequently, or of what was
very incident unto him, through the infirmity of the flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> through inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenesse
and anticipation by temptations to doe such things, which when he was in
a watchfull and considerate posture, and from under the malignant influence of a
temptation, he was altogether averse unto: now what a man doth ordinarily, is
one thing, and what he doth sometimes, and in some particular cases, especially
what it is possible for him to doe is another: that true believers whilest such, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
sinne not upon worse termes, then those mentioned by the Apostle concerning
his sinning, I easily grant; but it no waies followeth from hence, that therefore
they never sinne upon other termes, much lesse that it is impossible that they should
sinne upon others; and thus we see all things throughly and impartially argued, and
debated to and fro, that even true Believers themselves as well as others, may do
those works of the flesh, which exclude from the Kingdome of God, and that inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
thereof, they are subject to this exclusion as well as other men.</p>
            <p>The summe of this part of the Reply is, that what <hi>Paul</hi> speaks is true, of the
<hi>ordinary course of Believers,</hi> but not of extraordinary <hi>surprisals;</hi> this seems I
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59070:196"/>
say to be the tendency of it, though the direct sence of the whole is not so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to mee: by that expression, <hi>the evill that I would not,</hi> that I <hi>doe,</hi> you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
either the expression of, <hi>he would not,</hi> or, <hi>that he did;</hi> if the latter; then
you say, he did not sinne <hi>ordinarily</hi> and <hi>frequently,</hi> but only upon surprisalls,
which is freely granted, but is not at all to your purpose, but rather much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; If you attend that part of it, which holds out his Renitency against
the evill he did, in the expression of <hi>I would not,</hi> then you say, it was not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
with the Apostle to <hi>nill</hi> the evill that he did, but in case of surprisall to
sinne, which I believe is not intended; for is it credible, that any one should
think that in the <hi>ordinary course</hi> of a mans walking there should be no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
made to sinne, the falling whereinto men are liable, but upon <hi>surprizalls</hi>
and anticipations by temptation, as it is phrased there should. Nor is it on
the other side, that he intends the things that <hi>he did</hi> ordinarily, but was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
by temptation, then it might be otherwise. But first, is a Saint to be
supposed to <hi>sinne ordinarily,</hi> to sinne <hi>not prevailed</hi> on by temptation? is not all
sinne from temptation? doe they sinne actually but upon the surprisall of
temptation? to impose this upon the Apostle, that he should say truly for the
most part, or in my ordinary walking, I doe not sinne, but withall, <hi>I will it
not,</hi> but when I am surprized with temptations, then it is otherwise with mee,
there is no Renitency in my will to sinne, is doubtlesse to wrong him; He
doth not limit his <hi>not willing</hi> of the evill he did to any consideration whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but speakes it generally, as the constant state and condition of things
with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the beginning of this <hi>Section,</hi> the <hi>nilling of sinne,</hi> was antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the sinne: here, it is something that may be allowed in <hi>ordinary cases,</hi>
but not at all in extraordinary; so that these two expositions put together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to thus muh. Ordinarily the Apostle antecedent to any <hi>sinning</hi> before
the <hi>lusting of the spirit ceased,</hi> did <hi>not will</hi> the thing that he did, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
but in case of <hi>temptation it was not so;</hi> that is antecedently to his acting of
that which was evill, he had no opposition in the inward man unto it, nor lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of the spirit against it, which how it can be made good against him,
<hi>whose heart is upright,</hi> and who hates <hi>every evill way,</hi> I know not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly it is confessed that <hi>ordinarily Believers sinne at no worse a rate than
that expressed by the Apostle;</hi> But what doth that containe? If <hi>would not,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to their doing of sinnes, then you grant that which all this while you
have endeavoured to oppose, and are reconciled to your owne contradiction
in the first evidence sinne cannot <hi>ordinarily</hi> or <hi>extraordinarily</hi> be committed
but by an <hi>act</hi> of the will, and yet <hi>ordinarily,</hi> there is a dissent of the <hi>will</hi> also
thereunto. If you adhere to your other former interpretation <hi>that the willing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin committed, is antecedent to the commitment of it, &amp; layd a sleepe before
the perpetration of any sinne,</hi> then this also is imposed on you, that there are
sinnes whereunto they may be surprised by temptations, that <hi>antecedently</hi> to
the commitment of them, they do not, <hi>not-will;</hi> that as to them, <hi>the Spirit
lusteth not against the flesh;</hi> which is notoriosly false; for the flesh lusteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Spirit and all the wayes of it and all the fruits thereof, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
lusteth against the flesh, with all its wayes and fruits.</p>
            <p>Fourthly it appeares then that this being the description of a Regenerate
man, which the Apostle gives, as to indwelling sinne, and all the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that it is most <hi>ridiculous</hi> to exempt his frame in respect of such sinnes as they
may fall into by surprisalls of temptations, from this description of him, and
so to frame this distinction to the Apostles generall Rule, that it holds in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>ordinary,</hi> but not in <hi>extraordinary,</hi> when nothing in the whole Context
gives the least allowance or continuance to such a limitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:59070:197"/>
It appears then notwithstanding any thing offered here to the contrary,
upon due consideration of it, that <hi>Believers sinne not with their whole wills and
full consents;</hi> at any time,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> nor under the power of what temptation soever
they may fall for a season, and that because of the Residence of this principle
of a contrary tendency unto sinne in their wills which is allwayes acting, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>directly</hi> in inclining unto good, or in taking off, or making remisse the
consent of the will to sinne, not withstanding the prevalency of the principle
opposite thereunto, by its committing of sinne.</p>
            <p>And hence have we sufficient Light for the weakning of the Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in the beginning of this Chap.<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> For though it is weak in its <hi>Foundation</hi> (as
shall be shewed) concluding to what the Saints may do, from what is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them to do, that prohibition being the Ordinance of God certainly to preserve
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from it, yet taking it for granted that they may fall into the sin intimated,
yet seeing they do it not <hi>customarily,</hi> not <hi>maliciously,</hi> not with the <hi>full and whole
consent of their wills,</hi> that there is a principle in them still opposing sin, though
at any time weakened by sinne, and the conclusion of that Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
them not. I say then, <hi>First</hi> to the Major proposition, they who are
in a <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>possibility,</hi> that is, (an <hi>universall possibility</hi> not only in respect
of an <hi>internall principle</hi> but of all outward <hi>prohibiting</hi> causes as the purpose
and Promise of God, of <hi>perpetrating the workes of the flesh,</hi> not of bringing
forth any fruits of the lusting of the flesh, which are in the best, <hi>willingly and
ordinarily with the full and whole consent of their wills,</hi> in which sence alone
such workes of the flesh are absolutely exclusive from the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>they may posibly fall out of the favour of God and into destruction.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
being thus limited, and the termes of it cleared, for to cause it to passe;
I absolutely deny the <hi>minor,</hi> that true Believers do, or can so sinne; that is,
so bring forth the workes of the flesh, as to leave no roome for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Mercy to them, according to the tenour of the Covenant of
Grace.</p>
            <p>But now frame the Proposition so, as the Assumption may comprise Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
&amp; we shall quickly know what to judge of it; <hi>Those who are in a capacity or
possibility of falling into such sinnes, as deserve rejection from God, or of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
workes of the flesh though they do so, overborne by the power of temptation,
nilling the things they do, not abiding in their sinnes may fall totally and finally
from God: but Believers may so do.</hi> As the matter is thus stated the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be allowed, to passe upon Believers, but we absolutely deny the
Major Proposition in the sence wherein it is urged. I shall only adde that
when we deny that Believers can possibly fall away, it is not any <hi>absolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility</hi>
we intend, nor an impossibility with respect to any principle in
them, only that in, and from it selfe is not perishable, nor an impossibility in
respect of the manner of their acting, but such an one, as principally respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the <hi>outward removing cause</hi> of such an actuall defection, will infallibly
prevent the event of it. And thus is the cloud raised by this fifth <hi>Argument,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
and scattered by the light of the very first consideration of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in sinning, that is, between Regenerate and unregenerate men: so that
it will be an easy thing to remove, &amp; take a way what afterwards is insisted
on for the reinforcement and confirmation of the severall Propositions of
it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major Proposition</hi> he confirmes from <hi>Gal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 28.</note> 5. 21. <hi>Eph. 5. 5, 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 6.
9, 10. All affirming that neither <hi>whoremongers, nor adulterers, nor idolaters nor
the like have any inheritance in the Kingdome of God,</hi> or can be <hi>Saved;</hi> That the
intendment of the Apostle is concerning them, who live in a <hi>course of such
sinnes,</hi> who sinne with their <hi>whole wills,</hi> and from an <hi>evill roote,</hi> with whose
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59070:197"/>
sappe they are wholly <hi>leavened,</hi> &amp; tainted throughout, not them who through
the strength of temptation, and the surprisalls of it, not without the renitency
in their wills, unto all sin, any sin, the sinne wherewith they are overtaken,
may possibly fall into any such sinne (as did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>) was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
and in that sence we grant the Proposition.</p>
            <p>For the proofe of the <hi>Minor Proposition,</hi> which should be, that Believers may
<hi>perpetrate the Workes of the flesh,</hi> in the sence intended, in the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before mentioned, he insists on two things. First, the <hi>direction of those
Scriptures unto Believers.</hi> Secondly, <hi>the Experience of the wayes of such persons,</hi>
that is of Believers. The Apostle tells Believers, that they who commit such
and such things, with such, and such circumstances in their commitment,
cannot be saved; therefore Believers may commit those sinnes in the manner
intended: What hath been said before of the use of threatnings, and denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations
of judgements on impenitent sinners, in respect of Believers, will give
a sufficient account (if there be need of any) for our deniall of this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
and for the Second, that the experience of such mens waies and
walking evinceth it; it is a plaine <hi>begging of the thing under debate,</hi> and an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
of that, which was proposed to be proved, a thing unjustly charged
by him on his Adversaries, as though they should confesse, that <hi>Believers might
sinne to the extent</hi> of the lines drawn out in the places of Scripture mentioned,
and yet not loose their faith, when because they cannot loose their Faith, they
deny that they can sinne, to that compasse of excesse and riot intimated.</p>
            <p>I cannot see then,<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> to what end and purpose the whole ensuing discourse
from the beginning of this <hi>Argument</hi> to the end of the 21. <hi>Sect.</hi> is. It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that all those places doe concerne Believers; The intendment of
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in them, being to discover to them, the nature of the sinne spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
and the end of the committing of them, in the way intended, and that
God purposes to proceed according to the importance of what is threatned
to those sinnes, so committed, with all that doe them, that so they may <hi>walk
watchfully,</hi> and carefully avoiding not only those things themselves, but all
the wayes and meanes leading to them, (though if any one of them sinne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those sinnes without the deadly attendants of them mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they have <hi>an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the Righteous</hi>) but that
from thence it may be inferred, that Believers may, and some doe so sinne,
and that God intends as it is expressed, to destroy them if they so doe, when
he hath promised they shall never doe so, is a very weake and ridiculous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation:
They are a <hi>medium</hi> of acquainting them with the desert of sin,
the tenour of the Law, to them that are under it, and the riches of Grace in
their deliverance.</p>
            <p>It is true,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> unbelievers are (as you say) <hi>in our judgement,</hi> (and I wonder
what yours is in the case) in a state of exclusion from the Kingdome of God,
whether they perpetrate the workes of the flesh mentioned or no: Unbeliefe
is in our Judgement, sufficient of it selfe to exclude any one from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. But yet withall in our Judgment (and we desire to know yours)
it is impossible that Unbelievers (we meane those who are <hi>Adulti</hi>) should
not perpetrate the same evills mentioned, or others of the import, all the
<hi>thoughts, &amp; imaginations of their hearts being evill, &amp; that continually,</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
be farther exposed to the wrath of God, which is revealed against all that
do evill. If therefore the discovery of a mans desperate condition, that he
may be stirred up to labour, &amp; strive for a deliverance from it, doth concerne
him, then these &amp; the like passages do properly &amp; primarily concerne Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
whose state with the issue of it, is particularly described therein. And to
say (as our Author doth) <hi>that it is a vaine thing for the Spirit of God to threaten
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59070:198"/>
wrath to men upon the committing of sinne, if by unbeliefe they are exposed ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
to that wrath,</hi> is to question the wisdome of him with whom, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
become of us poore wormes) he cannot contend. He hath told us, that
all men by nature are <hi>Children of wrath and uncleane,</hi> so farre as not to be able
to <hi>enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> unlesse they be washed and borne againe
and yet we hope without the least deficiency in wisdome, hath farther revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his wrath from Heaven, against the <hi>ensuing ungodlinesse</hi> that is committed
by these Children of wrath to be executed in <hi>tribulation</hi> and <hi>anguish</hi> against
every soule that so doth evill: not to detaine the Reader, what hath been said,
and shall farther be argued concerning the difference that is between Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and unbelievers in their sinning, with that also which hath been spoken
of the concernement of Believers, in these and the like passages of Scripture,
sufficiently arguing that no such inference as is made for the confirmation of
the <hi>Assumption</hi> of the Argument under consideration according to Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
thoughts and apprehensions of it, can possibly be drawne out from
them.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> 22. <hi>is a pretty pageant, and by the Readers favour I shall shew it him
once more.</hi> If it be objected that true Believers have a Promise from God that
they shall never loose their Faith. I answer, first that this hath of been said, but
never so much as once proved. Secondly upon examination of those Scriptures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
such Promises of God are pretended to reside, or to be found, we finde no such
thing in them, we find indeed many Pomises of their Perseverance, but all of them
Conditionall, and such whose Performance in respect of actuall and compleate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance,
is suspended upon the diligent and carefull use of meanes by men to
persevere. And lastly to affirme that true Believers can by no commission of sinne
or sinnes whatsoever, how freequently soever reiterated, how long continued in
soever, ever make shipwracke of their Faith or fall away from the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God so as to perish, what is it but to provoke the flesh to an outragiousnesse
in sinning, and to encourage that which remaines of the old man in them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre
it selfe in all wayes of unrighteousnesse; and doubtlesse the bringing of that
Doctrine hath been the casting of a snare upon the World, and hath caused many,
whose feet God hath guided into wayes of peace, to adventure so farre into despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenesse
of sinning, that through the just Judgement of God their hearts never
served them to returne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, The foundation of this whole discourse, is a supposall of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of preserving believers in their Faith, upon the ridiculous supposition
after mentioned, to be asserted by the Doctrine of the Saints perseverance
and the defenders of it, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> knows fulwell to be far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
It hath sufficiently been proved, that Believers have a <hi>promise,</hi>
yea <hi>many promises,</hi> to be kept <hi>by the power of God,</hi> from all, and any such sinne,
or any such circumstance of sinne, or continuance in sinne, as is wholly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with Believing, and that therefore they shall be preserved in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
Upon our calling the examination of the proofes of this assertion
to an account, we have found them to be made up, of <hi>triviall</hi> exceptions, and
<hi>sophisticall</hi> suppositions, confident <hi>beggings,</hi> and cravings of the things under
contest and debate, (all the endeavours to prove the promises of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to be <hi>conditionall,</hi> having also involved in them, an absolute contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Truth, and to themselves) no way sufficient to evince, that the
promises and work of Gods grace, are suspended upon any conditions in men
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:59070:198"/>
And Fourthly, We say that the intrusion of this vaine <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
should continue so, under the consideration here intimated by you of
sinne, when the maine of the Doctrine contended for, consists in a full and
plaine deniall that they can, or shall fall under them (according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. immediately to be insisted on, being preserved by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and grace of him who so workes his Law in their hearts, that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
depart from him) is the great engine you have used in all your attempts
against it, being indeed a <hi>meere begging</hi> of the thing in question.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That there is nothing in this Doctrine, in the least, suited to turne
aside the Saints of God from the <hi>holy Commandement,</hi> but that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it is of an excellent usefulnesse, and effectuall influence for the promotion
of all manner of Godlinesse, in those that are truly Saints, howsoever any
man may abuse it, (as any other discovery of the grace of God) turning it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Lasciviousnesse, hath been declared: what use hath been made of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Doctrine in the world, we have hitherto had experience; only in the
<hi>Pelagians, Papists, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> and with what fruits of it they
have abounded, the Church of God doth partly know. What it is like to
bring forth, being now translated into another <hi>soile,</hi> or rather, having wonne
over to it, men sometimes of another profession, is somewhat, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
yet in obeyance.</p>
            <p>Let us then with the Apostle,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> having proceeded thus with M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
that a foundation may be the better laid, for the removall of what he farther
adds, proceed to consider the <hi>progresse of sinne,</hi> and to remarke from thence
the difference that is betweene <hi>Regenerate</hi> and <hi>Vnregenerate</hi> men in their
sinning.</p>
            <p>The second thing proposed in the Apostles discourse of the <hi>Rise</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
of sinne, is the generall way that <hi>Lust</hi> proceedeth in, for the bringing of
it forth, and that is <hi>Temptation: every one is tempted of his own Lust;</hi> This is the
generall way that <hi>Lust</hi> proceeds in, for the production of actuall sinne. <hi>It
tempts,</hi> and he in whom it is, <hi>is tempted:</hi> There is a <hi>Temptation</hi> unto sin only,
and a <hi>Temptation</hi> unto sin by sin: The first is no sinne in him that is so temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
our Saviour was so tempted; <hi>he was tempted of the Divell, Math. 4. 1. %He
was in all points tempted like as we are, without sin.</hi> That his temptations were
<hi>unto</hi> sin, is apparent from the story of them; <hi>but the Prince of this world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had nothing in him. John</hi> 14. 30. Found nothing in him to Answer and
close with his Temptations; and therefore though he was tempted, yet was
he without sin. Now though this sort of temptations from Sathan, are not
<hi>Originally</hi> our sinnes but his, yet there being <hi>tinder</hi> in our soules that <hi>kindles</hi>
more or lesse, in and upon every injection of his <hi>fiery darts,</hi> there being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in us to meet many, if not all of his Temptations, they prove in some
measure in the issue, to be ours. Indeed Sathan sometimes ventures upon us,
in things wherein he hath doubtlesse small hope of any concurrence, and so
seemes rather to aime at our <hi>disquiet,</hi> than our <hi>sinnes:</hi> as in those whom he
perplexes with <hi>hard and blasphemous thoughts of God;</hi> a thing so contradictory
to the very principles not of Grace only, but of that whereby we are men,
that it is utterly impossible there should be any assent of the soule thereunto;
to think of God, as God, is to think of him, every thing that is <hi>Good, Pure,
Great, Excellent, incomprehensible</hi> in all perfection: Now at the same time, to
have any Apprehensions of a direct contradictory importance, the mind of
man is not capable. Were it not for the <hi>unbeliefe, causelesse feares,</hi> and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
that in <hi>many</hi> do insue upon Temptations of this nature, which are
<hi>consequents,</hi> and not <hi>effects</hi> of it, Sathan might keepe this <hi>dart</hi> in his owne
forge, for any mischeife he is like to doe with it. The Apostle speakes here
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59070:199"/>
of Temptations <hi>by</hi> sinne as well as <hi>unto</hi> sinne; and these are mens <hi>sinnes,</hi> as
well as their Temptations, they are <hi>Temptations</hi> as tending to farther evill; they
are <hi>sinnes</hi> as being <hi>irregular</hi> and devious from the rule. Now this tempting of
Lust compriseth two things.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> The generall <hi>active</hi> inclination of the Heart unto sinne, though not
fixed as unto any particular act, or way of sinne; the <hi>motus primò primi;</hi> of
this you have that Testimony of God concerning man, in the state of nature
<hi>Gen. 6. 5. %Every figment of the thought of his heart, is only evill every day;</hi> the
<hi>figment</hi> or imagination of the thoughts, is the very roote of them; their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
moulding, or active preparing of the mind, for the exerting of them;
so 1 <hi>Chrou. 28. 9. %God understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</hi> The
<hi>figment</hi> of them: The <hi>next</hi> disposition of the soule unto them; and 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 29.
19. <hi>Keepe this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of their hearts,</hi> or keep
their hearts in a continuall framing posture and condition, of such good
thoughts. This (I say) is she first way of Lusts, Temptation; it makes a
mint of the heart, to frame readily all manner of evill desires, and thoughts
that they may as our Saviour speakes <hi>proceed out of the heart Mat.</hi> 15. 19. Their
actuall fixing on any object, is their <hi>proceeding,</hi> antecedent whereunto, they
are framed and formed in the heart; Lust actually <hi>disposeth,</hi> inclines, bends
the heart to things suitable to it selfe, or the corrupt habituall principle which
hath its residence in us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>actuall tumultuating of Lust,</hi> and working with all its <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>policy,</hi> in stirring up, provoking to, and drawing out thoughts and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of sin, with <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>complacency</hi> in inconeiveable variety: the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
degrees of its progresse herein being afterwards described.</p>
            <p>In the first of these there is no small difference between <hi>Regenerate &amp; Vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi>
persons,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> and that in these two things.</p>
            <p>First, In its <hi>universality;</hi> In Unregenerate men, <hi>every figment of their heart
is only evill and that every day;</hi> there is an <hi>universality</hi> of <hi>actings</hi> exprest posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
&amp; exclusively, to any actings of another kind; <hi>every figment of their heart
is only evill;</hi> and of time, <hi>every day:</hi> whatever good they seeme to do, or do,
whatever dutyes they performe, that in them all, which is the proper <hi>figment</hi>
of their heart, is <hi>only</hi> evill. On this account, take any duty they do, any worke
they performe, and weigh it in the ballance and t'will be found in respect of
principles, and circumstances, or aimes, to be wholly <hi>evill.</hi> That indeed there
is nothing in it that is acceptable to God: &amp; their hearts are casting, minting,
and coyning sinne, <hi>all the day long.</hi> With Believers 'tis not so, there is also a
<hi>good treasure</hi> in their hearts, from whence they bring out <hi>good things;</hi> there is
a good <hi>Root</hi> in them that beares <hi>good fruit;</hi> though they are, or may be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with many sins yea with great sins, yet lust doth not tempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it doth
unregenerate men, with a perpetuall continuall active inclination unto evill,
even some way or other in all the good they do. The Spirit is in them, &amp; will,
and doth in what state so ever they are, dispose their hearts to <hi>Faith, Love,
Meekenesse,</hi> and actuates those Graces, at least in the <hi>elicite</hi> acts of the will;
for a <hi>good tree will bring forth good fruit,</hi> never any Believer is, or was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
of God, or did so forsake God, as that every <hi>figment of his heart should
be evill only, and that continually;</hi> That no one act of sinne, can possibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
his habit of Grace, hath been formerly shewed; neither is he ever cast
into such a condition, but from the good principle that is in him. There is a
panting after God, longing for his Salvation with more or lesse efficacy; the
<hi>sparke</hi> is warme and glowing, though under <hi>ashes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In respect of <hi>power.</hi> Lust tempts in unregenerate men out an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
uncontrouleable <hi>dominion,</hi> and that with a <hi>morally</hi> irresistible efficacy;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59070:199"/>
All its <hi>dominion,</hi> as hath been shewed, and very much of its <hi>strength</hi> is lost in
Believers; this is the intendment of the Apostles discourse <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. concerning
the crucifying of sinne, by the death of Christ. The power, strength, vigour,
and efficacy of it, is so far abated, weakned, mortified, that it cannot so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
impell unto sin, as it doth when 'tis in perfect life and strength.</p>
            <p>But you'l say then,<note place="margin">§ 35.</note> If Lust be thus weakned in Believers, more than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
how comes it to passe, that they do at any time fall into such great, and
hainous sinnes, as sometimes they doe, and have done? Will not this argue
them, to be even <hi>worse</hi> than unregenerate persons, seeing they fall into sinne
upon easier termes, and with lesse violence of impulse from <hi>Indwelling sinne</hi>
than they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, The examples of Believers falling into great sinnes, are <hi>rare,</hi>
and such as by no meanes are to be accommodated to their <hi>state,</hi> in their
ordinary walking with God; 'tis true there are examples of such <hi>falls</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Scripture, that they might lye as <hi>bwoys</hi> to all generations, to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
men of their danger, when the <hi>waves</hi> of Temptation arise, to shew what
<hi>is in man,</hi> in the best of men, to keepe all the Saints of God humble, selfe-empty,
and in a continuall dependance on him, in whom are all their <hi>springs,</hi>
from whom are all their <hi>supplies;</hi> but as they are mostly all <hi>Old-Testament</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
before <hi>grace for grace</hi> was given out by Jesus Christ, so they are by no
meanes farther to be urged, nor are, but only to shew that it is possible that
God can keep alive the root, when the tree is cut downe to the ground; and
cause it to budde againe by the sent of the water of his Spirit, flowing towards
it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Believers fall not into great sinnes at any time, by the
<hi>meere strength</hi> of Indwelling sinne, unlesse it be in conjunction with some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
outward Temptation, exceedingly surprizing them, either by weakning
all wayes and meanes, whereby the principle of Grace should exert it selfe, as
in the case of <hi>Peter,</hi> or by sudden heightning of their corruption, by some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring
objects, attended with all circumstances of Prevalency, not without
Gods with-holding his speciall grace in an eminent manner, for ends best
known to himselfe, as in the case of <hi>David:</hi> Hence tis, that even in such sins,
we say, they sinne <hi>out of infirmity,</hi> that is, not out of <hi>propense</hi> deliberation, as
to sinne, not out of <hi>malice,</hi> not out of Love to, or delight in sinne; but meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through want of strength, when overborne by the power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>This
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> frames as an Objection to himselfe,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> in the pursuit of the
vindication of the Argument under consideration; <hi>Sect.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>Others plead that there's no reason to conceive that true Believers, though they
perpetrate the workes of the flesh, should be excluded from the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon this account; because when they sinne in this kind, they sinne out of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and not out of malice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I was not to choose what Objections M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> should answer, nor
had the framing of them, which he chose to deale withall: and therefore must
be contented with them, as he is pleased to afford them to us; Only if I may
be allowed to speake in this case, and I know I have the consent of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it, I should somewhat otherwise frame this Objection or Answer:be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partly perswaded, that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> did not find it, but framed it himselfe,
into the shape wherein it here appears. I say then, that the Saints of God sin
out of Infirmity only, not malitiously, nor <hi>dedita opera</hi> in coole bloud, nor
with their whole hearts, but purely upon the account of the weakenesse of
their graces, being overpowred by the strength of Temptation, and therefore
cannot so perpetrate the workes of the flesh, and in such a way as must accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59070:200"/>
to the tenour of the Covenant wherein they walke with God, not only
deserve rejection and damnation, but also be Absolutely and Indispensably
exclusive of them, from the Kingdome of God. What Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath
drawne forth to take off, in any measure, the Truth of this Assertion, shall be
considered. He sayes then,</p>
            <p>To say that true Believers, or any other men do perpetrate the workes of the flesh,
out of infirmity, involves a contradiction: For to do the workes of the flesh, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
the dominion of the Flesh in the doers of them, which in sinnes of infirmity
hath no place; the Apostle clearely insinuates the nature of sins of infirmity in that
to the Galatians; Beloved if any man be overtaken with a fault, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) be
prevented, or taken at unawares; when a mans foot is taken in the snare of a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only through a defect of that spirituall watchfulnes over himselfe, &amp; his wayes
which he ought to keepe constantly, and so sinneth contrary to the habituall &amp; stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
frame of his heart, this man sinneth out of iufirmity, but he that thus sinneth
cannot in Scripture phrase be said either to walke, or to live according to the Flesh,
or to do the workes of the Flesh, or to do the Lusts or desires of the Flesh, because none
of these are any where ascribed unto, or charged upon true Believers, but only upon
such persons who are enemies unto God, and Children of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This being the substance of all that is spoken to the businesse in
hand, I have transcribed it at large, that with its Answer it may at once lye
under the Readers view. I say then</p>
            <p>First we give this reason that Believers cannot <hi>perpetrate the workes of the
flesh</hi> in the sence contended about, because they sinne out of insirmity, and do
not say that they so <hi>perpetrate the workes of the flesh out of infirmity.</hi> But if by
perpetrating the workes of the flesh, you intend only the bringing forth at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time, or under any Temptation whatsoever, any fruits of the flesh, such as
every sinne is, that this may not be done out of infirmity, or that it involves a
contradiction to say so, is indeed not to know what you say, to contradict
your selfe, and to deny that there be any sinnes of infirmity at all, which that
there are you granted in the words foregoing, and describe the nature of it in
the words following. They doubtlesse in whom the Flesh alwayes lusteth
against the Spirit are sometimes lead a way and inticed by their owne Lusts,
so as to bring forth the fruits of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If <hi>to do the workes of the flesh,</hi> imports with you, as indeed in it
selfe it doth, the predominancy and dominion of the flesh in them that doe
the workes thereof, we wholly deny that Believers can so do the workes of
the flesh, as upon other Reasons, so partly because they <hi>sinne out of infirmity,</hi>
which sufficiently argues that the Flesh hath not the dominion in them; for
then they should not through Infirmity be captivated to it, but should <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi>
yeild up their <hi>members, as instruments of unrighteousnesse unto sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The description you give of a sinne of infirmity from <hi>Gal</hi> 6. 1. Is
that alone which we acknowledge may befall Believers, though it hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
befallen them in greater sinnes. It is evident from hence, that a sinne
becometh asinne of infirmity, not from the nature of it, but from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of mens falling into it. The greatest actuall sinne, may be a sinne of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
and the least, a sinne of Presumption. It is possible a Believer may
be <hi>overtaken,</hi> or rather <hi>surprised,</hi> with any sinne, so he be <hi>overtaken</hi> or <hi>surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
A surprisall into sinne through the power of Temptation, subtilty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
strength of indewlling sinne, contrary to the habituall standing frame
of the heart, (not alwayes neither through a defect of watchfullnesse) is all
that we grant a Believer may be lyable to: and fo upon Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
he sins only out of infirmity; such sins being not exclusive of the Love and
Favour of God. And therefore</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:59070:200"/>
Fourthly we say that true Believers cannot be said to walke <hi>according to
the flesh,</hi> to do the <hi>workes of the flesh,</hi> to do the <hi>Lusts and desires of the flesh,</hi>
which the Holy Ghost so cautions them against, which as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
are none of them charged upon true Believers, but only such persons
as are enemyes of God, and Children of wrath; so that those expressions hold
out to Believers only what they ought to avoid in the use of the meanes which
God graciously affords them, and do not discover any thing of the will of
God, that he will suffer them, contrary to his many Faithfull Promises to fall
into them. And so the close of this Discourse is contrary to the beginning; M.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> granting that true Believers cannot fall into these sinnes, but only
such as are enemies to God; and yet he hath no way to prove that true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
may cease to be so, but because they may fall into these sinnes, which
that they may do, he here eminently denyes. Wherefore he adds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>If by sinning out of malice they meane sinning with deliberation, with plotting,<note place="margin">§. 37.</note>
and contriving the methods and meanes of their sinning, sinning against Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against the dictates of conscience (and what they should meane by sining out of
malice but sinning upon such tearmes as these I understand not) certaine it is that
true Believers may so sinne out of malice, or at least such as were true Believers
before such sining, and this our Adversaries them selves confesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> All this falles heavy on the shoulders, (as it is supposed) of poore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and yet we think it evident, that God <hi>tooke not his holy Spirit from him,</hi>
but that his <hi>Covenant</hi> continued with him, <hi>ordered in all things and sure,</hi> and
that <hi>sinne had not dominion over him.</hi> The reasons of this perswasion of ours
concerning him, shall farther be insisted on, when we come to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his case in particular, in the meane time I confesse the dreadfnll falls
of some of the Saints of God, are rather to be bewailed than aggravated; and
the riches of Gods Grace in their recovery, to be admired than searcht into:
yet we say,</p>
            <p>First, That no one Believer whatever in the world, upon any temptation
whatever, did fall into any sinne of malice, that is, accompayned with any
<hi>hatred</hi> of God, or despite of his Grace, or whole delight of his will in the sin,
whereunto he was by temptation for a season captivated &amp; though they may
fall into sin, against their judgements &amp; dictates of their consciences, as every
sin whatever, that they have, or may possibly have knowledge of, or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with, in their owne hearts and wayes, is; Yet this doth not make them
to sinne out of <hi>malice;</hi> for that would leave no distinction between sinnes of
infirmity whereinto men are surprised by Temptation, and of Malice. Even sinnes of infirmity being in generall and particular directly contrary to the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates</hi>
of their inlightned, sanctifyed judgements &amp; consciences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for sinning <hi>with deliberation, plotting, and contriving the methods
and meanes of sinning,</hi> (the proofe whereof, that so they may do, will ly as
was before obseved, on the instance of <hi>David</hi>) I say it being the will of God
for ends and purposes knowne to his infinite Wisdome, to give us, as to his
fall, his darke side, and his sinne to the full, with the Temptations wherewith
he was at first <hi>surprised,</hi> and afterward violently hurryed upon carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
and considerations of the state whereinto he had cast himselfe, having
lost his old <hi>friend</hi> and counsellour as to any shines of his countenance for
a season, not acquainting us at all with the frame, and working and striving
of his Spirit, in, and under that fall, I shall not dare to draw his case into a
Rule, that what he then did a Believer now may do, judgeing of his frame in
doing of it, only by what is exprest. That Believers may have <hi>morosam
cogitationem,</hi> or deliberation upon some sinnes, whereunto they are tempted,
upon the strength of indwelling sinne, which may possibly so over come and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59070:201"/>
prevaile against the workings of Grace for a season, as to set the flesh at liberty
to make contrivances to fulfill the lusts thereof (I say) many have granted,
and I shall not (for the sake of poore returning soules, whose backslidings God
hath promised to heale,) deny: but yet I say all their actings in this kinde, are
but like the desperate actings of a man in a feaver, who may have some kind
of contrivance with himselfe to do mischiefe, (as I have known some my selfe)
and aime at opportunityes for the accomplishment of it; all the facultyes of
their foules being discomposed, and rendered unserviceable to them through
their distemper; Through the violence of temptation, &amp; the tumultuating of
lusts, the whole <hi>new man</hi> may be for a season so shattered, &amp; his parts laid out of
the way, as to such a due Answering to another, that the whole may be servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable
to the worke of Faith, (as a disordered army, wherein is all its funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
strength as well as when it is rallied in battalia, is altogether unservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable,
'till it be reduced to order) that sinne taking the opportunity to fill
their corrupt part (as farre as it is corrupt) with its pleasure and desireable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and so to set the thoughts of it on worke to continue meanes for its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment;
Now as through the goodnesse of their Father and supplyes
of Grace, which through the Covenant thereof, they do receive, this distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
seiseth not Believers but rarely &amp; extraordinarily, so it doth no way prove
them to sinne with <hi>malice,</hi> or without <hi>hatred</hi> of, and opposition (secret op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which may be as secret, as some inclinations to sinne are not known
to our selves) to the things they do in and under that condition.</p>
            <p>That which followes in this Section being suited to the apprehension of
some particular men, though of great name and esteeme, according to their
worth and desert in the Church of God, as <hi>Vrsin, Paraeus</hi> and the rest, about
<hi>reigning sinne,</hi> wherein (as I have declared) my thoughts fall not in with them
I shall not need to insist any longer upon it, <hi>Paraeus</hi> after all his aggravations of
the sinnes of Believers, yet adds that they sinne not (nor did <hi>David) ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu
Dei,</hi> but through a <hi>preoccupation</hi> or surprisall of sinne; which I believe
to be the perswasion of far the greatest number of Saints in the world; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is pleased to think or say to the contrary; nor is their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
weakened by <hi>Nathans</hi> charging upon <hi>David, his despising of the
commandement of the Lord.</hi> in doing evill; which as it is virtually done in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sinne, and in great sinnes in an eminent manner, so that it did amount in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
not only to a <hi>consequentiall</hi> but a <hi>formall voluntary</hi> contempt of God, Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> shall never prove. A Father often and severely chargeth upon his
sonnes, a despising of his command, when he hath been carryed out to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
it, when yet he kowes his sonne honoureth and reverenceth him in
his heart, and is exceedingly remote from any resolved contempt of
him.</p>
            <p>The close of all is a concession of the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> at the <hi>Hague</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> 
               <hi>That Believers might fall into such sinnes, as that the Church according to
the Commandement of Christ, must pronounce that they shall no longer abide in her
communion, and that they shall have no part in the Kingdome of Christ;</hi> which
being usually made an argument for the Apostacy of the Saints, I shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how it is here improved by M. <hi>Goodwin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly <hi>(saith he)</hi> their sence was, That true believers may sinne, above the
rate of those, who sinne out of infirmity, in so much as there is no commandement
of Christ, that any Church of his should eject such persons out of their Communion,
who sinne out of infirmity only; so that by the confession of our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
even true Believers may perpetrate such sinnes, which are of a deeper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,
than to be numbred amongst sinnes of infirmity, yea such sinnes, for which
the Church of Christ, according to the Commandement of Christ, stands bound to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59070:201"/>
judge them for ever excluded from the Kingdome of God without repentance; from
whence it undeniably followes, that they may commit such sinnes, whereby their
Faith in Christ will be totally lost, because there is no condemnation unto those that
are by Faith in Jesus Christ, whether they repent or not, and therefore they that
stand in need of Repentance, to give them a right and title to the kingdome of
God, are no sonnes of God by Faith; for were they sonnes, they would be heires also,
and consequently have right and title to the inheritance; so that to pretend that
howsoever the Saints may fall into great and grievous sinnes, yet they shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be renewed againe by Repentance before they dye, though this be an assertion
without any bottome on Reason or Truth, yet doth it no wayes oppose, but suppose
rather a possibility of the totall defection of Faith in true Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, That true Believers may sinne, above the rate of sinnes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
because they may so sinne, as that according to the appointment of
Jesus Christ, they may be cast out of a particular Church, is not attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be proved: M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> think none may be excommunicated
but such as have sinned themselves out of the state of Grace? That a man
may through infirmity, fall into some such sinne, as for it to be amoved from
a Church society, (that a motion being an ordinance of Christ, for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
from that sinne) I know not that it can be reasonably questioned. So
that by our confession, that true Believers may so sinne, as to be righteously
cast out of the externall visible society of a particular Church, doth no way
inforce us to acknowledge that they may sinne above the rate of them, who
are <hi>overtaken</hi> with, or <hi>surprized</hi> in sinne, upon the account of their weaknesse
or infirmity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Church of Christ in rejecting of one from its society, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the appointment of Jesus Christ, is so farre from being obliged to
judge any one <hi>for ever excluded</hi> from the Kingdome of God; that they doe so
reject a man, that he may <hi>never be excluded</hi> from that Kingdome: It is true he
may be <hi>Ecclesiastically</hi> and <hi>Declaratively</hi> excluded from the visible Kingdome
of God, and his right and title to the outward Administration of the good
things thereof; but that such an one is, and must be thought to be <hi>properly</hi>
and <hi>really</hi> excluded from his interest in the Love of God, and grace of the
Convenant, (being still by the appointment of God, and command of Christ,
left under the power of an ordinance, annexed by him, to the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Covenant, it doth not follow.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The non-restauration of persons cast out of communion, by the
Church, to their place in the Kingdome of God, but upon Repentance, holds
proportion with what was spoken before upon exclusion, The Repentance
intended is such, as is necessary for the satisfaction of the Church, as to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressenesse
and being known; yet we grant withall, that all sinnes whatever
without Repentance, in that kind and degree, that is appointed and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God, are exclusive of the Kingdome of God; and we doe much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to the Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. should adde, <hi>whether they repent or
not,</hi> which is not only beyond the sence of what went before, but directly
contrary to that which followes after, <hi>that walke not after the Flesh but after the
Spirit;</hi> not to repent of sin, is, doubtlesse to <hi>walke after the flesh,</hi> and no one of
them who are freed from condemnation in Christ, doth good and sinneth not;
The words we confesse, are not the condition in the intention of God, on
which their non-condemnation is suspended, but yet they are a description
infallible of them, who through Grace are made partakers of it. We say then,
that Believers may so fall, as that being on that account, rejected from the
communion of the Church, so as not to be restored, but upon the evidence of
their Repentance (and we say that Repentance is required for all sinnes, or
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59070:202"/>
men cannot be saved, wondring what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> according to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
intends by the addition to the Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. unlesse it be, that no
man stands in need of Repentance, unlesse he have cast off all Faith and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in God; a most Anti-evangelicall assertion) and yet not commit such sins,
as whereby their Faith must needs be wholly lost.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There's a twofold Right and Title to the Kingdome of God; a
Right and Title by the <hi>profession</hi> of a true Faith to the externall Kingdome of
God, in regard of its outward Administration, and a Right and Title to the
Eternall Kingdome of God by the <hi>possession</hi> of a true Faith in Christ: The
former, as it is taken for <hi>jus in re,</hi> believers may loose for a season; though
they may not in respect of a remote, originall, fundamentall Root which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides;
the latter they never loose, nor forfeite: We say also that repentance
for sinne being a thing promised of God, for those that come to him in Christ,
upon the account of the ingagement of his Grace, for the Perseverance of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
All such <hi>fallers</hi> into sinne, shall certainly return to the Lord by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who heales their back-slidings, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not been able
to disprove; Of whose Arguments, and his endeavours to vindicate them
from exceptions, this is the chiefe.</p>
            <p>But yet there being two or three things,<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is pleased to adde
to what went before, as objections against his doctrine in generall, though
not of this last Arguments concernment, any more than of any others he
makes use of, because there are in them Considerations of good advantage to
the Truth in hand, I shall a little insist upon them, before I proceed with my
intended discourse.</p>
            <p>The First is,<note place="margin">§. 40</note> that the <hi>Doctrine of the Saints Apostacy, maimeth or dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
the Body of Christ, and brings in, an uncouth and unseemely interchange of
members between Christ and the Soule;</hi> which howsoever slighted by M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
is a plea not of the least importance, in the case in hand. The body of
Christ intended, is that <hi>mysticall</hi> and spirituall, not that <hi>Politicall</hi> and <hi>visible;</hi>
His body in respect of the reall union of every <hi>member</hi> of it, unto him as the
<hi>head,</hi> described by the Apostle in its Relation unto him. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 15, 16. It
<hi>growes up unto him, in all things, which is the head, even Christ, from whom the
whole body fitly joyned together, and compacted, by that which every joynt suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
according to the effectuall working in the measure of every part, maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the body unto the edifying of it selfe in Love:</hi> So also <hi>Collos.</hi> 2. 19. the
Body we intend, whereof Christ is the <hi>Head,</hi> is that, not only in a <hi>Politicall</hi>
sence, as the supreame governour of it, but in a Spirituall, according to the
Analogy of an Head Naturall, from whence life, &amp; all influence of it unto the
Members do flow; Of this body, some are in their <hi>Spirits</hi> already <hi>consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and made perfect in Heaven, some are as yet pursuing their Warfare in
all parts of the World, pressing forward to the marke of the high-calling set
before them: Now that any member of his Body, <hi>bone of the bone, flesh of the
flesh of Christ,</hi> given him to make up his fulnesse, and mysticall perfection,
joynted unto him, washed in his bloud, and loved by him, according to the
Love and care of a head to its members, should be plucked off, to be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sire, and after it hath so closely and vitally been admitted into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of his fulnesse and increase, being united to him, become a child of
the Divell, an Enemy to him, and his sometimes fellow members, so as to <hi>hate
his head,</hi> and to be hated of his head (when yet no man ever yet hated his own
flesh) this we suppose no way to answer that inexpressibly intense Love, which
the Lord Jesus beares towards his members, and to be exceedingly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to his honour and Glory, in reference with his dealing to Sathan, the
great enemy of his Kingdome. But to this M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> Answers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:59070:202"/>
               <hi>First, For dismembering the Body of Christ, is it not the Law of Christ himselfe,
in every particular Church, or body of his, that as any of their members putrifie and
discover themselves to be rotten and corrupt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 41.</note> 
               <hi>they should be cut off by the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sword of excommunication, and doth not such a dismembring as this, rather
tend to the honouring &amp; adorning the Body of Christ, than any wayes to maime or
deforme it? And for such a dismembring of the Body of Christ which the Doctrine
in hand supposeth to be causable by the members themselves, by the voluntary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithing
of themselves, through sinne and wickednesse neither is the permission of
this, upon such tearmes as it is permitted, either unworthy Christ, or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Body it selfe.</hi> Reply.</p>
            <p>First that there is no Argument will tolerably arise from what is <hi>practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and comely in a visible Ecclesiasticall Body of Christ, to the Mysticall
Spirituall Body; that is, from a particular visible, to the Catholike Church of
Christ. As to the matter in hand, this is evident by the light of this single con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that in such an Ecclesiasticall body of Christ, there are alwayes or
may be, and Christ himselfe in the rules and Lawes that he hath given for the
government thereof did suppose that there alwayes would be <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi>
true Saints and empty professours; whereas in the Body whereof we treate,
there is no soule actually instated, but who is actually united to the head, by
the inhabitation of the same Spirit. There never was nor shall to eternity,
any dead member be of that Body. They are all living stones, built upon him
who is the Foundation; now surely this is an inference attended with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to be felt, because it may be comely for those to whom the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
of Ordinances in the visible Church of Christ, is committed, to cut of a
dead member, from the membership which he holds by his confession of the
Faith, when he discovers himselfe not to answer the confession he hath made,
in his walking and Conversation; Therefore Christ himselfe, doth cut off, or
on way, or other, loose any living members of his body Mysticall, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by Faith instated in the unity of his Body with him. And if it shall be
objected that even living members and such as are truly so, may yet for, and
at a season, be cut off from a visible particular body of Christ. I Answer,</p>
            <p>1. It is true, they may so, in respect of their ordinary present right to the
enjoyment of Ordinances, not in respect of their remote fundamentall Right
that still abides.</p>
            <p>2. They are so, or may be so, for their amendment, not for their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
That separation for a season being an expression of as much Love and
tendernesse to them in Christ as his joyning of them to the Body was from
whence they are so separated. And</p>
            <p>3. This makes not at all to the impairing of the true compleatnesse of the
mysticall Body of Christ, and the perfection of its parts; for as in particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
bodyes of Christ there may be, and are dead members which have no
place in the body, but are as excressencyes in the vine, and yet the body is not
rendred monstrous by them; so a true member may be removed and
the Body not be maimed in the least. The member though perhaps,
from any such visible body, for a season and yet the true Spirituall
sicke and pineing, continuing a member thereof still; Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of all this that will in any measure agree, to the plucking off a member
from the <hi>Mysticall Body</hi> of Christ, whereof alone we speake. If any should be
so separated, it must not only bee to his present actuall enjoyment of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to the losse of his Spirit also, and with him of all right and title, plea,
or claime whatever, to any interest therein; Neither is it possible that it
should be a meanes for the correction and amendment of such an one; it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a direct tendency to inevitable destruction; separation from all interest
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59070:203"/>
in Christ can looke no other way; so that still the uncouthnesse of such a
procedure abideth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The reason that's added to put some colour and glosse upon
this Assertion. <hi>viz. That such persons as are affirmed to be so separated from the
Body of Christ, do voluntarily disfaith</hi> (as 'tis called) <hi>themselves, is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in hand.</hi> For</p>
            <p>1. The question is about the thing it selfe, whereunto this Answer <hi>de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
is not satisfactory; 'Tis urged by the Argument, that it cannot be allowed
any way, the answer is, tis done this way.</p>
            <p>2. Were Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> desired to explaine unto us the manner how Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
voluntarily do, or may <hi>disfaith</hi> themselves, I suppose he would meet
with no small difficultyes in the undertaking; However this <hi>sounds</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely.</p>
            <p>3.
That they should so <hi>disfaith</hi> themselves, through sinne, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
without being overcome by the temptations of Sathan, and the power
of the enemyes, with whom they have to do and wrestle, doubtlesse will not
be affirmed, whilst they continue in their right witts, and if they loose them,
twill be difficult to manifest how they can voluntarily disfaith them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The state wherein they are described to be by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
and the considerations which for their preservation he allowes them,
should not, me thinkes, suffer him to suppose that of their owne accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
provocations, or temptations, they will wilfully ruine their owne soules.
Now that Believers should by the power of any Temptation, or opposition
whatever, or what affliction soever, arrising against them, be prevailed upon
to the losse of their Faith, and so to their dismembring from Christ, is that
which is objected as an unseemely uncouth thing, which in this Answer Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> earnestly begges, may not be so esteemed, and more he adds not as
yet.</p>
            <p>The following Discourse,<note place="margin">§: 42.</note> wherein he pursues the businesse in hand, is so
<hi>pretty,</hi> as that I cannot but once more present it to the Reader. Saith he,</p>
            <p>As to a politicke or civill corporation, 'tis better that the Governers should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the members respectively to go or be at liberty, that so they may follow their
businesse and occupations in the world, upon the better termes, though by occasion of
this liberty they may behave themselves in sundry kinds very unworthily; than it
would be to keepe them close prisoners though hereby the said inconveniences cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be prevented; in like manner 'tis much better for the Body of Christ, and for
the respective members of it, that he should leave them at liberty to obey and serve
God, and follow the important affairs of their soules, freely and without any Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
necessitation, though some do turne this liberty into wantonnesse, and so into
destruction, than I would be to deprive them of this liberty and to cause and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
them to any course whatsoever out of necessity: though 'tis true, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of much sinne and iniquity would be prevented hereby in many; the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
of the body of Christs Apostles, by the Apostacy of Judas was no dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
either to Christ himselfe, or it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The summe of the whole discourse is, that the Lord Jesus Christ
hath no way to keepe and secure his members to himselfe, that none of them
perish, but by taking away their liberty which rather than do, 'tis more to
his honour to let them abuse it, to their everlasting destruction; &amp; to this end
sundry sine supposalls, are scattered through the whole Discourse. As</p>
            <p>1. That the liberty of Believers, is a liberty to sinne, which they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
to their owne destruction. The Apostle is of an other mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17,
18, 19. <hi>God bethanked that ye were the servants of sinne, but ye have obeyed from
the heart that forme of Doctrine, which was delivered to you; being then made free
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59070:203"/>
from sinne ye became the servants of Righteousnesse &amp;c.</hi> 2. That there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
efficacy of Grace that will certainely fulfill in Believers the good pleasure
of Gods Goodnesse, and bring forth the fruits of an abiding Holinesse, but
what must needs deprive them in whom it is of their liberty: and suitably
hereunto, 3. That God having through Christ made his Saints Spiritually free,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin unto Righteousness, so that with the utmost liberty that they are capable
of as Creatures, they shall surely do good, cannot by his Spirit continue them in
that condition, infallibly without the destruction of their liberty. 4. That the
Spirituall operation of God in, &amp; with the wills of men, induceth a necessitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as to their manner of operation, that they must act on that account, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
&amp; not as free Agents: with such other the like supposals, which are so
many <hi>grosse figments</hi> whereof M. <hi>G.</hi> shall be able to prove no one to Eternity;
For the removeall then of all the fine words here tendered out of our way,
it may suffice to tell their Author, that he who is made <hi>Redemption to his
Saints,</hi> that sets them free from their bondage to sinne, by his Spirit, which is
allwayes accompanied with Liberty, and makes them willing, ready, and free
to Righteousnesse, and Holinesse in the day of his power towards them, whose
effectuall Grace enlargeth and improves all their facultyes, in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with the choicest attendences as to the manner their of working, can, and
doth, by, in, and with the perfect exercise of their liberty, keepe them to
himselfe, in their union, and communion with him for ever. That this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
liberty unto sinne, is a bondage, from which Christ frees his Saints,
neither is any thing that can be imagined more derogatory to the glory of
his Grace, than to affirme, that he cannot keepe those committed to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,
to the end, without depriving them of the liberty which they have
alone through him. Of <hi>Physicall necessitation</hi> enough hath been spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<hi>Judas</hi> was never a member of the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, or of <hi>Christ</hi> in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
whereof we speake. By the body of the Apostles, is intended only
their <hi>number,</hi> of which <hi>Judas</hi> (though he was never of that body whereof they
were members) was one.</p>
            <p>Farther the wickednesse of this Apprehension,<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> that Christ should loose any
of those who are true, and living members of his Mysticall body, is aggravated
upon the accovnt of that state and condition, whereinto he parts with them.
They being thereby made <hi>members of Sathan,</hi> and his Kingdome; God and
the Divell so interchanging Children to the great dishonour and reproach of
his name: to his M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> replyes, in the 28. Section.</p>
            <p>For the interchange of members between Christ and Sathan, the Scripture presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it, as a thing possible, yea as frequent and ordinary, know ye not (saith the
Apostle) that your Bodyes are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot; in the originall it is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. i. e. taking away the members of Christ, shall I
make them, &amp;c. meaning that true Believers who only are the members of Christ
disrelate themselves to him, cease to be members of his body, whilst they live in a
course of whoredome and Adultery, and make themselves members of another far
different relation, <hi>viz.</hi> of those harlots with whom they will fully commit sinne,
and consequently, in such a sence of the Divell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, for the sence of that place of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. As farre
as it relates to the merit of the cause in hand, I shall have occasion to speake
unto it, at large hereafter, &amp; so shall not anticipate my selfe, or Reader; For
the present I deny that there is the least mention made of any <hi>interchange of
members between Christ and the Devill,</hi> much lesse of any such thing as frequent
and ordinary; 'Tis true the Apostle sayes that he that is <hi>joyned to an harlot
makes his members the members of an harlot,</hi> and on that consideration, and

conclusion, with part of the dignity of Believers, whose persons are all the
members of Christ, perswades them from the sinne of Fornication; That they
may so much as fall into that sinne, he doth not here intimate. That men not
only in respect of themselves, and their principles of sinne, and pronenesse
unto it, within, with the prevalency of Temptations, but also eventually,
notwithstanding any regard or respect to other externall prohibiting causes,
may fall into all the sinnes from which they are dehorted, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath
not proved as yet, nor shall I live, to see him do it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for a man to make himselfe the <hi>member of an harlot,</hi> is no more
but to commit Fornication: which whether it be Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Judgement or
no, that none can fall into or be surprised with, but he is <hi>ipso facto</hi> cut of from
the Body of Christ thereby, I know not; Taking in the consideration of what
was spoken before, concerning the manner of Regenerate persons sinning,
with what shall be farther argued, I must professe, I dare not say so; In the
meane time, it is punctually denied, that Believers can fall into, or live in a
course of Whoredome and Adultery, and without such a course, they cease
not according to M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s sence of these words, to be <hi>members of Christ,</hi>
nor doe they otherwise become members of the Divell. There is nothing
here then that intimates such an interchange in the least.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> criticisme upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: it is hardly worth
taking notice of.</p>
            <p>For First, If by <hi>taking,</hi> there be meant <hi>taking away,</hi> the sence must be, that
they are first <hi>taken away</hi> from being members of Christ (the word expressing
a time past in that tendency) and then, made <hi>members of an Harlot:</hi> which
First, is not suited to the mind of M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who endeavours to prove their
ceasing to be members of Christ, by becoming members of an Harlot; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cause of their ceasing to be joyned to Christ, consisting in their being
joyned with an Harlot. And Secondly, destroyes the whole scope of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
reasoning in the place, from the great unworthinesse of such a way, or
practice, as making the <hi>members of Christ,</hi> to be <hi>the members of an Harlot,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none should so be made, but those who had first creased to be members
of Christ; and so his Assertion instead of an effectuall perswasive, should upon
the matter be entangled in a contradiction to it selfe.</p>
            <p>And Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> as there is nothing in the place to inforce that sence of the
<hi>word,</hi> so there is nothing in the <hi>word,</hi> to impose that <hi>sence</hi> upon the place;
When our Saviour speaks to his Disciples <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he
doth not bid them <hi>take nothing away</hi> for their journey, but <hi>take nothing with
them.</hi> And so <hi>Marke</hi> 6. 6. Where his command is, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and
in that of <hi>Math:</hi> 4. 6. When the Divell urged to our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
he did not intimate that the Angells should <hi>take him away</hi> in their hands, but
support him from hurt: when Jesus <hi>Ioh:</hi> 11 41. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: he did not
<hi>take away</hi> his eyes out of his head, and cast them upward, no more then the
Angell did his hand, when <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rev:</hi> 10. 5. or the Apostles
their <hi>voyce,</hi> when <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 24. Nor doth Christ command us
to <hi>take away his yoake,</hi> in that heavenly word of his, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Math:</hi> 11. 29. so that here is little help left to this sence imposed on the place,
under consideration, from the importance of the word, &amp; so consequently not
the least countenance given to that horrible interchange of members between
Christ and the Divell, which is asserted as an usuall and frequent thing.</p>
            <p>What he addeth in the close of the Section,<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> is no lesse considerable than the
beginning of it; for (saith he) <hi>if it be no dishonour to Christ, to take in such as
have been members of the Divell, why should it be any disparagement to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59070:204"/>
such, who by their wicked and abominable wayes render themselves unworthy
of such a Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Believers hold not their Relation to Christ, upon any worthinesse
that is in themselves for it, but upon the account meerely of Grace, according
to the tenour of the Covenant of Mercy. That they may fall into such <hi>wicked
and abominable waies,</hi> as shall render them altogether unmeet for that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to the Law of it, is that great Argument call'd <hi>petitio principii</hi>
which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath used in this case an hundred times. But the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
instituted in the first words is admirable; Confest it is, that 'tis no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to Jesus Christ; yea, that 'tis his great honour, seeing <hi>he came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the workes of the Devill, to bind the strong man, to spoyle his goods, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him that had the power of death, and to deliver them who by reason of
death were in bondage all their dayes, to deliver his people from their sinnes,
washing them in his bloud, and to make them a peculiar people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
zealous of good workes;</hi> that 'tis no dishonour (I say) for him to
translate them from the <hi>power of Sathan, into his own Kingdome,</hi> making them
meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, by redeeming them from their
vaine Conversation, to do according as he intended, and to take his own, given
him of his Father, out of the hands of the Tyrant which held them under
bondage. Therefore having undertaken to keep them and preserve them,
having so overcome Sathan <hi>in them, for them, by them,</hi> broken the <hi>head of the
Serpent,</hi> 'tis no dishonour for him, to loose ground given for his Inheritance,
with his subjects, <hi>members, brethren, children,</hi> bone of his bone, and flesh of his
flesh, into the hand of the Devill againe; what fort is so strong as to hold out
against such a battery? If it be no honour for Christ to bind Sathan, and
to spoile his goods, then 'tis no dishonour for him to be bound by Sathan and to
have his goods spoiled.</p>
            <p>Another burthen upon the shoulders of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Doctrine,<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> whereof he
labours to deliver it, is the great Absurdity of the <hi>Repetition of Regeneration,</hi>
whereof there is no mention at all in the Scripture, and which yet must be
Asserted by him, unlesse he will affirme all that fall away at any time irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to perish; which howsoever he waves at present, were with much more
probability according to his owne principles, to be maintained, than what he
insisteth on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this repetition of Regeneration</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not unworthy God, and for men
a blessed and happy accommodation;</hi> whether it be <hi>unworthy God</hi> or no, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the nature of the thing will declare. The <hi>Accomodation</hi> that it seemes
to afford unto men, being a plaine incouragement to sinne at the highest rate
imaginable, will perhaps not be found so Happy and Blessed unto them. With
great noise and clamour, hath a charge been managed against the Doctrine of
the Saints <hi>Perseverance,</hi> upon the account of its giving supportment to the
thoughts of men, in and under the wayes of sinne; whether Truth and
Righteousnesse have been regarded in that charge, hath been considered.
Doubtlesse it were a matter of no difficulty, clearely to evince that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Repetition of Regeneration,</hi> is of the very same tendency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
which is falsly and injuriously charged upon that of the Perseverance of
the Saints; The worst that a man thinks he can do by any act of sin, is but to
sin himselfe quite out of the favour of God, into a state of death, and desert of
wrath. He can no farther injure his soule, than to cast it into the condition of
men by nature; Tell this man, now, whom you suppose to be under the
temptation to sinne, at least that he hath in him that great <hi>foole the flesh</hi> which
longs for <hi>Blessed Accommodations</hi> to its selfe, whilest it makes provision to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
its lusts, that if he should so do, this is an ordinary thing for men to do,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59070:205"/>
and yet to be renewed againe and to have a <hi>Second Regeneration;</hi> do you not
incourage him to venture boldly to satisfy his sinfull desires, having such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
against the worst that his thoughts and feares can suggest to him?</p>
            <p>But whatever it be in respect of God or men, yet that so it may be Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> proves from. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. Where 'tis said, <hi>that 'tis impossible to renew
some to repentance,</hi> wherefore some may be renewed; and in <hi>Jude</hi> 12. Men are
said to be <hi>twice dead,</hi> therefore they may live twice Spiritually; The first
proofe seemes somewhat uncouth. The persons spoken of in that place are in
M. G. judgement <hi>Believers;</hi> there is no place of Scripture wherein he more try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
in his endeavoured confirmation of his <hi>Thesis.</hi> The Holy Ghost says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that 'tis impossible to renew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therefore says M.G. 'tis possible;
what is of <hi>emphasis</hi> in the Argument mentioned ariseth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two things. 1. That
they are true Believers of which afterwards. 2. That they fall totally away;
This then is the importance of M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> plea, from this place, <hi>If true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
fall totally away, it is impossible they should be renewed to Repentance,
therefore if true Believers fall totally away, it is possible they should be renewed to
and by Repentance;</hi> that there is a falling away, and a renewing againe by
Repentance of the same persons, we grant. That falling away is partiall only,
which is incident unto true Believers, who, when God heales their backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
are renewed by Repentance. To be <hi>renewed</hi> also by <hi>Repentance,</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
either for the <hi>renovation of our Natures,</hi> and our change as unto state and
condition, and so it is the same with Regeneration and not to be repeated; or
for a Recovery by Repentance in respect of <hi>personall failings,</hi> so it is the daily
worke of our lives. <hi>Jude</hi> saies, some are <hi>twice dead;</hi> that is, utterly so, <hi>an hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall</hi>
expression to aggravate their condition. Those to whom the Gospell
is a <hi>favour of Death unto Death,</hi> may well be said to be <hi>twice dead;</hi> unto the
Death that they are involved in, and are obnoxious to by nature, they adde
a second death, or rather, seale up their soules under the power and misery of
the other, by contempt of the means of Life and recovery; therefore Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may be reiterated: <hi>Quod erat Demonstrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much of the Section that remains, is taken up, in declaring in many words
without the least attempt of proofe, that 'tis agreeable to the honour of God,
to renew men totally fallen away; that is, when those who have been <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
by him, washt in the bloud of his Sonne, made partakers of the <hi>Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
imbrac'd in the armes of his Love, shall despise all this, <hi>dis-faith</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
reject the Lord and his Love, trample on the bloud of the Convenant,
kill their soules, by depriving them of spirituall life, proclaime to all the
world, their dislike of him, and his Covenant of Grace; yet though he hath
not any where revealed, that he will permit any one so to doe, or that he will
accept of them againe, upon their so doing; yet M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirming that for
him so to doe, is agreeable to his Holinesse and Righteousnesse, 'tis fit that
those who conceive themselves bound to believe what ever he saies, should
think so too; for my part I am at liberty.</p>
            <p>I should not farther pursue this discourse, nor insist on this digression, but
that M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath taken advantage by the mention of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
some rare notions of the nature of it, which deserve a little our farther
taking notice of, for which end doubtlesse he published them. To make way
then for his intendment, he informes us (<hi>Sect:</hi> 29.) <hi>That Regeneration it selfe,
according to the Grammaticall and proper signification of the word imports a rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
or repetition of some generation or other; it cannot import a Repetition of
the naturall all Generation of men; the sence of Nicodemus in this poynt was Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
who judged such a thing impossible, therefore it must import a repetition of a
spirituall generation, unlesse we shall say (which I think is the road opinion) that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59070:205"/>
it signifies only the spirituall generation with a kind of reflection upon, and unto
the birth Naturall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, That the <hi>Grammaticall</hi> sence of the word imports a <hi>Reiteration
of some generation,</hi> is only said; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath other signification in composition,
besides the intimating of a reiteration of the same thing: either <hi>in specie,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually,</hi>
the same againe; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> would seeme rather to inforce such
an Interpretation, than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which yet it doth not: It is spoken of that
which hath no birth properly at all, as <hi>Philo de Mundo,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
of it selfe is only <hi>through,</hi>

                  </gap>,
Resurrection,</hi> doth not import againe, after another rising before, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
from a lost state; so is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> used <hi>Math:</hi> 19. 28. to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
is to have a new, and another generation, not any one repeated; In the
place mentioned of <hi>John</hi> by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> there is mention neither of a <hi>repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a former generation,</hi> nor directly of a new one: Though it be so, it is
not there called so; our Saviour at first saies, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unlesse a man
be borne from above:</hi> as the word is elsewhere rendred, and properly signifies,
as <hi>Iohn 3. 31. %Iohn 19. 11. %Mark. 15. 38. %Iames</hi> 3. 17. and sometimes of old
or former daies, as <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 5. once only, it signifies <hi>againe, Gal:</hi> 4. 9. but there
joyned with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which restraines it. And in the exposition afterwards of
what he intended by that Expression, he calls it simply a being borne of the
<hi>water &amp; the spirit, v.</hi> 5. without the least intimation of the <hi>repetition</hi> of any
birth; but only the asserting of a new spirituall one; called a <hi>birth</hi> indeed,
with allusion to the birth Naturall, which is the road opinion, well beaten e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since Christ first trod that path. Besides, the very same thing which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
under the name of Regeneration, being a spirituall birth, which a man
had not before, is also delivered unto us in such words, and termes, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
no <hi>reiteration</hi> of any state, condition, or thing to be included therein;
as <hi>Conversion</hi> to God, a <hi>Quickning</hi> from death, <hi>Sanctification</hi> by the spirit, &amp;c.
all which manifest the induction of a new Life and forme, and not the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of another; hence the ancients called <hi>Baptisme,</hi> Regeneration; being
the initiall ordinance of Christianity, and expressive of the new life, which in,
and through Christ, we receive; and that from <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Regeneration then
neither in the import of the word, nor in the nature of the thing, doth require
a <hi>reiteration</hi> of any generation, but only the addition of a new one, to that
which a man hath before; and whereunto this doth allude. The receiving of
a new spirituall Birth and Life, is our <hi>Regeneration, Renovation, Resurrection,
Quickning,</hi> implanting into Christ, and the like: so that the foundation of all
the ensuing discourse, is a meere <hi>quagmire,</hi> where no firme footing can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
and of the same Nature is that which ensues; <hi>It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sence of Divines, that the two generations mentioned, the Naturall and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
are</hi> membra dividentia, <hi>and contra-distinguished the one unto the other; and
so the Apostle Peter too seemes to state and represent them; as also our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
Ioh: 3. 6. %Now there can hardly any instance be given, where the introducing
of one contrary forme or quality into the Subject, is termed a reiteration, or repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the other; Calefaction (for example) is never termed a repetition of Frige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
nor Calefaction called a reiteration of Frigefaction; nor when a Regenerate
or mortifyed man dyeth his naturall death, is he said to reiterate or repeat his
Spirituall death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans,</hi> That in the terme <hi>Regeneration two births</hi> are implyed, may be
granted: that the same is intimated to be repeated, is denyed: and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at all; And therefore Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> sayes well, that the <hi>introducing of a
contrary forme,</hi> is not called the reiteration of an other, no more is it here;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59070:206"/>
our new birth is called our Regeneration, or new generation, in allusion to
our naturall birth, not as a repetition of it, neither is the Allusion in respect
of the contrary qualityes wherewith the one, and the other are attended, but
in respect of the things themselves, in which regard, as they are not the same,
so they are not <hi>contrary</hi> but <hi>diverse.</hi> They are both births, the one <hi>Naturall</hi>
the other <hi>Spirituall;</hi> Naturall and Spirituall in that sence are not <hi>contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes,</hi>
but <hi>diverse adjuncts;</hi> and so are the two births compared, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 13. In which last place our Regeneration is exprest under the simple
terme of being borne, with distinction to the naturall birth, and not the least
intimation of the iteration of any birth or Generation subjoyned; so also is it
<hi>Iames</hi> 1. 18. so that hitherto little progresse is made by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> towards
his intendment whatever it be; thus then he expresseth it.</p>
            <p>I rather (<hi>saith he</hi>) conceive that Regeneration which the Scripture makes appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
only unto persons living to yeares of discretion,<note place="margin">§. 48.</note> who generally in the dayes of
their youth, degenerate from the innocency of their childhood &amp; younger yeares, and
corrupt themselves with the principles &amp; wayes of the world, relates not to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
generation as such, I meane, as naturall, but unto the Spirituall estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of men in respect of their Naturall generation and birth, in and upon which
they are if not simply &amp; absolutely yet comparatively, innocent, harmeles, free from
pride and malice; and inrespect of these qualifications, in Grace and favour with
God, upon the account of the death and sufferings of Christ for them, as we shall
afterwards prove.</p>
            <p>Here you have the summe of the designe, and the <hi>Doctrine of Regeneration</hi>
cleared from all those vaine and erroneous opinions, wherewith it hath so
long been clouded. It is, the returning of men into the <hi>good state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
wherein they are borne, after they have degenerated into waies of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
we thought it had been the quickening of them, who are by nature
<hi>dead in trespasses and sinnes,</hi> their being begotten againe <hi>by the will of God,</hi> the
bestowing of a new principle of Spirit and Life upon them, a Translation
from Death to Life, the opening of blind eyes, making them who were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to be light in the Lord. It seemes we have all this while been in the
darke, and that Regeneration indeed, is only a returning to that condition
from whence we thought it had been a delivery; but let us a little see the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of this new notion of Regeneration.</p>
            <p>First, (he saith) the <hi>Scripture makes it appropriable only to them who come to
yeares of discretion.</hi> Sir, your proofe; we cannot take your bare word in a
thing of this importance. In the place your selfe chose to mention, as the
foundation you laid of the inferences you are now making, our Saviour saies,
tis a being <hi>borne of the spirit;</hi> doth the Scripture make this appropriable only
unto men of discretion? Men only of discretion then can enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God; for none, <hi>not so borne of the Spirit shall enter therein Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. If
none but men of discretion can be borne of the Spirit, then infants have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
birth but only that of the flesh; and that <hi>which is borne of the flesh is flesh,
v.</hi> 6. Not capable of entring into the Kingdome of heaven; surely you better
deserve the title of <hi>durus pater infantum,</hi> than He to whom of old 'twas given;
perhaps a grosser figment was never framed by a <hi>man of Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is true, Infants are comparatively innocent, in respect of <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Transgressions</hi> but <hi>equally nocent</hi> and guilty with Sinners of discretion, in
respect of naturall state and condition. They are no lesse obnoxious to that
death, from whence our Regeneration is a delivery, by the bestowing of a new
Spirituall life, than a sinner of an hundred yeares old; A returning to this
condition, it seemes, is Regeneration. <hi>Quantum est in rebus inane!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The qualifications of Infants not Regenerated, are meerely nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59070:206"/>
and that in respect of the acts of sinne, not the habituall seed and root of
them; for in them <hi>dwells no good;</hi> that in respect of these qualifications of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
that are in them by nature Antecedent to any Regeneration (all
which are resolved into a Naturall impotency of perpetrating sinne) they
are accepted in Grace and favour with God, had been another new notion,
had not <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> before you fallen upon it; without <hi>Faith it is
impossible to please God Heb.</hi> 11. 6. And his wrath <hi>abides on them that Believe
not. Iohn</hi> 3. 36. That Infants have or may have Faith, and not be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
will scarcely be granted by them who believe the Spirit of Christ to
cause Regeneration where he is bestowed <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. And all Faith to be the
Fruit of that Spirit; <hi>Gal</hi> 5. 26, 27. Farther for the qualifications of Infants
by Nature; how are they brought <hi>cleane,</hi> from that which is <hi>uncleane?</hi> Are
they not conceived in sinne and brought forth in iniquity? Or was that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
hard case alone? If they are borne of the flesh, and are flesh, if they are
uncleane, how come they to be in that estate, upon the account of their
Qualifications accepted in the Love and favour of him, who is of purer eyes
than to behold iniquity? If this be the Doctrine of Regeneration that M. <hi>G.</hi>
preaches I desire the Lord to blesse them that belong unto him, in a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from attending thereunto. Of the Effects of the death of Christ, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of all children I shall not now treat; That they should be saved by Christ
not washed in his Bloud, not sanctifyed by his Spirit, (which to be is to be
Regenerate,) is another new notion of the new Gospell.</p>
            <p>The Countenance which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> would begge to his Doctrine, from
that of our Saviour to his Disciples, <hi>Except ye be turned and become as little
Children ye cannot enter into the Kingdome of God;</hi> reproving their ambition
and worldly thoughts from which they were to be weaned that they might
befit for that Gospell state &amp; imployment whereunto he called them, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were to serve him, does no more advantage him nor the cause he hath
undertaken, than that other caution of our Saviour to the same persons to be
<hi>wise asserpents &amp; innocent as Doves,</hi> would do him that should undertake to
prove that Christians ought to become <hi>pigeons</hi> or <hi>snakes:</hi> Thus much then we
have learned of the mind of M. <hi>G.</hi> by this digression; 1. That no <hi>children are
Regenerate; 2. That they are all accepted with God through Christ,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the good Qualifications that are in them; 3. <hi>That Regeneration is a
mans returing to the state wherein he is borne;</hi> And having taken out this
Lesson, which we shall never learne <hi>by heart</hi> whilst we live, we may now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>I
shall only adde to the maine of the businesse in hand,<note place="margin">§. 49.</note> that so long as a man
is a child of God, he cannot, he need not to repeat his Regeneration. But
that one who hath been the child of God, should cease to be the child of God,
is somewhat strange. How can that be done amongst men? that he should
cease to be such a mans sonne, who was his sonne? Those things that stand
in Relation, upon any thing that is past, and therefore irrevocable, cannot
have their beings continued, and their Relation dissolved; it is impossible but
that cause and effect must be related one to another; such is the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Father and Sonne; The foundation of it is an act past and irrevocable,
and therefore the Relation it selfe is indissoluble; Is it not so with God and
his Children; when they once stand in that Relation, it cannot be dissolved.
But of these things hitherto.</p>
            <p>To proceed with that place of Scripture which I laid as the foundation of
this discourse.<note place="margin">§. 50.</note> The generall way of <hi>Lusts</hi> dealing with the soule the <hi>bringing
forth of sinne,</hi> whereof there are two acts expressed, v. 14. the one of <hi>drawing
away,</hi> the other inticing, is to be insisted on. Upon the <hi>first,</hi> the person <hi>tempted</hi>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:59070:207"/>
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>drawn off,</hi> or <hi>drawne away;</hi> and upon the <hi>second</hi> he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>inticed,</hi> or <hi>intangled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First stirring of <hi>sinne</hi> is to <hi>draw away</hi> the soule from what it ought to
be fixed upon, by its rising up irregularly to some delightfull object. For a
man to be <hi>drawne away by his lust,</hi> is to have his Lust drawne <hi>out</hi> to some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
suited to it, wherein it delighteth. Now this <hi>drawing away,</hi> denoteth two
things.</p>
            <p>1. The turning of the soule from the actuall rectitude of its frame to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God. Though the soule cannot alwayes be in actuall Exercise of
Grace towards God, yet it ought alwayes to be in an immediate readinesse to
any Spirituall duty, upon the account whereof, when occasion is administred,
it doth as naturally goe forth to God, as a vessell full of water floweth forth
when vent is given unto it. Hence we are commanded to <hi>pray alwayes.</hi> Our
Saviour giveth a Parable to instruct his Disciples, that they ought to <hi>pray</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. And we are commanded to <hi>pray</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>without ceasing
or intermission, 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hess.</hi> 5. 17. Which the same Apostle in an other place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
praying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in every place:</hi> namely as occasion is administred. It is
not the perpetuall exercise of this duty (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> some of them have ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
interpreted the first Psalme of <hi>reading the Law day and night</hi>) which
would shut out and cut off all other dutyes, not only of mens Callings and
Employments as to this Life, but all other dutyes of the wayes &amp; worship of
God whatever; But it is only the <hi>readinesse</hi> and promptitude of the heart in its
constant frame to that necessary duty, that is required; Now he who is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
by lust, is drawne off from this frame; that is, he is interrupted in it
by his lust, diverting unto some sinfull object. And as to this particular, there
is a great difference betwixt the sinning of Believers, and those who arise not
beyond that height which the power of Conviction beareth them oftentimes
up unto. For</p>
            <p>1. The maine of a true Believers <hi>watching</hi> in his whole life,<note place="margin">§: 51.</note> and in the
course of his walking with God, is directed against this <hi>off-drawing</hi> from that
habituall frame of his heart by lust and sinne. His great businesse is, as the
Apostle telleth us, to <hi>take the whole armour of God to him,</hi> that sinne if it be
possible, may make no approach to his soule. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13. It is to keepe up their
spirits to a <hi>hate of every evill way and to delight in God continually;</hi> and because
they cannot attaine in this life unto perfection, they <hi>cry out</hi> of the power of sin
leading them <hi>captives</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> thereof. They would have their wills dead
to sinne, wholly dead, and have trouble that they are not so, as to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
frame of of their spirits how oft so ever they be drawne off. For other
persons they have <hi>truly</hi> no such frame at all, whatever they may be cut into
the likenesse of, by the sharpnesse of Scripturall convictions that come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and therefore they watch not, as to the keeping of it. The deeper
you dive into them, the more neere you come to their hearts, the worse they
are: their very inward parts is wickednesse, I speak now of the ordinary frame
of the one and other.</p>
            <p>This <hi>drawing of</hi> by sinne in Believers, is by the <hi>power</hi> of sinne, in opposition
to their <hi>Will.</hi> Their wills lye against it to the utmost: thev <hi>would</hi> not (as was
shewed,) be so drawne off. But as for the others as hath been shewen, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their minds may be <hi>inlightned,</hi> and their consciences <hi>awakned,</hi> and
their Affections <hi>corrected</hi> and restrained, their wills are wholly dead in
sinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when a man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>drawne away</hi> there are stricken out
between the lust and the pleasing object, some glances of the heart, with
thoughts of sinne. When lust hath gon thus farre, if a violent temptation fall
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59070:207"/>
in, the person to whom it doth so befall, may be carryed, or rather <hi>hurried</hi>
out and surprized into no small advance towards the perpetration of sinne,
without the least delight in the sinne or consent of the <hi>will</hi> unto it, if he be
a godly man. So was it in the case of <hi>David</hi> in the cutting of the lap of the
garment of <hi>Saul.</hi> Lust stirred in him, drew him off from his frame of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on God, and by the advantage of <hi>Sauls</hi> presence stirred up thoughts of
selfe-security, and advantage in him, which carryed him almost to the very
act of sinne, before he recovered himselfe. Then (<hi>I say</hi>) is a man <hi>drawn away,</hi>
not only in respect to the <hi>Terme from whence,</hi> but also of <hi>that whereunto,</hi> when
the thoughts of the object presented as suitable to lust are cast in, though
immediately rejected. This I intend by this acting of sinne; Which although
it be our sinne, as having its rise and spring in us, and is continually to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
yet when it is not accompaned with any <hi>delight</hi> of the Heart or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the <hi>Will,</hi> but the thought of it, is like a piece of fiery iron cast into
water which maketh a sudden commotion or noise, but yet is suddenly
quenched, it is that which regenerate men are, &amp; may be subject to; which also
keepeth them humble all their dayes. There is more in this drawing away,
than a single thought or apprehension of evill amounts to, (which may be
without the least sinne. <hi>To know evill is not evill</hi>) but yet is short of the soules
consent unto it.</p>
            <p>The second way wherein lust proceedeth in tempting is by inticing the soule,<note place="margin">§: 53.</note>
&amp; he who is so dealt withallby it is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be <hi>inticed.</hi> There is
something more in <hi>this,</hi> than in being only <hi>drawn away.</hi> The word here used
is twice mentioned in the 2 <hi>Epistle of Peter 2 chapter.</hi> Once it is rendred to
<hi>beguile</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>v.</hi> 14. And in the other <hi>alluring v.</hi> 18. It
commeth (as is commonly known) from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>bait,</hi> which is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>deceit,</hi> because the end of a <hi>bait</hi> is to <hi>deceive,</hi> &amp; to catch by deceiving.
Thence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to <hi>intice,</hi> to <hi>allure,</hi> to <hi>intangle,</hi> as men do <hi>fishes,</hi> and <hi>birds</hi>
with baits. That which by this expression the Holy Ghost intendeth, is the
prevalency of <hi>Lust</hi> in drawing the soule unto that, which is by the Casuists
termed <hi>Delectatio morosa,</hi> a <hi>secret delight</hi> in the evill, <hi>abiding</hi> some space
upon it. So that it would do that which it is tempted and <hi>inticed</hi>
unto, were it not forbidden; as the <hi>fish</hi> liketh the <hi>bait</hi> well enough, but is
affraid of the <hi>Hooke.</hi> The soule for a season is captivd to <hi>like</hi> the sinne, and
so is under the power of it, but is affraid of the guilt. It sticketh only at this,
<hi>how shall it do this great thing and sinne against the Lord.</hi> Now though the
mind never frame any intention of fulfilling the evill, wherewith the soule is
thus <hi>intangled,</hi> or of committing that sinne whereunto it is <hi>allured</hi> and <hi>inticed,</hi>
yet the affections having been <hi>cast</hi> into the <hi>mould</hi> of sin for a season, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto it by delight, (which is the conformity of the affections to the
thing delighted in) This is an high degree of sin; and that because it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to that <hi>death unto sin,</hi> and the <hi>crucifying of the flesh and the lusts
thereof,</hi> which we are continually called unto. It is in a sence, a making <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof: provision</hi> is <hi>made</hi> though the flesh
be not suffered to <hi>feed</hi> thereon, but only delight it selfe with beholding of
it:</p>
            <p>I shall not deny but this also may befall a true Believer,<note place="margin">§. 54.</note> it being <hi>chiefely</hi>
implyed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. But yet with wide difference, from the condition of other
persons, in their being under the power of the deceits and <hi>beguilements</hi> of sin.
For first this neither doth nor can grow to be the <hi>habituall</hi> frame of their
hearts; because as the Apostle telleth us <hi>they are dead to sinne and cannot live
any longer therein Rom.</hi> 6. 2. And, <hi>their old man is crucified with Christ that the
body of sinne might be destroyed, v.</hi> 6. Now though a man should abst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59070:208"/>
from all actuall sinnes or <hi>open committing</hi> of sinne all his dayes, yet if he have
any <hi>habituall delight in sinne,</hi> and defileth his soule with <hi>delightfull contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations</hi>
of sinne, he <hi>liveth</hi> to sinne, and not to God, which a Believer cannot
do, for he is <hi>not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> To abide in this state, is to
<hi>weare the garment spotted with the flesh.</hi> But now take another Person, however
heightned, and wrought up by <hi>convictions,</hi> unlesse it be when Conscience
is stirred up, and some affrightment is put upon him, he can as his leisure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,
give his heart the swing in inordinate affections, or what else pleaseth &amp;
suiteth his state, condition, temper and the like.</p>
            <p>2. A Believer is exceedingly troubled, upon the account of his being at
any time <hi>led captive to the power of sinne</hi> in this kind; and the review of the
frame of his spirit, wherein his affections were by <hi>delight</hi> conformed to any
sinne, is a matter of sore trouble and deep humiliation to him I am of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
mind, <hi>De Nup-Concupis. Cap.</hi> 8: that it is this <hi>perpetrating of sinne,</hi> and not
the actuall committing of it, which the Apostle complaineth of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Two
things perswade me hereunto. First, That it is the <hi>ordinary course</hi> and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a regenerate man, that <hi>Paul</hi> describeth in that place; and not his <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
falls and failings, under great and extraordinary temptations. This
is evident from the whole manner of his discourse, and scope of the place.
Now <hi>ordinarily,</hi> through the grace of God, the Saints doe not <hi>doe outwardly,</hi>
and <hi>Practically,</hi> the <hi>things they would not;</hi> that is, commit sinne actually, as to
the outward act; but they are <hi>ordinarily</hi> only swayed to this <hi>intanglement,</hi> by
the <hi>baits</hi> of sinne. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the <hi>sole worke</hi> of <hi>Indwelling sinne,</hi> that the
Apostle there describeth, as it is in its selfe, and not as it is advantaged by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Temptations, in which it carrieth not Believers out to actuall sinnes, as
to such <hi>accomplishment</hi> of them, which is their state in respect of great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
only. It is then I say the great burthen of their soules, that they have
been in their affections at any time dealing with the baits of sinne, which
causeth them to <hi>cry out</hi> for helpe, and filleth them with a perpetuall selfe-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency
and condemnation.</p>
            <p>3. In such <hi>surprisalls</hi> of sinne, although the Affections may be insnared,
and the judgement, and Conscience by their tumultuating, dethroned for a
season, yet the <hi>Will,</hi> still maketh head against sinne in Believers, and crieth
out, that whether it <hi>will</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> it is <hi>captived,</hi> and violently overborne, calling
for reliefe, like a man <hi>surprized</hi> by an enemy. There is an <hi>active renitency</hi> in
the Will, against the sinne, whose <hi>bait</hi> is exposed to the Soule, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is <hi>inticed, allured,</hi> or <hi>intangled;</hi> when of all the faculties of the Soule,
if any thing be to be done in any act of sinne in <hi>Unregenerate</hi> men, the <hi>will</hi> is
the ringleader. Conscience may grumble, and Judgement may plead, but the
Will runneth headlong to it. And thus farre have I (by way of digression) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the difference there is, betwixt Regenerate and Unregenerate men,
as to the root and foundation of sinne, as also to their ordinary walking: what
is farther added by the Apostle, in the two following degrees, in the place
mentioned, because thence also may some light be obtained to the businesse
in hand, shall be briefely insisted on.</p>
            <p>The next thing in the <hi>Progresse</hi> of sinne,<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> is Lusts <hi>conceiving.</hi> When it hath
turned <hi>off</hi> the heart from its Communion with God, or consideration of its
duty, and <hi>intangled</hi> or hampered the Affections, in delight with the sinfull
object proposed, prevailing with the soule to dwell with some <hi>complacency</hi>
upon the thoughts of sinne, it then falleth to <hi>conceiving;</hi> that is, it <hi>warmes, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
cherisheth</hi> thoughts and delights of the sinne entertained, untill it so
farre prevaile upon the will, (in them in whose wills there is an opposition
unto it) that being wearied out with the sollicitations of the flesh, it giveth
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59070:208"/>
over its power, as to its actuall predominant exercise, and sensibly dissenteth
not, from the sinne whereunto it is tempted. That this may sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
a Regenerate Person, I have granted before, and what is the difference
herein betwixt them, and Unregenerate persons, may be collected from what
hath been already delivered.</p>
            <p>Of the next step of sinne,<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> which is, its <hi>bringing forth,</hi> or the actuall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the sinne <hi>so conceived</hi> as above expressed, there is the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it bringeth out</hi> of its wombe, the Child of sinne, which it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
it is the <hi>actuall perpetration</hi> of sinne formerly consented unto, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
under this <hi>Metaphor.</hi> I have little to adde upon this head, to what was
formerly spoken. For,</p>
            <p>1. As they are not the <hi>sinnes of daily infirmities</hi> that are here intended, in
the place of the Apostle under consideration, but such as lye in an immediate
tendency unto Death, as to their eminent guilt; as also being the fruit of the
hearts conception of sinne, by fomenting and warming thoughts of sinne,
with delight, untill consent unto it be prevalent in the soule, so falls of this
nature in the Saints, are <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and alway attended with their <hi>losse of
peace,</hi> the <hi>weakeneng</hi> of their Faith, <hi>wounding</hi> of their soules, and obnoxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
without Repentance unto death. God indeed, hath provided better
things for them, but for themselves, they have done their endeavour, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their own soules.</p>
            <p>2. That God never suffereth his Saints to fall thus, but it is for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of some very glorious end of his, in their afflictions, trialls, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
humiliation, which he will bring about. These ends of God are many
and various: I shall not enter into a particular discourse concerning them.</p>
            <p>3. That an <hi>impenitent continuance in,</hi> and <hi>under</hi> the guilt of such a sinne,
is a sore signe of an heart, that neither hath, nor ever had any true faith. In
others, there is a truth of that of <hi>Austin,</hi> who affirmed, that he dared say, that
it might be good for some, to have fallen into some eminent particular sinne,
for their humiliation and caution all their daies.</p>
            <p>4. That this frequent <hi>conception</hi> of sinne, and bringing of it forth, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who have been heightned by conviction to a great regularity of walking
and conversation, is the means, whereby they doe goe forth unto that which
is mentioned in the last place; which is <hi>finishing of sinne;</hi> that is, so to be
brought under the power of it, as to compleate the whole worke of sinne.
Now men <hi>bring it forth</hi> by the temptations, and upon the surprisalls fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
but they that come to finish it, or doe the worke of it, in them it
will bring forth death. This I take to be the intendment of that expression,

to doe any one act which the Law requireth, but to walke studiously, and
constantly, according to the rule thereof: and so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the Apostle useth
it <hi>Philip:</hi> 1. 6. where we translate it, as here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. To <hi>perfect the good
worke,</hi> is to walke in the way of Grace, and the Gospell, unto the end. So to
<hi>perfect sinne,</hi> is to <hi>fulfill the worke of sinne,</hi> and to walke in the way of sinne,
to be under the dominion and reigne of sinne so far, as to be carried out in a
<hi>course of sinning;</hi> and this is that alone, which we exempt Believers from;
which that they are exempted from, unto all that hath formerly been spoken,
I shall adde the consideration of one place of Scripture, being turned aside
from my thoughts of handling this at large, as the second part of the Doctrine
of the <hi>Saints Perseverance,</hi> the former being grown under my hands, beyond
expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:59070:209"/>
Now this place is, the I <hi>Iohn 3. 9. Whatsoever is borne of God, doth not commit
sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 57.</note> 
               <hi>for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sinne because he is borne of
God.</hi> A place of Scripture, that alway hath <hi>amazed</hi> the adversaries of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which hitherto through the Grace of God, we have asserted; being in
its selfe, fully sufficient to captivate every understanding, unto the obedience
of its Truth, that is not resolved to cleave to a contrary Conclusion, let what
Demonstration soever lye against it. In the defence of the Doctrine under
consideration, should we use Expressions of the same importance, with these
here used by the Apostle, as we should abundantly satisfye our selves, that we
had delivered our mindes and sence, to the understanding of any indifferent
Person, with whom we might have to doe, so we should by no meanes, avoid
all those imputations of folly and errour, that our Doctrine suffereth under,
from the men that have entertained an enmity against it, as it is held forth
in equivalent expressions by us. The Authority of the Holy Ghost, hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thus much upon our Adversaries, that when he asserteth in expresse, and
expressive termes, the very thing, or things that in us are called <hi>folly,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
should be studied, and pains taken to rack his words, to a sence which
they will not beare, rather than plainly to deny his Authority. But let the
words, with the scope &amp; tendency be considered. (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.) The scope &amp; intendment
of the Apostle in the place is to give a <hi>discriminating character</hi> of the Children
of God, and the Children of the Divell; thus he fully expresseth himselfe unto
us v. 10. <hi>In this</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Children of God are manifested, and the Children
of the Divell, whosoever doth not righteousnesse is not of God, neither he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not his Brother.</hi> And withall to presse on an Exhortation against sinne,
whereunto he useth the Argument that lieth in the following words. <hi>If any one
sin that thinketh himselfe to be borne of God, he deceiveth himselfe.</hi> v. 7. <hi>Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
let no man deceive you; he that doth righteousnesse, is righteous even as he is
righteous, He that committeth sinne is of the Divell:</hi> But how proveth he this?
In these words, <hi>Whosoever is borne of God sinneth not, doth not, cannot sinne. Such
is the Genius and Nature of the Children of God, of them that are borne of him,</hi>
that they doe not, they cannot sinne. You are perswaded that you are so
borne of God, therefore you must presse after such a frame, such an <hi>ingenie</hi>
and disposition, such a principle, as that thereby you cannot sinne: it must
manifest its selfe to be in you, if you be the Children of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now whereas it is offered by M.</hi> Goodwin <hi>Cap. 10. Sect: 27. pag.</hi> 194.<note place="margin">§. 58.</note> That
the context, or scope of the whole place, doth not invite such an Exposition as is
usually insisted on, because (<hi>saith he</hi>) the intent and drift of the Apostle from verse
3. even to the end of the Chapter (as he that doth but runne the context over may
reade) is not to shew or argue, Whether the sonnes of God, may possibly in time so
degenerate, as to live sinnefully, and dye impenitently, but to evince this, that these
who claime the great honour &amp; priviledge of being the Children of God, cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
or make good this claime neither unto others, nor unto themselves: but by an
Holy and Christian Life and conversation, now it is one thing to argue, and prove,
who are the Sonnes of God at present; another, whether they who are such at present
must of necessity alwaies so continue. The former is the Apostles theame in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
the latter he is wholly silent of.</p>
            <p>I say, it is evident that the scope of the place, is to evince, that in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, those that are borne of him, there is such a <hi>Principle, Genius,</hi> a
new nature, as that upon the account thereof, they <hi>cannot sinne,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that those who have not such principles in them, what ever their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be, are not indeed borne of God; and in this he manifesteth, that those
who are indeed borne of God, cannot possibly so degenerate, as to fall into
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59070:209"/>
totall impenitency, so as to become Children of the Divell, which he <hi>emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
affirmeth.</p>
            <p>2. He doth indeed declare, that none can make good their Title to be
children of God, but those who can justify their claime, by an holy and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
conversation; but yet moreover, he maketh good the Assertion by this
farther discovery which he maketh of their new nature, to be such, as that
they <hi>cannot sinne,</hi> or degenerate into a condition of lying under the power of
a vaine conversation: so that though his intent should not be primarily, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that those who are at present the Children of God, cannot Apostatize,
but must so continue; yet it is to confirme their Nature, and Genius, to be
such, with the principles which from God they have received, that so it shall
be with them, so they shall abide; and to this he is not silent, but eminently
expressive.</p>
            <p>The Context being thus cleare,<note place="margin">§. 59.</note> the words themselves are a <hi>Proposition</hi> or
<hi>Thesis,</hi> and a Reason for the confirmation of the Truth of that Proposition. The
Proposition is ready at hand in the words: <hi>He that is borne of God, doth not,
cannot commit sinne.</hi> The Reason of the Proposition confirming the Truth
thereof, is twofold; 1. <hi>Because he is borne of God;</hi> 2. Because, <hi>his seed whereof
he is so borne remaineth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proposition is <hi>universall,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>every one that is borne
of God;</hi> whence thes two things insue. 1. The truth of it, hath a <hi>necessary</hi> cause
or causes; Universall Propositions must have so, or they are not true. If that
which is their ground may be otherwise, it invalidates their certainty; such
then must be the cause of this Assertion of the Apostle.</p>
            <p>2. That it compriseth all and every one that is interested in that which is
the cause of the certainty of this <hi>universall</hi> Assertion or proposition; every
on who is <hi>borne of God,</hi> that hath this seed, be he young or old, weake or
strong, wise or foolish, exercised in the wayes of God, or newly entred into
them, all is one; whosoever is thus interested in the foundation, is equally
interested in the inference:</p>
            <p>In the proposition it selfe may be considered,<note place="margin">§. 60.</note> the subject, and what is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it. The subject is, every one that is borne of God. That which is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it, is, sinneth not, cannot sinne.</p>
            <p>1. For the first <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Subject;</hi> they are those which are <hi>borne of God;</hi>
and who they are that are so <hi>borne of God,</hi> the Scripture is cleare in; neither is
there any difference of importance, as to the intendment of this expression.
Those who suppose that Believers of some eminency only are denoted in it,
do not consider that all Believers whatever are shares in the Grace inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
therein; they are all said to be <hi>borne againe not of the will of flesh but
of God, Iohn</hi> 1. 13. For it is ascribed to all Believers on the name of Christ
<hi>v. 12. He begetteth them all of his owne will. James</hi> 1. 18. as also 1 <hi>Epistle of Peter</hi>
1. <hi>chapter 23. verse,</hi> he is said to <hi>beget them,</hi> as to quicken them 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 11
And they to be <hi>borne</hi> of him, as they are <hi>quickned</hi> or raised from the dead.
Two things are intimated in this Expression.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A new principle, habit or Spirituall Life</hi> which such persons have; hence
they are said to be <hi>borne;</hi> as they who are borne in the world are partakers of
a <hi>vitall principle,</hi> that is the foundation of all their actions, so have they here
a <hi>new Life,</hi> a <hi>new vitall principle,</hi> by their being borne are they made partakers
of it.</p>
            <p>2. The divine originall of that principle, or life is from God. They have the
principle of Life, immediately fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; therefore are said to be <hi>borne of God,</hi>
&amp; both these considerations are here used as descriptions of the Subject: &amp; in
the close of the Reason of the Proposition, they are insisted on, as the cause of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59070:210"/>
that Effect of <hi>not sinning; he sinneth not</hi> because he is <hi>borne of God;</hi> both the
nature of the principle it selfe which in it selfe is abiding, and the rise or ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
that it hath from God, have an influence into that causality that is
ascribed to it; but about this there can be no great contest.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly That which is <hi>affirmed</hi> of every such person,<note place="margin">§: 61.</note> is, that <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
not sinne.</hi> That this Expression is to be attended with its restrictions
and limitations is evident, from that contrariety wherein, in its whole lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
it standeth to sundry other Testimonyes in the Booke of God; yea in this
very Epistle. <hi>There is none that doth good and sinneth not,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon 1 Kings</hi>
8. and <hi>In many things we sinne all</hi> saith <hi>James</hi> in the 3. <hi>James</hi> 4. And this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
putteth all out of question, by convincing the best of Saints, that have
<hi>communion with the Father and Sonne,</hi> that by saying we have no sinne, by a
denyall of it, we involve our selves in the guilt of it. <hi>If we</hi> (we Apostles, we
who have fellowship with the Father and the Sonne,) <hi>say we have no sinne, we
deceive our selves, 1 John</hi> 1. 8. (<hi>doth not commit sinne</hi> then, cannot be taken
absolutely for <hi>doth not sin at all.</hi>) There is a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> in the words; and they
must be restrained to some <hi>kind</hi> of sinne, or to some manner or degree in, or
of sinning. Some say <hi>he doth not, cannot sinne,</hi> is, they <hi>doe not commit sinne with
delight,</hi> not <hi>deliberately</hi> and with their full and whole will, without reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and opposition in their wills unto sinne; (which reluctancy is at a vast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
from the reluctancy that is raised in wicked men from the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Concience and judgement,) which sence is canvassed by M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
to no advantage at all Sect. 25. For in the way and manner formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
this may well take place. <hi>Committeth not sinne</hi> then, is, doth not <hi>so</hi>
commit sinne as that <hi>sinne should raigne in him</hi> spoken of <hi>and prevaile with him
to death:</hi> There is an <hi>Emphasis</hi> and intention in the words; <hi>Committeth not sin;</hi>
that is, doth not so commit it, as to be given up to the <hi>power of it;</hi> he doth
not <hi>commit sinne</hi> in such a way as to be separated from communion with God
thereby; which is only done when sinne taketh the Rule or raigne in any
Person.</p>
            <p>This Exposition M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">§. 62.</note> 
               <hi>if it can be made to stand upright, will
beare the weight of the whole cause depending alone, but as it is, it argueth weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to determine for our own sence, in a Controversy or Question, without giving
a very substantiall Reason for the Exposition.</hi> I doubt if M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> discourses
in this Treatise, were to be tried by this Rule, a man might upon very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
grounds &amp; reasons call many of his assertions into Controversy; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he addeth <hi>that such is his hard hap he can meet with no reasons at
all,</hi> I must needs question whether he made any dilligent search or
no, to this purpose shall supply him with one, or two, that lye hard at
hand.</p>
            <p>This then to be the intendment of the words is evident.</p>
            <p>1. From the scope of the place and aime of the Apostle therein: This
is to distinguish (as was said) betwixt the Children of God and of the Divell.
The children of the Divell commit sinne <hi>v. 8. He that committeth sinne is of
the Divell,</hi> as he giveth an instance of one that did so sin, <hi>v. 12. Cain</hi> (saith he)
<hi>was of the Divell, he was of that wicked one and he committeth sinne.</hi> How did
<hi>Cain</hi> commit sinne? impenitently, to death, that is the committing of sinne
which is ascribed to them that are of the Devill, of the <hi>wicked</hi> one; <hi>Now</hi> (saith
he <hi>whosoever is borne of God doth not commit sinne;</hi> that is, he doth not so
commit sinne as the Children of the Divell that <hi>wicked one</hi> do; He sinnes not
to death with impenitency.</p>
            <p>2. The same Apostle doth most eminently cleare his own intendment in
this expression <hi>Chap: 5. v:</hi> 17, 18. of this Epistle, <hi>All unrighteousnesse is sinne
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59070:210"/>
there is a sinne not unto death, we know that whosoever is borne of God,
sinneth not, but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himselfe, and that wicked one
toucheth him not.</hi> That expression <hi>v. 18. Sineth not,</hi> standeth in opposition to the
sinne mentioned <hi>v. 17. Sinne unto death: there is a sinne unto death;</hi> but he that
is borne of God sinneth not unto <hi>death;</hi> So that both the context and the
Exposition of the words, given in a <hi>parrallell</hi> place, affordeth us the sence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on.</p>
            <p>Three reasons are tendred by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> against this exposition,<note place="margin">§. 63.</note> 
               <hi>and many
more</hi> (saith he) <hi>are at hand,</hi> which it seemes he is willing to spare for another
season. Of those that he is pleased to use, I have already considered that
which is of the chiefest importance, being taken from the scope of the place.
It hath been already declared, not only that the sence by him urged, is not
suitable to the intendment of the Holy Ghost, and that M. <hi>G.</hi> is not a little mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in his <hi>Analysis</hi> of the Chapter, but that the exposition insisted on by us,
is from thence inforced.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>His other reasons are, First,</hi> That the Grammar or letter of the Phrase
breatheth not the least aire of such a sence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Expression is <hi>Synecdochicall</hi> was before affirmed, what it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
under the power of that figure, is the <hi>Grammaticall</hi> sence of the words.
To the <hi>Grammaticall</hi> regularity, and signification of them, doth their figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivenesse
belong. Let the words be restrained, as the <hi>figure</hi> requireth, and the
sence is most proper, as was signifyed.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>But Secondly, saith he,</hi> The Phrase of committing sinne, is no where in the
Scripture found in such a sence, as to sinne with finall impenitency or to sinne to
death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The contrary hath been demonstrated. The same phrase necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
importeth no <hi>lesse. v.</hi> 8. of this Chapter, and an equivalent expression be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all contradiction intending the same, Chap: 5. 17, 18. Besides a Phrase
may be so circumstantiated, as to be in one, <hi>only place,</hi> restrained to a sence,
which it doth not elsewhere necessarily import. So that notwithstanding these
Exceptions, the Exposition of the words is cleare, as before given in. And yet
this is all M. <hi>G.</hi> produceth as his ground, and foundation, whereon to stand in
denying ths proposition, <hi>he that is borne of God sinneth not,</hi> that is, falleth not
under the power of raigning sinne, sinneth not to death as the Children of
the wicked one, which I shall leave under that consideration wherewith it is
educed from the scope of the Text, and the <hi>paralell</hi> place of Chap. 5. 16, 17.
The truth is there is not much need to contend about this expression, M. G.
granting that the intendment of it is, <hi>that such as are borne of God do not walke
ordinarily &amp; customarily in any wayes of known sin</hi> Sect: 28. <hi>Which</hi> (as he saith) <hi>is
the import of that Phrase</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (the contrary whereof might yet be
easily evinced) he maketh no trade or occupation of sinning, that is, he doth
not sinne in an inconsistency of communion with God, in the Covenant of his
Grace. Now in this sence he granteth this Proposition, <hi>he that is borne of God
sinneth not, i. e. ordinarily or customarily, that is so as not to be accepted of God:</hi>
that is, <hi>no Believer sinneth at such a rate</hi> as not to be accepted with God. Adde
now hereunto the ground &amp; reason of this Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> His being borne of
God, &amp; the abiding of the seed in him, &amp; we have obtained all that we desire
to evince from this place. Because such an one is borne of God, (which is a
Reason which holdeth good to Eternity being an act irrevocably past) and
because the seed abideth in him, he cannot sinne ordinarlly or customarily:
which kind of sinning alone (as is supposed) can eject the abiding seed; that is,
he sinneth not beyond the rate of sinnes of infirmity, nor in any such way as
should render him uncapable of communion or acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:59070:211"/>
The Apostle nextly advanceth farther with his designe and saith, <hi>He that
is borne of God cannot sinne:</hi> that is, <hi>That sinne</hi> which he sinneth not, he <hi>cannot
sinne;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 64.</note> He <hi>cannot</hi> fall under the power of raigning sinne unto death. I confesse
the words <hi>can</hi> &amp; <hi>cannot,</hi> are variously used in the Scriptures; some kind of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility</hi>
in one respect or other (for things may be in some regard impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that are not so absolutely) it alway denoteth. The whole of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in this kind, may be referred to two heads.</p>
            <p>1. That which is <hi>morally</hi> impossible. Of that it is said, that it cannot be
done 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Saith <hi>Paul, we can do nothing against the Truth.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 20.
Say the Apostles, <hi>we cannot but speake the things we have seen and heard.</hi> It was
morally impossible that ever any thing should have been done by <hi>Paul</hi> against
the truth; or that the Apostles having received the Spirit should not speak what
they had seen and heard of Christ. And of many things that are thus <hi>morally
impossible,</hi> there are most certaine and determinate causes, as to make the
thing so impossible as in respect of the event, to be absolutely impossible. It
is morally impossible that the <hi>Divell</hi> should do that which is Spiritually
good, and yet absolutely impossible. There is more in many a thing that is
<hi>morally</hi> impossible than a meere opposition to Justice; as we say <hi>Illud possumus
quod jure possumus.</hi> The causes of morall impossibility may be such, as to tye
up the thing which it relateth unto, in an everlasting <hi>nonfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urition.</hi> There is
also</p>
            <p>2. An <hi>impossibility</hi> that is <hi>Physicall,</hi> from the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
So <hi>Jerem. 13. 23. %Can the Aethyopian change his skin?</hi> that is, <hi>He cannot.
Mat. 7. 18. %A good tree cannot bring forth evill fruit, neither can an evill tree
bring forth good fruit.</hi> That is, nothing can act contrary to its owne naturall
principles: And as we shall see afterwards, there is of this impossibility in the
[<hi>cannot</hi>] here mentioned. They <hi>cannot</hi> do it, upon the account of the new
Spirituall nature wherewith they are indued.</p>
            <p>Now there may be a third kind of <hi>impossibility</hi> in Spirituall things, arising
from both these, which One hath not ineptly called <hi>Ethico-physicall,</hi> or <hi>moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-naturall,</hi>
partaking of the nature of both the other. It is <hi>morall</hi> because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
to <hi>duty,</hi> what is to be done or not to be done. And it is <hi>Physicall</hi> because
it relateth to a cause or principle that <hi>can, or cannot</hi> produce the effect. So our
Saviour telleth the <hi>Pharisees; How can ye being evill, speake good things.</hi> Or ye
cannot <hi>Mat. 12. 34. %You cannot heare my words John</hi> 8. 43. It was morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should either <hi>speake or heare,</hi> that is, either believe or do that
which is <hi>Spiritually</hi> good, having no principles that should enable them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
having no root that should beare up unto fruit; being evill trees
in themselves, and having a principle, a root continually, universally, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptedly,
inclining, and disposing them an other way, to acts of a quite
contrary nature. Of this kind is that impossibility here intimated. The effect
denyed is morally impossible, upon the account of the <hi>internall Physicall</hi>
cause hindring of it.</p>
            <p>However then the word in the Scripture may be variously taken, yet here it
is from adjacent circumstances, evidently restrained to such a signification as
in respect of the event, absolutely rejecteth the thing denyed. The gradation
of the Apostle also leadeth us to it. He <hi>sinneth not,</hi> nay, <hi>he cannot sin: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sin,</hi> riseth in the Assertion of that before expressed He sinneth not: which
absolutely rejecteth the <hi>glosse</hi> that some seeke to put upon the words, namely,
that <hi>cannot sinne</hi> is no more but <hi>cannot sinne easily: and cannot sinne but as it
were with difficulty, such is the Antipathy &amp; habituall opposition which they have
to sinne,</hi> which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> adhereth unto: For besides,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:59070:211"/>
That this is in it selfe <hi>false,</hi> there being no such Antipathie in any to sinne,
but that they may easily fall into it, yea and with great difficulty and labour
do restraine from it, as the Apostle argueth at large <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: So is it also flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradictory to the words themselves: the Apostle saith, <hi>He that is borne of
God sinneth not; cannot sinne;</hi> He <hi>can sinne</hi> (saith this Glosse) though <hi>difficultly;</hi>
now he that <hi>can sinne difficultly,</hi> can sinne: can sinne, and cannot sinne, are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradictory; He cannot then sinne at all, the sinne that is intended in the
place, of whom it is said <hi>he cannot sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have cleared the first Proposition in the words, both as to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
every one that is borne of God;</hi> and the <hi>Predicate, sinneth not, cannot sinne,</hi>
Which last expression, taken in its only proper and most usuall signification,
denoteth an Impossibility of the event, &amp; plainely confirmeth in direct termes
the position we insist on from the words.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> knoweth not well,<note place="margin">§. 65.</note> (If I am able to gather any thing of his
thoughts, from his expressions to the Argument in hand,) what to say to this
Assertion of the Apostles. The Argument he intendeth to deale withall from
the place he casteth into this forme, <hi>He that sinneth not neither can sinne, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fall away, whosoever is borne of God sinneth not, neither can sinne:</hi> Ergo,</p>
            <p>Comming to the consideration of that expression [<hi>cannot sin</hi>] he findeth
out, as he supposeth, <hi>four</hi> severall acceptations in the Scripture, of the word
[<hi>cannot</hi>] &amp; giveth us an account of his thoughts upon the consideration of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that in respect of these <hi>sences</hi> both Propositions are false. Now one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
being the expresse language &amp; literall Expression of the Holy Ghost,
not varyed in the least, there is no way to relieve himselfe, from being thought
and conceiv'd to give the lye to the Blessed Spirit of God, by flatly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he peremptorily affirmeth, but only by denying the word
[<hi>cannot</hi>] to be taken in this place, in any of the sences before mentioned;
Doth he then fixe on this course for his own extrication? Doth he give in
another sence of the word, which he accepts and grants that in that sence
the affirmation of the Holy Ghost may be true? Not in the least? Yea plainly
for one of the sences he supposeth himself to have found out of the word [<hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>]
<hi>viz.</hi> That it is said of men, they <hi>cannot</hi> do such or such a thing, because
of their <hi>aversenesse and indisposition</hi> to it, which he exemplifyeth in that of
Christ to the Pharisees <hi>John</hi> 8. 43. He afterwards more than intimateth, that
this is the sence, wherein the words <hi>cannot sinne</hi> are in this place to be taken.
Sect. 34. So that he will not allow the Holy Ghost to speake the truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he take his words in what sence he pleaseth. Yea and adding a fifth
sence, Sect. 31. Which is all it seemeth he could find out, (for we heare not of
any more) he denyeth that to be the meaning of the place, and so shutteth up
the mind of the Holy Ghost into some of those significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherein if the words
be taken (he saith) <hi>they are false.</hi> The Discourse of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sect. 28,
29, 30. (being taken up with the Consideration of the various significations of
the word [<hi>cannot</hi>] and his inferences thereon; taking it in this place, this way
or that way, then it is so or so, shewing himselfe very skilfull at fencing &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
off the force of our Arguments, as perhaps his thoughts of himselfe were
upon a review of what he had done) we are not concerned in. And though
it were very easy to mnifest that in the distribution of his instances, for the
exemplification of the severall significations which in part he feigneth, and
fastneth upon the words, he hath been overtaken with many grosse
mistakes, some of them occasioned by other corrupt principles than those
now under consideration, yet none of the sences insisted on by him, coming
really up to the intendment of the Holy Ghost without any disadvantage
to our cause in hand, being wholly inconcerned therein, we may passe by that
whole <hi>Harangue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59070:212"/>
               <hi>That which looketh towards the Argument under Consideration, appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth
first in Sect. 31. which he thus proposeth:</hi> If the said Argument under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
the Phrase [cannot sinne] according to the fifth and last import mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of the word [cannot] wherein it soundeth an utter and absolute incapacity and
impossibility, then in this sence the major Proposition is granted: viz. He that doth
not, nor can sinne cannot fall away from his Faith: yet the minor is tardy which
saith, Whosoeoer is borne of God sinneth not, neither can sinne; for he that is borne
of God is in no such incapacity of sinning; of sinning I meane in the sence formerly
asserted to the Scripture in hand, which amounteth to an absolute impossibility for
him so to sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Because this seemeth to be the sence intended in the Argument,
and the minor Proposition in this sence to be built upon the Scripture in hand,
let us consider whether the Reason which is assigned for the said Assertion,
doth necessarily inforce such a sence thereon. What we understand by this
Phrase both as to that sinne that is here intended, and that impossibility of
commiting it, or falling into it often, in that expression [<hi>cannot</hi>] hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
discovered. An impossibility it is of the event, from the causes above
mentioned that the holy Ghost intendeth. An utter, and absolute incapacity
to sinne, on any account, we assert not; An impossibility of so sinning, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the event, for the reasons and from the causes above mentioned, the
holy Ghost averreth. In this sence the first Proposition is granted, He that doth
not commit sin nor can sin, cannot fall away from his Faith, or cannot utterly
loose it. The Minor which is the expresse language of the holy Ghost is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
and found <hi>tardy,</hi> that is, (as I suppose) <hi>false:</hi> and the Reason is added
namely, <hi>that he that is borne of God is in no such incapacity of sinning;</hi> that is,
of sinning in that kind of sinning which is here intended, which amounteth
to an impossibility for him so to sin: Not to play fast and loose, under those
ambiguos expressions of <hi>incapacity</hi> and <hi>absolute impossibility,</hi> the Event is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
denyed upon the account of the prohibiting causes of it, and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity</hi>
asserted, relateth not to the internall frame and principle only, but
respecteth also other Considerations. Whether these are such as to beare the
weight of this Exposition, is that which cometh nextly to be discussed. <hi>viz.</hi>
The causes of this state and condition, of those who are thus borne of God,
and the Reasons investing that <hi>universall Proposition, every one that is borne of
God cannot sinne: with a necessary truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reasons added of the former affirmation, there is an emphaticall distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of the two parts of the <hi>praedicate</hi> of the former Proposition, by the way
of <hi>ascending</hi> to a more vehement confirmation of them. <hi>He that is borne of
God sinneth not,</hi> But why so? <hi>His seed remaineth: neither can be sinne,</hi> why so?
<hi>because he is borne of God.</hi> It is an expressive pursuit of the same thing; and not
a redoubling of the Proposition; And this contexture of the Words, is so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
significant, that it seemeth strange how any head of opposition can
be made against it; There is no reason then to resolve the words into two
Propositions, of distinct consideration, each from other; it being one and the
same thing, that the Apostle intendeth to expresse, though proceeding to
heighten the <hi>certainty</hi> of the thing, in the minds of them to whom he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it, by the contexture of the words which he maketh use of. What is
meant, or intended by the <hi>seed of God,</hi> we need not dispute; the Argument
of the Apostle, lieth not in the words (<hi>seed of God</hi>) nor in the word (<hi>abideth</hi>)
but in the whole, <hi>The seed of God abideth;</hi> and therefore it were to no purpose
at all, to follow M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his considerations of the word <hi>Seed,</hi> and then
of the <hi>seed of God,</hi> and then, of the word (<hi>abideth</hi>) divided one from another.
The summe of his long answer is, <hi>The word (Seed) doth not import any such
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59070:212"/>
thing as is aimed at from the Text;</hi> nor the word (<hi>abide:</hi>) but to the whole
proposition, <hi>the seed of God abideth in him,</hi> as produced to confirme the former
assertion of the not sinning of the Persons spoken of, there is nothing spoken
at all; I shall therefore briefely confirme the Argument in hand, by the
strength here communicated unto it, by the Holy Ghost, and then consider
what is <hi>answered</hi> to any part of it, or <hi>objected</hi> to the interpretation insisted on.
That he, <hi>that sinneth not, neither can sinne,</hi> in the sence explained, shall never
fall away <hi>totally</hi> or <hi>finally</hi> from God, is granted. That Believers <hi>sinne not,</hi> nor
<hi>can sinne,</hi> so, or in the manner mentioned, besides the Testimony of the Holy
Ghost, worthy of all acceptation, in the cleare assertion of it, we have the
Reason thereof manifested, in the discovery of the causes of its truth. The
first Reason is, <hi>Because the seed of God abideth in them.</hi> A tacite grant seemeth
to be made; that fruit sometimes may not visibly appeare upon them, as the
case is with a <hi>Tree in winter,</hi> when <hi>it casts its leaves:</hi> but its seed remaineth.
Grace may abide in the habit, in, and under a winter of Temptation, though
it doth not exert its selfe in bearing any such actuall fruit, as may be <hi>ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
visible. The Word of God is sometimes called <hi>seed incorruptible; seed</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satively,
as being an instrument in the hand of God, whereby he planteth the
<hi>seed</hi> of Life and holinesse in the heart; That it is not the <hi>outward word,</hi> but that
which is produced, and effected by it, through the efficacy of the Spirit of God,
that is by seed intended, is evident from the use and nature of it. And it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
in the Person in whom it is. Whatever it is; it is called <hi>seed,</hi> not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that from whence it cometh, as is the cause and Reason of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
of other seed, but in respect of that which it produceth, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
and insueth upon it: and it is called the <hi>seed of God,</hi> because God useth it
for the Regeneration of his. Being from God, being the principle of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
of them in whom it is, abiding in them even when it hath brought
forth fruit, and continuing so to doe, it can be no other but the <hi>New Creature,
New Nature, inward Man,</hi> new principle of Life, or habit of Grace, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon all Believers, whence they are Regenerate, quickned, or borne
againe, of which we have spoken before.</p>
            <p>This <hi>seed</hi> (saith the Holy Ghost) <hi>abideth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 67.</note> or remaineth in him. Whatever
falling or withering <hi>He</hi> may seeme to have, or hath, this <hi>seed,</hi> the <hi>seed of God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
in him. The principle of his new life abideth, some exceptions are
made as we shall see afterwards, to the signification of the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi>
and instances given where it signifyeth for <hi>to be,</hi> and denoteth the <hi>essence</hi>
of a thing not its <hi>duration.</hi> That to <hi>abide,</hi> or <hi>remaine</hi> is the proper signification
of the word, I suppose will not be questioned. That it may in some place be
used in another <hi>sence,</hi> is not dispuited. All that lyeth under consideration here,
is, whether the word in this place be used <hi>properly</hi> according to its <hi>genuine</hi> and
<hi>first signification,</hi> or no? It <hi>supposeth</hi> indeed (<hi>to be</hi>) also; but properly signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
only to <hi>abide</hi> or <hi>remaine.</hi> Now if nothing can be advanced from the
Text, ot context, from the matter treated on, or the paralell significancy of
some expression that is in conjunction with it, that should inforce us to carry it
from its proper use and signification, the instancing of other places, if any
such be, wherein it is restrained to denote <hi>being,</hi> and not <hi>duration,</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impertinent to the businesse in hand. When an Argument is urged from
any place of Scripture, to pick out any word in the Text, and to manifest that
it hath been used improperly, in some other place, and therefore must be so
in that, is a procedure so farre from an ingenious Answer, that it will scarce
passe for a tolerable shift or evasion. To <hi>remaine</hi> then, or to <hi>abide,</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
signification of this word, &amp; nothing is in the least offered to manifest that
it must necessarily in this place be diverted from its proper use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:59070:213"/>
According to the import of the word, the <hi>seed of God remaineth in Believers;</hi>
now that <hi>remaining of the seed,</hi> is the cause of their <hi>not sinning</hi> that sinne, or in
that manner, as the Apostle here denyeth them to be liable to sinne. For that
is the Reason he giveth why they <hi>cannot sinne,</hi> even because the <hi>seed of God
remaineth in them.</hi> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> granteth, that this <hi>seed</hi> remaineth in Believers
alwayes, unlesse they sinne by a totall defection from God. Of not sinning the
sinne of totall de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection from God, the <hi>remaining</hi> or abiding of this seed is the
cause. Whilst that abideth, they cannot sinne, that sin, for it is an unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
cause &amp; uncontrouleable of their not so doing. This <hi>seed</hi> therefore must
be utterly lost, and taken away, before any such sinne can be committed.
Now if the seed cannot be lost, without the commission of the sinne which
cannot be committed till it be lost, neither can the seed be lost, nor
the sin becommited. The same thing cannot be before, and after its selfe,
He that cannot go sucha journey, unlesse he have such a horse, &amp; cannot have
such a horse unlesse he go such a journey, is like to stay at home. In what sence
the words [<hi>cannot sin</hi>] are to be taken, was before declared. That there are sins
innumerable, whereinto men may fall notwithstanding this seed, is confessed.
Under them all, this seed abideth; so it would not do under that which we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sin,</hi> because it abideth; but because it <hi>abideth,</hi> that sin cannot be <hi>committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter part of the Reason of the Apostles assertion,<note place="margin">§. 68.</note> is, <hi>for he is borne of
God;</hi> which is indeed a driving on the former to its head, and fountaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What it is to be borne of <hi>God</hi> we need not dispute. It was sufficiently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the mention that was made before of the <hi>seed of God.</hi> God by his
Holy Spirit bestowing on us a new <hi>Spirituall Life</hi> which by nature we have not,
and in respect of whose want we are said to be <hi>dead,</hi> is frequently said to <hi>beget</hi>
us, <hi>James</hi> 1. 14. And we are said to be <hi>borne of God.</hi> He is the Soveraigne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposer,
dispenser, and supreme fountaine of that Life, which is so bestowed on
us, which we are begotten againe unto, and are borne with, and by; And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> is also said to have this <hi>Life in himselfe, Joh:</hi> 5. because
he hath received the <hi>spirit</hi> of the father, to give to his, for their quickning;
who <hi>taketh of his,</hi> and thereby begeteth them a new. And this Life which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
thus receive, and whereby indeed <hi>radically</hi> they become Believers, is
every where in Scripture noted as <hi>Permanent</hi> and abiding. In respect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
of it, it is said to be from <hi>above,</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> of the <hi>will of God,</hi> of
<hi>God;</hi> As to its principle, to be <hi>not of flesh, or bloud, or of the will of man,</hi> or of
any thing done by us, but of the <hi>seed of God, incorruptible seed, seed that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth;</hi>
in respect of its <hi>duration</hi> to be <hi>eternall,</hi> and that it may so be, to be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded,
being <hi>hid in God with Christ.</hi> In this place <hi>Receiving this Life from
God,</hi> is placed as the cause; and <hi>cannot sinne,</hi> as the effect. He cannot sinne,
for, or because he is borne of God. The connexion that is between this cause
and effect, or wherein the causality of <hi>Being borne of God to a not sinning</hi> doth
consist, needs not be inquired into. That it hath such a <hi>causality,</hi> the holy
Ghost hath asserted, and our Argument resteth thereon. If that be the nature
of Regeneration, or being borne of God that it doth exclude Apostacy, then
he that is Regenerate, or borne of God, as every Believer is, cannot so sinne
as to Apostatize, or fall totally from God: But that such is the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
whereby any one is borne of God, the holy Ghost here declareth;
For he denyeth Apostacy upon the account of Regeneration; <hi>He cannot sinne
because he is borne of God,</hi> which is that which we intended to demonstrate from
this text of Scripture.</p>
            <p>To evade the force of this Argument,<note place="margin">§. 69.</note> M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (as hath been declared)
undertaketh to give an Exposition of this place of Scripture, turning every
stone, and labouring to wrest every word in it. The severall significations of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59070:213"/>
the words in other places are set out, and suppositions made of taking them
this way, or that way: but in what sence the scope of the matter treated on,
the most usuall known common acceptations, call for their <hi>Vse,</hi> in this place,
nothing is spoken: neither is any cleare Answer once attempted to be given
to the words of the Text, speaking out, and home, to the conclusion we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
or to the Argument thence deduced. What I can gather up from <hi>Sect.</hi> 31.
and forwards, that may obstruct the thoughts of any, in closing with the
Interpretation given, I shall consider, and remove out of the way. 1. Then, he
giveth you this Interpretation of these words <hi>sineth not, or cannot sinne: Every
one that hath been borne of God (sinneth not)</hi> i. e. <hi>Whosoever hath by the Word
and Spirit of God been made partaker of the Divine nature, so as to resemble God
in the frame and constitution of his heart and soule, doth not under such a frame,
or change of heart as this make a trade or practice of sinning, or walking in any
course of inordinatenesse in the world. Yea</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the latter Proposition
every such person doth not only or simply refraine sinning in such a sence, but he
cannot sin; (i. e.) He hath a strong and potent disposition in him which carryeth
him an other way, for he hath a strong Antipathy or aversenesse of heart and soule
against all sinne, especially all such kind of sinning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What is meant by being <hi>borne of God,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> whereby any come
so to be, the <hi>Vniversality</hi> of the expression requiring a necessary cause of its
verity, with the like attendencies of the <hi>Proposition</hi> have been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>2.
What M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> intendeth by such a <hi>frame</hi> and constitution of spirit
and soule, as may resemble God, with his deniall of the bestowing on us from
God a vitall principle of Grace, wherein the Renovation in us, of his image
should consist, hath in part also been already discovered, &amp; will yet farther be
so, in our consideration of his rare notion of Regeneration, &amp; its consisting in a
mans returnall to the <hi>innocent and harmelesse estate,</hi> wherein he was borne.</p>
            <p>3. That (<hi>sinneth not</hi>) is sinneth not that sinne, or so sinneth, not as to
break his Relation to God as a child, hath been already also manifested, and
the Reader is not to be burthened with Repetition.</p>
            <p>4. In the interpretation given of the latter phrase <hi>he cannot sinne,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so sinne against the light of the Text, as to joyne with M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in it:
It is not the <hi>Antipathie</hi> of his heart to sinne, but the <hi>Course</hi> of his walking
with God, in respect of sinne, that the Apostle treateth on. His internall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaling
against sinne, he hath, from being <hi>borne of God,</hi> and <hi>the abiding of his
seed in him,</hi> of which this, that <hi>he cannot sinne,</hi> is asserted as the effect. He <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sinne,</hi> that is, he cannot so sinne, upon the account of his being borne of
God. (Thence indeed he hath not only a <hi>potent disposition</hi> another way, and
<hi>Antipathie</hi> to evill, but a vitall principle, with an everlasting enmity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
to, and inconsistency with any such sin, or sinning as is intimated,)
and that he cannot sinne, is the consequent and effect thereof, and is so affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nextly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 70.</note> 
               <hi>M.</hi> Goodwin <hi>giveth you the</hi> Reason <hi>of this Assertion used by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
why such an one, as of whom he speaketh,</hi> sinneth not, and cannot sinne.
Now the Reason saith the Apostle, why such a person committeth not sinne in the
sence explained, is because his seed, the seed of God, by whom, of which, he was
borne of him, remaineth in him, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) is, or hath an actuall and present being, or
residence in him: and that in this place it doth not signify any perpetuall abiding,
or any abiding in relation to the future, is evident: because the abiding of the seed
here spoken of, is given as the Reason, why he that is borne of God, doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sinne, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) doth not frequently walke in any course of known sinne; now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in respect of any future permanency, or continuance of being, can be looked
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59070:214"/>
upon as the cause of an effect, but only in respect of the present being or
residence of it. The Reason why the soule moveth to day, is not because it
will move, or act the body to morrow or because it is in the body to day, upon such
termes, that it will be in it to morrow also, much lesse because it is an immortall
substance; but simply because it is now or this day in the body. So the Reason why
Angels at this day do the will of God, is not because they have such a principle of
holinesse, or Obedience in them, which they cannot put off, or loose to eternity, but
because of such a principle as we speake of, residing in them at present: therefore
when John assigneth the remaining of the seed of God in him that is borne of him,
for the reason why he doth not commit sinne, certaine it is that by this remaining of
the seed he meaneth nothing else but the present residence or abode thereof in this
Person; and if his intent had been either to assert, or imply a perpetuall residence
of this seed, in him, that is borne of God, it had been much more proper for him to
have saved it for a reason of the latter proposition, [he that is borne of God cannot
sinne] then to have subjoyned it as a reason of the former; for though the future
continuance of the thing in being, can be no reason of the effect present, yet it will
be a ground or reason of the continuance of a present effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans:</hi> I have thus at large transcribed this discourse, because it is the sum
of what Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> hath to offer for the weakning of our Argument from
this place, of what weight this is, will quickly appeare. For</p>
            <p>1. This Reason (the seed abideth in him) though brought in <hi>illatively,</hi> in
respect of what was said before, [<hi>he doth not commit sinne</hi>] yet hath its <hi>causall
influence</hi> chiefly into that which followeth, <hi>he cannot sinne.</hi> To make good
what was first spoken, <hi>of his not committing sinne that is borne of God,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
discovereth the cause of it, which so farre secureth the truth of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
as that it causeth it to ascend, and call them up higher, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
impossibility of doing of that which was only at first simply denyed.
Neither is this Assertion <hi>the seed of God abideth in him,</hi> any otherwise a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the first Assertion <hi>He committeth not sinne,</hi> than as it is the cause of the
latter <hi>He cannot sinne.</hi> Now Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> granteth in the close of his Discourse,
that the <hi>future continuance of a thing in being, is, or may be the cause of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of an effect which at present it produceth;</hi> and what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> may
more curiously discover of the intent of the Apostle, his words plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assert the <hi>continuance and abode of the seed of God</hi> in them in whom it is; and
using it as he doth, for a reason of the latter cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se of that Proposition [<hi>He
cannot sinne</hi>] he speaketh properly enough, so great a Master (of one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
at least) as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> being judge.</p>
            <p>2. The Reason insisted on by the Apostle, is neither from the word [<hi>seed</hi>]
nor from the word [<hi>abideth</hi>] nor from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>seed</hi> simply conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed,
nor from its <hi>permanency</hi> and <hi>continuance [the seed abideth;]</hi> So that it is
no exception to the intendment of the Apostle, to assert the abiding of the
seed, not to be a sufficient cause of the Proposition, because its <hi>abiding or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manencie</hi>
is not a cause of present not sinning, for it is not asserted that it is.
His present <hi>not sinning</hi> in whom it is, is from God, <hi>his being borne of God by
the seeds, his continuance and estate of not sinning,</hi> (both which are intended) is
from the <hi>abiding of the seed.</hi> The whole condition of The Person, that <hi>He sinn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, neither can sinne,</hi> (which te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes regard his continued estate) is from
the whole Proposition, <hi>The seed of God abideth in him.</hi> Separate the <hi>permanency</hi>
of the seed, which is asserted in the consideration of it, and it respects only,
and solely, the <hi>continuance</hi> of the effect which is produced by it as seed, or of
the estate wherein any one is placed, by being borne of God. All that Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to offer in this case, is, that the <hi>abiding of the seed,</hi> is so asserted
to be the <hi>Reason</hi> of that part of the Proposition <hi>He commits not sinne,</hi> as not to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59070:214"/>
be the cause <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (<hi>he cannot sinne.</hi>) When the abiding of the seed, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered is not used as any reason at all of the first, nor in the proposition
as it lyeth, <hi>the seed abideth</hi> any otherwise, but as it is the cause of the <hi>latter,
(he cannot sinne).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Even the expression [he committeth not sinne,] denoteth not only
the present actuall frame, and walking, of him of whom it is spoken, but his
estate and condition: being once borne of God he committeth not sinne; no
one that is so borne of God doth; none in the state &amp; condition of a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Person doth so; that is, in his course and walking to the end; and this is
argued not so much distinctly to the <hi>permanencie</hi> of the seed, as from the seed
with such an Adjunct.</p>
            <p>4. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Allusions, to the <hi>soule,</hi> and the <hi>Obedience of Angels,</hi> are
of little use, or none at all to the illustration of the businesse in hand. For
though the Reason why the soule moveth the body to day, is not because it
will move it to morrow, yet the reason why the body <hi>moveth,</hi> and cannot
but do so, is because it hath the <hi>Soule</hi> abiding in it, and he that shall say, <hi>he
that liveth moveth, for he hath a soule abiding in him, and cannot but move,</hi> shall
speake properly enough. And the reason why the Angells do the will of God
in Heaven, that is, <hi>actually</hi> continue in so doing is, because they have such a
confirmed &amp; uncontroulable principle of Obedience: So that all these Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
amount not to the least weakning of the Apostles Arguments.</p>
            <p>Sect. 32.<note place="margin">§. 71.</note> Our Authour giveth two instances to prove that the word [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>]
in the Scripture, signifieth sometime only to <hi>be,</hi> &amp; not to <hi>abide,</hi> and they are the
one, <hi>John</hi> 14. And the other 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. And one Argument, to manifest
that in the place under Consideration, it must needs signify a <hi>present abode and
being, and not a continuance &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If any such places befound, yet it is confessed that it is an <hi>unusuall</hi>
sence of the word, and a thousand places of that kind, will not inforce it to be
so taken in another place, unlesse the circumstances of it, and matter wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it treateth, enforce that sence, and will not beare that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>2.
M. <hi>G.</hi> doth not make it good by the instances he produceth that the
word is tyed up in any place, to denote precisely only the <hi>being</hi> of a thing,
without relation to its <hi>abiding</hi> and continuance Of the one <hi>John 14. 17. %But
ye know him because he remaineth with you, &amp; shall be in you:</hi> (saith he) <hi>the latter
clause [shall be in you] will be found a meere Tautologie, if the other phrase
[abideth with you] importetha perpetuall residence or inbeing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that this phrase [<hi>abideth with you</hi>] importeth the same with the phrase
in the foregoing verse, where it is clearely expounded by the addition of the
terme <hi>forever (that he may abide with you forever)</hi> I suppose cannot be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
Nor</p>
            <p>2. Is there any the least appearance of a <hi>Tautology</hi> in the words. His <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining</hi>
with Believers, being the thing promised, and his <hi>inbeing,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi>
of his abode with them. Also the 1 <hi>John</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth not simply
denote an Estate or Condition, but an estate or condition in its nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>interposition</hi> of Almighty <hi>Grace,</hi> abiding, and permanent: so that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have we yet any instance of restraining the significancy of the word, as
pretended, produced: nor if any place could be so, would it in the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
that Acceptation of the word in this place contended about. Wherefore
M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> (as I said) addeth an Argument, to evince that the word must
necessarily be taken in the sence by him insisted on in this place, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a course to the purpose, if his Argument prove so in any measure; It is
this. <hi>Because such a signification of it, would render the sence altogether inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59070:215"/>
with the scope of the Apostle, which is to exhort Christians unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Love of the brethren, now it is contrary to common sence its selfe, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
unto those whom we perswade to any duty, any such thing, which imports an
absolute certainty, or necessity of their doing it, whether they take care, or use any
meanes for the doing of it or no: and a cleare case it is, that the certainty of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
remaining of the seed of God, in those that are borne of him, importeth a
like certainty of their perpetuall performance of that duty, whereunto they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
If this be all it might have been spared. The Argument consisteth of
two parts. 1. An aspersion of the infinite wisdome of God, with a procedure
contrary to all Reason, and common sence. 2. A begging of the thing in
question, betwixt its Author, and its Adversaries. That there is any thing at
all in the Text, even according to our Interpretation of it, that importeth an
<hi>absolute necessity</hi> of mens doing any thing, whether they take care to use the
meanes of doing it or no, the Reader must judge. The abiding of the Seed, is
that we say, which shall effectually cause them, in whom it is, to use the
meanes of not sinning, that eventually they may not doe so; and that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the use of meanes, is imported, is no Argument to prove, that their
necessity of Persevering is proved, whether they use meanes yea or no. To
take care, to use meanes, is amongst the meanes appointed to be used, and
this they shall doe, upon the account of the <hi>abiding seed.</hi> That indeed which
is opposed, is, that God cannot promise to worke effectually in us by the use
of meanes, for the accomplishment of an appointed end, but that withall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
uselesse and vaine, all his exhortations to us to use those meanes. This
is M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Argument from the place it selfe, to inforce that improper
Acceptation of the word <hi>remaineth</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>What remaineth of M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> long discourse upon this Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<note place="margin">§. 72.</note> is but a fencing with himselfe, and raising of <hi>Objections,</hi> and Answering
them, suitably to his owne principles, wherein we are not in the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
There is not any thing, from the beginning to the end of it, that
tendeth to impeach our Interpretation of the place, or impede the progresse
of our Argument, but only a flourish set upon his own Exposition, which if
he were desired to give in briefely, and in termes of a plaine downeright sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy,
I am verily perswaded, he would be hardly put to it, to let us know
what his mind, and conceptions of this place of Scripture are. But of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and in Answer to his Fifth Argument, with this Chapter, this is the
issue.</p>

36. Section of his 13. Chapter containes one of the greatest Rarities,
he hath to shew in the whole packe, concerning the influence of the
Doctrine of the Saints Apostacy into their Consolation in their
walking with God, an undertaking so uncapable of any Logicall Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that though Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> interweave his Discourse concerning it
with a Sillogisme, yet he quickly leaves that thorney path, and pursues it only
with a Rhetoricall flourish of words, found out and set in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
At the head then of his Discourse he placeth this Argument as it is
called.</p>
            <p>That Doctrine whose genuine and proper tendency is to advance the peace and
joy of the Saints in Believing, is of a naturall sympathy, with the Gospell, and
upon this account a truth; such is the Doctrine, which informeth the Saints of a
possibility of their totall and finall falling away: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proposition of this syllogisme he supposes we will grant,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> and (not to
trouble the Reader with the Qualifications, and limitations formerly annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to that which proposed the furtherance of the obedience of the Saints, as
a proofe of the truth of any Doctrine) for my part I do. For the proofe of the
Assumption wherein alone Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s interest in this Argument doth lye,
He referrs us to his 9. Chapter: where, as he tells us, (if we may believe him)
he hath undenyably demonstrated the truth of it. But we have considered
whatever looks that way in that Chapter, and have found it all as Chaffe and
stubble, before the breath of the Spirit of the Lord in the Word. That which
lyes upon his shoulders, to support; (A burthen too heavy for him to beare) &amp;
whose demonstration he hath undertaken is, that it tends to the Peace, Joy,
&amp; Consolation of the Saints of God, in their walking with him (which arises
from, and solely depends upon that assurance they have of their eternall fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of him through Christ) to be instructed, that indeed they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
weake, unable to do any thing as they ought, that they have no
strength to continue in the Mercy of God, but carry about with them a body
of death, and that they are continually exposed to a world of Temptations,
whereby many strong men fall down, thrust through and are slaine every day,
and that in this condition there is no consideration of the <hi>Immutability</hi> or <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse</hi>
of God, that may secure them of the continuance of his Love
to them, no eternall purpose of his that he will preserve them, &amp; keepe them,
through his power, no <hi>Promise</hi> of not leaving them, or of giving them such
supplyes of his Spirit and Grace that they shall never forsake, nor leave him,
nothing in the Covenant, or Oath of God whereby it is confirmed, to Assure
them of an Abiding, and a not-to-be destroyed communion with him, that
Christ by his death and oblation hath not so taken away the guilt of their sins,
nor laid such a sure foundation, for the destruction of the power of them, as
that they shall not arise either way to their ruine: That he <hi>intercedes</hi> not for
their Preservation in Faith and Holinesse, upon the account of which state
and condition, of things, many of the most eminent Saints that ever served
God in this world, have utterly fallen out of his Love and Favour, and have
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59070:216"/>
been cast out of covenant from whence though perhaps some few have been
recovered, yet for the greatest part of them, have perished everlastingly (as is
the state in reference unto many in every Generation,) only such may do well
to consider what a fearefull &amp; desperate issue, their Apostacy will have, if they
should so fall, and what an eminent reward, with what Glory is proposed to
them if they persevere. That I say the instruction of the Saints, in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is a singular meanes of promoting their Consolation and establishing
their peace, is that which (doubtlesse with undervaluing thoughts of all with
whom he hath to do) he hath undertaken to prove. I doubt not but that Mr

Selfe-confidence is hereby setled and fixed with considerations: &amp; though M.
<hi>G.</hi> in the close of this Section, tels us, <hi>That sundry Godly and seriously Religious
persons, when they heard this Doctrine published which he now asserts, with their
wbole hearts blessed God for it:</hi> Yet truly I cannot but question whether, yea
I must positively deny that ever any Saint of God received Consolation by the
doctrine of the Saints Apostacy, a <hi>lye</hi> exceedingly unsuited to the production of
any such effect, any further than that all Errour whatsoever is apt to defile
and cauterise the Conscience, so deceiving it with sencelessenesse for peace;
Perhaps some of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s hearers who either were so ignorant, or so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
as not to be acquainted with this Doctrine before, in the attempts made
for that the propagation of it, by the latter broode of Prelats and Arminians
amongst us, upon his delivery of it with inticing words of humane wisedome,
helped on by the venerable esteeme they have of his transcendent parts and
abilityes, through the cunning of Sathan, improving the <hi>itching</hi> after new
Doctrines, which is fallen upon the minds and spirits of many professours in
this age, have rejoyced under the shadow of this bramble, set up to rule in
their Congregation: And (according as is the constant manner of all, in our
dayes that are insnared with any errour be it never so pernitious) have blessed
God for it, professing they never found rest nor peace before; yet I no way
question for such as feare the Lord, and are yet bowed downe under the
weight, and carryed away with the strength of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Rethoricke for
a season, will quickly finde a fire proceeding out of that newly enthroned
Doctrine, preying upon and consuming all their Joy, Peace, and Consolation,
or (which I rather hope) a fire proceeding out of their Faith, (the Faith once
delivered to the Saints) to the utter confusion &amp; consumption of this <hi>bramble</hi>
scratching errour in the meane time if the eminent appearance of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of the Saints of God, in this Nation (whereof many are fallen asleepe,
and many continue to this day) testifying and bearing witnesse to the Joy
&amp; Consolation they have found, &amp; that upon Spirituall demonstrative grounds
in being cast into the mould of the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance for
many dayes, be of no weight with Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I know not why his single
Testimony (which yet as to the matter of fact I no way question) concerning
some few Persons by himselfe seduced, into a perswasion of their Apostacy,
blessing God for the discovery made to them (the constant Practise of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in their first intanglement, in the foulest and grossest errours whatever)
should sway us much to any good liking of it.</p>
            <p>The influence of the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> into their conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
hath been sufficiently already evinced, when we manifested, the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their Faith and Love, the conquest of their feare and troubles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
so that I shall not need, farther to insist thereon. It was in my thoughts
indeed, to have handled the nature of Gospell Consolation, <hi>that which God is
so abundantly willing the heires of promise should receive,</hi> at large, both as to the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59070:216"/>
nature and Causes of it, the meanes of its preservation; The oppositions that
lye against it: and by all the Considerations of it, to have manifested, That it
is utterly impossible to keep it alive one moment in the heart of a Believer,
without the contribution of supportment it receives from the Doctrine in
hand. And that those who refuse to receive it, as usually delivered, indeed
have none, nor can have any drop of it, but what is instilled into them, from,
and by the power and efficacy, which secretly in and upon their hearts that
truth hath, which in words they oppose: all their peace and comfort, being
indeed absolutely proportioned, to that which the Doctrine of the Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
tends to confirme, and to nothing else. But this Discourse grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under my hands beyond all thought or expectation, I shall now only keep
close to the removall of the Exceptions made against it, and hasten to a
close.</p>
            <p>I must not leave this Argument,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> without taking notice of the <hi>Medium,</hi>
whereby M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> supposeth himselfe to have confirmed the truth of the
assumption, laid downe at the entrance, or, to have manifested <hi>the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion</hi>
(as he phrases it) <hi>of that nurse he hath provided</hi> for the Consolation of
the Saints (a Nurse with breasts of flint, and a heart of Iron, hath, this Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell

hireling, doing not the least service for God, but labouring to stirre
up strife in his Family, to set his poore children, and their heavenly Father at

            <p>The Consolation of true Believers, depends upon their obedience, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

which God is willing Believers should receive; whence it flowes; the

on our own Obedience, hath been in part before declared; But yet if
the next Assertion can be made good, <hi>(viz.) That the Doctrine of the Saints
Apostasy, hath a tendency instituted of God, to the promotion of their Obedience
and Holinesse,</hi> I shall not contend about the other, concerning the issuing of
their consolation from thence. All that really is offered in the behalfe of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy,
as to its serviceablenesse in this kind is, that it is suited, to ingenerate in
Believers, a feare of Hell, which will put them upon all wayes of mortifying
the flesh, and the fruits of it, which otherwise would bring them thereunto:
And is this indeed the great mistery of the Gospell? Is this Christs way of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with his Saints? Or is it not a <hi>falling from Grace,</hi> to returne againe unto
the Law? Those of whom alone we speak, who are concerned in this busines
are all of them taken into the Glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God, are every
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59070:217"/>
one of them partakers of that Spirit with whom is liberty, are all indued with
a living principle of Grace, Faith and Love, and are constrained by the Love
of Christ to live to him, are all under Grace and not under the Law, have
their sinnes in some measure begun to be mortifyed, and the flesh with the
lusts thereof, the old man, with all his wayes and wiles crucifyed, by the
Death and Crosse of Christ, brought with their power and efficacy by the
Spirit into their hearts, are all delivered from that bondage wherein they were
for feare of Death and Hell all their dayes, by having Christ made <hi>Redemption</hi>
unto them? I say that these persons should be most effectually stirred
up to Obedience, by the dread and terrour of that Iron rod, of vengeance
and Hell, and that they should be so, by Gods appointment, is such a new, such
another Gospell, as if preached by an Angell from Heaven, we should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
That indeed no motive can be taken from hence, or from any thing in
the Doctrine by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> contended for, suited to the principle of Gospell
Obedience in the Saints, that no sin or lust whatsoever was ever mortifyed
by it, that it is a clog, hinderance &amp; burthen to all Saints as far as they have to
do with it, in the wayes of God, hath bin before demonstrated: And therefore
leaving it withall the Consolation that it affords, unto those who of God are
given up thereunto, we proceed to the Consideration of another Argument
his eighth in this case which is thus proposed Sect. 37.</p>
            <p>That Doctrine which evacuates and turnes into weakenesse and folly,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
councells of the Holy Ghost, which consist partly in the diligent information
which he gives unto the Saints from place to place, concerning the hostile, cruell
and bloudy mind and intention of Sathan against them, partly in detecting and
making knowne all his subtile stratagems, his plots, methods, and dangerous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
against them, partly also in furnishing them wiih speciall weapons of all
sorts, whereby they may be able to grapple with him, and to tryumph over him,
partly againe in those frequent admonitions and Exhortations, to quit themselves
like men in resisting him, which are found in the Scripture: And lastly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
his feare least Sathan should circumvent and deceive them, that Doctrine I
say which reflects disparagement and vanity upon all these most serious and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
applycations of the Holy Ghost, must needs be a Doctrine of vanity and errour,
And consequently that which opposeth it by a like necessity, a truth: But such is the
common Doctrine of absolute and infallible Perseverance: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Not to ingage into any needlesse contest about wayes of Arguing,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
when the designe and strength of the Argument is evident, I shall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke
two things upon this.</p>
            <p>First the Holy Ghost professing his feare least Sathan should beguile Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
is a mistake. It was <hi>Paul</hi> that was so afraid, not the Holy Ghost, though
he <hi>wrote that feare,</hi> by the appointment and inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
The Apostle was jealous least the Saints should by the craft of Sathan be sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into errours and miscarriages; which yet argues not their finall defection,
this indeed he records of himselfe; but of the feares of the Holy Ghost arising
from his uncertainty of those issue of the things and want of power to prevent
the coming on of the things feared, I suppose there is no mention. And</p>
            <p>Secondly that the consequent of the supposition in the inference made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, is not so cleare to me as to Mr <hi>Goodwin. viz. Suppose any Doctrine
to be false, whatsoever Doctrine is set up in opposition to it, is true;</hi> I have
knowne and so hath Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> also, when the truth hath layen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
opposite Doctrines, assaulted by both, entertained by neither; with
these Observations I passe the Major of this <hi>Sillogisme</hi> the Minor he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:59070:217"/>
If the Saints be in no possibility of being finally overcome by Satan, or of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying
in the great and most important businesse of their Salvation by his snares
and subtilties,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> all that operousnesse, and diligence of the Holy Ghost, in those late
mentioned Addressements of his unto them, in order to their finall conquest over
Satan, will be found of very light consequence, of little concernement to them:
yea if the said Addressements of the Holy Ghost, be compared, with the State and
Condition of the Saints, as the said Doctrine of Perseverance representeth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
it to be, the utter uselesnesse, and impertinency of them, will much more
evidently appeare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What possibility or not possibility the Saints are in, of finall Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
from God, what assurance themselves have, may have, or have not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their <hi>Perseverance,</hi> with what is the use of Admonitions and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to them in that condition, hath been already declared; for the present,
I shall only adde; That let their finall Apostasy, in respect of the Event, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so impossible, yet in the state and condition wherein they are, and from
the things which they are exercised about, with the Principles on which they
proceed, and the wayes whereby they are led on, considerations enough, may
be raised to set forth those Exhortations, Admonitions, and Encouragements,
appointed by the Holy Ghost, to be used and insisted on, in the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Word, in the Beauty and splendor of infinite Wisdome, Love, and
Kindnesse. The glory of God being so eminently concerned, as it is, in the
Obedience, and fruitfulnesse of the Saints; the honour of the Lord Jesus in
this World, with the advancement, and propagation of the Gospell, in like
manner relating there unto; Their own peace lying so much, as it doth upon
their close walking with God, the spirit being so grieved by their falling into
sinne, as he is, God so dishonoured, and themselves exposed to such fearfull
desertions, darknesse, trouble, sorrow, and disquietments as they are, upon
their being overcome by the temptations of Satan, and prevailed upon to
turne aside into waies and sinnes, short of totall Apostasy, and it being the
purpose of the Lord, to lead them on in obedience, in wayes suitable to that
<hi>nature,</hi> he created them withall, and that <hi>New nature</hi> wherewith he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
them, (both apt to be wrought upon by Motives, Exhortations, and
Perswasions) without any such supposall, as that of finall Apostasy; There is
a sufficient bottome and foundation of exalting the motives and admonitions
insisted on, to the possession of that Glory, of Wisdome, and Goodnesse which
is their due. But M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> having borrowed another <hi>Pageant</hi> from the
<hi>Remonstrants,</hi> had a great mind to shew it to the World, in its English dresse,
and therefore introduces the Holy Ghost, thus speaking in the Admonitions
above pointed at.</p>
            <p>Suppose we then the Holy-Ghost should speake thus unto the Saints,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> Oh yee that
truly Believe, who by vertue of the promises of that God that cannot lye, are fully
perswaded and possest that ye shall be kept by God, by his irresistible Grace, in true
Faith untill Death; so that though Satan should set all his witts on worke, and by
all his stratagems, snares, and cunning devices, seek to destroy you, yea though he
should entice you away from God, by the allurements of the World, and entangle
you with them againe, yea and should cause you to runne and rush headlong against
the Light of your own Consciences, into all manner of horrid sinnes, yet shall all
his attempts and assaults upon you in every kind be in vain, &amp; you shall be in never
the more danger, or possibility of perishing: Vnto you (I say) attend and consider
how sore and dangerous a contest you are like to be ingaged in, for you are to wrestle
not against Flesh and Bloud, but against Principalities and Powers, the governors
of this World, and spirituall wickednesses, against that old Serpent the Divell, the
great red Dragon who was a murtherer from the beginning, and who still goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59070:218"/>
like a roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may devoure, Who will set himselfe
with all his might, to thrust you headlong into all manner of sinnes, and so to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
'tweene you and your God for ever; And truly I am afraid, least as the Serpent
by his subtilty deceived Eve, so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity
which is in Jesus Christ, least the tempter should any way tempt you, and my labour
about you be in vaine; Therefore Watch, Pray, Resist him stedfast in the Faith;
Take unto you the whole armour of God, that you may be able to resist in an evill
day, and having done all things stand fast; Stand having your loines girt with the
girdle of truth, and the brestplate of Righteousnesse upon you: Would such an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or speech as this be any way worthy the Infinite wisedome of the Holy Ghost?
Or is it not the part of a very weake and simple person to admonish a man and that
in a most serious and solemne manner of a danger threatning him, or hanging over
his head, and withall to instruct him with great variety of direction and caution
how to escape this danger, when as both himselfe knows, and the person admonished
knowes likewise that it is a thing altogether impossible that ever the danger should
befall him, or the evill against which he is so solemnely cautioned come upon him?
Therefore those who make the Holy Ghost to have part and fellowship in such weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as this are most insufferably injurious unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To support the Stage for to act this part of the pageant in hand upon,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note>
there are many supposalls fixed by our Author, that are to beare up the
weight of the whole, which upon tryall will appeare to arrant false preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
painted anticks, that have not the least strength or efficacy for the end
and purpose whereunto they are applied.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> 'Tis supposed, that the end of all these admonitions, is meerely and
solely to prevent the Saints from finall Apostasy; and that they are to beware
of the wiles and assaults of Satan, only least he prevaile over them, to cause
them to depart utterly from God; That this is supposed in this discourse is
evident, because upon the granting of a promise, that they shall not be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against, they are judged all uselesse and ridiculous: Now who knows
not but that Satan may winnow, and in some measure prevaile against the
Saints, to the Dishonour of God, the Reproach of the Gospell, Grieving of
the Spirit, and Scandall of the Church, although they fall not totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
from God; And that many of those Admonitions, tend to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Believers, from such <hi>falls</hi> and <hi>failings,</hi> is more evident than to need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Demonstration by consideration of the particular instances.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> It supposeth as is exprest, that Believers may fall into <hi>all manner
of horrid sinnes and Abominations,</hi> which is the thing in Question, and by us
punctually denied: What ever their surprizalls may be, yet there are sinnes
which they cannot fall into: and the great abomination of every sinne, that
'tis committed with the whole heart, and with full consent, they are not at all
exposed or liable unto, as hath been proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§ 12.</note> That there is an inconsistency between Promises and Precepts, in
reference to the same Object; that God should promise to worke any thing
effectually in us, and yet require it of us, is thought ridiculous, and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the great folly here imputed to the discourse framed for the Holy
Ghost, is proposed to consist in this, that God should exhort us, to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the assaults of the Divell, and yet promise that by his Grace, he will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
work in us, &amp; for us, the very same thing; A supposall destructive to
the whole nature of the New-Covenant, easily disproved by innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">§.
13.</note> That Believers are to be wrought upon to obedience alwaies,
whatever the frame of their spirits be, by the same waies and meanes;
Thence 'tis that promises, promises of highest and greatest assurance, are
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59070:218"/>
in this discourse, coupled with cautions of the deepest charge, as though they
must at the same time operate the same way to Believers, or else the Holy-Ghost
be liable to be traduced, as inconsistent with himselfe. When the great
variety that is in their spirituall frame and temper, the manifold Temptations
wherewith they are assaulted, the Light and Darke places they walke
through &amp;c. give occasion sufficient to the exercising towards them, all the
<hi>piping</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> that is provided for them.</p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> That all Believers are assured of their Perseverance, &amp; that to such a
degree as not to feare any Apostasy, or to care what becomes of them (that
is assured to presumption not Believing,) &amp; therefore are those Cautions and
Admonitions of the Holy Ghost on that Account, tending to stirre up in them
any Godly care or feare rendred frustrate; when M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe, thinks
that very few of them, doe upon any good and abiding foundation, know
themselves to be Believers. And we never once supposed that all of them
have Assurance of their Perseverance, nor any of them upon the <hi>termes</hi> here
proposed; all the strength of what is here insinuated lyes in this that God
gives Assurance to men of the stedfastnesse, and constancy of his Love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
supposall of their falling into all manner of abominable sinnes; Which
supposall alone renders an inconsistency between the sence of the Promises we
embrace, and that of the Admonitions that are given to the Saints charging
them to walke heedfully and to watch diligently against the attempts and
assaults of Sathan. Now this supposall is in it selfe false and ridiculous: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever did the Lord, nor do we ever say he did, tender men Assurance
of his Love on such termes; Neither is it possible for any one for ever to have
a true perswasion of his owne <hi>Perseverance</hi> under such notions.</p>
            <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">§: 15.</note> That there is an inconsistency betwixt Faithfull Promises of <hi>attaining</hi>
an <hi>end</hi> by the use of <hi>meanes,</hi> and Exhortation with Admonitions, to make use of
those <hi>meanes;</hi> so that if it be supposed that God promiseth that Sathan shall
not in the issue prevaile over us prescribing to us the meanes whereby we
shall be preserved from his prevalency, 'tis in vaine to deale with us for the
application of our selves, unto the use of those meanes.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> 'Tis also supposed that an <hi>Assurance</hi> of the Love of God and
the continuance of it to the Saints unto the end, so that they shall be never
utterly rejected by him is an effectuall way &amp; meanes to induce them to carnall
&amp; loose walking, and a negligence in those things, which are a provocation to
the eyes of his Glory, and therefore if he Promise Faithfully <hi>never to leave us
nor forsake us,</hi> it is an inducement for us to conclude, let the Divell now take
his swing &amp; do with us what he pleaseth. To exhort us to take care for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance
of his subtiltyes and opposition is a thing altogether ridiculous;
The vanity of this supposall, hath been sufficiently before discovered and it
selfe disproved.</p>
            <p>Upon such Hypotheses as these (I say) upon such painted posts,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> is the whole
pageant erected which we are here ingaged withall; and these being easily
cast down, the whole rushes to the ground, in the roome whereof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our principles this following Discourse may be supplyed.</p>
            <p>You that are true Believers,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> called, Justifyed, Sanctifyed by the Spirit and
Bloud of Christ, adopted into my family ingrafted in, &amp; united unto the Son
of my Love, I know your weakenesse, insufficiency, disability, darkenesse, how
that without my Sonne and continuall supply of his Spirit, you can do nothing,
the power of your Indwelling sinne, is not hid from me, how with violence
it leads you captive to the Law thereof, and though ye do believe, yet I know
you have yet also some unheal'd unbeliefe and on that account are often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed
with Feares, Sorrowes, Disconsolations and Troubles, and are
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59070:219"/>
ready often to thinke that your way is passed over form me, and your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hidden from your God: And in this Condition, I know the Assaults,
Temptations, and Oppositions of Sathan that you are exposed to, how he
goes up and downe like a roaring Lion seeking to destroy you, his wayes, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
wiles and baits (that he layes for you, and whereby he seekes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
you) are many, he acts against you as a Serpent subtilly and wisely; as a
Lyon dreadfully and fearefully, and with snares not of you, by your selves to
be resisted: you have Principallityes, and Powers to wrestle withall, and the
darts of the wicked one to defend your selves against, Wherefore beware of
him, be not ignorant of his devices, stand fast in the Faith, take to you the
whole armour of God, resist him, overcome him, cast him out by prayer, and
the bloud of the Lambe, watch night and day that you be not surprised nor
seduced (as <hi>Eve</hi> was) by him, that he turne you not out of the way into pathes
leading to destruction, and thrust you headlong, into such sinnes as will be a
dishonour to me, a griefe to my Spirit a scaudall to the Church, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to your owne soules; And as for me, who know your disability of your
selves to do any of these things, and so to hold to the end, because it pleased
me to love you, &amp; set my heart upon you, having chosen you before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world, that you should be holy and unblameable before me in
Love, &amp; having given my only Sonne unto you, who is your peace &amp; through
whom you have received the Attonement, with whom I will not deny
you or withhold from you any thing that may safeguard your abiding with
me unto Salvation, I will through the riches of my Grace, worke all your
workes for you, fulfilling in you all the good pleasure of my Goodnesse &amp; the
worke of Faith with power, I will tread down Sathan, this cruell, proud,
Malicious, bloudy enemy of your Soules, under your feet, and though at any
time he soile you, yet ye shall not be cast down, for I will take you up, and
will certainly preserve you by my power, to the end of your hope, the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your soules; whatever betide you, or befall you, I will never leave
you, nor forsake you, the mountaines may depart and the hills be removed,
but my kindnesse shall never be removed from you, comfort ye, be of good
courage, and runne with joy the race that is set before you.</p>
            <p>This (I say) is the language which according to the tenour of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
whose maintenance we are ingaged in, God speakes to his Saints and
Believers, and if there be folly and inconsistency found therein, let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
vindicate and plead for themselves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the close of this Discourse of our Author, charging this
course of proceedure with folly; <hi>viz.</hi> To give admonition to the use of
meanes, when the end is certainely determined to issue upon the use of those
meanes, he must first evince it as to the application of it to the businesse in
hand, before I can close with him in the managing thereof: for the present I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think the folly of this charge, as far as it lookes towards the <hi>Doctrine</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consideration to arise from other things. As</p>
            <p>First, An <hi>Impertinent comparison</hi> instituted between God and man in their
Admonitions and dealings with men; as though nothing might beseeme him
in Spirituall <hi>things</hi> of eternall concernement, but what is squared to the
rules of our proceedings one towards another, in things Naturall or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A false supposall that the end is promised and assured to any,
without or besides the use of <hi>meanes,</hi> or walking according to the rules, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and instructions given for that purpose, or for Attainement of the end so
promised. Now what folly there is to charge men to use <hi>meanes</hi> for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of an <hi>end,</hi> when they are, although Exhorted, also Assured, that in their so
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59070:219"/>
doing, they shall attaine the end aimed at, is yet under contest? And
may passe for the present with those other Ridiculous supposalls, formerly
mentioned.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> proceedes farther in the vindication of this Argument
<hi>Sect.</hi> 38.<note place="margin">§. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas (<hi>saith he</hi>) they still plead, or pretend rather, that such admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as these lately specifyed may well stand with an unconditioned Promise of
Perseverance, we have formerly shewed, that they are not able to make good this
plea, nor to give any reasonable account of it, whereas they adde that their sence and
opinion is not, that tis a thing absolutely or every way impossible for true Believers
to fall away totally or finally from their Faith, but that they willingly grant that
true Believers what through their owne weakenesse, and what through the subtile
baites and temptations of Sathan may so fall away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer, But this is but a fig-leafe sought out to cover the nakednesse of their
Opinion, which hath no strength at all nor weight in it. For what though it were in
a thousand other respects never so possible for true Believers to perish, yet if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impossible in such a respect which over rules all those others, and which
will &amp; of necessity must hinder the comming of it to passe, all those other notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
'tis to be judged simply and absolutely impossible, and all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
wereby tis pretended possible are not to be brought into account in such a
case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> Whether we are able to make good our <hi>plea</hi> concerning the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
of <hi>Admonitions</hi> with the Promises of Perseverance, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is not
the sole Judge; Neither do either we, or our plea stand or fall at his Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
What hath been lately spoken for the reinforcement of that <hi>plea</hi> against
his Exceptions, he may if he please, take time to consider.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For what is now added in this place as a part of that <hi>plea</hi> of ours,
as tis here proposed we owne not; We doenot grant that true Believers may
fall away on any account whatever <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally,</hi> if the expression, <hi>may
fall away,</hi> relate to the issue and event; We say indeed that by the temptations
of <hi>Sathan</hi> Believers may be prevailed against, to the committing of many sins,
the root whereof is in themselves, whilst the lust remaines in them which
tempteth and insnareth them, whereby God may be dishononred, and their
own Consciences wounded, which is a sufficient ground and bottome for all
the <hi>Admonitions</hi> that are given them to beware of his deceits, to strengthen
themselves against his assaults, to be built upon, though through the Grace &amp;
Faithfulnesse of God and his goodwill manifested, and secured unto them in
his Covenant and Promises, he can never <hi>totally</hi> prevaile against them.</p>
            <p>We say moreover, that 'tis not from Believers themselves, nor any thing in
them, nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Faith that they have received, that they cannot so fall <hi>finally</hi>
away; there being in them a pronenes to sin, &amp; the seed of all sin still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yea a <hi>root of bitternes</hi> ready to spring up &amp; trouble them; but from those
outward principles of the Will, Purposes, Covenant &amp; Promises of God which
we have formerly insisted on. Farther, that there is no need of granting any
such <hi>possibility</hi> taking that terme, as relating to the issue and event, and not
the internall principle of operation in men, to manifest the Harmony that is
between the <hi>Admonitions</hi> under consideration, and the <hi>Promises</hi> we have insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on; it being sufficiently evinced on other considerations; So that Mr
<hi>Goodwins</hi> ensuing Discourse concerning <hi>Absolute Impossibility</hi> is not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to any thing that we have asserted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Neither yet doth the Reason by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> produced, in any
measure convince what he intends though <hi>we</hi> be not concerned therein; He
will not easily perswade us that that which is possible in any respect, much
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59070:220"/>
lesse in many, and impossible only in one, is alwayes to be judged <hi>Simply</hi>
and <hi>Absolutely</hi> impossible; much lesse are we concerned in it, who say that
<hi>Simply</hi> and <hi>Absolutely</hi> the falling away of Believers is Possible, namely, as the
terme <hi>possible</hi> relates to the principle of operation in them; But in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
only it is impossible, that is, not of it selfe, but in respect of the <hi>externall</hi>
prohibiting cause. It was Absolutely and simply possible, that the <hi>bones</hi> of
our Saviour should have been <hi>broken,</hi> in the nature of the thing it selfe: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
in respect of the decree of God; So are a thousand things Absolutely
<hi>possible</hi> in their owne nature, as to the power of the causes whereby they

cause; Absolutely possible in respect of their proper cause and principle; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
in respect of the event, upon the the account of some externall prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
cause as was shewed. So 'tis in the businesse in hand; We assert not
any possibility in respect of the event; As though in the issue it might so come
to passe, that Believers should fall <hi>totally</hi> and finally from God, which is the
thing we oppose: but it grant, in respect of the causes of such apostacy, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the nature of the thing it selfe; Though how the possibility might
be reduced into act Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> cannot declare; As for the close of this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the <hi>Absolute, Peremptory, irresistible decrce</hi> of Perseverance
which he ascribes to us as our assertion, when he shall have convinced us
of the <hi>Conditionall, Non-peremptory, reversible decree</hi> of God, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to introduce in the place thereof, he may here more of us, in the meane

            <p>
               <hi>Section</hi> 39.<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> 40. he seekes to alleviate the instance commonly given of our
Saviour Christ, who though assured of the <hi>end,</hi> (and in respect of whom 'twas
utterly <hi>impossible</hi> that his glorious exaltation, should not follow in the issue, he
being wholly out of all danger of being detained under the power of Death,)
yet he Laboured, and prayed, and fasted, and resisted <hi>Satans</hi> temptations, and
watched against him, and dealt with him, by weapons taken out of the word
of God; And in especiall when the Divell urged him with the argument in
hand, <hi>that there is no need of meanes or the using of them, when there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the end, and an impossibility that it should otherwise fall out, or the End
not be brought about and accomplished,</hi> as he did when he tempted him to <hi>cast
himselfe headlong from a pinacle of the Temple</hi> because the <hi>Angells had charge
over him, that not so much as his foot should be hurt against a stone, whatever he
did,</hi> as Sathan intimated, which is the tenour of the Argument wherewith we
have to doe, he returnes to him the very Answer that we insist upon, <hi>viz.</hi>
that though it be the good pleasure of God to bring us to the <hi>end</hi> we aime at,
yet are we not to tempt him by a neglect of the <hi>meanes</hi> which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
'tis true, there are Arguments used to us that could have no place
with Christ, being taken from the Estate &amp; Condition of infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
through sinne, wherein we are; which is a ground only of an Inference,
that if Christ who was <hi>Holy, Harmelesse,</hi> undefiled, separate from sinners, did
yet watch and pray and contend against <hi>Sathan,</hi> much more should we do so.
But this doth not at all take off from the parity of Reason that is in case of
Diligent using of the <hi>meanes,</hi> for the compassing of the <hi>end,</hi> that in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is under an impossibility of not being accomplished; For the removeall
of this instance Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> enters into a large Discourse of the cause and
Reason vesting the Lord Christ with an immutability in good, and how 'tis
not competent to any Creature: which that it is, never entred into the thoughts
of any to assert that I ever heard of; Nor is it of the least importance to the
removeall of our <hi>Instances</hi> as to its serviceablenesse unto the end, for which
'tis produced; He tells us also, <hi>That in case men be caused necessit atingly and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59070:220"/>
unavoidably to act Righteously, it will take away all rewardablenesse from their
actings; And the Reason is, because such a necessitating of them, makes them meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passive they having not any internall principle of their owne to contract such a
necessity;</hi> which Discourse is pursued with many other words to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
And a Discourse it is</p>
            <p>First, Exceedingly <hi>Irrelative</hi> to the businesse in hand; there is not any thing
now under consideration, that should minister occasion at all, to consider the
manner of our yeilding Obedience, and the way of Gods Grace, in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the fruits thereof, but only of the consistency that is between Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
for the using of the <hi>meanes,</hi> when 'tis supposed impossible that the
<hi>end</hi> prevented by them should ever come to passe, which may, or may not be
so, whatever be the manner and way of our yeelding Obedience upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion
of the Efficacy of the Grace of God; Diversion is one of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi>
ordinary wayes of warding those blowes, which he is not able to beare.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>false,</hi> charging a crime on the Doctrine which he doth oppose
whereof it is not guilty; Neither it, nor they that maintaine it, affirming that
there is a <hi>necessitation</hi> upon the <hi>wills</hi> of men by the Grace of God, such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitation
as should in the least prejudice their freedome, or cause them
to elicite their acts as principles Naturall and necessary; All the necessity ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by them to the efficacy of the operation of the Grace of God, respects
only the <hi>event;</hi> They say 'tis necessary that the good be done, which God
workes in us by his Grace, when he workes it in us; but for the manner of its
doing, they say, tis wrought suitably to the state and Condition of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
principle whence tis to proceed, and doth so, and of the Agents whereby
tis wrought, which are free; Neither do they say that good is not wrought
by any <hi>Native</hi> and inward Principle that is in men, unlesse they will allow no
principle to be <hi>Native</hi> but what is in them by nature; And then indeed they
say, that though <hi>Naturally</hi> and <hi>Physically</hi> there is, yet <hi>Morally</hi> and <hi>Spiritually</hi>
there is not in them any <hi>Native</hi> principle to that which is Spiritually good;
seeing, in that sence <hi>no good thing dwells in men.</hi> But if it may suffice to evince
that they worke from a <hi>Native inward principle,</hi> that their wills which are
their Naturall facultyes, quickned, improved and heightned, by inward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
habits of Grace, properly theirs when bestowed on them, are the
principles of all their actings, then they assert them to worke no lesse from a
native internall principle than Christ himselfe did; So that notwithstanding
this diversion given in to supply the Absence of an Answer, the <hi>instance</hi> as to
that alone, wherein the parallell was intended, stands unmoved, and Mr
<hi>Goodwin</hi>'s whole charge of folly and inconsistency on the proceeding of the
Holy Ghost falls to the ground, which is the issue of his eight Argument in this
case; His last follows.</p>
            <p>The last Argument which he proposeth Sect.<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> 41. and ends his Chapter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
is faint, and as the droppings after a showre, will easily be blown over, he
thus proposeth it.</p>
            <p>That Doctrine which Naturally, and directly tendeth to beget and foment jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousyes,
and evill surmises between brethren in Christ, or such as ought cordially
to Love, Reverence and Honour one another is not confederate with the Gospell, nor
from God, and consequently, that which contradicteth it must needs be a truth: The
common Doctrine of unqnestionable and unconditioned Perseverance, is a Doctrine
of this tendency, apt to beget and foment jealousyes, suspicions and evill surmises
between brethren, or such as ought to Love and Respect one the other as brethren in
Christ: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Not to take notice of any thing by the by, which sundry Expressions
and one inference at the least, in this Argument do readily administer occasion
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59070:221"/>
unto. I awaite the proofe of the <hi>Minor,</hi> which in the following Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to this: <hi>That judging all those who fall finally away not to have been
true Believers, we cannot but have evill surmises, of all that stand, that they are
not true Believers, seeing as good as they have fallen away, hence jealousyes of their
Hypocrysy will arise.</hi> And he tells us for his part, he knowes no Christian in the
world, that he hath more reason to judge a true Believer, than he had to
judge some, who are turned wretched <hi>Apostates.</hi> To which I say
briefely,</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> I doubt not but Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> knowes fullwell, that this is not a Rule
given us to make a judgement of Believers by, with whom we walke, and
towards whom it is required we beare <hi>Love without dissimulation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
such as shew us their Faith by their workes; Our rule of walking from
the principle of Love, and Charity is layd downe in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And if all that
any man knowes at this day professours in this world, should turne Apostates,
save only <hi>one,</hi> and he had reckoned that one, and them that are Apostatized,
before their Apostasy, of the same ranke of Believers, and had no evill
thoughts of that one above the rest, he was bound without any evill surmises
to <hi>believe</hi> all things, and to <hi>hope</hi> all things, and not to let goe his sincere Love
towards that one, imbracing of him, delighting in him, holding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with
him to his lives end without suspicion of Hypocrisy, or other hard thoughts
of him unles he also should degenerate; 'Tis said <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23. That <hi>many believed</hi>
on Christ because of the profession of Faith that they made, &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 34. They
pray earnestly to be fed with the <hi>bread of Life;</hi> So that they were accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his <hi>Disciples v.</hi> 60. &amp; yet upon a temptation they left our Saviour, &amp; <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
no more with him, v.</hi> 66. Now notwithstanding the profession of these men
our Saviour plainely sayes, that they <hi>believed not, v.</hi> 64. They falling thus
away who had <hi>professed to believe,</hi> and were accounted <hi>as Believers,</hi> so <hi>called</hi>
and named among the Disciples of Christ, and Christ declaring on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Apostacy, that indeed they did never believe, how was it that
the remaining <hi>Twelve</hi> had not <hi>hard thoughts and jealousyes</hi> one of another,
(especially considering that there was one Hypocrite still left among them)
whether they had true Faith or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seeing our Saviour had declared that those
who so fell off, as those before mentioned, had none? Doubtlesse they were
instructed to walke by a better and streighter Rule, than that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> here
assignes to Believers; Let him who will or can fall away, whilst we are <hi>taught
of God to love one another,</hi> and are acted by the principle of Love which <hi>thinkes
no evill,</hi> and do contend against evill surmizes as the workes of the flesh;
There is not any thing in the least attending the discovery of one mans Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,
to worke us to a perswasion that another (not in any thing discovered)
is so also; that because we see some goodly house fall under stormes and
temptations to the ground, and so manifest it selfe to have been built on the
sand, that therefore we must conclude that those which stand, are not built
upon the Rocke, is not suited to any principle or Rule that our <hi>Master</hi> hath
given us to walke by, in order to the exercise of that Love, which he calleth for
in us towards one another.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> I say this way of proceeding in our thoughts and judgements
doth the Holy Ghost lead us to: 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. The Apostle giving an account
of some who had formerly walked with him in the profession of the Faith,
and of the <hi>fellowship</hi> which they had with the <hi>Father and Sonne,</hi> fell away from
Christ into an opposition against him, so farre as to deserve the title of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
having not only forsaken the Gospell, but making it also their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to oppose it, and to seduce others from the simplicity of the same; These
he informes the scattered Believers of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were Apostates, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59070:221"/>
walked with them, but deserted their fellowship, and thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
themselves never to have been true Believers, nor ever indeed to have
had <hi>fellowship with the Father and the Sonne,</hi> no more than they of whom our
Saviour spake in the place before mentioned; And yet doubtlesse the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
may not be supposed to lay a foundation for jealousyes, evill suspicions,
and surmises among Believers, though he plainely and evidently affirme that
those who fall away were never true Believers, and that if they had been so,
they would have continued in their Faith and fellowship with the people of
God. <hi>They went ous from us</hi> (saith he) <hi>but they were not of us, for if they had
been of us, they would (no doubt) have continued with us, but they went out, that
they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A passage (by the way) clearely confirming the maine of the Doctrine we
have hitherto insisted on;<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> And therefore I shall turne aside, before I come to
the close of this Chapter, having this occasion administred, to vindicate it
from the exceptions Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> gives in against the Testimony it beares in
this case.</p>
            <p>The Argument that it readily furnisheth us withall, is of this import,<note place="margin">§: 27.</note> 
               <hi>If all
they who fall away totally from the fellowship, and society of the Church, and
Saints of God, what ever their profession were before that Apostasy, were never true
Believers, and are thereby manifested never to have been so, then those who are
true Believers cannot fall away:</hi> But <hi>the First is true, therefore the latter;</hi> The
words are so disposed as to be cast into an <hi>Hypotheticall Proposition,</hi> which vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
includes a doubleArgument as every <hi>discrete Axiome</hi> doth; 'tis not thus,
therefore thus; If true Believers might so depart and Apostatise as those here
mentioned, no unquestionable proofe could be drawne from such Apostacy,
that men were never true Believers, which yet is plainely insisted on, in the
Text.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> Cap.<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> 10. Sect. 21, 22, 23, 24. Pag. 189, 190, 191, 192. gathers up
sundry Exceptions from the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> which, (as they also did) he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to this Interpretation of the words, and the Inferences from them insisted
on; I shall briefely consider and remove them in that order as by him they are
laid downe. He saith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> This Inference presumeth many things, for which neither it, nor any the
Authors of it, will ever be able to give any good security of proofe, As</p>
            <p>First, That this phrase [they were not of us] imports that they were never true
Believers; this certainly can never be proved, because there is another sence, and
this every whit as proper to the words, and more commodious for the Context, and
scope of the place, which may be given of them, as we shall see anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> That there is not any thing presumed for the eduction of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
proposed, but what is either directly exprest, or evidently included, in
the words of the Text, will appeare in the farther consideration of what M.
<hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to offer to the contrary. That expression [<hi>they were not of us</hi>]
imports evidently, that they were not of them, in the fellowship and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
which he was now exhorting Believers to continue and abide in. He
tells them at the head of this Discourse Cap. 1. 3. that the end of his writing to
them, was to draw them into, and keep them in communion with himselfe,
and the Saints with him; which <hi>Communion or Fellowship,</hi> he tells them, <hi>they
had with the Father and the Sonne.</hi> But as for the Persons, of whom in these
words he is speaking to them, describing them by their former and present
condition, with the causes of it, he tells them, that though they abode with
them for a season, yet they were never of them, as to the <hi>Communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
they had with the Father and Sonne,</hi> and so were never true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church; The only reason M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> gives to Invalidate this
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59070:222"/>
sence of the Words is, that he is able to give <hi>another meaning of them</hi> (in his
own judgement) <hi>more proper to the words, and more commodious to the scope of
the place:</hi> which whether it have any more efficacy to take in the force and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of the Interpretation given, lying plaine and cleare in the first view of
the words, and Context, than it hath to evade the eduction of any Truth
whatever, from any place of Scripture whatever, seeing some or other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves able to give another sence of the words, let the Reader
judge: But he adds</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 30.</note> That this Expression [they were of us] signifies that they were true
Believers is presumed; of the uncertainty of this supposition we shall (<hi>saith he</hi>) give
the like account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> When we come to take M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s farther Account, we shall be
able (I make no doubt) to reckon with him, and to discharge his Bill; In the
meane time, we say, that supposition [<hi>if they had been of us</hi>] (whence our Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is made) evidently includes a <hi>fellowship and communion</hi> with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
&amp; true Believers in their fellowship with God, which is asserted as a certain
Foundation of mens abiding in the communion of the Saints.</p>
            <p>But saies he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> 
               <hi>tis supposed, that these words [they went out from us] signifie their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
defection, or abdication of the Apostles communion, or their totall and finall
renunciation of Christ, his Church, and Gospell; This supposition hath no bottome
at all, or colour for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Divide not the words from their coherence, and the intendment of
the place, and the signification denyed is too evident and cleare for any one,
with the <hi>least colour of Reason,</hi> to rise up against it; They went out, so out
from the communion of the Church, as to become <hi>Anti-Christs,</hi> opposers of
Christ, and seducers from him; and certainly in so doing, did totally desert
the Communion of the Apostle, renounce the Lord Christ, as by him Preacht,
and forsooke utterly both Church and Gospell, as to any fellowship with the
one or the other: And we know full well, what is the bottome of this and the
like Assertions, <hi>that such and such things have no bottome at all;</hi> which never yet
failed M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> at his need.</p>
            <p>Fourthly (<hi>saith he</hi>)<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> 'Tis supposed that this clause [<hi>they would no doubt have
continued with us</hi>] signifies they would have continued in the same Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we Persevere and continue; nor is there (saith he) any competent Reason to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
this sence of those words, because neither doth the Grammaticall tenour of
them require it, and much lesse the scope of the passage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Fellowship <hi>John</hi> invited Believers unto, and to continue in, (as
hath been often observed with him,) and the Saints with him, was <hi>that</hi> which
they held with the <hi>Father and the Sonne,</hi> to continue with them therein, in
the <hi>Litterall Grammaticall</hi> sence of the words, is to continue in the <hi>Faith:</hi> It
being Faith whereby they have that fellowship or Communion; this also is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
from the scope of the whole passage, and is here only impotently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
But saith he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, The said Inference supposeth that John certainly knew, that all those who
for the present remained in his communion, were true Believers, for, if they were
not true believers, they that were gone out from them in the sence contended for,
might be said to be of them, that is, persons of the same condition with them; But
how improbable this is, I meane that John should infallibly know, that all those
who as yet continued with them, were true Believers, I referre to consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Had M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> a little poised this passage before he took it up, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he would have cast it away, as an uselesse trifle; But his masters having
insisted on it, perhaps he thought it not meet to question their judgements, in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59070:222"/>
least, for feare of being at liberty to deale so with them in matters of greater
importance. I say then that there is not the least coulour for any such suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
from the inference we make from the text; nor is there any thing of that
nature intimated, or suggested in the words, or Argument from them; the
body of them whom the Apostates forsooke, were true Believers; and their
abiding in the fellowship of the Saints, was a manifestation of it sufficient for
them to be owned as such, which the others manifested themselves never
to have been, by their Apostacy. But saith he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 33.</note> 
               <hi>The inference under contest yet farther supposeth, that John certainely
knew, that they who were now gon out from them, neither were, now, nor ever
before true Believers, yea and that he certainely knew this by their departure or
going out from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the very thing that the Apostle affirmes, that he certainely
knew those Apostates never to have been true Believers, and that by their
Apostacy, or falling totally from the Gospell, becomming seducers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of Christ; Let him argue it out with the Holy Ghost, if he can, whose
plaine and cleare expression this is, and that confirmed by the insuing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Perseverance of them who were true Believers, and whose fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
is with the Saints, in their <hi>communion with the Father and the Sonne;</hi>
Wherefore saith he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly it presumeth yet farther that all true Believers do alwayes abide in the
externall communion of the Church;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 34.</note> 
               <hi>and that when men do not so abide they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare herein, that they never were true Believers, which is not only a manifest
untruth, but expressly contrary to the Doctrine it selfe, of those men who assert the
inference; for they teach (as we heard before) that a true Believer may fall so foulely
and so farre, that the Church according to the command of Christ, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to testify that shee cannot tolerate them in her externall communion, nor
that ever they shall have any part or portion in the Kingdome of Christ, unlesse they
repent; Doubtlesse to be cast out of the Church according to the institution and
command of Christ (who commands no such thing but upon very heinous and high
unchristian misdemeanours) is of every whit as sad importance, as a voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of the Churches communion can be for a season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It supposeth that no true Believers fall <hi>so</hi> off from the Church, as to
become <hi>Antichrist</hi>'s, opposers of Christ, and the Church, so as to deny that
<hi>Christ is come in the flesh,</hi> which was the great busines of the Antichrists in those
dayes; Tis true, and granted by us, that a true Believer may forsake the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
communion of some particular Church for a season, yea and that upon
his irregular walking and not according to the rule of Christ, he may by the
Authority of such a Church, be rejected from its communion for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and recovery into the right way, of which before: But that a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
can voluntarily desert the communion of the Saints, and become an
Antichrist, that this text denyes, and we from it, and the many other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the same truth, that have been produced: Notwithstanding then all
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> exceptions, there is nothing presumed in the <hi>inference,</hi> we make
from these words, but what is either <hi>expressly</hi> contained, or <hi>evidently</hi> included
in them.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will not thus give over,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> he prefers his exceptions to this
Testimony in another whole <hi>Section:</hi> which because the Demonstration of the
truth in hand from this place, though here handled by the <hi>by,</hi> is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and such as by its single strength, is sufficient utterly to cast to the
ground the figment set up in opposition to it, I shall present entirely to the
Reader (that our Authour may be heard out and nothing omitted that he
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59070:223"/>
pleads, for the waving of the force of the Argument in hand) that whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Thus then he proceeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppose that these two suppositions be granted to the Inference makers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> 
               <hi>First,
That this phrase [to goe out from us] signifies voluntarily to forsake the society and
communion of Christians; And Secondly, That this expression [to be of us] signifies
true and inward communion with those from whom they went out, yet will not these
contributions suffice, for the firme building of the said Inference; The Reason is,
Because the Apostle expressely saith; that they would have continued with [us,] not
that they would have continued such, as they were, in respect of the Truth or Essence
of their Faith; and if the Apostles scope in this place were to prove or affirme, that
they who are once true Christians, or Believers, alwaies continue such, then, when
he saith they would have continued with us, he must of necessity meane, either that
they would have continued Faithfull as we continue Faithfull, or else that they
would have continued alwaies in our society, or in the profession of Christianity:
But that neither of these sences are of any tolerable consistency, is evident, by the
light of this Consideration, viz. That the Apostle then must have known, that the
persons hee speakes of, and who went out from them, neither were nor ever had been
true Christian Believers, when they went thus from them; Now if he had this
knowledge of them, it must be supposed either that he had it by extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
(but this is very improbable, and howsoever cannot be proved;) or else
that he gain'd and obtain'd it by their departure or going out from them; but that
this could be no sufficient Argument or ground, to beget any such knowledge in the
Apostle concerning them, is evident from hence, Because it may very easily, and
doth very frequently come to passe, That they who are true Christians, doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
continue in the society to which they have joyned themselves, no nor yet in
the externall profession of Christianity it selfe; yea, our opposers themselves, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and without scruple teach, that even true believers themselves, may through
Feare, or shame, or extremity of sufferings, be brought to deny Christ, and without
any danger of being ship-wrack't of their Faith forbeare making a profession of
the name of Christ afterwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§: 37.</note> First, What is meant and Intended by those expressions [<hi>went out
from us,</hi> and <hi>to be of us</hi>] hath been declared; We are not to teach the Holy
Ghost to speake; What ever conceit we may have of our own abilities, when
we deale with Wormes of the Earth, like our selves, to his will, to his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
we must vaile and submit; He is pleased to phrase their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Faith, their <hi>continuance with us,</hi> that is, with the Saints in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
and communion of the Gospell, which they had with God in Christ;
The expression is cleare and evident to the purpose in hand, and there is no
contending against it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we doe not say, that 'tis the direct scope and intent of the Apostle
in this place, to prove that those who are true Believers, cannot fall away,
and depart from the Faith, which he afterwards doth to the purpose, Cap. 3.
9 but his mind and intendment was, to manifest, that those who forsake the
Society of Christians, and become Anti-Christs, and seducers, were indeed
never true Believers; useing the other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> as a <hi>medium</hi> for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this Assertion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By that phrase, they would have continued with us, the Apostle
intends their continuance in the society and fellowship of the Faithfull by the
profession of Jesus Christ, whom now they opposed; <hi>denying him to be come in
the flesh;</hi> that is, they would not have so fallen off, as they have done, upon
the account of the Estate and Condition of true Believers, and reall Saints,
who are kept by the <hi>power of God to salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Apostle did know, and professed himselfe to know, that
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59070:223"/>
they were not, nor ever had been true Believers, when they were once <hi>so</hi>
gone out from them, <hi>as</hi> they went; as our Saviour Christ profest them not to
have been true believers, who followed him for a while, were called and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
his Disciples, when they fell in an houre of Temptation; Neither
have we the least reason to suppose, that the Apostle had this knowledge by
<hi>Revelation,</hi> seeing the thing it selfe in reference and proportion to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
he laies downe of the continuance of Believers, did openly proclaime
it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That true Christians or Believers, can so fall away from the society
of the Saints, as these here mentioned did, is denied; and a grant of it ought
not to be <hi>begged</hi> at our hands; 'tis true, that (as was before granted) a true
believer may for a season desert the communion or fellowship of a Church,
wherein he hath walk'd, and that causelesly; yea, he may be surprized through
Infirmity, to deny, under mighty temptations, in words, for a moment, the
Lord Christ, whom yet his Heart loves, and honours, as in the case of <hi>Peter</hi>
was too evident, But that such an one, may forsake the externall profession of
Christianity, or cease <hi>profession making,</hi> and betake himselfe to a contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
opposing Christ and his wayes, as those here insisted on did; that's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
and not the least attempt of proofe made to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Whilst I was upon the consideration of these exceptions of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> to
our Testimony from this Text of Scripture by us insisted on, there came to my
hands, his <hi>Exposition on the 9. Chapter to the Romans;</hi> In the Epistle whereof to
the Reader, he is pleased, Sect. 6. Studiously to wave the imputation of having
borrowed this Exposition from <hi>Arminius</hi> and his followers: An Apology per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
unworthy his prudence, and great abilityes: which Testimony yet I feare,
by having cast an eye on the body of the Discourse, will scarcely be received
by his Reader, without the helpe of that vulgar Proverbe <hi>Good Wits jumpe:</hi>
But yet on that occasion I cannot but say, however he hath dealt in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
this Discourse I have under consideration is purely translated from them,
the condition of very much of what hath ben already considered, having the
same which I had there thought to have manifested, by placing their <hi>Latine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>English</hi> in the margent: but these things are personall, not belonging
to the cause in hand M. <hi>G.</hi> is sufficiently known to have Abilityes of his own
such as wherewith he hath done (in sundry particulars) considerable service to
the Truth, as sometimes they have been unhappily ingaged in wayes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
nature, and tendency.</p>
            <p>It being evident from these Considerations that our Author is not able in the
least to take off this witnesse from speakeing home to the very heart of the
cause in hand,<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> that it may not seeme to be weakened and impaired by him
in the least: I shall farther consider that diversion which he would intice the
words unto, from their proper channell and Intendment, and so leave the
Apostacy of the Saints dead, at the foote of it: He gives us then, (Sect. 23, 24.)
an Exposition of this place of Scripture, upon the Rack whereof, it seemes not
to speake what formerly we received from its mouth, For the occasion of the
words, he sayes,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the true meaning of this place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 40.</note> 'tis to be considered, that the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to prevent, or heale an offence, that weake Christians
might take, at the Doctrine which was taught and spread abroad by those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
or Anticristian teachers, spoken of in the former verse; and they are
said to have been many, &amp; that especially because they had sometimes liv'd &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with the Apostles themselves in Christian Churches, and had profest the same
Faith &amp; Doctrine with them; by reason hereof some Christians not so considerate or
judicious as others, might possibly thinke or conceive, that surely all things were not
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59070:224"/>
well with the Apostles, and those Christian societyes with which they consorted;
There was something not as it ought to have been, either in Doctrine, or manners,
or both, which ministred an occasion to these men to breake communion with them,
and to leave them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 41.</note> First The intendment of the Apostle in the Context, is evidently to
caution Believers against <hi>seducers,</hi> acquainting them also, with the sweet and
gracious provision, that God had made for their preservation, in <hi>the abiding,
teaching, anointing, bestowed on them:</hi> In the verse under present considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he gives them a description of the persons that did seduce them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their present state and condition; They were Apostates; who though
they had sometimes made profession of the Faith, yet indeed were never true
Believers, nor had any fellowship with Jesus Christ, as he and the Saints had,
which also they had abundantly manifested by their open Apostacy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
opposition to the Doctrine of the Gospell, and the <hi>eternall Life</hi> manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That any Christians whatsoever, from the consideration of these
seducers falling away did entertaine any suspicion that all things were not
well in that society of which the Apostle speakes (not with the Apostles, which
were all dead, himselfe only excepted, when <hi>John</hi> wrote this Epistle) either
as to Doctrine or manners, so supposing them to take part with the Apostates,
in their departure, is a <hi>surmize</hi> whereunto there is not any thing (in the least)
contributed in the Text, or Context, nor any thing like to it, being a meere
invention of our Author, found out to serve this turne, and confidently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any induction looking that way; or attempt of proofe, imposed upon his
credulous Reader; if men may assume to themselves a liberty of creating oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of words, discourses or expressions in the Scripture, no manner of way
insinuated, nor suggested therein, they may wrest it to what they please, and
confirme whatever they have a mind unto.</p>
            <p>This false foundation being laid he proceeds to build upon it,<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> and suitably
thereunto feignes the Apostle to speake what never entred into his heart, and
unto that, whereof, he had no occasion administred.</p>
            <p>To this (<hi>saith he</hi>) the Apostle answereth partly by Concession, partly by Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
First by Concession, in those words [they went out from us] which words doe
not so much import their utter declining or forsaking the Apostles communion, as
the advantage or opportunity which they had, to gaine credit and respect, both to the
Doctrine, and Persons, among professours of Christianity in the World; In as much
as they came forth from the Apostles themselves as men sent and commissioned by
them to teach; The same phrase is used in this sence, and with the same import
where the Apostles write thus to the Brethren of the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. For as
much as we have heard, that certain that went out from us have troubled you,
with words subverting your soules, saying you must be circumcised and keep the
Law, to whom we gave no such commandement; So that in this clause [<hi>they went
out from us</hi>] the Apostle grants; First, That those Antichristian teachers had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
for a time held communion with them; And Secondly, That hereby they had
the greater opportunity, of doing harme in the World, by their false Doctrines. But
Secondly. He Answers farther by way of Exception (but they were not of us) whilest
yet they conversed with us, they were not men of the same spirit and principles with
us; we walk'd in the profession of the Gospell, with single and upright hearts, not
aiming at any secular greatnesse, or worldly accommodations in one kind or other;
these men loved this present World, and when they found the simplicity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
would not accommodate them to their minds, they brake with us, and with
the truth of the Gospell it selfe at once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 43.</note> First, I suppose tis evident (at the first view) that this new <hi>glosse</hi> of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59070:224"/>
the Apostles words, is inconsistent with that, which was proposed for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of them in the words foregoing; There an Aspersion is said to be cast
upon the Churches, and societyes whereof the Apostle speakes, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of these seducers from them, as though they were not sound in Faith
or manners; here an insinuation quite of an other tendency, is suggested, as
though these persons found continuance in their teachings and seductions,
from the society and communion which they had had with the Apostles; as
though they had pretended to come from them, by commission, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of casting reproach upon them by their departure, did assume Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to themselves, by their having been with them; But to the thing it
selfe I say,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Apostle is not answering any Objection, but describing
the state and condition of the Antichrists, and seducers, concerning whom,
and their seduction, he cautioneth Believers, hath been formerly beyond
contradiction manifested and maintained; That expression then [<hi>they went
out from us</hi>] is not an Answer (by concession) to an Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of seducers by their Apostacy; Which words also in their regard to the
Persons as before by him described, do manifest their utter declining and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the Communion of the Saints, they so going from them, as also going
into an opposition to the Doctrine of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Apostle here insinuates an advantage these Antichrists had,
to seduce, from their former communion with him, (a thing not in the least
suggested (as was observed) in the occasion of the words, as laid downe by
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe) is proved from the use of the words [<hi>they went out from
us</hi>] <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. Whence this undenyable Argument may be educed. <hi>Some
who went out from the Apostle, had repute and authority in their preaching thereby,
these Antichrists went out from the Apostle, therefore they had repute and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety
thereby;</hi> younger men than either Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> or my selfe, know well
enough what to make of this Argument; Besides, though there be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that one Expression, all the neighbouring parts of the Description, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that in the things themselves, there and here pointed at, there is no
affinity; Those in the <hi>Acts</hi> pretended to abide still in the <hi>communion and Faith
of the Apostles,</hi> these here expressively departed both from the one and the
other, to an opposition of them both: The former, seemed to have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a commission from the Apostles, these according to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe
did so farre declare against them, that it was a scandall to some, fearing that
all had not been well among the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That which is called an Answer by way of <hi>Exception</hi> (as in it lye
the expression of it so used upon the matter, is as much as we urge from these
words; The import of them is said to be, <hi>they were not of us, though they were
with us, yet they were not such as we are, didnot walke in that uprightnesse of
heart, as we do, they were not men of the same principles and spirit with us;</hi> that
is, they were not true, thorough, sincere and sound Believers at all, no not
while they converst with the Apostles. Now evident 'tis that in those words,
as is manifest by the assuming of them againe for the use of an inference in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
[<hi>for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us</hi>] the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
yeilds a Reason and Account, how they came to Apostatize and fall to
the opposition of the Gospell from the profession wherein they walked;
'twas because they were not men of thorough and sound principles, true Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
and consequently he supposeth, and implyeth, that if they had been so
they would not, they could not have so Apostatized: for if they might there
had been no weight in the account given, of the Reason of their revolt.</p>
            <p>In what followes,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> that these words, but they were not of us, <hi>do not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59070:225"/>
imply they were Believers formerly, but perhaps they had been so, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fallen away, being choaked by the cares of the world,</hi> an observation is insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
directly opposite to the Apostles designe, and such as makes his whole
Discourse ridiculous; An account he gives of mens falling away from the
Faith, and tells them 'tis because, though they have been professors, yet they
were never true Believers, yea but perhaps they were true Believers, and then
fell away, &amp; after that fell away; that is, they fell from the Faith, and then fell
from the Faith: for that is plainely intimated in, &amp; is the sence of this doubty
Observation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to proceed with his exposition:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 45.</note> 
               <hi>he sayes,</hi> It followes, for if they had been
of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; in these words the Apostle gives
a reason of his Exception telling them, to whom he writes; that this was a signe
and Argument that those Antichristian teachers, were not of them in the sence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared;
viz. That they did not continue with them, that is, they quitted their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
intimacy and converse with the Apostles, refused to steere the same course, to
walke by the same principles, any longer with them, which (saith he) doubtlesse
they would not have done, had they been as sincerely affected towards Jesus Christ &amp;
the Gospell as we; by which Assertion John plainely vindicated himselfe and the
Christian Churches of his communion, from giving any just occasion of offence unto
those men, whereby they should be any wayes induced to forsake them, and resolves
their unworthy departure of this kind into their own carnall and corrupt hearts,
which lusted after some fleshly accommodations and contentments, that were not to
be obtained, or enjoyed, in a sincere profession of the Gospell with the Apostles and
those who were perfect of heart with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, That no aspersion was cast on <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the Churches of his
<hi>Communion,</hi> by the Apostasy of the Antichrists, of whom he speakes, from
which he should need to vindicate himselfe and them, was before declared:
There was not, indeed, nor possibly could be, the least occasion for any sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
of evill concerning them, from whom men departed, in turning ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposers of Christ; For any thing that is here offered, 'tis but an obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Light that breaks forth from the words, for the discerning of the
Truth in hand; 'tis granted that the Apostle manifests, that they were not of
them, that is, true, upright, sound believers, that walked with a right foot in
the Doctrine of the Gospell, because they forsooke the communion of the
Saints, to fall into the condition of <hi>Antichristianisme,</hi> wherein they were now
engaged. Now if this be an Argument that a man was never a true believer,
in the highest profession that he makes, because he falls from it, and forsakes
it, certainly those that are true believers, cannot so fall from their stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
or the Argument will be of no Evidence or conviction at all; Neither
is any thing here offered by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> but what upon a through conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
doth confirme the inferences we insist upon, and make to the worke
in hand; Truth will at one time or other, lead captive those who are most
skilfull in their Rebellion against it.</p>
            <p>What is added (Sect. 24.) concerning the Righteous <hi>Judgement of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 46.</note> and
the <hi>gracious tendency</hi> of his dispensations to his Churches use, in suffering these
wretches so to discover themselves, and be manifested what they were, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not. The discovery that was made, was of what they had been before,
that is not true Believers, &amp; not what now they were; yea, by what they now
shewed themselves to be, was made manifest what before they were; Words of
the like import you have 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 19. %For there must be also heresies among
you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you;</hi> as here
those who fall away are manifested to be corrupt, so there are those who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
to be sincere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:59070:225"/>
From what hath been occasionally spoken of the intendment and scope of
this place, of the designe which the Apostle had in hand, of the direct sence of
the words themselves,<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> exceptions to our Interpretation of the
words and inferences from it, being wholly removed, and his Expofition,
which he advanceth in the roome of that insisted on, manifested to bee, as to
the occasion and scope of the place assigned, utterly forreigne unto it, and as
to Explication of the particulars of it, not of any strength or consistency for
the obscurenig of the true sence and meaning of the place, in the eye of an
intelligent Reader, 'tis evidently concluded beyond all colourable contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that those who are true Believers indeed, having obtained communion
with the Father and his Sonne Christ Jesus, cannot fall into a totall Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment
of Christ, or of the Faith of the Gospell, so as to have no portion
nor interest in the communion they formerly enjoyed.</p>
            <p>To returne to M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> close of this 13.<note place="margin">§. 48.</note> Chap. and nine Arguments (as
he calls them) from which he labours to Evince the Apostasy of Believers,
he shuts up the whole with a <hi>Declamation</hi> against, and revileing of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
he opposeth, with many opprobrious and reproachfull expressions,
calling it an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and an <hi>Appearance of Satan in the likenesse of an Angell of
Light,</hi> with such like termes of reproach, as his Rhetorick at every turne is
ready to furnish him withall; threatning it farther, with calling it in Question
before I know not how many Learned men of all sorts, and to disprove it by
their Testimony concerning it; and so all that is required for its destruction
is, or shall be speedily dispatched; God knows how to defend his Truth, and
as he hath done this in particular, against as fierce assaults as any M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
hath made, or is like to make against it, so I no way doubt, he will continue
to doe; 'Tis not the first time, that it hath been conformeable to its Author;
in undergoing the <hi>contradiction of men,</hi> and being laden with reproaches, and
<hi>crucified</hi> among the <hi>theevish</hi> principles of Errour and prophanenesse. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it hath not wanted in due time its <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and that continually with
a new Glory, and an added estimation to what before it obtained among the
Saints of God; and I no way doubt, but that it will grow more and more, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the perfect day,</hi> when those opinions and inventions of men, derogatory to
the Grace and Covenant of God, his Truth, Unchangeablenesse, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
which now make long their shades, to eclypse the beauty and lustre of
it, shall consume and vanish away before its brightnesse; In which perswasion
I doubt not, but the Reader will be confirmed with mee, upon the farther
consideration of what M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> endeavours are in an opposition thereto,
wherewith now by the grace of God, contrary to my first intendment, I shall
proceed.</p>

            <p>In the first and second Section he fronts the Discourse intended with an
<hi>eloquent Oration,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> partly concerning the tendency of the Doctrine of the <hi>Saints

               <hi>He informes us, that his judgement is,</hi> that many who might
have attained a Crowne of Glory, by a presumptuous conceit of the Impossibility of
their miscarrying, are now like to suffer the vengeance of eternall fire; men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
gratifying the flesh, with wresting the Scripture to the encouragement thereof.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Presumptuous conceits</hi> of men, are like to have no other
issue or effect, than the betraying of their soules to all manner of <hi>Loosenesse</hi>
and <hi>Abomination,</hi> so exposing them to the <hi>vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> we are well
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59070:226"/>
assured; &amp; therefore knowing the terrour of the Lord do <hi>perswade men</hi> (what
we are able) to cast downe all high thoughts and imaginations concerning
their owne Abilities to doe good, to believe, to obey the Gospell, or to abide
in the Faith thereof, and to rowle themselves <hi>freely, fully, wholly</hi> on the free
Grace and faithfulnesse of God, in the covenant of Mercy, ratifyed in the
bloud of his Sonne, wherein they shall be assured to find Peace to their soules.
On this foundation doe we build all our endeavours, for the exalting the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
free, effectuall grace of God, in opposition to the <hi>proud and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
conceits of men,</hi> concerning their own imbred, native power in spirituall
things; an Apprehension whereof we are well assured, disposeth the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a frame as God abhorres, and prepares the soule to a battle against
him, in the highest and most abominable Rebellion imaginable; I no waies
doubt, but that the way and meanes whereby innumerable poore creatures
have been hardened to their eternall Ruine, have had all their springs and
fountaines, ly in this one wretched reserve, of a <hi>power in themselves</hi> to turne
to God, and to abide with him. That any one by mixing the promises of
God with Faith, wherein the Lord hath gratiously assured him, that seeing he
hath <hi>no strength in himselfe to continue in his mercy,</hi> he will preserve and keep
him in, and through the Sonne of his Love, hath ever been, or ever can be
turned wholly aside to any way or path not acceptable to God, or not ending
in everlasting peace, will never be made good whilest the Gospell of Christ
finds honour and credit amongst any of the sonnes of men There may be
some indeed, who are <hi>strangers to the covenant of promise,</hi> what ever they doe
pretend, who may turne this Grace of God in the Gospell, as also that of the
<hi>Satisfaction of Christ, Redemption</hi> by his bloud, and <hi>Justification</hi> by Faith, (the

not be <hi>the savour of Life unto Life</hi> unto them that doe embrace it? What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
then be the disasters, (of which themselves are the sole cause) of men
with their presumptuous conceits of the impossibility of miscarrying (seeing
every presumptuous conceit of what kind soever, is a desperate miscarriage)
their ruine and destruction cannot in the least, be ascribed to that Doctrine,
which calls for Faith in the promises of God, <hi>a Faith working by Love,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying
all presumptuous conceits whatever; A Doctrine without which, and
the necessary concomitant Doctrines thereof, the whole bottome of mens
walking with God, and of their obedience, is nothing but <hi>presumption</hi> and
<hi>conceit,</hi> whereby setting aside the <hi>cold sitts</hi> they are sometimes cast into, by
the checks of their consciences, they spend their daies in the distemper of a
<hi>Feaver</hi> of Pride and Folly.</p>
            <p>In the insuing Discourse Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> informes us of these two things.<note place="margin">§. 5.</note>
First, <hi>What Rule he proceeds by in judging of the Truth of contrary opinions when</hi>
(as he phraseth it) <hi>the toung of the Scripture seemes to be cloven about them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Secondly, <hi>Of his owne Advantages and abilityes to make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to that Rule.</hi> The Rule he attends unto upon the information
he hath given us is, <hi>The Consideration of which of the Opinions that are at any
time Rivalls for his judgement and acceptation tend most unto Godlinesse; the
Gospell being the truth which is according to Godlinesse,</hi> of his owne advantages
and abilityes to make a right judgment according to this rule, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
heads and springs; as his <hi>knowledge of the generall course of the Scripture,
the Experience of his owne heart, his long observation of the Spirits and wayes of
men, but chiefely that light of Reason and Vnderstanding which he hath.</hi> And by
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59070:227"/>
this Rule with these Abilityes proceeding in the examination of the Doctrine of
the Saints Perseverance, He condemnes it and casts it out as an abominable
thing, preferring that concerning their finall defection farre above it. Some
Considerations I shall adde to attend upon his Rule and principles.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> It is most certaine, <hi>that the Gospell is a Doctrine according unto Godlinesse</hi>
whose immediate and direct tendency as in the whole frame and course of it,
so in every particular branch and streame is to promote that <hi>Obedience to Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in Christ,</hi> which we call <hi>Godlinesse;</hi> This is the will of God revealed therein
even our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and whatever Doctrine it be that is suited to turne
men off from walking with God in that way of Holinesse, it carryes its brand
in its face, whereby every one that finds it, may know that it is of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
Spirit,</hi> the <hi>evill one;</hi> But yet that there may be fearefull and desperate
deceits in the hearts of men judging of truths, pretending their rise and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
from the Gospell, by their suitablenesse to the promotion of Godlinesse
and Holinesse, hath been before in part declared, and the Experience of all
Ages doth sufficiently manifest. Among all those who professe the name of
Christ more or lesse in the world, though in &amp; under the most <hi>Antichristian</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to him, who is there that doth not pretend that this tendency of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
unto Godlinesse, or their disserviceablenesse thereunto, hath a great
influence into the guidance of their judgement in the receiving or rejecting of
them. On the account of its destructivenesse to Godlinesse and obedience do
the <hi>Socinians</hi> reject the <hi>Satisfaction and merit of Christ;</hi> and on the account
of conducingnesse thereunto, do the <hi>Papists</hi> assert and build up the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of their owne merits, Penance, Satisfaction and the like. On that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
did they seeme to be acted, who pressed Legall &amp; Judaicall suppositions
with a shew of <hi>wisdome or will worship, and humility and neglecting the body, Col.</hi>
2. 23. Neither did they faile of their plea concerning promotion of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the Worship of God, who reviled, rejected and persecuted the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Christ in this Generation, to set up their own Abominations in the
Roome; Yea, it is generally the first word wherewith every Abomination
opens its mouth in the world, though the men of those Abominations do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suppose this pretence of Godlinesse to be serviceable for the promotion
of their opinions, than their opinions any way really usefull to the promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
godlines: Neither need we go far to enquire after the Reasons of mens miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
pretending to judge of Truth according to this Rule, seeing they ly at
hand, &amp; are exposed to the view of all; for besides that very many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to this plea may be justly suspected to be men of corrupt minds, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
falsely &amp; treacherously with their own soules &amp; the truth, the pretence of
furthering Holinesse being one of the <hi>cunning sleights wherewith they ly in
wait to deceive</hi> (which may justly be suspected of them who together with this
plea, and whilst they make it, are apparently themselves loose and remote
from the power of a Gospell conversation, as the case hath been with not a
few of the most eminent assertors of Arminianisme) How few are there in the
world, who have indeed a true notion and Apprehension of the nature of
Holinesse in its whole compasse and extent, as in the Fountaine, Causes, Rise,
and Use, and end thereof; And if men know not indeed what holinesse is,
how shall they judge what Doctrine or Opinion is conducing to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereof, or is obstructive to it; Give me a man who is perswaded that he
hath <hi>power in himselfe,</hi> being by the discovery of a Rule directed thereinto, to
yeild that obedience to God, which he doth require, who supposeth that <hi>threats</hi>
of hell &amp; destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the greatest, &amp; most powerfull &amp; effectuall motive unto
that obedience that the Spirit &amp; Grace of God to worke &amp; create a new heart
in him as a suitable principle of all holly actings, are not purchased nor procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59070:227"/>
for him by the Bloud of Christ, nor is there any holinesse wrought in him
by the Almighty efficacy of that Spirit and Grace, he having a sufficiency in
himselfe for those things, that there is not a reall Physicall concurrence of the
Grace of God for the production of every good act whatever, and that he is
Justifyed upon the account of any act or part of his Obedience, or the whole,
and I shall not be much moved or shaken with the Judgement of that man,
concerning the serviceablenesse &amp; suitablenesse of any Doctrine or Doctrines
to the furtherance of Godlinesse and Holinesse; There are also many different
opinions about the nature of Godlinesse, what it is, and wherein it doth
consist. I desire to be informed how a man may be directed in his Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those opinions, supposing him in a streight and exigency of thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, in considering which of them is best suited to the promotion of
Godlinesse. I do not intend in the least to derogate from the certaine and
undoubted truth of what was premised at the beginning of this Discourse. <hi>viz.
That every Gospell Rule whatever is certainly conducing to the furtherance of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
Obedience in them that receive it in the Love and power thereof;</hi> Every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
being in its utmost Activity (especially in corrupting the principles of it)
obstructive thereunto, much les do we in any measure decline the tryall of the
Doctrine which I assert, in opposition to the <hi>Apostacy</hi> of the Saints, by this
touch-stone of its usefulnesse to Holinesse, having formerly manifested its emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Activity and efficacy in that service, and the utter aversenesse of its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall
to lend any assistance thereunto; But yet I say, in an inquiry after, and
dijudication of truth, whatever I have been, or may be streightned between
different perswasions, I have and shall rather close in the practice of Holinesse
in <hi>prayer, Faith</hi> and waiting upon God, to <hi>search the Scripture,</hi> to attend wholly
to that Rule, having plentifull promises for guidance and direction, than to
weigh in any Rationall consideration of my owue, what is conducing to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
what not; especially in many truths which have their usefullnesse in
this service, (as is the case of most Gospell Ordinances and institutions of
Worship) not from the connexion of things, but the meere will of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointer.
Of those Doctrines (I confesse) which <hi>following on to know the Lord, we
know from his Word</hi> to be from him, and in which doing the <hi>will of Christ,</hi> are
revealed to us to <hi>be his will,</hi> a peculiar valuation is to be set on the head of
them, which appeare to be peculiarly and eminently serviceable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
and furthering our Obedience; as also that all opinions what ever,
that are in the least seducers from the power, truth and Spirituality of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
are not of God, &amp; are <hi>eo nomine</hi> to be rejected; yet having a more sure
rule to attend unto, I dare not make my apprehensions concerning the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Doctrines, any Rule (if God hath not so spoken of them) for the judging
of their truth or false-hood: if my thoughts are not shut up and determined
by the power of the Word.</p>
            <p>The next proposall made by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> is of the advantages he hath <hi>to
judge of Truths,</hi> which he hath done unto plenary satisfaction, according to
the Rule now considered. The first thing he offereth to induce us to close
with him in his judgement of Opinions is, <hi>the knowledge he hath of the generall
course of the Scripture;</hi> what is intended by the <hi>generall course of the Scripture,</hi>
well I know not: &amp; so am not able to judg of M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> knowledge thereof
by any thing exposed to publique view; If by the <hi>generall course of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
the matter of them is intended, the importance of the expression seems
to be coincident with the <hi>Analogy,</hi> or <hi>proportion of Faith,</hi> a <hi>safe</hi> rule of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy;
but what ever M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> knowledge may be of this, I am not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
satisfied that he hath kept close unto it in many Doctrines of his Book
entituled <hi>Redemption Redeemed;</hi> and so the weight of his skill in judging of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59070:228"/>
truths on this foundation, will not ballance what I have to lay against it, for
the inducement of other thoughts, than those of closeing with him. The
<hi>course of the Scripture,</hi> cannot import the <hi>manner of the expressions</hi> therein u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
in that there is so great and so much variety therein, that it can scarce be
cast into one course and current: and if the <hi>generall scope, aime,</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi>
of the Scripture may passe for the course of it, there is not any one thing that
lyes so evident and cleare therein, as the decrying of all that <hi>Ability</hi> and
strength, and power to doe good in men, which M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> so much pleads
for, and Asserts to be in them, with an Exaltation of that <hi>rich</hi> and free Grace
in the efficacy and the power of it, which he so much opposeth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>experiment all knowledge he hath of his own heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the workings and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
thereof,</hi> (a thing common to him with others) and what advantages
he hath thereby I shall not consider; Only this I shall dare to say, that I would
not for all the World, have no experience in my heart of the truth of many
things which M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in this Treatise opposeth; or that my weake expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Grace of God, should not rise above that frame of heart and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which the teachings of it seem to discover; I doubt a person under the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of workes,</hi> heightned with convictions, and a low or common worke of
the Spirit, induced thereby to some Regular walking before God, may reach
the utmost of what in this Treatise is required to render a man <hi>a Saint, truly
gracious, regenerate</hi> and a Believer; And in this also I doubt not, lyes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of what is thirdly insisted on, <hi>viz. His observation of the wayes and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of men, their firstings and lastings in Religion;</hi> A sort of men there are in
the world, who escape the <hi>outward pollution of it,</hi> and are <hi>cleane in their owne
eyes,</hi> though they are never wash't from their iniquityes, who having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
strong convictions by the power of the Law, and broken thereby from the
course of their sinne, attending to the Word of the Gospell with a temporary
<hi>Faith</hi> do go forth unto a profession of Religion, and walking with God so far
as to have all the lineaments of true Believers (as Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> somewhere
speakes) drawne in their faces, <hi>hearing the Word gladly as did Herod,</hi> receiving
it with <hi>joy</hi> as did the <hi>stony ground,</hi> attending to it with delight as they did in
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31. Repenting of former sinnes, as did <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> untill they
are reckoned among true Believers, as was <hi>Judas</hi> &amp; those <hi>John</hi> 2. 23. who yet
were never united unto Jesus Christ, of whose wayes and walking Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
seemes to have made observation, and found many of them to end in
visible Apostacy; But that this observation of them, should cause him to judg
them when Apostatized to have been true Believers, or that he is thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
to determine concerning the truth of severall Opinions pretending
to his acceptance, I cannot grant, nor doth he go about to prove.</p>
            <p>For what he mentions in the last place of the <hi>light of reason and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> which he hath, I do not only grant him to have it in <hi>common</hi> (as he saith)
with other men, for the <hi>kind</hi> of it, but also as to the <hi>degrees</hi> of it to be much
advanced therein, above the generality of men; yet I must needs tell him in
the close, that all these helps and advantages, seeming to be drawne forth and
advanced in opposition to that one great assistance which we enjoy by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
from Christ; of his <hi>Spirit leading us into all truth,</hi> and teaching us from
God by his owne <hi>anointing,</hi> are to me <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>stubble,</hi> yea <hi>losse</hi> and <hi>dung,</hi> of no
value nor esteeme; Had we not other wayes &amp; meanes, helps and advantages
to come to the knowledge of the Truth than these here unfolded and
spread by Mr <hi>Goodwin, actum esset,</hi> we should never perceive the things that
are of God. The Fox was acquainted with many wiles and devices; the Cat
knew <hi>unum magnum</hi> wherein she found safety. Attendance to the Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the direction of the usuall knowne Rules, and helpes, agreed on
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59070:228"/>
for the interpretation of it, with humble dependance on God waiting for
the guidance of his Spirit according to the Promise of his deare Sonne; asking
him of him continually that he may dwell with us, anoint and lead us into all
truth, with an utter abrenunciation of all our skill, abilityes, wisdome and
any resting on them, knowing that it is God alone that gives us understanding
is the course that hitherto hath been used in our enquiry after the mind of
God, in the Doctrine under consideration, and which (the Lord assisting)
shall be heeded, and kept close unto, in that discussion of the Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wrested by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> (as by others before him) to give countenance
to his opposition to the Truth hitherto uttered, confirmed and vindicated
from his contradictions thereunto.</p>
            <p>The place of Scripture first insisted on,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> and on the account whereof, he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
with the greatest confidence of successe, is that of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 24, 25. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which
words he subjoynes a Triumphant Exulting Exclamation.</p>
            <p>What more (<hi>saith he</hi>) can the understanding judgement soule and conscience of
a man, reasonably desire for the establishment in any truth whatsoever, than is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by God himselfe in this passage, to evince the possibility of a righteous mans
declining from his righteousnesse, and that unto death.</p>
            <p>The councell given of old to the <hi>King,</hi> may not be unseasonable to Mr

off.</hi> You have but newly entered the lists; and that, with all <hi>pressed Souldiers</hi>
unwilling so much as once to appeare in that service they are forced to. If you
will but suspend your triumph, untill we have made a little tryall of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and your skill in managing of them to the battle, perhaps you may be a
little taken off from this confidence of successe, notwithstanding the facing
of this Scripture upon the Truth, being cut off and taken away from that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
and connexion, and station wherein it is placed of God (which is not
at the least enquired into) it will be found in that issue to beare it no ill

hitherto been engaged in the condition of the Saints of God; and his dealing
with them, in and under the Covenant of Grace in Generall. For our guidance
and direction herein, a Text of Scripture evincing the Righteousnesse of Gods
dealings with a number of persons in a peculiar case, which was under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
is produced and by the tenour of this, and according to the tenour of
the reasonings therein, must all the Promises of God, in the Covenant of
Grace, mape and ratifyed by the Bloud of Christ, be regulated and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
We have been told by as Learned a man as Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> that Promises
made to the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> peculiarly, and suited to the peculiar state
and condition wherein they were, do not concerne the People of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
And why may not the same be the condition of <hi>Threatnings</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out upon a <hi>parralell</hi> account <hi>Compedes quas fecit ipse ut ferat aequum
est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That it is the determination and stating of a particular Controversy,
between God and the people of the Jewes, suited to a peculiar dispensation
of his Providence towards them which is here proposed, is evident from the
occasion of the words lay'd downe <hi>v. 2, 3. What mean ye &amp;c. that use
this proverb concerning the Land of Israel, saying, the Fathers have eaten sower
Grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set on edge? As I live saith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> It
is the use of a <hi>Proverb</hi> concerning the <hi>Land of Israel,</hi> that God is descrying
and disproving the truth of the Proverb it selfe under consideration, and that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59070:229"/>
this should be the standard and Rule of Gods proceeding with his people, in
the Covenant of mercy, no man that seemes to have either understanding,
judgement or conscience can reasonably imagine.</p>
            <p>3. That it is not the nature and tenour of the Covenant of Grace, and
Gods dealing with his chosen secret ones, his Saints, true Believers, as to their
eternall condition, which in these words is intended, but the manifestation of
the Righteousnesse of God in dealing with that people of the Jewes, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
dispensation of his providence, towards the body of that people, and
the Nation in generall, appeares farther from the occasion of the words, and
the provocation given the Lord to make use of these expressions unto them.
The proverbe that God cuts out of their lips and mouthes, by the sword of
his Righteousnesse in these words; was <hi>concerning the Land of Israel:</hi> Used
perhaps mostly by them in captivity: but it was concerning the <hi>Land of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
not concerning the Eternall state and condition of the Saints of God,
but concerning the <hi>Land of Israel, v.</hi> 2. God had of old given that Land to
that people by Promise, and continued them in it for many Generations;
untill at length for their wickednesse', Idolatry, Abomination and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
in their evill wayes, he caused them to be carryed captive unto <hi>Rabylon.</hi>
In that Captivity the Lord revenged upon them not only the sinnes of
the present Generation, but as he told them also those of their fore-Fathers,
especially the Abomination, Cruelty, Idolatry exercised in the dayes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh,</hi>
taking this season for his worke of vengeance in the Generations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
who also so farre walked in the steps of their fore-Fathers,
as to Justify all Gods proceedings against them; Being wasted and removed
from their owne Land, by the Righteous Judgement of God, they considered
the <hi>Land of Israel,</hi> that was Promised to them (though upon their good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
therein) and how instead of a plentifull enjoyment of all things in
peace and quietnesse therein, there were now a small remnant in captivity,
the rest, the farre greatest part, being destroyed by the sword and famine in
that Land. In this state and condition, being as all other of their frame and
principle, prone to justify themselves, they had hatched a proverb among
themselves <hi>concerning the Land of Israel</hi> promised to them, excedingly oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
and reproachfull to the Justice of God, in his dealings with them;
The summe of the intendment of this saying that was growne rise
amongst them, was, that for the sinne of their fore-Fathers, many,
yea the greatest part of them was slain in the <hi>Land of Israel,</hi> and the rest car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from it into bondage and captivity. To vindicate the Righteousnesse
and equity of his wayes, the impartiallity of his Judgements, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
to them by his Prophet many of their sinnes, whereof themselves with
their Fathers were guilty, in the Land of their nativity, and for which he had
brought all that calamity and desolation upon them, whereof they did
complaine: confirming under many supposalls of rising and falling, that
principle of rising and falling, that principle he layd downe in the entrance of
his dealings with them, that every one of them suffered for his own iniquity,
whatever they suffered, whether death or other banishment, and not for the
sinnes of their fore Fathers: Whatever influence they might have upon the
procuring of the generall vengeance, that overtooke the whole Nation in the
midst of their iniquity. This being the aime, scope, and tendency of the place,
the import of the words and tenour of Gods intendment in them, I cannot
but wouder how any man of understanding and Conscience, can once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that God hath given any Testimony to the possibilty of falling out of
Covenant with him, of those whom he hath taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh to himselfe through
the Bloud of his Sonne, in the Everlasting bond thereof. As though it were
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59070:229"/>
any thing of his dealing with the Saints, in reference to their <hi>Spirituall</hi> and
<hi>Eternall</hi> Condition, that the Lord here reveales his will about; being only
the tenour of his dealings with the <hi>House of Israel</hi> in reference to the Land of
<hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This is farther manifest in that principle &amp; Rule of Gods proceedings
in the matter laid down <hi>v.</hi> 4. which is not only a line from, but also directly
opposite unto, that which is the principle in the Covenant of Grace. <hi>The soule
that sinneth he shall dye.</hi> That soule and person and not another, when in
that Covenant of Grace, he sets <hi>forth his Sonne to be a propitiation through faith
in his Bloud, giving him up to death for all, causing the just to dye for the unjust,</hi>
the soule that never sinned for the soules that had sinned, that they might go
free. And I would faine know, on what solid grounds an answer may be
given to the <hi>Socinians</hi> triumphing in the 4. <hi>v.</hi> against the satisfaction of Christ,
nolesse than Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in the 24, 25. against the Perseverance of the Saints;
If you do not manifest the whole tendency of this place, to be accommodated
to Gods <hi>providentiall dispensation</hi> of <hi>temporall Judgements,</hi> and Mercyes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that people, and the Covenant whereby they held the <hi>Land of Canaan;</hi>
and not at all to respect the generall dispensation of his Righteousnesse and
Grace in the Bloud of Christ. So that</p>
            <p>5. The whole purport and intendment of the Scripture under conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is only to manifest the tenour of Gods Righteous proceeding with the
people of Israel in respect of his dispensation towards them in reference to the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> convicing them of their own abominations, confuting
the profane <hi>proverb</hi> invened and reared up in the reproach of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
beating them from the vaine pretence of being punished for their
Fathers sins, and the conceit of their owne Righteousnesse, which that people
was perpetually puffed up with all; He letts them know, that his dealing
with them and his wayes towards them, were <hi>equall</hi> and righteous, in that
there was none of them but was punished for his owne sinne: and though
some of them might have made some profession, and done some good, yet
upon the whole matter first or last, they had all declined, and therefore ought
to owne the punishment of their sinnes; God dealing severely, and unto
death, and destruction, with none but those who either, wholly, or upon the
summe of the matter, turned away from his Judgements and Statutes. So
that</p>
            <p>6. This being the tenour and importance of the words insisted on, this
their tendency, aime, and accommodation to the objection levyed against the
<hi>Righteousnesse of God</hi> in dealing with that people, this their rise, and end,
their spring, and fall, it is evident beyond all Contradiction from any thing
but prejudice it selfe, that all the enquiries and disputes about them, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the declaration of the minde of God in them be <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> or <hi>Absolute;</hi>
what is meant by the <hi>Righteous Person,</hi> what by his <hi>turning away,</hi> and what by
the death threatned, (all which expressions of the Text are in themselves
ambiguous and must be limited from the circumstances of place) are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uselesse, and needlesse, the words utterly refusing any accommodation to
the businesse of our present debate. So that</p>
            <p>7. This dependance of the words scope of the Context, designe of the
place, and intendment of God in it, the accommodation of the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the removeall of the Objection, and disproving of the <hi>proverbiall</hi>
selfe Justification of a sinfull People, the only directoryes in the investigation
of the true, proper, native, genuine sence and meaning of them, eyed, weighed
nor considered by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who knew how much it was to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to rend away these two <hi>verses,</hi> from the body of the Prophets dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59070:230"/>
I might well supersede any farther proceeding in the Examination of
what he has prepared for a <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Answers</hi> commonly given to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
taken from this place: yet that all security imaginable may be given to
the <hi>Reader,</hi> of the inoffensivenesse of this place, as to the Truth we maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
I shall briefely manifest, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not indeed effectually
taken up and off, any one Answer, or any one parcell of any such, that hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
been given by our Divines unto the Objection against the Doctrine of
<hi>Perseverance</hi> hence levied.</p>
            <p>That which naturally first offers it selfe to our Consideration,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> is, the forme
and tenour of the Expression here used: which is not of an <hi>absolute</hi> nature,
but <hi>Hypotheticall;</hi> The import of the words is, <hi>If a righteous man turne from
his Righteousnesse and continue therein he shall dy:</hi> True, say they who make
use of this Consideration; God here proposes the desert of sinne, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
that is by his appointment, between Apostacy and the punishment
thereunto allotted; but this not at all inferres, that any one who is truly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
shall or may everlastingly so <hi>Apostatize.</hi> Such comminations as these
God maketh use of to caution Believers of the evill of Apostasy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to preserve them from it, as their tendency to that end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and their efficacy thereunto, hath been declared. So that to
say, because God sayes <hi>If a righteous man turne from his Righteousnesse he shall
dye;</hi> the whole <hi>Emphasis</hi> lying in the connexion, that is between such <hi>turning
away, &amp; dying,</hi> to conclude considering what is the proper use &amp; intendment
of such threatnings) that a man truly Righteous may so fall away,
is to build up that which the Texts contributes not any thing to in the
least.</p>
            <p>Against this plea Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> riseth up with much contempt and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> Chap. 12. Sect. 9. in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this Sanctuary hath also been profaned, by some of the chiefe Guardians
themselves of that cause, for the protection and safety whereof it was built. There
needs no more be done (though much more might be done, yea and hath been done
by others) than that Learned Doctor (so lately named) hath done himselfe for the
demolishing of it. Having propounded the Argument from the place in Ezekiel
according to the import of the interpretation asserted by us; Some (saith he) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that a condition proues nothing in being: which how true soever it may be in
respect of such Hypotheticalls, which are made use of only for the amplyfication of
matters, &amp; serve for the aggravating either of the difficulty or indignity of a thing;
(as if I should climbe up into Heaven thou art there Psal. 139. It were ridiculous to
inferre, therefore a man may climbe up into Heaven;) yet such conditionoll sayings
upon which Admonitions, Promises, or Threatnings are built, do at least suppose
something in possibility, however by vertue of their tenour &amp; forme, they suppose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in being. For no man seriously intending to encourage a student in his way
would speak thus to him; If thou wilt get all the Books in the Vniversity Library by
heart, thou shalt be Doctor this Commencement. Beside in the case in hand, he that
had a minde to deride the Prophet, might readily come upon him thus: But a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man according to the Judgement of those that are Orthodox, cannot turne
away from his righteousnesse: therefore your Threatning is in vaine. Thus we see
to how little purpose it is, to seeke for starting holes in such Logicke quirkes as
these; Thus farre the great Assertor of the Synod of Dort, and the cause which they
maintained, to shew the vanity of such a sence or construction, put upon the words
now in debate; which shall render them meerely conditionall, and will not allow
them to import so much as a possibility, of any thing contained or expressed in
them.</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> his choosing not to lay the weight of this Answer, to
the Argument of the Arminians from this place, on the <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> manner
of the expression used therein, is called a <hi>defiling this Sanctuary by the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of the cause whose protection it undertakes. Criminarasis, librat in Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;
doct as posuisse figuras laudatur?</hi> what are my thoughts of it, I need not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
being unconcerned in the businesse, as knowing it not at all needfull
to be insisted on, for the purpose for which it is produced, the Text looking
not at all towards the Doctrines under consideration: yet I must needs say, I
am not satisfied with the <hi>Doctors</hi> attempt for the removall of it, nor with
what is farther added by the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> in the place which we are sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> marginall directions, though it should be granted, that
such conditionall expressions do suppose, or may (for that they alwaies do is
not affirmed, and in some cases it is evident they doe not) that there is
something in <hi>posse,</hi> as the <hi>Doctor</hi> speakes, whereunto they doe relate, yet they
doe not inferre, that the <hi>possibility</hi> may by no meanes be hindred from ever
being reduced into Act. We grant a possibility of desertion in Believers, in
respect of their own principles of operation, which is ground sufficient for to
give occasion to such <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> expressions, as containe comminations,
and threatnings in them, but yet notwithstanding that possibility on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
supposed, yet the bringing forth of that possibility into an actuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment,
may not be effectually prevented by the spirit and grace of
God, the Doctor saies nothing. This I say is ground sufficient for such <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall</hi>
comminations, that in respect of them, to whom they are made, it is
possible to incurre the thing threatned, by the meanes therein mentioned,
which yet upon other accounts is not possible. That God who saies, if the
<hi>Righteous man turne from his Righteousnesse, he shall dye,</hi> and saies so on purpose
to preserve Righteous men from so doing, knowes full well, that the thing
in respect of themselves, of whom, and to whom he speakes, is sufficiently
possible, to give a cleare foundation to that expression. So that if M. <hi>Goodwin</hi>
hath not something of his own to adde, he will find little reliefe from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of that Learned <hi>Doctor:</hi> wherein yet, I should not have translated
some phrases and expressions, as M. G. hath made bold to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds therefore Pag.</hi> 276.<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> To say that God putteth a case in such solemnity
and emphaticalnesse of words and phrase, as are remarkeable all along in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the place in hand, of which there is no possibility, that is should ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
or be exemplifyed in reality of event; and this in vindication of himselfe, and
the equity of his dealings and proceedings with men, is to bring a scandall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of weakenesse upon that infinite Wisdome of his, which magnifyes it
selfe in all his workes, which also is so much the more unworthy and unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when there is a sence commodious every way worthy, as well the infinite wisdome
as the Goodnesse of God, pertinent and proper to the occasion he hath in hand, which
offers it selfe plainely and clearely. <hi>So far He.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is all it seemes which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to adde: and indeed
<hi>this all</hi> is <hi>nothing at all,</hi> but only the repetition of what was urged before from
the <hi>Doctor,</hi> in more swelling, and lesse significant termes. What possiblity there
is in the thing, hath been before manifested; that this possibility should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be exemplifyed in reality of event to give significancy to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
I suppose is not Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> owne intendment; True Believers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine he asserts (as he pretends) are only in such a remote
<hi>possibility of Apostasy,</hi> as that it can scarce be called <hi>danger.</hi> Now doubtlesse
it is <hi>possible</hi> that such a <hi>remote possibility</hi> may never be reduced into Act. But
now if Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will not be contented with such a possibility, as may, but
also will have that, must be exemplifyed in reality of event, he is advanced
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59070:231"/>
from a <hi>possibility</hi> in all, to a <hi>necessity</hi> in some to Apostatize.</p>
            <p>2. Had M.G. a little more attended to what here drops from him, <hi>viz.
that the words are used for the vindication of the justice of the proceedings of God,</hi>
(namely) in the particular case formerly opened and cleared, perhaps he
would himselfe have judged the edge of this weapon, to be so farre blunted,
as to render it wholly uselesse to him, in the combat wherein he is engaged; I
hope at least that by the light of this sparke, he may apprehend the <hi>Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callnesse</hi>
of all the expressions used in this place, to be pointed towards the
particular case under consideration, and not in the least to be expressive of the
<hi>possibility</hi> he contends for; God knowes what beseemes his own infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and hath given us rules to judge thereof, as farre as we are called
thereto in his word; And from thence, whether M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will pardon us
or no, in our so doing, we doubt not to evince, that it exceedingly becomes
the infinite wise God, emphatically to expresse that connexion, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
one thing and another (sinne and punishment, believing and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
by his appointment, though some never believe unto salvation, nor some
sinne, to the actuall inflicting of punishment on them; and as for M. <hi>Goodwins
commodious sence</hi> of this place, we see not any <hi>advantage</hi> in it, for any but
those, who are ingaged into an opposition to the Covenant of the grace of
God, and his faithfulnesse therein: so that once more upon the whole matter,
this Text is discharged from farther attendance in the triall of the truth in
hand.</p>
            <p>The severalls of the Text come nextly under consideration,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> and amongst
them; First, The subject spoken of (that we may take the words in some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
M.G. having roved up and downe, backwards and forwards, from one
end of the Text to the other, without any at all) and this is, a <hi>Righteous man,</hi>
that is such an one as is described, v. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. but if a man &amp;c. that is, such
an one that walkes up to the judgments, and statutes, and ordinances of
God, so farre as they were of him required in the Covenant of the Land of
Canaan, and according to the tenour of it, whereby they held their possession
therein, whereby heavenly things were also shadowed out: That this is the
<hi>person</hi> intended, this his <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and that the matter upon which he is
here tryed, is cleare in the contexts, beyond all possible contradiction. So
that all farther inquiries into what Righteousnesse is intended, is altogether
needlesse; what with any colour of probability can be pretended from hence,
as to the matter in hand, arises from the analogie of Gods dealings with men
in the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of the land of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
which yet are eminently distinguished in the very foundation of them:
The one being built upon this bottome, <hi>the soule that sinneth it shall dye;</hi> the
other upon a dispensation of another import, as has been declared: We do
then plainely supererogate as to the cause in hand, by the confutation of the
Answers, which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> farther attempts to remove, and his endeavour
therein which yet shall not be declined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 8. one exposition by some insisted on, of this terme</hi> a righteous man, <hi>is
thus proposed by Mr</hi> Goodwin: Notwithstanding some formerly (it seemes) in
favour of the Doctrine, attempted an escape from that sword of Ezechiel lately
drawn against it, by pretending that by the Righteous man mentioned in the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in hand, is not meant a person truly and really righteous, but a kind of formall
Hypocrite, or outside professour of Righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>Those who insist on this interpretation of the place, tell you that in the
commands of God, there is the meere end of them considerable, and the
manner of their performance, which is as the life and forme of the obedience
to them which is acceptable to God. Farther that many persons wrought
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59070:231"/>
upon by the power of conviction from the Law of God, and enabled in some
measure with common guifts and Graces, do goe forth in such a way to the
performance of the command, of God, as to the substance and matter of them,
(wherein also they are not Hypocriticall in the strict sence of the word but
sincere) and so are called and counted <hi>righteous,</hi> comparatively so, in respect
of those, who live in open rebellion against the Lord and his wayes: And such
as these <hi>they say,</hi> as they are often times usefull in their Generations, and
bring Glory to God by their profession, so (especially under the old legall
dispensation of the Covenant) they were rewarded in a plentifull manner of
God in this Life, in the enjoyment of the abundance of all things in peace and
quietnesse. Of this sort of men, that is men upright and righteous in their
dealings with men, and in the world, conscientious in their trust, yeilding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
subjection to the judgements and institutions of God, performing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
all known duties of Religious men, <hi>they say,</hi> that after they have made
a profession of some good continuance, having never attained union with God
in Christ, nor being built on the rock, many do fall into all manner of spirituall
&amp; sensuall abominations, exposing themselves to all the Judgements and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God in this life, which also under the old Testament generally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
them, God being (as here he pleades) righteous therein: In this descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Righteous person</hi> here intended, there is no occasion in the least ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to relieve himselfe against it, by that which in the
close of this <hi>Section</hi> he borrows from D. <hi>Prideaux, viz. That if the Righteous
man, should turne himselfe away from his counterfeit and Hypocriticall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he should rather live than dye:</hi> For they say not that this Righteousnesse
is <hi>Hypocricall</hi> or <hi>counterfeit,</hi> but <hi>true</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in its kind; only the person
himselfe is supposed, not to be partaker of the Righteousnesse of God in
Christ, and a principle of life from him, which should alter his Obedience,
render it spirituall and acceptable to God in the Sonne of his Love.</p>
            <p>What more sayes Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> unto this exposition of the words? With
many scornefull expressions cast both upon it (as by himselfe stated and lay'd
downe) and the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> he tells you it was rejected by the <hi>Synod.</hi> That
some in the Synod looking on it perhaps under such sence and apprehension
as Mr <hi>G.</hi> proposeth it in, did not see cause to close with it, may be true: Yet
that it was rejected by the Synod, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> can by no meanes prove, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is pleased to say, and to insult thereon, upon the judgements of very
learned men, whom he hath no reason upon any account in the world, to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise:
The labours of very many of them praising them in the gates of Syon,
exceedingly above the cry and clamour of all Reproaches whatever mustered
to their dishonour. But to let passe those poore contemptible wretches, let us
see how this <hi>Master</hi> in our <hi>Israel,</hi> in his indignation deales with this silly shift,
whereby poore men strive to avoid his fury. Saies he then.</p>
            <p>And indeed the whole series and carriage of the Context from v.<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> 20. to the
end of the Chapter, demonstratively evinceth, that by the Righteous man all along,
is meant such a man, as was or is truly righteous, and who, had he persever'd in
that way of Righteousnesse, wherein he sometimes walked, should have worne the
Crowne of Righteousnesse, and received the reward of a Righteous man. As by the
wicked man all along opposed to him, is meant not a person seemingly wicked, but
truly and really so (as is acknowledged on all hands) so that the Antithesis or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
between the righteous and the wicked, running<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so visibly quite through
the body of the Discourse, must needs be dissolved, if by the Righteous man should
be meant, a Person seemingly righteous only; he that is Righteous in this sence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly and really wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>maine series and context of the Chapter,</hi> without the least endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59070:232"/>
to give any light or illustration thereunto, by the scope, occasion, or
dependance of the parts of it one upon another, does more than once stand
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> instead, when nothing else presents it selfe to his reliefe. It is true
the whole context of the Chapter, grants the persons spoken of, to be <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
in the performance of the duties mentioned in the Chapter, in opposition
to the wicked man and his intentions, and wayes described therein, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the dispensation of the Covenant, whose Rule &amp; principle is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the head of v. 20. which M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> directs us unto; <hi>viz. The soule that
sinneth it shall dye;</hi> And as there is nothing in all this contrary to any thing in
the Exposition by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> opposed, so there is not any thing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor once attempted to be here by M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himselfe, than what is
confessed therein.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged that the person spoken of, is <hi>truly and really righteous,</hi>
with that kind of righteousnesse which is intended, and wherein if he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he was to receive the <hi>reward of righteousnesse,</hi> then under consideration;
and yet, though such an one might be truly and really united unto Christ, yet
there is nothing in the <hi>Text,</hi> nor Context, enforcing that such an one, and
none else is intended here: and more in this case Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not to
adde; nor doth he threaten us with any more than he hath delivered, as he
did upon the consideration of the tenor of the words, and our enquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are of an <hi>hypotheticall</hi> or <hi>absolute</hi> nature and importance.</p>
            <p>It is true he addes, that <hi>Calvin in his Exposition on the place, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his warinesse to mannage it so, as that the Doctrine of Perseverance which he
maintained, might suffer no dammage,</hi> (which perhaps M. G. was not so wary
in expressing, contending so much as he does, to manifest, that he had
thoughts lying another way) <hi>and therefore asserting the person here spoken of, to
be a person seemingly righteous only, yet lets fall such things, as declared nothing
to be wanting in this Righteous person, but Perseverance.</hi> But that <hi>Calvin</hi> grants
in any expression of his, this person, or him concerned herein, to be in such
an estate, as to want nothing but Perseverance, to render them everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blessed, is notoriously false; neither does any thing in the expressions cited
by M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> come from the body of his discourse, in the least look that
way, as might easily be manifested, did I judge it meet in a Context of this
nature, to trade in the Authorities of men; so that I cannot but wonder with
what confidence, he is pleased to impose such a sence upon his words; all this
while then, notwithstanding any thing our Author hath to say to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the <hi>Righteous Person</hi> here intended, may be only such an one, as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the entrance of this Consideration of his; and that it is not requisite
from the Text, or Context, that he should be any other, is more evident than
that it is to be contended against.</p>
            <p>Sect. 7. <hi>He deales with another Exposition of the words, which hath no
small countenance given unto it from the Scriptures, which for to prevaile
himselfe upon an expression or two, by the by, he sets downe in the words of
D.</hi> Prideaux Lect. 6. <hi>and they are these.</hi> There is (<hi>saith he</hi>) a double Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
one, inherent, or of Workes, by which we are sanctified; another, imputed, or
of Faith, whereby we are justified; A righteous man may turne aside from his own
Righteousnesse: <hi>viz.</hi> from his Holinesse, and fall into very heinous sinnes: but it
doth not follow from hence, that therefore he hath wholly shaken off from him [or
out of him] the Righteousnesse of Christ. <hi>To this he adornes a threefold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1.
The Doctor here persents us with a piece of new Divinity, in making San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
and Justification, no more intimate friends, than that one can live
without the company and presence of the other. Doubtlesse if a mans justification,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59070:232"/>
may stay behind when his Holinesse is departed, that assertion of the Apostle will
hardly stand; without Holinesse no man shall see the Lord. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. And if
they that are Christs [<hi>i.e.</hi> who believe in Christ, and thereby are justified] have
crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts (another assertion of the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
how their relation unto Christ should stand, and yet their Holinesse sinke and
fall, I understand not. But I leave his friends to be his enemies in this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How little advantage Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath obtained by attempting a
diversion from the Consideration of the matter insisted on; (which is all he
doth in this Paragraph) will quickly appeare. From the Righteousnesse of
Sanctification there is (or may be supposed) a twofold fall. First from the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises</hi>
of it, in all or any of the fruits thereof, according to the will of God.
Secondly from the <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of it, in respect of its roote and gronnd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
in the soule; it is the former that the <hi>Doctor</hi> asserts. A man saith he,
may fall away from the zealous practice of the dutyes of holinesse,
and with, or under violence of Temptation (as to fruit-bearing) decay in close
walking, untill the whole seeme really to dye, so as through the righteous
judgment of God, to be exposed to calamityes, corrections and punishments
in this Life, yea the great death it selfe, as it fell out in the case of <hi>Josiah,</hi> who
fell by the sword in undertaking against the mind and will of God: but
now for the worke and principles of Holinesse, none who have once received
it, can ever cast it up, and he come wholly without, and between this, and
the righteousnesse of justification, there is that strict connexion, that the one
cannot, doth not consist without the other; if now Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> understands
not, how a Justifyed, Sanctifyed person, may decline from the wayes, and
pretences of Holinesse for a season, so as to provoke the Lord to deale sharply,
yea and sometimes terribly with him, take vengeance of his invention,
and yet that person not loose his relation to Christ, nor his interest in the
Love and favour of God, I shall not presume to instruct him in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof; but referre him to them who are better able so to do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
upon the account of his aptnesse to heare as well as teatch, I presume their
undertakings will not be difficult. He adds.</p>
            <p>2. He seemes by his word (penitus) wholly, thoroughly, or altogether, to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
also in another straine of Divinity, and to teach magis and minus in Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For in saying that from a mans apostatizing from his owne righteousnesse,
it doth not follow that therefore he hath wholly or altogether shaken off the imputed
righteousnes of Christ, doth he not imply, that a man may shake off some part of the
righteousnesse of Christ from him, and yet keepe another part of it upon him? Or
else that by sinning, he may come to weare the entire garment, or clothing of it so
loosely, that it will be ready to drop or fall off from him every hour? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that the righteousnesse of Christ sits faster, and closer upon some than
upon others; yea upon the same person at one time than another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That this is a second attempt, for to lead the Reader off from the
consideration of the businesse in hand, and to prepare him by a diversion, to
an acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what he afterwards tenders, in way of reply, that he may not
perceive how insufficient, it is for the purpose, by an immediate comparing
of it, with the answer it selfe, is evident. Truly when in my younger dayes, I
was wont to heare that <hi>Doctor</hi> in his Lectures, and other exercises, I did not
think then I should have afterwards found him called in question for want
of skill to expresse himselfe, and the sence of his minde in <hi>Latine,</hi> he having a
readinesse and dexterity in that Language equall to any that ever I knew, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet am I convinced that his word <hi>penitus,</hi> upon which Mr <hi>Goodwin cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiseth,</hi>
(being commonly as might by innumerable instances be made good)
used to encrease and make emphaticall the import of the word wherewith it
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59070:233"/>
is associated) will evince any such meaning in his expression, as is there inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Mr <hi>Goodwin.</hi> Justification is, and it was so taught by the <hi>Doctor</hi> to be
(<hi>Lect. de Just.</hi>) in respect of all persons that are partakers of it equall: and
equall to every person so partaking of it, at all times; though in regard of
sence, and <hi>perception,</hi> and the peace and comfort, wherewith (when perceived,
and felt) it is attended, it is no lesse subject to encreases and wanings than
Sanctification it selfe. So that this also might be attended by the <hi>Doctor</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least straine of new Divinity, that Justifyed and Sanctifyed persons,
though they might so decline from the course of close walking with God, as
for a season to be like a tree in Winter, whose substance is in his roots, his
leaves and fruite falling off ceasing to bring forth the fruits of Holinesse, in
such degrees as formerly, and so loose their sence of acceptation with God,
through Christ, and the peace, with consolation, and joy wherewith it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
yet they could not, nor should not, wholly be cast out of the favour
of God; the nature and essence of their Justification being abiding; and what
singular straine of Divinity there is, in the tendency of such a discourse I know
not. Besides that teaching of <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus</hi> in Justification should be any
singular thing in Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> I do not well understand; for if the matter of
our Righteousnesse, or that upon the imputation whereof unto us, we are
Justifyed, may have its degrees, and receive <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> as certainely
our Faith, may and doth; why our Justification may not do so too, I see no
Reason. But he comes at length to the matter and addeth.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, were it granted unto the Doctor, that from a mans turning aside from
his own Holinesse, it doth not follow, that therefore he hath wholly divested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of the Righteousnesse of Christ imputed; yet from Gods determination, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
a man to be in an estate of condemnation, &amp; of death, it followes roundly,
that therefore he is divested of the Righteousnesse of Christ imputed (if ever he
were invested with it before) because no man with that Righteousnesse upon him,
can be in such an estate. Now we have upon severall grounds proved, that the
Righteous man under that Apostacy, wherein Ezechiel describes and presents him,
is pronounced by God, a child, not of a temporall, but eternall death and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
This indeed the Doctor denyes, but gives no reason of his denyall, for which
I blame him not. Only I must crave leave to say, that the Chair weigheth not so
much, as one good Argument, with me; much lesse, as many. So that all this while, he
that spake, and still speakes unto the world, by Ezekiel, is no friend to that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which denyeth a possibility of a righteous mans declining even unto death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If this be all that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to say, for the removall of this
Answer, that cuts the throat of his Argument, if it be not removed, he hath
little Reason for the confidence wherewith he closeth it, concerning <hi>Gods
speaking in this place of Ezechiel, against that Doctrine</hi> which in innumerable
places of his Word he hath taught us, as a Doctrine enwrapping no small
portion of that Grace, which in a Covenant of Mercy he dispenseth to his
<hi>Chosen, Redeemed, Justifyed, Sanctifyed ones:</hi> neither is here any need to adde,
the weight of the <hi>Chair</hi> (wherein yet that person spoke of, behaved himselfe
worthily in his Generation, and was in his Exercises herein, by no meanes by
Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to be despised) be laid upon the Reasonings of the <hi>Doctor</hi> in this
case, they proving singly of themselves, too <hi>heavy</hi> for Mr <hi>Goodwin to beare.</hi> In
briefe that the substance of the reply in hand, is meerely a begging of the
thing in Question, any one that hath but halfe an eye in the businesse of this
nature, may easily discerne; that it is supposed that a man truly Righteous,
and Justifyed in the bloud of Christ, may so fall away, as to be pronounced of
God to be in a state of damnation, and so fallen really from his former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.) is the thing that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to prove; Now saith he,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59070:233"/>
this must needes be so, because God here upon such a supposall, pronounceth
such a man to be in the estate of condemnation, what this is with other men,
I know not; but to me, it is no proofe at all; nor should I believe that to be
the sence of the place, though in variety of expressions he should significantly
affirme it a thousand times; the Reader also is misinformed that the <hi>Doctor</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
not any proof, that by <hi>death,</hi> eternall death is not in this place inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he that shall consult the plaee will finde himselfe abused; but we must
speake more of this anon.</p>
            <p>And this is all our Authour offers as to the persons spoken of in the place of
Scripture under consideration, wherein though he hath taken some paines
to little or no purpose, to take off the exposition of the words, &amp; the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the person given by others, yet he hath not attempted to give so much
as one Argument, to confirme the sence he would impose on us, concerning
the condition of the person spoken of; And I must crave leave to say, that
naked assertions be they never so many, in the <hi>Chaire</hi> or out, weigh not
so much with me, as one good Argument, much lesse as many.</p>
            <p>There is nothing remaines to consideration,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> but only the <hi>Comminatory</hi> part
of the words, or the expression of the <hi>punishment</hi> allotted of God, to such as
walke in the wayes of Apostasy here expressed, <hi>in his trespasse that he hath
trespassed, and in his sinne that he hath sinned, in them shall he dye;</hi> that is, He
shall be dealt withall, as many of their Nation were in the <hi>Land of Israel;</hi> my
judgements shall overtake him; it shall not advantage him, that either he
had Godly Parents that have walked with mee, or that he himselfe, had so
behaved himselfe in a way of Righteousnesse, as before described, if he turne
to the profanenesse and abominations, which are laid downe as the waies of
wicked men, or into any paths like them, he shall <hi>even dye,</hi> or be punished for
his sinnes, according to the tenour of the truth, laid downe in the entrance of
the Chapter, and repeated againe v. 20. <hi>the soule that sinneth it shall dye.</hi> But
now whereas it might be replied, that such an one, notwithstanding his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy,
might yet perhaps recover himselfe, to his former way of walking,
obedience, and righteousnesse in conversation; And is there then no hope,
nor helpe for him, but having once so Apostatised, he must suffer for it? To
prevent any such misprision of the mind of God, there is added the termes of
his duration in that state of Apostasy, that is even unto death; if he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
iniquity, and dyeth in it, that is, repents not of it, before his death, the
judgements of God shall find him out, as was before expressed. If by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
he prevent not his calamities, he shall end his sinning in destruction;
in which expressions of the persons continuance in his <hi>Apostatised</hi> condition,
and of the judgements of God falling on him on that account, there is not
the least appearance of any <hi>Tautology,</hi> or incongruity in the sence; the same
word is used to expresse diverse concernements of it; which is no <hi>Tautology</hi>
though the same word be used, yet the same thing is not intended, Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
reflects on things not words, otherwise there must be a Tautology where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>John 1. 4. %to commit iniquity, and to dye therein,</hi> is
no more but to continue in his iniquity impenitently untill death; now to say
that a man was put to death for his fault, because he committed it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
impenitent in it, even unto the death, which he was adjudged to, and
which was inflicted on him for his fault, is an incoherent expression, it seems
will puzle, as great a master of Language as M.G. to make good.</p>
            <p>M.G. endeavours to make the punishment threatned in the words (<hi>he shall
dye for his iniquity) precisely</hi> and <hi>exclusively</hi> to signify eternall death (which
the former interpretation doth not exclude) which he is no way able to make
good. what he offers Sect. 3. concerning the incongruity of the sence, and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59070:234"/>
tautology of the expression of it, be not so understood, hath been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
the comparison ensuing instituted between these words, and those of
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. Should have been enforced with some consideration of the coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
of the scope of either place, with the expressions used in them and
though Repentance (which is also added) will not deliver them from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
or naturall death, yet it will and may as did <hi>Ahab</hi> in part, from having
that death inflicted, in the way of an extraordinary Judgement.</p>
            <p>Sect. 4. Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> offers sundry things, all of the same importance and
tendency, all animated by the same fallacyes or mistakes, to make good the
sence he insists on, exclusively to all others, of these words, <hi>he shall dye,</hi> and he
tells you, that, <hi>If the Righteousnesse such men have done, shall come into no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that it shall not profit him as to his temporall deliverance, then it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it should profit him as to his eternall Salvation.</hi> But first, according to our
interpretation of the words, there is no necessity incumbent on us, to affirme
that the persons mentioned, shall obtaine Salvation, though we say that
<hi>eternall death,</hi> is not precisely threatned in the words; but yet that a man
may not by the just hand of God be punished with temporall death for his
faults and iniquityes, (as <hi>Josiah</hi> fell by the sword,) and yet have his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
reckoned to him as to his great recompence of reward, is a strain of
doctrine that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> will scarce abide by. I dare not say that all who
dyed in the <hi>wildernesse of the Children of Israel,</hi> went to Hell, and came short
of eternall Life; and yet they all fell there because of their iniquityes. But he
adds.</p>
            <p>Sect. 4. Againe that which God here threatneth against that double, or two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
iniquity of back-sliding, is opposed to that life, which is Promised to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Perseuerance in their well-doing: But this Life is confessed by all to be
eternall Life, therefore the death opposite to it, must needs be Eternall, or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death. When the Apostle saith the wages of sinne is death, but the guift of
God is eternall Life through Christ Jesus our Lord. Rom. 6. 23. Is it not evident
from the antithesis, or opposition in the tendency, between the death and life men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in it that by that death, which he affirmes to be the wages of sinne, is
meant eternall death, how else will the opposition stand?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> here mentioned, the one promised
<hi>v.</hi> 9. the other threatned in those insisted on, are opposed, and of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and kind the one is, of the same is the other to be esteemed. It is also
confessed, that the Life Promised in the Covenant of Mercy to Repentance,
is <hi>eternall</hi> Life, and the wages of sinne mentioned in the <hi>Law,</hi> is Death <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi>
but that therefore, that must be the sence of the words when they are
made use of, in answer to an Objection expressed in a <hi>proverb</hi> concerning the
<hi>Land of Israel,</hi> and when it was temporall death that was complained of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the <hi>proverb,</hi> the <hi>Fathers have eaten sower graps, and the childrens teeth
are set on edge,</hi> (they did not complaine that they were damned for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sinnes) that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth not attempt to prove; and I do not blame
him for his silence therein. He sayes yet againe.</p>
            <p>When God in the Scriptures threatens impenitent persons with death for their
sinnes, doubtlesse he intends and meanes, eternall death, or that Death which is
the wages of sinne. Otherwise we have no sufficient ground to believe or thinke,
that men dying in their sinnes without Repentance, shall suffer the vengeance of
eternall fire, not only a temporall or naturall death; which those who are righteous
and truly eminent themseves suffer as well as they; therefore to say that God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
impenitent Apostates (in the place in hand) with a temparall Death only,
when as elsewhere he threatens impenitency, under the lightest guilt of all, with
eternall death, is (in effect) to represent him as vehement and fore in his diswasives
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59070:234"/>
from ordinary and lesser sinnes; as indifferent and remisse in disswading from sins
of the greatest provocation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The summe of this Reason is, if the death there threatned to those
men of our present contest, be not death eternall, we have no sufficient
ground to believe, that God will inflict any death on impenitent Apostates,
but only that which is temporall or naturall, which others dye as well as they,
and why so I beseech you; is there no other place of Scripture, whence it
may be evinced, that <hi>eternall death</hi> is the wages of sinne? or is every place
thereof where death is threatned to sinne, so circumstantiated as this place is?
Is the threatning every where given out upon the like occasion, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to the like state of things? These Discourses are exceeding <hi>loose,
sophisticall,</hi> and inconclusive neither is a violent death counted naturall,
though it be the dissolution of nature.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any thing more added by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in all his conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the words of this passage of the Scriptures, than what we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on: that he nextly mentioneth (<hi>that if God here threatneth impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
only with temporall death, then why should the most profligate sinners feare any
other punishment?</hi>) is of more energie, for the confirmation and building up the
sence which he imposeth on the words, than that which went before, they
with whom he hath to do, will tell him that he doth all along most vainly
assume, and beg the thing in question, <hi>viz.</hi> That the persons intimated, are
absolutely impenitent sinners; and not so under some considerations only;
that is, that do never recover themselves from their degeneracy from close
walking with God; nor do the words indeed necessarily import any thing else;
and for impenitent sinners in generall (not those who are only so termed)
there are testimonyes sufficient in the Scriptures concerning Gods righteous
judgment, in their <hi>eternall condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the first testimony produced by Mr <hi>G.</hi> for the proofe of the
<hi>Saints Apostacy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> a witnesse which of all others, he doth most rely upon, and
which he bringeth in, with the greatest acclamation of successe, (before the
triall) imaginable. That when he hath brought him forth, he giues us no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the least, <hi>whence he comes,</hi> what is his businesse, or what he aimes to
confirme, nor can make good his speaking one word on his behalfe. Indeed
as the matter is handled, I some thing question, whether lightly a weaker
Argument hath been learned on, in a case of so great importance, than that
which from these words is drawn for the Apostacy of the Saints; for as we
have not the least attempt made, to give us an account of the context, scope,
and intendment of the place, (by which yet the expressions, in the verses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, must be regulated) no more can any one expression in it, be made
good, to be of that sence, and signification, which yet alone will, or can yeild
the least advantage to the cause, for whose protection it is so earnestly called
upon; Now the leaders and <hi>Captaines</hi> of the forces Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath mustered
in this 12. Chapter, being thus discharged, the residue, or the followers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
will easily be prevailed with, to returne every one to his owne place in
peace.</p>
            <p>The next place of Scripture produced to consideration,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> ushers
in (<hi>Sect.</hi> 11.) with a description of the Adversaries with whom in this Context,
he hath to doe, and sets them off to publique view, with the desireable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
of <hi>ignorance, prejudice,</hi> and <hi>partiality,</hi> having it seems, neither inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
enough candidly, and fairely themselves to search into, and to weigh
the Scriptures, wherein the case in question is clearely determined; nor skill
enough to understand and receive them, when so dexterously opened to their
hand by M. G. What they are, the Lord knoweth, will judge, determine, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:59070:235"/>
in the appointed time declare: and it may be the day, that shall <hi>manifest all
things,</hi> will vindicate them from those reproaches; in the meane time, such
expressions as these, ly in the <hi>middle,</hi> between all parties at variance, exposed
to the use of any that is pleased to take them up: the place insisted on in the
sequell of this Preface, is the <hi>Parable</hi> of our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 32, 33. the whole
extent of the <hi>Parable</hi> is from v. 20. to the end of the Chapter: Hence M. G.
thus inferreth <hi>Sect:</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Evident it is from our Saviours rendition or application of the Parable (so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
shall my heavenly Father doe also unto you, if &amp;c.) (speaking unto his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
v. 1. and to Peter more particularly v. 21.) that Persons truly regenerate, and
justified before God (for such were they, to whom in speciall manner he addresseth
the Parable, and the application of it, and indeed the whole carriage of the Parable
sheweth, that it was calculated, and formed only for such) may through high mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours
in sinning, as (for example) by unmercifulnesse, cruelty, oppression, &amp;c.
turne themselves out of the justifying Grace and Favour of God, quench the spirit
of Regeneration, and come to have their portions with Hypocrites and Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
This is not the only occasion whereupon we have to deale with this
Parable: The <hi>Socinians</hi> wrest it also with violence, to disprove the <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ,</hi> from the mention that is made in it, of the free <hi>forgivenesse of sins,</hi>
and the Lords injoyning others to doe what he did; they doubtlesse being to
<hi>forgive without satisfaction</hi> given or made, as to any crimes committed against
them. M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> with much lesse <hi>probability,</hi> of drawing nigh to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of our Saviour in this place, makes use of it, or rather abuses it, to
countenance his Doctrine of the <hi>Apostasy of the Saints:</hi> To both I say, <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
have their bounds and limits, their lines and proportions, scope and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
intendment, beyond which they prove nothing at all: to wring the <hi>nose</hi>
of a Parable or similitude, to force it to an universall compliance, <hi>will bring
forth bloud.</hi> There is nothing so sottish, or foolish, or contradictious in, and
to it selfe, as may not be countenanced, from teaching Parables to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and proving, in every parcell or expression that attends them. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of the <hi>Parable</hi> here used, that wherein from the proportion, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerablenesse
of the <hi>comparats</hi> it argueth, is neither that God forgives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
satisfaction to his justice, being the judge of all the World, nor that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
may fall away by <hi>sinnes of unmercifulnesse and oppression, and so perish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly,</hi>
but that men upon the account of mercy, and forgivenesse recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God in Christ, ought to extend mercy, and kindnesse to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
God threatning, and revenging unmercifulnesse and oppression, in, and
on whomsoever it is found; whether it be <hi>Ignorance</hi> in us, or what it be, the
Lord knowes, and will judge: but we are not able to stretch the lines of this
<hi>Parable</hi> one step towards what M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would lengthen them unto; that
no persons whatever, must or ought to expect, the grace, and pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God to them, who have no bowells of compassion towards their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
is clearly taught; in making the rest of the circumstances of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
argumentative, we cannot joyne with our Adversary, he himselfe in his
so doing, working meerly for his own ends.</p>
            <p>2. Finding his Exposition of this Parable,<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> liable and obnoxious to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
in that it renders God changeable in his dealings with men, and a
knot to be cast on his Doctrine, which he is not able to untie, he ventures
boldly to cut it in pieces, by affirming that <hi>indeed God loves no man at all, with
any love, but the approbation of the qualifications that are in him, and that he
cannot be said to change in reference of that, which is not in him at all:</hi> This he
sets out, and illustrates variously with the dealings of men, and the Laws
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59070:235"/>
that are made amongst them, rewarding what is good, and punishing what is
evill, &amp;c. words fully fitted in his apprehension, to the clearing of God, from
any shadow of alteration in that course of proceeding, which to him he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes,
and tells you the <hi>roote of the mistake concerning the Love of God</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any mans person, lyes in that <hi>Capitall errour, of personall Election,</hi> or a
purpose of God to give Grace, and Glory to any one in Christ: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
That M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth at all understand the love of God, if his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of it be uniforme to what he expresseth here in disputation, I must
question. An eternall, unchangeable love of God, to some, in Christ, is not
now my taske to demonstrate: it may through the patience, and goodnesse
of God, find a place in my weake endeavours for the Lord, ere long: When it
will be a matter of delight, to consider the Scriptures, and Testimonies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
that M.G. will produce for the eversion of such a <hi>personall election;</hi> for
the present I shall only take notice of the face of his judgement in the thing,
which (<hi>Sec.</hi> 13.) he here delivers: <hi>All the Love which God bears to men, or to any
person of man, is either in respect of their nature, and as they are men, in respect
of which he beares a generall or common love to them, or in respect of their qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as they are good men, in one degree or other, in respect whereof he bears a
more speciall love to them:</hi> What that common love is, in M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which God bears to all men, as men, we know full well: He also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is not unacquainted how often it hath been demonstrated to be a vaine
and foolish figment (in the sence by him and his associates obtruded on us)
derogatory to all the glorious Properties of the nature of God, and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with any thing, that of himselfe he hath revealed. The Demonstration
and farther eviction whereof, waits its season, which I hope draweth on. The
speciall love which he bears persons in respect of their <hi>qualifications,</hi> is only
his <hi>Approbation</hi> of those qualifications, where ever they are, and in whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
That these <hi>qualifications</hi> are Faith, Love, Repentance, Gospell obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c. Is not called into question: I would faine know of M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> on
what account and consideration, some men and not all, are translated from
the condition of being objects of Gods common love, to become objects of
his peculiar love; or from whence spring these <hi>qualifications,</hi> which are the
procurement of it; whether they are from any love of God to them, in whom
they are? If not, on what account do men come to have Faith, Love, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c. If they are from any Love of God, whether it be from the common
Love of God to man, as men? and if so, why are not all men endowed with
those qualifications? If from his peculiar Love, how come they to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and causes of the same thing? Or whether indeed this assertion be not
destructive to the whole Covenant of Grace, and the effectuall dispensations
of it in the bloud of Christ? And to his second Testimony I shall adde no
more.</p>
            <p>The third place insisted on, is that of the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. Hence he thus
argueth.<note place="margin">§. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If Paul, after his conversion unto Christ, was in a possibility of being, or becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Reprobate, or cast away, then may true Believers fall away both totally and
finally (for finally ever includes totally) But the Antecedent is true: Paul after
his conversion, was in the possibility mentioned: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Major Proposition (I
presume) will passe without controle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is not able to make good eitheir of the <hi>Propositions</hi>
in this <hi>syllogisme,</hi> will evidently appeare in the conclusion of our examination,
of what he drawes forth, new and old to that purpose; of the <hi>Major</hi> he gives
you only this account: <hi>It will passe I presume with out controulc:</hi> but by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
unlesse cleared from ambiguity of expressions and fallacy, it is not like
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59070:236"/>
to obtaine so faire a passage, as is presumed, and fancyed.</p>
            <p>Though the terme of <hi>possibility</hi> in the supposition, and, <hi>may be,</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
seeme to be <hi>equipollent,</hi> yet to render them of the same significancy,
as to the Argument in hand, they must both be used in the same respect, but
if a possibility of being a reprobate, (that is, one rejected of God, by a <hi>meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy</hi>
of the effect,) be ascribed to <hi>Paul</hi> in respect of himselfe, and the infirmity
of his owne will as to abiding with God, in which case alone there is any
appearance of truth in the Assumption of this supposition, and the terme of
<hi>may be,</hi> in respect of Believers falling totally &amp; finally away, respects the event,
&amp; purpose, decrees or Promise of God, concerning it, (in which sence alone, it
is any step to the purpose, in hand) I deny the inference, and thereby
at the very entrance, give checke, and <hi>controule</hi> to Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure:
That which is possible to come to passe, that terme <hi>possible,</hi> affecting
the end, or comming to passe, must be every way, and in all respects possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
this is the intendment of the inference: That which is possible in respect
of some certaine causes, or principles, (the termes of <hi>possibility</hi> affecting the
thing it selfe, whereof it is spoken in its next causes) may be impossible on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account; &amp; in this sence only is there any colour of truth contained in the
supposition; so that the <hi>Major Proposition</hi> of this <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> is laid up and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for doing any farther service in this case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 22.</note> But Paul after his conversion was in a possibility of becoming a
Reprobate or cast-away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> He was not in respect of the event, upon the account of the purpose
and promises of God of him, and to him made in Christ; though any such
possibility may be affirmed of him, in respect of himselfe, and his own will,
not confirmed in Grace, unto an impossibility of swerving: Now this <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
he thus farther attempts <hi>syllogistically</hi> to confirme.</p>
            <p>That which Paul was very sollicitous &amp; industrious to prevent, he was in a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of suffering or being made. But Paul was very sollicitous and industrious to
prevent his being made a cast-way, as the Scripture in hand plainely avoucheth; he
kept under his body and brought it in subjection, in order to prevent his becoming
a cast-away: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He was in danger or possibility of being made a cast-away. The
reason of the consequence in the Major Proposition, is, because no man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
will be sollicitous to prevent or hinder the coming to passe of such a thing,
the comming to passe whereof, he knowes to be impossible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Once more, The major is questioned: <hi>Paul</hi> might and ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the use of meanes, for the preventing of that, which in respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
he might possibly run into, God having appointed those meanes to be
used for the prevention of the end feared, and avoided; although in respect of
some other preventing cause, it was <hi>impossible</hi> he should so do: He who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<hi>that in him, that is in his flesh dwelleth no good, that he had a law in his
members leading him captive to the Law of sinne, and sinne working in him all
manner of concupisence,</hi> for whose prevention from running out into a course
of sinning, God hath appointed meanes to be used, might use those meanes
for that end, notwithstanding that God had immutably Purposed, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Promised, that in the use of those meanes, he should attaine the end ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at; And the Reason Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> gives for the confirmation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
is no other, but that which we have so often exploded, <hi>viz.</hi> That
a man need not, ought not to use meanes for attaining of any end, though
appointed and instituted of God for that end, and purpose; if so be the end
for which they are ordained, shall certainely and infallibly be compassed, and
accomplished by them. Our Saviour Christ, thought meet to use the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
wayes for the preservation of his life, notwithstanding the Promise of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59070:236"/>
keeping him by the <hi>Angels:</hi> and <hi>Hezechiah</hi> neglected not the meanes of Life,
notwithstanding the infallible promise of Living so long, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
<hi>Paul</hi> was carefull in the use of meanes, to prevent that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himselfe,
it was possible for him to runne into, though he had or might have
assurance, that through the faithfulnesse and power of God, in the use of
those meanes, (as an antecedent of the consequent, though not the conditions
of the event) he should be preserved certainely and infallibly from what he
was so in himselfe apt unto. So that whatever be the peculiar intendment of
the Apostle in this place, taking the terme <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the largest sence possible,
and in a significancy of the greatest compasse, yet nothing will regularly be
inferred thence, to the least prejudice of the Doctrine I have undertaken to
maintaine.</p>
            <p>And this may suffice as to the utmost of what Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Argument from
this place doth reach unto.<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> There is another, and that a more proper sence
of the place, and accommodated to the context and scope of the Apostle
wherewith the Doctrine indeavoured to be confirmed from hence, hath not
the least pretence of communication. And this ariseth (as was before mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested)
from the scope of the place, with the proper native signification of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here translated a <hi>cast-away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The businesse that the Apostle hath in hand, from <hi>v.</hi> 15. of the chapter, and
which he presses to the end, is a relation of his own principles, wayes, and
deportment in the great worke of the preaching of the Gospell to him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
in the last words of the chapter he acquaints us with one especiall
ayme he had in the carrying on of that worke, through the whole course
of his employment therein. And is his such care, and endeavour after <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
mortification,</hi> holinesse, and selfe-denyall, that he might no way be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up, nor entangled with the revelations made to him; therein providing
in the midst of the great certainety, and assurance which he had (<hi>v.</hi> 26.) that
he might approve himselfe a workeman not needing to be ashamed, as not
only preaching to others for their good, but himselfe also accepted of God,
in the discharge of that employment, as one that had dealt uprightly, and
faithfully therein. <hi>v.</hi> 17. he acquaints us with what is the state and condition
of them that preach the Gospell, their worke may go on, and yet themselves
not be approved in the worke: this he laboured to prevent, walking upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
faithfully, sincerely, zelously, humbly in the discharge of his duty: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
saith he <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>least having preached to others he
should not himselfe be approved and accepted in that worke, and so loose the reward
mentioned (v.</hi> 17.) peculiar to them, who walke in the discharge of their duty
with a <hi>right foote,</hi> according to the mind of God. The whole context, designe,
and scope of the Apostle, with the native signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
us evidently and directly to this interpretation, it is sufficiently cleare,
that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is llke to finde little shelter for his <hi>Apostasy,</hi> in this Assertion
of the Apostle. And besides, whatever be the importance of the word, the
Apostle mentions not any thing but his conscientious diligent use of the
meanes, for the attaining of an end, which end yet may fully be promised
of God to be so brought about, and accomplished.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> tells us indeed,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>is in the writings of the
Apostle, constantly translated Reprobate, as Rom. 1. 28. 2 Cor. 13. 5, 6, 7. 2 Tim.</hi>
3. 8. <hi>Tit. 1. 16. %or is expressed by a word equivalent, as Heb.</hi> 6. 8. how rightly this
is done, in his judgement he tells us not: that it is so done, serves his turne; &amp;
he hath no cause farther to trouble himselfe about it: The truth is, in
most of the places intimated, the word is so restrained, either from the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the thing expressed, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. or the condition of the persons of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:59070:237"/>
whom it is affirmed, with some adjunct in the use of it, as 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 8. %Tit.</hi> 1.
16. that it necessarily imports a <hi>disallowance</hi> or <hi>Rejection</hi> of God, as to the
whole state and condition wherein they are, of whom it is asserted, joyned
with a profligate disposition to farther abominations in themselves; that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
place it imports, what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> would wrest it here unto, a man final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected of God, what ever may be the thought of others, he will not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert;
and what ever the translation be, I would know of him, whether in any
place, where the word is used, he doth indeed understand it in any other sence,
than that which here he opposes; only with this difference, that in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it regards the <hi>generall condition</hi> and state of them, concerning whom it is
affirmed, here only the condition of a man, restrained to the particular case
of <hi>labouring in the Ministry,</hi> which is under consideration 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5, 6, 7. the
word cannot be extended any farther, than to signify a condition of men,
when they are not <hi>accepted nor approved;</hi> which is the sence of the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for; nor yet <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 8. though it be attended with those severall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of <hi>nigh unto cursing &amp;c.</hi> The Apostle ascending by degrees in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the state of the <hi>unfruitfull barren land,</hi> saies first it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
by the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> as that which he hath spent his cost and labour
about in vaine; so that not only the originall first signification of the word, (as
is known,) stands for the sence contended for, but it is also evidently <hi>restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
to that sence by the context, designe and scope of the place, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of the Apostle therein, the word being the same that in all other
places of the writings of the same Apostle, unlesse where it is measured, as to
its extent and compasse, by some adjoyned expression, which is interpretative
of it, as to the particular place, being still of the same signification.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> ensuing discourse, is concerning the judgement of Expositors
upon the place, particularly naming <hi>Chrysostome, Calvin, Musculus, Deodate,
the English Annotators,</hi> of whom notwithstanding, not any one doe appeare
for him, so unhappy is he in his quotations, though sundry of good note, (and
amongst them <hi>Piscator</hi> himselfe) doe interpret the word in the sence by
him contended for; knowing full well, that it may be allowed in its utmost
significancy, without the least prejudice to the Doctrine of <hi>the Saints Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
as hath been manifested: of these mentioned by M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> there is
not any one, from first to last, but restrained the word to the <hi>reproachablenesse</hi>
or <hi>inreproachablenesse</hi> of the Apostle, in the discharge of the <hi>worke of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>
the sence of it, which we also insist upon, to spend time and labour in
searching the expressions of particular men, weighing and considering the
coherence, designe, and circumstances of their writings, is besides my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the judgement of what hath been affirmed, is left to the intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who supposeth it of his concernment, to inquire particularly into it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> What is added of the <hi>Scope</hi> of the place <hi>Sect. 15. pag.</hi> 280. alone requires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther consideration, this he then thus proposeth.</p>
            <p>5. The scope of the place from verse 23. evinceth the legitimacy of such a sence
in both, above all contradiction; for the Apostle, having asserted this for the reason,
motive, and end, why he had made himselfe a servant to all men, in bearing with
all mens weaknesses and humors in the course of his Ministry, <hi>viz.</hi> that he might
be partaker of the Gospell (<hi>i.e.</hi> of the saving benefit or blessing of the Gospell) with
them, v. 23. and againe, that what he did, he did to obtaine an incorruptible
Crowne, v. 25. plainly sheweth, that that which he sought to prevent, by running
and fighting at such an high rate as he did, was not the blame and disparagement
of some such misbehaviour, under which notwithstanding he might retaine the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
love of God, but the losse of his part and portion in the Gospell, and of that
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59070:237"/>
incorruptible Crowne which he sought by that severe hand, which he still held over
himselfe, to obtaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The scope of the place was before manifested, in answer to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on the whole discourse foregoing, from v. 15. where the Apostle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon the relation of his deportment, in the worke and service of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
with a particular eye to his carriage therein, as to his <hi>use,</hi> or <hi>forbearance</hi>
of the <hi>allowance of temporall things,</hi> from them to whom he Preached, which
was due to him, by all right, whereby any claime in any kind whatever, may
be pursued, together with the expresse institution of the Lord Jesus Christ, by
him before laid downe. In this course he behaved himselfe with wisdome,
zeale and diligence, having many glorious aimes in his eye, as also being full
of a sence of the duty incumbent on him (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) to whose performance he
was constrained by the Law of Jesus Christ, as he also here expresses. Among
other things that provoked him to, and supported him in his hard labour and
travaile, was, the Love he bare to the Gospell, and that he might have with
others fellowship in the propagation and declaration of the glorious message

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Gospells sake, or the
love he bare to it, he desired with others to be partaker of it; that is, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
worke of <hi>preaching</hi> of it; for of the <hi>benefit</hi> of the Gospell he might
have bin partaker with other Believers, though he had never bin set a part to
its <hi>promulgation.</hi> In his whole Discourse he still speaks accommodately to his
businesse in hand; for the describing of his worke of Apostleship, in preaching
the glorious Gospell of Jesus Christ; and as to the end of this worke, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us that there was proposed before him the <hi>incorruptible Crown</hi> of his
Masters approbation, (upon his lawfull <hi>running and striving</hi> in the <hi>way of the
ministry,</hi> whereto he was called) the peculiar Glory of them, whom he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to imploy in this service; and though the cause of his <hi>fighting at that rate,</hi>
as he did, was not wholly the feare of non approbation in that worke, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of duty being incumbent on him, which he was to discharge, yet he
that knowes how to value the crowne of approbation from Christ, the holy
Angels and the Church, of having Faithfully discharged the office of a <hi>Steward</hi>
in dispensing the things of God, will think it sufficiently effectuall to stirre up
any one to the utmost expence of Love, paines and diligence that he may not
come short of it; And of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> proofe this is the issue.</p>
            <p>His next is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6, 7. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 26, 27. which he brings
in attended with the ensuing Discourse,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> Sect. 18.</p>
            <p>The next passage we shall insist npon to evince the possibility of a finall defection
in the Saints, openeth it selfe in these words. For it is impossible for those who were
once enlightned, and have tasted of the Heavenly guift, and were made partakers
of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted of the good Word of God, and the powers of the
world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them againe nnto repentance, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they crucify to themselves the sonne of God afresh, and put him to an open
shame. For the earth, which drinketh in the raine, that cometh oft upon it, and
bringeth forth herbes meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing
from God. But that which beareth thornes and briers, is rejected and is nigh unto
cursing, whose end is to be burned. Answerable hereunto is another in the same
Epistle. For if wee sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth,
there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sinnes, but a certaine fearefull looking for of
Judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour the Adversaryes. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
Moses Law dyed without mercy under two or three witnesses. Of how much
sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot
the Son of God, and hath counted the Bloud of the Covenant where with he was
Sanctifyed an unholy thing, and hath done despight unto the Spirit of Grace. Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:59070:238"/>
it is, that in these two passages the Holy Ghost, after a serious manner, &amp; with
a very pathetique &amp; moving straine of Speech, and discourse (scarce the like to be
found in all the Scriptures) admonisheth those who are at present true Believers, to
take heed of relapsing into the wayes of their former ignorance &amp; impiety. This ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat
or admonition he presseth by an argument of this import; that in case they shall
thus relapse, there will be very little or no hope at all, of their recovery or returne
to the Estate of Faith and Grace, wherein now they stand. Before the faces of
such sayings and passages as these, rightly understood, and duely considered, there
is no standing for that Doctrine, which denies a possibility, either of a totall, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
defection of the Saints. But this light also is darkened in the Heavens, by the
interposition of the vailes of these two exceptions. 1. That the Apostle in the said
passages affirmes nothing positively, concerning the falling away of those he speakes
of, but only conditionally and upon supposition. 2. That he doth not speake of true
and sound Believers, but of Hypocrites, and such who had Faith only in shew, not
in substance. The former of these exceptions hath been already nonsuited, and
that by some of the ablest Patrons themselves of the cause of Perseverance; where
we were taught from a pen of that Learning, that such conditionall sayings, upon
which Admonitions, Promises, or Threatnings are built, doe at least suppose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
impossible, however by vertue of their Tenor and forme, they suppose nothing
in being. But</p>
            <p>2. As to the places in hand, there is not any Hypotheticall signe, or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Particle to be found in either of them, as they come from the Holy Ghost, and
are carried in the Originall. Those two, Iffs, appearing in the English Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the one in the former place, the other in the latter, shew (it may be) the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
inclination to the cause, but not their faithfulnesse in their engagement; an
infirmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y whereunto they were very subject, as we shall have occasion to take notice
of the second time ere long, in another instance of the like partiality. But the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of both the passages in hand, is so ordered by the Apostle, that he plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
how great and fearfull the danger is, or will be, when Believers doe, or shall,
fall away, not if, or in case, they shall fall away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Of the two <hi>Answers,</hi> which, as himselfe signifyeth, are usually given
to the objections from these places of Scripture, that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth not
fairely acquit his hands of either, will quickly appeare.</p>
            <p>1. To the first, that the forme of speech used by the Apostle in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is <hi>conditionall,</hi> whence there is no arguing to the event, without begging
the thing in question, or supposall, that the condition in all respects may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
where it requires only to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution of it as a condition in the place
of arguing, wherein it is used, that it be possible in some only, he opposeth.</p>
            <p>That some of them, who have wrote for the <hi>Doctrine of the Saints Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance,</hi>
have disclaimed the use of it, as to its application to the place in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi>
formerly considered; but yet leaving them to the liberty of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who are so minded, that the reason given by them, and here againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> doth not in the least enforce any to let go this Answer
to the objection proposed, that shall be pleased to insist upon it, hath been
manifested.</p>
            <p>To this Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> farther addes that weighty Observation that the
word <hi>If,</hi> is not in the Originall, and thence takes occasion to fall foule upon
the <hi>Translators,</hi> as having corrupted the passages out of favour to the Doctrine
contended for. I wish they had never worse mistaken, nor shewed more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
in any other place; For first, will Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> deny that a proposition
cannot be <hi>Hypotheticall,</hi> nor an expression <hi>conditionall,</hi> unlesse the word <hi>if,</hi> be
expressed; were it worth the labour, instances might abundantly be given him
in that language, whereof we speake, to the contrary. He that shall say to him
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59070:238"/>
as he is journying, <hi>going the right hand way you will meet with theeves,</hi> may be
doubtles said to speake conditionally, no lesse than he that should expresly
tell him, <hi>If you go the way on the right hand you shall meet with theeves.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what cleare sence &amp; significancy can be given the words, without the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of the <hi>conditionall</hi> conjunction, or some other terme <hi>equipollent</hi>
thereunto, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath not declared. <hi>For it is impossible for those who
were once enlightned &amp;c.</hi> And they falling away: as the words (<hi>verbum de verbo</hi>)
lye in the text, is scarce in english a congruous or significant expression:
Yea, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Syntaxe</hi> and coherence wherein it lyes, is most
properly and directly rendered, if they fall away. As is also the
force of the expression, Chap. 10. 26. Yea thirdly the connexion of the
<hi>Translation</hi> mentioned by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> doth not in the least relieve him, as
to the delivery of the words from a <hi>sence, Hypotheticall. When they fall away;</hi>
(though, his <hi>when,</hi> be no more in the text, than the Translators <hi>if</hi>) doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
include a supposition, that they shall and must fall away certainely, and
so requiers the event of the thing whereof it is spoken, or it is expressive only
of the condition, wheron the event is suspended; if it be taken in the first sence,
all Believers <hi>must</hi> fall away, if in the latter none may, notwithstanding any
thing in this Text, (so learnedly restored to its true significancy) the words
only pointing at the connexion, that is between Apostacy and punishment.
Notwithstanding then any thing here offered to the contrarary, those who
affirme that nothing can certainely be concluded from these places for the
Apostacy of any, be they who they will that are intended in them, because
they are <hi>conditionall</hi> Assertions, manifesting only the connexion between the
sin and punishment expressed, need not be ashamed of, nor recoyle from their
Affirmation in the least.</p>
            <p>For mine owne part,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> I confesse, I do not in any measure think it needfull
to insist upon the <hi>conditionalls</hi> of these assertions of the Holy Ghost, as to the
removall of any, or all the oppositions that from them of old, or of late have
been raised, and framed against the Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance,
there being in neither of the Texts insisted on, either <hi>name</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> enquired
after: nor any one of all the severalls enquired into, and constantly in the
Scriptures used in the description of the Saints, and Believers of whom we
speake. This I shall breifely in the first place demonstrate, and then proceed
with the eonsideration of what is offered by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> in opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Some few observations will lead us through the first part of this worke
designed. I say then,</p>
            <p>1. There is an inferiour common worke of the Holy Ghost, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the word, upon many, to whom it is preached, causing in them
a great alteration and change, as to <hi>Light, Knowledge, Abilityes, Guists, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Life,</hi> and <hi>Conversation,</hi> when the persons so wrought upon, are not
<hi>quickned,</hi> regenerate, nor made new creatures, nor united to Jesus Christ. I
suppose there will not be need for me to insist on the proofe of this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the truth of it being notoriously knowne, &amp; confessed as I suppose amongst
all that professe the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>2. That in persons thus wrought upon, there is, or may be, such an <hi>assent</hi>
upon light and conviction, to the truths proposed and Preached to them, as
<hi>is true</hi> in its kind, not counterfeit, giving and affording them, in whom it is
wrought, profession of the Faith, and that sometimes with constancy to the
death, or the <hi>giving of their bodies to be burned,</hi> with perswasions, (whence
they are called Believers) of a future enjoyment, of a glorious and blessed
condition, filling them with ravished affections and rejoycings in hope, which
they professe, suitable to the expectation they have, of such a state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59070:239"/>
This also might be easily evinced by innumerable instances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
from the Scripture, if need required.</p>
            <p>3. That the persons in and upon whom this work is wrought, cannot be
said to be <hi>hypocrites</hi> in the most proper sence of that word: that is, such as
<hi>counterfeit</hi> and pretend themselves to be that, which they know they are not:
nor to have faith only in shew, and not in substance, as though they made a
shew and pretence only of an assent, to the things they professed; their high
gifts, knowledge, faith, change of affections and conversation, being in their
own kind true (as the Faith of Devills is) and yet notwithstanding all this
they are in bondage, and at best, seeke for a righteousnesse, as it were by the
workes of the Law, and in the issue, Christ proves to them of none effect.</p>
            <p>4. That among these persons, many are oftentimes endued with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
gifts, lovely parts, qualifications and abilities, rendring them exceeding
usefull, acceptable, and serviceable to the Church of God, becoming <hi>vessells
in his house,</hi> to hold and convey to others, the precious liquour of the Gospell,
though their nature in themselves be not changed, they <hi>remaining wood and
stone still.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That much of the worke, wrought in and upon this sort of persons, by
the Spirit and word, lies in its own nature in a direct tendency to their relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment
of their sinnes, and selfe-righteousnesse, &amp; to a closing with God in
Christ, having a mighty prevalency upon them, to cause them to amend their
wayes, and to labour after life and salvation: from which to Apostatize and
fall off, upon the account of the tendency mentioned of these beginnings, is
<hi>dangerous</hi> and for the most part <hi>pernitious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. That persons under the convictions and workes of the Spirit former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, partakers of the guifts, light and knowledge spoken of, with
those other endowments attending them, are capacitated for the <hi>sinne against
the Holy Ghost,</hi> or the impardonable Apostasy from God.</p>
            <p>These things being commonly knowne, and as farre as I know, universally
granted, I affirme, <hi>that the persons mentioned and intended in these places, are such
as have been now described, and not the Believers or Saints, concerning whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
our contest is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> replyes Sect. 19. Pag. 183.</p>
            <p>To the latter exception, which pretends to find only Hypocrites, and not true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
staged in both passages, we likewise answer, that it glosseth no whit better,
than the former, if not much worse, considering that the persons presented in the
said passages, are described by such characters, and signall excellencies which the
Scriptures are wont to appropriate unto Saints, and true Believers, and that when
they intend to shew them iu the best and greatest of their glory: what we say herein,
will (I suppose) be made above all gainesaying, by instancing particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> That this is most remote from truth, and that there is not here
any one discriminating Character of true Believers, so farre are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
from setting them out in any signall eminency, will appeare from
these ensuing considerations.</p>
            <p>1. There is no mention of Faith or Believing either in expresse termes, or
in termes of an equivalent significancy in either of the places mentioned.
Therefore true Believers are not the persons intended to be described in these
places. Did the Holy Ghost intend to describe <hi>Believers,</hi> it is very strange that
he should not call them so, nor make mention of any one of those principles in
them, from whence, and whereby they are such. Wherefore I say,</p>
            <p>2. There is not any thing ascribed here to the persons spoken
of, which belongs peculiarly to true Believers, as such, or that constitutes
them to be such, and which yet are things plainely and positively asserted and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59070:239"/>
described in innumerable other places of Scripture: that the Persons described
are, <hi>called according to the purpose of God, quickened, borne againe or regenerated,
Justifyed, united to Christ, Sanctifyed by the Spirit, adopted, made sonnes of God,</hi>
and the like, which are the usuall expressions of Believers pointing out their
discriminating forme as such, is not in the least intimated in the Text, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
or any concernement of it. That they are <hi>elected</hi> of God, <hi>Redeemed</hi> of
Christ, <hi>Sanctifyed</hi> by the Spirit, that they are made <hi>Holy,</hi> is not at all affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>3.
The persons intended are <hi>v.</hi> 8. ch. 6. compared to the <hi>ground upon
which the raine falls, aud beareth thornes and briers.</hi> True Believers whilst they
are so, are not such as do bring forth nothing but <hi>thornes and briers;</hi>
Faith it selfe being an <hi>Herbe meet for him by whom they are dressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Things that accompany Salvation,</hi> are <hi>better things,</hi> than any in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
mentioned were to be found. This the Apostle asserts <hi>v. 9. we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation.</hi> Now neither of
these, either better things, or things that accompany Salvation were upon them
whose Apostacy the Apostle supposeth. The exceptive particle at the ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
with the <hi>Apologeticall</hi> designe of the whole verse, ascribes such things
to the Saints, to whom the Apostle speakes, as they were not partakers of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom he had immediately before discoursed. The Faith of Gods Elect,
whereby we are Justifyed, is doubtlesse of the <hi>things that accompany Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5.
The persons intended by the Apostle, were such, as <hi>had need to be
taught againe the first principles of the Oracles of God, Chap. 5. v.</hi> 12. that were
<hi>unskillfull in a word of Righteousnesse v.</hi> 15. that had not their <hi>sences exercised to
discerne good and evill v.</hi> 14. and are plainely distinguished from them, to
whom the Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> doth properly belong Chap. 6. 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. True Believers are opposed in the Discourse of the Apostle (Chap. 6.)
unto these persons lying under a possibility of Apostacy, so farre as they are
cast under it, by the conditionall Discourse of it, upon sundry accounts.</p>
            <p>As</p>
            <p>1. Of their <hi>workes and labour of Love shew'd to the name of God v.</hi> 10: of
their preservation, from the <hi>Righteousnes or Faithfulnes of God</hi> in his Promises,
<hi>v. 11. Of the mutability of the counsels of God,</hi> and his Oath for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, <hi>v 13, 17, 18. Of their sure and steedfast anchor of hope, v.</hi> 19. &amp;c.
Upon all which Considerations it is abundantly evident, that they are not
Believers, the Children of God, Justifyed, Sanctifyed, Adopted Saints of whom
the Apostle treates in the passages insisted on.</p>
            <p>Sect.<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> 28. M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> urges sundry reasons to prove that they are not <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi>
or outside professors only, but true Believers that are described. If by
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>outside Professors</hi> he intends those who are grossely so,
pretending to be what they are not, and what they know themselves
not to be, we contend not about it: if by those expressions he
compriseth also those whom we <hi>characterized</hi> in the entrance of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
who unto their profession of the Faith, have also added those guifts
and endowments, with the like, which we mentioned, notwithstanding all
their Advancement in light, conviction, joy, usefulnesse, conversation, do
yet come short of union with Christ, I shall joyne issue with him, in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of his reasons offered to be pregnant of proofe for the confirmation
of his Assertion. He tells you, Sect. 28. Pag. 288.</p>
            <p>1. There is no Clause, Phrase, or Word in either of the places, any waies cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristicall
or Descriptive of Hypocrisy, or Hypocrites, there are none of those co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59070:240"/>
to be seen, which are wont to be used in drawing or limning the Portraitures,
or shapes of those Beasts, as distinguished from creatures of a better kind. All the
lineaments of the Persons presented in these tables, before the mention of their fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, become the best and fairest faces of the Saints, (as hath been proved)
and are not to be found in any other. Yea, the greatest and most intelligent Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
under heaven, hath no reason but to desire part and fellowship with the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
here described, in all those characters and properties which are attributed
unto them before their falling away, or sinning wilfully.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The designe of the Apostle is not to discover, or give any chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> to manifest them to be such, but to declare the <hi>excellencies</hi>
that are, or may be found in them, from the enjoyment of all which they
may decline, and sinne against the mercy and grace of them, to the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their condemnation: Neither had any lines used to particularise those
beasts in their shape, wherein they differ from Believers, been at all usefull to
the Apostles purpose: his ayme being only to draw those wherein they are
like them, and conformeable to them. Neither</p>
            <p>2. Is it questioned whether these things here mentioned, may be found
in true Believers, and become them very well, rendering <hi>their faces beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
but whether there be not something else, then what is here mentioned,
that should give them being, as such, and life, without which these things are
little better than painting. Nor</p>
            <p>3. Is it at all to the purpose, <hi>that Believers may desire a participation in
these characters</hi> with the persons described, but whether they who have no
other characters or markes upon them of true Believers, then what are here
mentioned, must necessarily be so accounted, or will of God be so accepted.
Many a Believer may desire the guifts of those Hypocrites, who have not
one dramme of the <hi>Grace,</hi> wherewith he is quickned. So that this first reason as
pregnant as it seemes of proofe, is only indeed swelled &amp; puffed up, with wind
&amp; vanity. He adds</p>
            <p>2. True Believers, are in estate of honour, and are Lifted up on high towards
the Heavens, in which respect they have from whence to fall. But Hypocrites are
as neere Hell already as lightly they can be, till they be actually fallen into it. From
whence then are they capable of fallings? men of estates may faile and breake, but
beggers are in no such danger. If Hypocrites fall away, it must be from their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,
but this is rather a rising than a fall. A Begger cannot be said to breake but
only when he gets an estate. When he doth this, the begger is broke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> All that here is added, arises meerely from the ambiguity of the
word <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> the persons that fall, are on all hands supposed to have, and
enjoy all, that is made mention of in the Texts insisted on, so that they have
so much to fall from, as that thereupon Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinkes them true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
They have all the heighths to tumble from, which we before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
and very many others, that it is no easie taske to declare. They fall
from the excellencies they have, and not the Hypocrisy, with which they are
vitiated. From the profession of the Faith, with honesty of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> not from the want of Roote, or being built on the Rocke, so that
this pretended pregnant reason, is as <hi>barren</hi> as the former, to the production
of the assertion layd down to be proved by it. He adds</p>
            <p>3. It is no punishment at all to Hypocrites to be under no possibility of being
renewed againe by repentance. Nay in case they should fall away, it would be a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and blessing unto them, to be under an impossibility of being renewed againe. For
if this were their case it would be impossible for them to be ever Hypocrites again,
and (doubtlesse) it is no great judgment upon any man to be uncapable of such a
preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:59070:240"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Whether it be no punishment for them who have been in so
good a way, a way of such tendency unto Salvation, and such usefullnesse to
the Gospell, as these persons are supposed to be in; not to be renewed againe
to that state and condition, but to be shut up, unrecoverably under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of darkenesse, and uubeliefe, unto eternall wrath, when before they were
in a faire way for life and Salvation, others will judge beside Mr <hi>Goodwin.</hi>
Neither is there an affirmation of their falling away from their Hypocrisy, and
being renewed againe thereunto, in any thing we assert in the exposition of
this place, but their falling away from guifts and common Graces, with the
impossibility of what kind soever it be, of being renewed to an enjoyment of
them any more. His fourth and last attempt follows.</p>
            <p>4. (And lastly) it stands off, forty foot at least, from all probability, that the
Apostle writing only unto those, whom he judged true and sound Believers (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from severall places in the Epistle, as cap. 3. 14. 6. 9. &amp;c.) should in the
most serious, emphaticall and weighty passages hereof, admonish them of such evills
or dangers, which only concerned other men, and whereunto themselves were not
at all obnoxious, yea and whereunto if they had been obnoxious, all the cautions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
warnings, threatnings in the world would not according to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
with whom we have now to do) have relieved or delivered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To say that such
admonitions, are a meanes to preserve those from Apostacy, who are by other
meanes (as suppose the absolute decree of God, or the interposall of his irresistible
power, for their Perseverance, or the like) in no possibility of Apostatizing,
as to say that washing is a meanes to make snow white, or the rearing up of a pillar
in the aire a meanes to keep the Heavens from falling. But more of this in the
chapter following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What exact measure soever Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> seemeth to have taken of
the distance of our assertion from all probability (which he hath accurately
performed, if we may take his word) yet upon due consideration it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeares, that he is not able to disprove it, from coming close up to the
absolute truth, of the meaning and scope of the Holy Ghost in the places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consideration. For besides what hath been already argued, and proved,
it is evident.</p>
            <p>1. That the Apostle wrote promiscuosly to all that professe the name
of Christ, &amp; his Gospell, of whom he tells you Cap. 3. 14. (one of the places we
are directed to by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>) that those only are made <hi>partakers of Christ,
who hold the beginning of their confidence to the end;</hi> For the rest notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all their glorious profession, guifts &amp; attainments, yet they are not truly
made partakers of Christ, (whereby he cuts the throat of Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> whole
cause) and cap. 6. 9. that there were amongst them, who had attained <hi>things
accompanying Salvation,</hi> and <hi>better things</hi> than any of those had done, who
notwithstanding their profession, yet held it not <hi>fast without wavering,</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
day fell away; so that though he judged no particulars before their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
yet he partly intimates, that all Professors were not true Believers, and
therefore does teach them all to make sure worke in closing with Christ,
least they turne Apostates and perish in so doing.</p>
            <p>2. That conditionall comminations and threatnings, discovering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
that is between the antecedent and consequent, that is in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of them, are and may be of use to the Saints of God, preserved from
the end threatned and the cause deserving it, upon the accounts, Reasons
and Causes, that have been plentifully insisted on, hath more than
once been declared; and the objections to the contrary the same
with those here insisted on, answered and removed. This being all
that Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to offer, by the way of reason, to exclude the persons
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59070:241"/>
formerly described, to be the only concernement of the place of Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, there remaines nothing but only the consideration of the severalls
of the passages, debated, wherein by the light that hath already broken forth,
from the Circumstances, aymes, ends and connexion of the places, we may so
far receive direction, as not to be at all stumbled in our progresse.</p>
            <p>With the consideration of the severall expressions in the passages under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> proceedeth Sect. 19: and first infisteth on that of Cap. 6.
where it is said that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> once enlightned; whence he
thus argues.</p>
            <p>Believers are said to be enlightned, and to be children of light in the Lord 2 Cor.
4. 6. Heb. 10. 32. Luke 16. 8. Eph. 5. 8. therefore they who here are said to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
were true Believerss</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I shall not insist upon the various interpretations of this place, and
reading of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, very many, and that not improbably affirming
that their participation of the ordinance of Baptisme is here only intended
by it, for which exposition much might be offered, were it needfull, or much
conducing to our businesse in hand. Nor</p>
            <p>2. Shall I labour to manifest that persons may be enlightned, and yet never
come to Christ savingly by faith, to attain union with him &amp; justificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by him:
a thing M.G. will not deny himselfe, or if he should, it were a very facile thing
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vince him of his mistake, by a sole intreaty (if he would be pleased to give
an account of his faith in this businesse at our intreaty) of him to declare, what
he intends by <hi>illumination,</hi> whence it would quickely appeare, how unsuitable
it is to his own principles to deny, that it may be in them, who yet never come
to be, or at least by vertue thereof may not be said to be true Believers: but
this only I shall adde,</p>
            <p>3. That M.G. <hi>doubtles</hi> knowing that this Argument (which withall the Texts
of Scripture, whereby he illustrates it he borrows of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>) hath
been againe and againe excepted against, as <hi>illogicall</hi> and <hi>unconcluding,</hi> and
inconsistent with the principles of them that use it, ought not <hi>crudely</hi> againe
have imposed it upon his Reader without some attempt at least, to free it
from the charge of impertinency, weaknesse and folly, wherewith it is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened.
<hi>Illumination</hi> is ascribed to Believers, <hi>illumination</hi> is ascribed to these
men, therefore these persons are Believers: a little confideration will recover
to Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> minde the force of this Argument, so farre as that he will
scarce use it any more.</p>
            <p>Sect. 20.<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> he takes up another expression from Chap. 10. <hi>v.</hi> 12. That they
are said to receiue <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the acknowledgement of the Truth,</hi> whence
he argues in the same manner and forme, as he had newly done from the
terme of Illumination: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>is ascribed to Believers,</hi> therefore they
are all so, to whom it is ascribed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he tells you in particular that (Sect. 20.)</hi> In the latter of the said passages
the persons spoken of, are said to have received <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (i.e.) the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the truth; which expression, doth not signify the bare notion of what
the Gospell teacheth, of which they are capable, who are the most professed enemies
thereof, but such a consenting and subjection thereunto, which worketh effectually
in men to a separating of themselves from sinne and sinners. This is the constant
import of the phrase in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> All this may be granted, yet nothing hence concluded, to evince
the persons to whom it is ascribed to be true Believers; men may be so
wrought upon, and convinced by the Word and Spirit, <hi>sent forth to convince
the world of sin, Righteousnesse and Judgment,</hi> as to acknowledge the truth of the
Gospell, to <hi>professe</hi> subjection to the Gospell, &amp; to <hi>yeild</hi> to it so farre as to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:59070:241"/>
themselves from sinne and sinners, in such a manner and to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
(not disembling but answering their convictions) as to blesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
oftentimes in their own condition, and to obtaine an esteem with the
people of God to be such indeed, as they professe themselves to be, and yet
come short of that <hi>union</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with the Lord Christ, which all true
Believers are made partakers of. It is not of any use or importance to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the particular places mentioned by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> wherein as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the expression of the <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of the truth denotes
that which is saving, and comprehendeth true Faith, unlesse be attempted to
prove from them, that the word could signify nothing else, or that a man
might not be brought to an <hi>acknowledgment of the truth,</hi> but that he must of
necessity be a true Believer: neither of which he doth, or if he did, could he
possibly give any seeming probability to. There may be a knowing of
the things of the Gospell in men, &amp; yet they may come short of the happinesse
of them that <hi>doc</hi> them; there is a knowledge of Christ, that yet is barren as to
the fruite of holinesse.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In the next place the persons queried about,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 32.</note> 
               <hi>are said to be sanctifyed
by the bloud of the Covenant; of this Mr</hi> Goodwin <hi>sayes (Sect. 21.) i.e.</hi> By their
sprinkling herewith, to be sprinkled from such, who refuse this sprinkling: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from the pollutions and defilements of the world, to be Sanctifyed when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
unto persons, is not sound in any other sence throughout the new Testament,
unlesse it be where Persons beare the consideration of things. 1 Cor. 7. 14.
But of this signification of the word which we claime in this place, instances are so
frequent and obvious, that we shall not need to mention any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If no more be intended in this expression, but what Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> gives
us, in the exposition of it <hi>viz.</hi> that they are so sprinkled with it, as to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from them that refuse this sprinkling (that is openly) as likewise from
the pollution and defilements of the world, we shall not need to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it: for men may be so sprinkled, and have such an efficacy of conviction
come upon them by the preaching of the Crosse, &amp; bloud shedding of Christ,
as to be separated from those who professedly despise it, and the open pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the Word, and yet be farre from having <hi>consciences purged from dead
workes to serve the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And secondly that the terme of <hi>sanctifying</hi> when applyed to persons, is not
used in any other sence, than what is by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> here expressed, is an
Assertion that will be rendered uselesse untill Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> be pleased to give
it an edge by explayning in what sence he here intends to apply it. Of the
terme <hi>Sanctifying</hi> there are, as hath been declared, two more eminent and
known significations. First, to <hi>separate</hi> from common use, state or condition,
to dedicate, consecrate and set apart to God by profession of his will, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
manner is frequently so expressed. Secondly realy to purify, clense
with Spirituall purity, opposed to the defilement of sinne is denoted thereby;
In the exposition given of the place here used by Mr <hi>G.</hi> He mentions both:
<hi>Separation,</hi> and that chiefely, as the nature of the Sanctification whereof
he speakes, as also some kind of Spirituall clensing from sinne: but in
what sence precisely he would have us to understand him he doth not tell
us.</p>
            <p>I somewhat question, whether it be used in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> in
any other sence than the former, which was the <hi>Temple</hi> sence the of word;
the Apostle using many termes of the old worship in their first <hi>signification.</hi>
however that it is used in that sence, in the new Testament appropriated to
persons, without any such respect as that mentioned by M.G. is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced by that of our Saviour <hi>John.</hi> 17. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59070:242"/>
expressing his <hi>dedicating</hi> and separating himselfe to his objection; and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
may be had, if we stood in any need of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly that many are said to be sanctifyed and holy in the latter sence, as
it signifyeth spirituall purity, in respect of their profession of themselves so to
be, and some mens esteem of them, who yet were never wholly, and truly
purged from their sinne, nor ever had received the holy <hi>Spirit of Promise,</hi> who
alone is able to purge their hearts, doth not now want its demonstration,
that work hath been some whiles since performed. So that Mr <hi>G.</hi> makes not
any progresse at all, in the proofe of what he has undertaken <hi>viz.</hi> that they
are true Believers in the sence of that denomination which we assert, who in
these places are described. For a close, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is far more properly referred
to Christ, than to the persons spoken of, and that sence the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do not oppose.</p>
            <p>That they are said (Cap. 6. 4.)<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> 
               <hi>to have tasted the heavenly guift</hi> is urged
in the next place (Sect. 22.) to prove them true Believers; both the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
and the <hi>act</hi> are here in question, what is meant by the <hi>Heavenly guift,</hi> and
what by tasting of it. I shall not looke into the Text beyond the peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement
of the cause in hand: somewhat might be offered for the farther
clearing of the one and other. At present it sufficeth that be the <hi>Heavenly guift</hi>
what it will, the persons of our contest, are said only to tast of it: which
though absolutely, and in it selfe, it is not an extenuating expression, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
a matter of high aggravation of the sinne of <hi>Apostacy,</hi> in that they were
admitted to some <hi>tast</hi> and <hi>relish</hi> of the excellency and sweetnesse of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
guift;</hi> yet comparatively to their feeding on it, digesting it, growing
thereby, it clearely denotes their coming short of such a participation of it,
who do but tast of it. That to <hi>tast,</hi> doth not in the first <hi>genuine</hi> signification in
things naturall, signify to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>digest</hi> meat, so as to grow by it, I suppose
needes no proof; that in that sence it is used in the Scriptures <hi>Ioh. 2. 9 Mat.</hi>
27. 34. is by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> confessed. This he tells you is only, when the <hi>tast</hi>
or <hi>relish of things is desired to be known:</hi> but that our Saviour tasted of the <hi>gall</hi>
and <hi>vineger</hi> out of a desire to know the relish of it, he will hardly perswade
those who are accustomed to give never so easie a beliefe to his assertions. By
the <hi>Heavenly guift</hi> M. <hi>G.</hi> in the first place intends <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> now if by tasting,
eating and drinking of Christ be intended as is here pleaded, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
will determine this strife, telling us that whosoever eateth his flesh shall
be saved <hi>John</hi> 6. 35, 49, 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57. So that either to tast, is not to
eate, or they that tast cannot perish.</p>
            <p>Three things are urged by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> to give proofe of his interpretation
of these words of the Holy Ghost: saith he,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1.</hi> Whatsoever is meant by this Heavenly guift, certain is it that by tasting, is
not meant any light or superficiall impression made upon the hearts or soules of
men, through the sence or apprehension of it, but an emphaticall, inward
and effectuous relish and sence of the excellent and Heavenly sweetnesse and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse
of it, opposed to a bare speculation or naked apprehension thereof. The
reason hereof, is because the tasting of this Heavenly guift here spoken of, is not
mentioned by the Apostle in a way of easing or extenuating the sinne of those that
should fall away from Christ, but by way of aggravation and exaggeration of the
beinousnesse and unreasonablenesse thereof, and withall more fully to declare and
assert the equitablenesse of that severity in God, which is here denounced against
those, that shall sinne the great sinne of Apostacy here spoken of. It must needs be
much more unworthy and provoking in the sight of God, for a man to turne his backe
upon and renounce those wayes, that profession, wherein God hath come home
to him, and answered the joy of his heart abundently, then it would be in case he
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:59070:242"/>
had only heard of great matters, and had his head filled, but had really found and
felt nothing with his heart and soule truly excellent and Glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2.</hi> And bestdes the very word it selfe, to tast ordinarily in Scripture, importes
a reall communion with or participation and enjoyment (if the thing be good) of
that which was said to be tasted. Oh tast &amp; see (saith David) that the Lord is good
<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 34. 8.</note> His intent doubtlesse was not to invite men to a slight or superficiall tast of the
goodnesse of God, but to a reall cordiall and thorough experiment and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
enjoyment of it. So when he that made the great invitation in the parable,
expressed himselfe thus to his servants; For I say unto you, that none of those who
were bidden shall tast of my Supper<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 14. 24.</note> His meaning clearely was that they should not
partake of the Sweetnesse, and benefit thereof with those who should accept of his
invitation, and come unto it. In like manner when <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh thus to his
Christian Jewes, If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracius,<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 3.</note> his meaning
(questionlesse) is not to presse his exhortation directed unto them in the former verse
upon a consideration of any light or vanishing tast, such as hypocrites &amp; false-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Christians may have, of the graciousnesse of the Lord, but of such a tast, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they had had a reall, inward, and sensible experiment thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3.</hi> And besides according to the sence of our adversaries in the present debate,
if the tast of the heavenly gift we speake of should imply no more, but only a faint
or weake perception of the sweetnesse and glorious excellency of it, yet even this
may be sufficient to evince truth of grace and Faith in men. For their opinion is,
that a man may be a true Believer with a graine of Mustard-seed only, <hi>i.e.</hi> with a
very slender rellish and tast of spirituall things; yea their sence is, that in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of desertion, and under the guilt of some enormous courses, they may have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no tast of them at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. To the first discourse considering what hath been already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
I shall only adde, that although it be no aggravation of the sinne
of Apostacy, that they who fall into it, have but <hi>tasted of the Heavenly guift,</hi>
yet it is that they have <hi>tasted of it:</hi> that tast of its relish, preciousnes, &amp; sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which they haue obtained, whereby they are distinguished from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose
blindnes &amp; hardnes keeps them up to a totall disrelish and contempt of it, is
abundantly enough to render their sinne heinous and abominable. When
men by the preaching of the Word, shall be startled in their sinnes, troubled
in their consciences, forced to seeke out for a remedy, and shall come so farre
as to have some (though but a light) tast of the excellency of the Gospell, and
the remedy provided for sinners in Jesus Christ, and then through the strength
of their lusts and corruptions, shall cast it off, reject it, and spit out of their
mouth as it were, all that of it, whereby they found the least savour in it, no
creature under Heaven, can be guilty of more abominable undervaluing of
the Lord Christ, and the Love of God in him, than such persons. What degree
of <hi>Love, Joy, Repentance, Peace, Faith,</hi> persons many times arrive unto, when
with <hi>Herod</hi> they have heard the <hi>Word gladly,</hi> and done many things <hi>willingly
&amp;c.</hi> hath been by others abundantly demonstrated. This sufficeth our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose, that they do make such a progresse in the wayes of God, and
finde so much excellency in the treasure of Grace and mercy, which he
hath provided in Jesus Christ, and tenders in the Gospell, that he cannot but
look upon their Apostacy &amp; renunciation of him, (whereby they proclaime to
all the world as much as in them lyes, that there is not that reall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
worth, and excellency to be found in him, as some pretend) as the
highest scorne and contempt of him, and his Love in Christ, and revenges it
accordingly.</p>
            <p>2. To the second, which consists of instances collected by the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
to manifest the use of the word <hi>tasting</hi> to be other than what we here
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59070:243"/>
confine it to. I say 1. That the word as it is applyed to <hi>Spiritualls,</hi> being
borrowed and <hi>metaphoricall,</hi> not in its <hi>Analogie</hi> to be extended beyond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>triall,</hi> for our coming to some knowledge of a thing in its nature, the use
of it in one place, cannot prescribe to the sence of it in another, no more than
any other <hi>metaphoricall</hi> expression whatever; but it must in the severall
places of its residence, be interpreted according to the most peculiar restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the matter treated of doth require. If then M <hi>G.</hi> can prove that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in this place under consideration enforces such a sence, all his other
instances are needlesse: if he cannot, they are uselesse.</p>
            <p>It might easily be manifested, and hath been done by others already, that
in all the places mentioned by Mr <hi>Goodwin,</hi> the word is not expressly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
of any thorough, solid <hi>eating</hi> &amp; <hi>participation</hi> of that which is said to be
tasted, as is pretended. But to manifest this, is not our concernment; there
being no reason in the world to enforce any such sence as is contended for in
the place under present consideration.</p>
            <p>2. To the third wherein he argues with his <hi>predecessors</hi> from our opinion
concerning Faith, a briefe reply will suffice: That a <hi>faint, weake perception
and relish of heavenly things,</hi> is sufficient to make a man a Believer, is so farre
from being our opinion, that we utterly disclaime them from being Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to whom this is ascribed, if nothing else be added in their description,
from whence they may be so esteemed. It is true, Faith is sometimes <hi>little,</hi> and
weake in the exercise of it, yea a man may be so overtaken with Temptations,
or so clouded under desertions, as that it may not deport it selfe with any
such considerable vigour, as to be <hi>consolatory</hi> to him in whom it is, or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
of him unto others to be what he is: but we say that the weakest,
lowest, meanest measure and degree of this Faith, is yet grounded and fixed
in the heart, where though it be not allwayes alike lively, and active, yet it is
allwayes <hi>alive,</hi> and gives <hi>life.</hi> How farre Believers may fall into the guilt of
enormous courses, has been already manifested. The intendment of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
is to disadvantage the perswasion he opposeth. We do not grant that
believers may fall into any <hi>enormityes,</hi> but only what God himselfe affirmes
they may, &amp; yet not utterly be cast out of his Love &amp; favour in Jesus Christ.
Farther the weakest Faith, of which we affirme that it may be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>saving,</hi>
though it may have no great perception nor deepe tast of Heavenly things for
the present, yet hath it allwayes that, of adherence to God in Christ, which is
exceedingly exalted above any such preception of Heavenly things whatever,
that may be had or obtained without it: so that from the consideration of
what hath been spoken, we may safely conclude, that M.G. hath not been
able to advance on steppe in his intendment, to prove, that the persons here
described are true Believers.</p>
            <p>I know no sufficient ground or reason to induce me to any large considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the other two or three expressions that remaine,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> &amp; that are insisted on
by M.G. seeing it is evident from their associats, which have been already exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
that there is none of them can speak one word to the businesse in hand:
I shall therefore discharge them from any farther attendance, in the service
they have been forced unto.</p>
            <p>The next priviledge insisted on which to these persons is ascribed, is, <hi>that
they are made partakers of the Holy Ghost.</hi> In mens <hi>participation of the Holy
Ghost,</hi> either the <hi>guifts</hi> or <hi>Graces</hi> of the Holy Ghost are intended. The <hi>Graces</hi>
of the Holy Ghost, are either more <hi>common</hi> and <hi>inchoative,</hi> or <hi>speciall</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating</hi>
of the worke of conversion: that it is the peculiar <hi>regenerating Grace</hi> of
God, that is intended in this expression, of being made partakers of the Holy
Ghost, and not the guifts of the Spirit, or those common graces of <hi>illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:59070:243"/>
unto which persons not truly converted, but only wrought upon
by an effectuall conviction in the preaching of the word, may attaine, M: G:
is no way able to prove: And there is also this consideration rising up with
strength and power, against that interpretation; <hi>viz.</hi> that those that are so
made partakers of the Spirit as to be regenerated, quickned, sealed, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereby, which are some of the peculiar acts of his Grace, in and towards
the soules of those that Believe, can never loose him, nor be deprived of
him, as was manifested before at large, being sealed and confirmed, not only in
the present enjoyment of the Love and favour of God, but also unto the full
fruition of the Glory, which is provided for them, and therefore cannot fall
away, as these are supposed to do. What there is in Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> Discourse,
on this passage Sect. 23, 24. to weaken in the least what is usually answered, or
farther to enforce his exposition of the place; I am not able to apprehend, and
shall therefore proceed with what remaineth.</p>
            <p>All that followes in the place of the Apostle under contest,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> is regulated by
the word, <hi>Tast: they have tasted of the good word of God, and the powers of the
World to come:</hi> what the sence and importance of that word is, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
declared: neither can it be proved, that the persons here described, doe
so <hi>tast</hi> of the <hi>good word of God,</hi> as to mix the promises of it with Faith, or of the
powers of the world to come, as to receive them in <hi>power</hi> in their hearts by
believing so that farther contest about these words seemes to be altogether
needlesse.</p>
            <p>How farre men may proceed in the wayes of God,<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> what progresse they
may make in amendment of life, what gifts and common graces they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
what light and knowledge they may be indued withall, what kind of
Faith, Joy, Repentance, Sorrow, Delight, Love, they may have, in and about
spirituall things; what desire of mercy and heaven, what usefull gifts for the
Churches <hi>edification</hi> they may receive, how farre they may perswade their
own soules, and upon what grounds, that their condition <hi>Godward</hi> is good,
and saving, and beget an opinion in others that they are true Believers, and
yet come short of union with Christ, building their houses on the sand &amp;c. is
the daily taske of the Preachers of the Gospell to manisest, in their pressing
that exhortation of the Apostle unto their hearers, to examine and try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the middest of their profession, whether Christ be in them of a truth
or no. I shall not now enter upon that labour; the Reader knowes where to
find enough in the writings of holy and learned men of this Nation to evince,
that men may arrive at the utmost height of what is in this place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
by the Holy Ghost ascribed to the persons of whom he speakes, and yet
come short of the state of true Believers. M.G. indeed tells us <hi>Sect.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>The Premises relating to the two passages yet under debate, considered,<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> I am so
farre from questioning whether the Apostle speakes of true and sound Believers in
them, that I verily judge, that he purposely sought out severall of the most empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
and signall characters of Believers, yea such which are hardly or rather not
at all, to be found in the ordinary sort of true Believers, but only in those that are
most eminent amongst them, that so he and such, who though sound, yet were weake
in the Faith, might fall away and perish, but that even such also, who were lifted
up nearer unto Heaven than their fellowes, might through carelesnesse and carnall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>security,
dash themselves in pieces against the same stone, &amp; make shipwracke of
their soules, as well as they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The House built on the sand, may oftentimes be built higher, have
more faire perapets and battlements, windowes and ornaments than that
which is built upon the Rock: yet all guifts and priviledges, equall not one
Grace in respect of light, knowledge, guifts, and many manifestations of the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:59070:244"/>
Spirit, such who never come up to that Faith which gives reall union and
communion with Jesus Christ, may farre outgoe those that do.</p>
            <p>2. That there is any thing mentioned, or any characters given of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
much lesse such as are singular and not common to all: M.G hath not
in any measure been able to evince: There is not the meanest Believer in the
world but he is a <hi>Child of God,</hi> &amp; <hi>heir of the Promises,</hi> &amp; <hi>brother of the LordChrist;</hi>
hath <hi>union</hi> with him, hath his living in him, is <hi>Quickned, Justifyed, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,</hi>
hath Christ made to him <hi>Wisedome &amp;c.</hi> hath his <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> in God,
and his <hi>Life hid in him in Christ,</hi> is <hi>passed from death to Life, brings forth fruit,</hi>
and is deare to God as the <hi>apple of his eye, accepted</hi> with him, <hi>approved</hi> of him,
as his <hi>temple</hi> wherein he delighteth to dwell. That any thing in this place
mentioned and insisted on, any characters we have given of the persons, whom
we have considered, doe excell, or equall, or denote any thing in the same
kind, with these and the like excellencyes of the meanest Believers, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be proved, if we may judge of future successes, from the issue of all former
attempts for that end and purpose.</p>
            <p>And this is the issue of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s third <hi>Testimony</hi> produced to confirme
the Doctrine of the Saints Apostacy but hypothetically, and under such a
forme of expression as may not be argued from, nor of Saints and true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
at all: His 4. followeth.</p>
            <p>His fourth Testimony he produceth,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> and indeavours to mannage for the
Advantage of his cause, Sect. 31. in these words.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture Testimony we shall produce &amp; briefely urge in the cause now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
maintainance, is in the same Epistle with the former and speaketh these words.
Now the Just shall live by Faith, But if any man draw back, my soule shall have
no pleasure in him. Our English translators, out of good will (doubtlesse) to a bad
cause, have almost defaced this Testimony, by substituting any man for the just
man, for whereas they translate, but if any man draw back, the Originall readeth,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> &amp; if [or but if] he [i.e. the just man who should live by his
Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> if he continues in it] shall draw back. Beza himselfe likewise before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
had stayned the honour of his faithfulnesse, with the same blot in his Translation.
But the mind of the Holy Ghost in the words is plaine, and without Parable; <hi>viz.</hi>
that if the just man who lives [<hi>i. e.</hi> who at present enjoyes the favour of God,
and thereby is supported in all his tryalls] and should live allwayes by his
Faith [if he continues in it, as Pareus well glosseth] shall draw back, or shall be
withdrawn [<hi>viz.</hi> through feare, or sloth, as the word properly signifyeth: See
Acts 20. 27.] from his believing, my soule shall have no pleasure in him <hi>i.e.</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the import of the Hebraisme) my soule shall hate, or abhorre him to death;
as it is also expounded in the words immediately following: But we are not of those
who draw back to perdition, but, &amp;c. From hence then evident it is, that such a
man who is a just, or Righteous man, and under promise of living for ever by his
Faith (and therefore also, a true and sound Believer) may draw back, or be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne,
to the contracting of the hatred of God, and to destruction in the end.
The forlornehope of evading, because the sentence is Hypotheticall, or conditionall
not positive, hath been routed over and over, yea and is abandoned by some of the
great Masters themselves of that cause, unto the defence whereof it pretendeth.
And however, in this place, it would be most preposterous. For if it should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that the just man, who is in a way &amp; under a Promise of living by his Faith,
were in no danger or possibility of drawing backe, and that to the losse of the favour
of God, and ruine of his soule, God must be conceived to speake here at no better
rate of wisdome or understanding, than thus; The Just shall live by his Faith: but if
he shall do that, which is simply and utterly impossible for him to do, my soule shall
have no pleasure in him. What savour of wisdome, yea or of commonsence, is there
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:59070:244"/>
in admonishing, or cautioning men against such evills, which there is no possibility
for them to fall into, yea and this known unto themselves? Therefore this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for confirmation of the Doctrine we maintaine, is like a King upon his Throne,
against whom there is no rising up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What small cause Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath to quarrell with <hi>Beza,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> or other
Translatours, and with how little advantage to his cause this <hi>Text</hi> is produced
shall out of hand be made appeare.</p>
            <p>1. The words as they cry are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
In the foregoing part of the chapter, the Apostle had treated of two
sorts of persons. 1. Such as so forsake the <hi>Assemblies of the Saints,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the Church, and Ordinances of Christ; and so by degrees fell off
with a totall and everlasting backsliding: of these the Apostle speakes, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
their wayes and end, from v. 25. unto v. 32. thence forward. 2. He speaks
to them and of them, who abode in their persecutions, and under all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
to hold fast their confidence; which he also farther exhorts them to,
that by <hi>patient abiding in well doing, they might receive the reward;</hi> concerning
these both, having told them of the <hi>unshaken Kingdome</hi> of Christ, that should
be brought in, notwithstanding the Apostasy of many, of whose iniquity God
would take vengeance on; he laies downe that eminent promise of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
<hi>the just by Faith shall live,</hi> wordes often used, to expresse the state &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Believers, of those who are truly and unfainedly so; the Lord being
faithfull in his promise, <hi>the justified person shall live,</hi> or obtaine life everlasting.
It is the promise of eternall life, that is here given them, as that which they
had not as yet received, but in patience they were to waite to receive, after
they had done the whole will of God: that any of these should so draw back,
as that the Lords soule should have no pleasure in them, is directly contrary to
the promise here made of their <hi>living.</hi> The particle (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in the next words,
is plainly <hi>adversative,</hi> and <hi>exceptive,</hi> as it is very many times in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;
and that as to the Persons of whom he is speaking: at <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
<hi>period</hi> is full, the description of the state of the just by Faith is compleated,
and in the next words, the state of backsliders is entred upon: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
referring to them, whom by their Apostasy, and subduction of themselves
from Christian assemblies he had before described: there is an <hi>elleipsis</hi> in the
words to be supplied, but some indefinite terme, to give them the sence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
this <hi>Beza</hi> and our translators have done by that excepted against
causelessely by M.G. for if a Translator may make the Text speake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
in the language whereunto he translates it, the introduction of such
supplements is allowed him.</p>
            <p>2. The following expression puts it out of all question, that this was the
intendment of the Apostle; for he expressely makes mention, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to what was spoken before, of two sorts of people, to whom his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
expressions are respectively to be accommodated, the words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as above. M. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to make us believe, that he took notice of these words,
hath this passage of them, (<hi>as it is also expounded, in the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,</hi>
but we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but &amp;c.) but
what I pray is expounded in these words; <hi>that drawers back shall be destroyed?</hi>
this is all he takes notice of in them; Evidently the words are an application
of the former assertions unto severall persons: there are saies he some who
are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and some that are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: those saith he who are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they
shall be destroyed, those who are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they shall live; Evidently and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all contradiction, assigning his former assertions of, <hi>the just shall live by
Faith,</hi> and, <hi>if any man shall draw back,</hi> to severall persons, by a distribution
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59070:245"/>
of their lot and portions to them: in v. 28. he layes downe in <hi>These</hi> the state
and condition of believers and backsliders: in v:29. he makes application of
the position he laid downe to himselfe and them, 1. <hi>negatively</hi> that they were
not of the former sort of them that draw back, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Positively,</hi> that they
were of the rest of them that <hi>believed,</hi> and those expressions <hi>v.</hi> 29. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
doe undeniably affirme two sorts of persons in both places to
be spoken of &amp; that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> can by no meanes be referred to our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which would entermixe them, whom the Apostle as to their present state and
future condition, held out in a contradistinction one to the other, unto the
end: All that ensues in M. <hi>Goodwins</hi> discourse, being built upon this sandy
foundation, that it is the Believer, of whom God affirmes that he shall live by
Faith, who is supposed to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, contrary to the expresse assertion of
the Apostle, it needs no farther consideration, although he is not able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
any strength in conclusion drawn from suppositions, of events, which
may be possible in one sence, and in another impossible.</p>
            <p>But before we passe further,<note place="margin">§. 40.</note> may not this witnesse which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath
attempted in vaine to suborne to appeare, and speake in his cause, be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what he can speake, or what he knowes of the truth, of that which he is
produced to oppose. This then it confesseth and denyeth not, at first word,
that of professours there are two sorts: some are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of such as doe or
may draw back unto perdition; some <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which believe to the saving of
the soule, and that in opposition to the others: Also, that those who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
are not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not true Believers, nor ever were, notwithstanding all
their profession and what their guifts, and attainments, in and under their
profession: So that the Testimony produced, keepeth still its place, and is as a
<hi>King</hi> upon his Throne against <hi>whom</hi> there is no rising up, but yet speaks quite
contrary, clearly, evidently, distinctly to what is pretended, both on the one
hand &amp; the other, is our thesis undeniably confirmed, in this place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
If all those who fall away to perdition were never truly nor <hi>really</hi> of the
Faith, then those who are of the Faith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fall away; but they who fall away
to perdition, were never truly nor really of the Faith, or true Believers: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
The reason of the consequent of the first proposition is evident: for their not
being of the Faith, is plainly included as the Reason of their Apostacy, &amp; their
being of the Faith, intimated as that which would have preserved them from
such defection; the <hi>Minor</hi> is the Apostles, we are not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of them that draw
back, but of them that believe, which plainely distinguisheth them that draw
<hi>back,</hi> from Believers; Againe if <hi>true Believers</hi> shall <hi>live,</hi> and continue to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of their soules, in opposition to them that fall away to perdition, then
they shall certainly persevere in their Faith: for these two are but one &amp; the
same: but that true Believers shall <hi>live,</hi> &amp; believe, to the saving of their soules,
in opposition to them that <hi>draw back,</hi> or subduct themselves to perdition, is
the assertion of the Holy Ghost: <hi>Ergo:</hi> I presume by this time Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is
plainly convinced that indeed he had as good, yea and much better, for the
Advantage of his cause in hand, have let his witnesse have abode in quietnesse,
and not entreated him so severely to denounce judgment against that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which he seekes by him to confirme.</p>
            <p>Sect. 32.<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> the parable of the <hi>stony ground Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. comes next to conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
the words chosen to be insisted on are in the verses mentioned, <hi>but he
that received the seed into stony places, is he that heareth the Word, &amp; anon with joy
receiveth it, yet hath be not root in himselfe, but dureth for a while &amp;c.</hi> That by
the stony ground is meant true Believers, is that which Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to prove: but how in his whole Discourse, I professe I perceive not: I
must take leave to professe that I cannot finde any thing looking like a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fe
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59070:245"/>
or Argument to evince it, from the beginning to the end of this Discourse,
though something be offered to take off the arguments that are used to prove
it to be otherwise; doth Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> think that men will easily Believe that
<hi>Faith,</hi> which hath neither <hi>root, fruit,</hi> nor <hi>continuance,</hi> to be true and saving
Faith; doubtlesse they might have very low apprehensions of <hi>saving faith, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ, justification, sanctification, adoption, &amp;c.</hi> wherewith it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
who can once entertaine any such imagination: that which is tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to induce us to such a perswasion, may briefly be considered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saith he Sect.</hi> 32.<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> Now those signified by the stony ground, he expressely calleth
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> Persons who continue for a time, or a season, <hi>i.e.</hi> (as Luke explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who believe for a season, so that those, who only for a time
believe, and afterward make defection from Christ, and from the Gospell, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
numbred and ranked by him amongst Believers. The words in Luke are
very particular. They on the Rock, are they which when they heare, receive the
word with joy; and those have no root, which for a while Believe, and in time of
temptation fall away. From whence it appeares, that the hearers here described, are
not compared to the Rock or stony ground, for the hardnesse of their hearts, for as
much as they are said to receive the word with joy, which argues an ingenuity and
teachablenesse of spirit in them; and is elsewhere (<hi>viz.</hi> Acts 2. 41.) taken know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of by the Holy Ghost, as an Index or signe of a true Believer; but for such a
Property, Disposition, or Temper as this; <hi>viz.</hi> not to give or afford the word so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
a radication in their hearts and soules, so intimous, serious, and solid,
which should be sufficient to maintaine their beliefe of it, and good affections to it,
against all such occurrences in the World, which may oppose, or attempt either the
one or the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The first Reason intimated, is, that they are said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a terme given them plainly to distinguish them from true Believers; men that
make a profession for a <hi>season,</hi> expressly opposed to them, who receive the
word in <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honest hearts:</hi> if the word had denoted any excellency, any
thing that was good in them, then there had been some pretence to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on it, to prove them true Believers: But to demonstrate the truth of
their Faith, from their Hypocrisy, and their excellencies from that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
denotes their unworthinesse, is a strange way of arguing: They are
persons, saith our Saviour, that make profession for a little while, and then
decay, not like them who receive the Word in good and honest soules; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith M.G. they are true believers; but,</p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Luke</hi> they are said to <hi>Believe</hi> for a season: Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> is not now to
learne, how often in the Scripture they are said to believe, who only professe
the Faith of the Gospell, though the root of the matter, be not in them: that
of <hi>John</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25. may suffice for undenyable instance: or <hi>John</hi> 6. 64. may
farther expound it: their believing for a season, is but the lifelesse, worthlesse,
fruitlesse profession for a season, as their destruction from the good ground
doth manifest, But</p>
            <p>3. They are said to <hi>receive the word with joy, which argues ingenuity and tractablenesse of spirit in them:</hi> No more than in <hi>Herod,</hi> who heard the Word
gladly, or in the Jewes, when the preaching of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was pleasant, or desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to them; or those described <hi>Isai. 58. 2. %who sought God dayly,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to know his wayes, in the middest of the abominable practices.
From the similitude it selfe, He yet farther attempts this uncouth Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But as the blade which springs from one and the same kind of seed, as suppose
from Wheat or any other graine, though sown in different yea or contrary soyles
is yet of the same species or kind, the nature of the soyle not changing the specified
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:59070:246"/>
nature of the seed that is sowne in it, and God giving to every seed its owne body, of
what temper so ever the ground is, where it is sown: in like manner that Faith,
which springs from the same seed of the Gospell must needs be of one and the same
nature and kind, though this seed be sowne in the hearts of never so differing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and frame; the temper of the heart, be it what it will be, not being able
specifically to alter either the Gospell or the naturall fruit issuing from it: And as a
blade or eare of Wheate, though it be blasted before the Harvest, is not hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to have been a true blade or eare of wheate before it was blasted, in like
manner the withering or decay of any mans faith, by what meanes or occasion soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
before his death, doth not prove it to have been a false, counterfeit, or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall
Faith, or a Faith of any other kind, than that which is true, reall, and
permanent unto the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It hath been formerly observed, that <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>militudes</hi> are not <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative,</hi>
beyond the extent of that particular, wherein their nature, as such,
doth consist. The intendment of Christ in this Parable, is to manifest that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heare the word in vaine, and bring forth no fruit of it at all: of these one
sort is compared to <hi>stony ground,</hi> that brings forth a blade, but no fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no
fruit, is no spirit, though there be a blade, or no blade, the difference between
the ones receiving of seed, and the others manifested by our Saviour in this
Parable, is in this, that <hi>one brings forth fruit,</hi> and the other doth not: farther,
the <hi>seed of wheate,</hi> or the like brings forth its fruit in a naturall way; and
therefore whatever it brings forth, followes in some measure the nature of
the seed, but that seed of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> brings forth its fruit in a <hi>morall</hi> way, and
therefore may have effects of sundry natures; that which the <hi>seed</hi> of <hi>Wheat</hi>
brings forth is <hi>wheat,</hi> but that which the <hi>Gospell</hi> brings forth is not <hi>Gospell,</hi> but
<hi>Faith,</hi> besides what the wheate brings forth, if it come not, nor ever will to
be wheate in the eare, it is but grasse, and not of the same nature, and kind
with that which is <hi>wheate</hi> actually, though virtually and originally there
be the nature of wheate in the roote, yet <hi>actually</hi> wheat is not in the blade,
that hath not, nor ever will have eare. If the seed of wheate be so corrupted
in the soyle where it is sowne, that it cannot bring forth fruit, that which it
doth bring forth, what ever it be, is of a different nature, from that which is
brought forth to perfection, by the seed of wheate in good ground. Againe
<hi>Faith</hi> is brought forth by the seed of the Gospell, when the Promises and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
of the Gospell being preacht unto men, do prevaile on them: to
give assent unto the truth of it: that every such effect wrought, is true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Faith, giving <hi>union</hi> with Jesus Christ, Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> cannot prove, that
effects specifically different, may be brought forth by the same seed of the
Gospell, seeing to some it is a savour of life unto life, and to some a savour
of death unto death, needes not much proving. Some receive the Word, and
turne it into wantonnesse, some are cast into the mould of it, and are tansla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the same image; if the temper of the heart, as is said, is not able spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically
to alter the Gospell: but that there may not fruit of various kinds,
be borne in the heart that assents to it, that receives it in the upper crust and
skin of it, is the question. Neither is it a blade occasionally withering before
the Harvest, but a slight receiving of the seed, so as that it can never bring
forth fruit that is intimated. In <hi>summe,</hi> this whole Discourse is a great piece of
Sophistry, in comparing <hi>naturall</hi> &amp; <hi>morall</hi> causes in the producing of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
a thing not intended in the Parable, and whereabout he that will busie
himselfe, <hi>jungat vulpes, &amp; mulgeat hircos;</hi> this is that which our Saviour teacheth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>in the similitude of <hi>seed sown in the stony ground:</hi> The Word is preached unto
some men, who are affected with it for a season, assent unto it, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:59070:246"/>
these we say were never true Believers: a small matter will serve to make a
man a true Believer, if these are such. What tendency this Doctrine may have
to lull men asleepe in security, when <hi>Christ</hi> is not in them of a truth, may easily
appeare, &amp; be judged: if men who are distinguished from other Believers, by
such signall differences as these here are, may yet passe for true Believers,
Justifyed, Sanctifyed, Adopted ones, <hi>solvi mortales curas,</hi> the way to Heaven
is layed open to thousands, who I feare will never come to the end of the
journey.</p>
            <p>What remaines of M. G's Discourse on this text,<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> is spent in answering some
objections which are made against his interpretation of the place; it growes
now late, and this taske growes so heavy on my hand, that I cannot satisfye
my selfe in the repetition of any thing spoken before, or delivered, which
would necessarily enforce a particular consideration of what M. G. here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
on, let him at his leisure Answer this one Argument and I shall trouble him
no farther in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Faith which hath neither root nor fruit, neither sound heart, nor good life,
that by and by, readily and easily yeelds upon Temptation to a totall defection, is
not true saving, justifying Faith.</hi> The root of Faith taken spiritually, is the
habit of it in the heart; a spirituall living <hi>habit,</hi> which if it reside not in the
heart, all assent whatever, wants the nature of Faith, true and saving; the
fruits of Faith, are good Workes, and new Obedience; that Faith which hath
not Workes, <hi>James</hi> tells you, is dead; dead and living Faith doubtlesse differ
<hi>specifically.</hi> Againe Faith purisieth the heart, and when a heart is wholly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
corrupted, naught and false, there dwelles no <hi>Faith</hi> in that heart; it is
impossible it should be in a heart, and not at least <hi>radically</hi> and <hi>fundamentally</hi>
purify it: farther Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath told us, that true Believers are so fortified
against Apostasy, that they are in only a <hi>possibility,</hi> in nor <hi>probability,</hi> nor <hi>great
danger</hi> of totall Apostasy: and therefore they who presently, and readily fall
away, cannot be of those, who are scarse in any danger of so doing, upon any
account whatever: but that the faith here mentioned, hath neither root, nor
fruit, good heart to dwell in, nor good life attending it, but instantly upon
triall and temptation, vanisheth to nothing, we are taught in the text it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
therefore the Faith here mentioned, is not true no saving Faith. That it hath
no root is expressly affirmed. <hi>v.</hi> 21. and all the rest of the qualityes mentioned
are evidenced from the opposition wherein they, who are these Believers,
are set unto true Believers, they receive the Word in <hi>good and honest hearts,</hi>
they bring <hi>forth fruit with patience,</hi> they <hi>endure in the time of tryall;</hi> like the
house built on the Rock, when the house built on the Sand, falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>One word more with this witnesse before we part: they who receive the
Word in good and honest hearts, and keepe it, do bring forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and fall not away under temptation: so saith the testimony: but all
true Believers recive the Word in good and honest hearts: <hi>Ergo</hi> Which is the
voyce of Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s fourth Witnesse in this cause.</p>
            <p>The 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> is forced to bring up the reare of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
by M. G. produced to convince the world of the truth &amp; Righteousnesse
of his Doctrine of the Saints Apostacy, ending his whole Discourse in the mire,
Observatioas from the Text or context, from the words themselves, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence,
to educe his conclusion from, he insists not on. Many excellent words
we have concerning the clearenesse &amp; evidence of this Testimony, &amp; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of avoyding what hence he concludes, we want not, but we
have been too often inured to such a way of proceeding, to be now moved
at it, or troubled about it, were the waters deepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would not make such
a noyse. The state and condition of men here described by the Apostle, is so
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:59070:247"/>
justly delineated to the eye, by the practice of men in the world, to whom
the Gospell is preached, that I do not a little wonder how any man excercised
in the Ministry, should once surmise that they are true Believers of whom
he here treates; Taking the words in the sence wherein they are commonly
received, And in the utmost extent, who sees them not dayly exemplyfyed,
in and upon them, who are yet far enough from the Faith of Gods Elect. By
the dispensation of the Word, especially when mannaged by a skilfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of assemblyes, men are every day so brought under the power, of their
convictions, and the light communicated to them, as to acknowledge the
truth and power of the Word, and in obedience thereunto, to leave off, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
and abhor the wayes and courses wherein the men of the world, either
not hearing the Word at all, or not so wrought upon by it, do pollute
themselves and wallow with all manner of sensuality; and yet are not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in their natures, so as to become <hi>new creatures,</hi> but continue indeed, and
in the sight of God, <hi>doggs and swine, oftentimes returning to their vonit and mire,</hi>
though some of them hold out in the professions to the end; And these are
they, whom commonly our Divines have deciphered under the name of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malists,</hi>
having a <hi>forme of Godlinesse but denying the power of it,</hi> who are here
all at once by Mr <hi>Goodwin</hi> interested in Christ, and the inheritance of the
Saints in light; To make good his enterprise he argues from the <hi>Remonstrants.</hi>
Sect. 40. pag. 297.</p>
            <p>1. If the said expressions import nothing,<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> but what Hypocrites, and that in
sensu composito, i. e. whilest Hypocrites, are capable of, then may those be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
who are separated from men that live in errour, and from the pollutions of
the World, and that through the knowledge of Jesus Christ: and on the other hand
those may be Saints, and sound Believers, who wallow in all manner of filthinesse,
and defile themselves daily with the pollutions of the World. This consequence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the principles, and known Tenets of our Adversaries, is legitimate and
true, in as much as they hold that true Believers may fall so foule, and so far, that
the Church, according to Christs institution may be constrained to testify that they
cannot beare them in their outward communion, and that they shall have no part
in the kingdome of Christ, except they repent &amp;c. But whether this be wholesome
and sound Divinity, or no, to teach that they who are separate from sinners, and
live holily, and blamelessly in this present world, and this by meanes of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Jesus Christ, may be Hypocrites and children of perdition, and they on the
other hand who are companions with Theeves, Murtherers, Adulterers &amp;c. Saints
and sound Believers, I leave to men whose judgements are not turned upside down
with prejudice to determine.</p>
            <p>1. Sundry things might be observed from the Text, to render this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
altogether uselesse, as to the end for which it is produced: as 1. That
sundry copies <hi>v.</hi> 13. instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who almost, or a little way, or
measure, so escaped as is said. 2. That it is not said, that those who are so
escaped, may Apostatize, it is said indeed, that the false Prophets and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> do lay baites for them, as the Fisher doth for the fish that he
would take, by proposing unto them a liberty, as to all manner of impurity
and uncleanesse, but that in so doing, they prevaile over them, is not affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
3. The conditionall expression <hi>v.</hi> 20. may be used in reference to the
false Prophets, and not to them that are said to <hi>escape the pollutions of the
World;</hi> and if to <hi>them,</hi> that nothing can be argued from thence, hath plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
upon severall occasions been already demonstrated: but to suffer M. G.
to leap over all these blots in his entrance, and to take the words in his own
sence and connexion, I say;</p>
            <p>1. In what large and improper sence, such performs as we treat of, are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:59070:247"/>
               <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> hath been declared. Those who pretend to be Godward, what
they know themselves not to be, making a pretence of Religion, to colour
and countenance them in vice and vicious practises, or sensuall courses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they allow and blesse themselves, we intend not: But such as in <hi>some since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
under the enjoyment and improvement of gifts and priviledges, do, or
may walke conscientiously, as <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion, and yet are not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christ.</p>
            <p>2. Of these we say, that they may so escape, &amp;c. but that <hi>sound Believers,</hi>
may wallow in all manner of sinfulnesse, and defile themselves with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of pollutions, we say not: nor will any instance given amount to the
height and intendment of those expressions, they being all alleviated by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
considerations, necessarily to be taken in with that of their sinning.</p>
            <p>3. If we may compare the worst of a Saint, with the best of a formall
Professor, and make an estimate of the states and conditions of them both,
we may cast the ballance on the wrong side.</p>
            <p>4. We do say that <hi>Simon Peter</hi> was a believer when he denyed Christ, &amp;
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> an Hypocrite, and in the bond of iniquity, when it was said <hi>he
believed.</hi> We do say, that a man may be alive notwithstanding many
wounds and much filth upon him, and a man may be dead, without either the
one or the other, in that eminently visible manner. He addes.</p>
            <p>2. The Persons here spoken of,<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> are said to have, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, truly and really escaped
from those, who live in errour. Doubtlesse an Hypocrite cannot be said, truly or
really, but in shew, or appearance at most, to have made such an escape (I meane
from men who live in errour) considering that for matter of reality and truth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in Hypocrisy, he lives in one of the greatest and foulest errours that
is.</p>
            <p>The whole force of this second exception, lyes upon the ambiguity of the
terme <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> though such as pretend Religion, and the worship of God,
to be a colour and pretext, for the free and uncontrouled practising of vile
abominations, may not be said so to escape it, yet such as these we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
described, with their convictions, light, guiftes, dutyes, good conscience
&amp;c. may truly and <hi>really escape</hi> from them, and their wayes who <hi>pollute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the errours of Idolatry,</hi> false-worship, superstition, and the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of practises against the light of nature, and their owne convictions: It is
added that</p>
            <p>3. An Hypocrite, whose foot is already in the snare of Death, cannot upon
any tolerable account, either of reason or common sence, be said to be allured
(<hi>i.e.</hi> by allurements to be deceived) or overcome by the pollutions of the world, no
more than a fish that is already in the nett, or fast upon the hooke, can be said to be
allured, by a baite held to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But he that hath been so farre prevailed upon by the preaching of
the Word, as to relinquish, and renounce the practises of uncleanenesse;
wherein he sometime wallowed, and rolled himselfe, may be prevailed upon
and overcome by temptations, to backslide into the same abominable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherein he was formerly engaged, deserting that way and course of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Word, and yeilding obedience thereunto, which he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that in its own nature tended to a better end.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sayes he,</hi> Hypocrites are no where said, neither can they with any congruity
to Scripture Phrase, be said to have escaped the pollutions of the world through the
acknowledgement (for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should be translated) of Jesus Christ
the acknowledgement of the truth, and so of Christ, and of God, constantly in the
Scriptures, importing a sound and saving worke of conversion: as we l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ans.</hi> It sufficeth that the thing it selfe intimated, is sufficiently revealed in
the Scriptures, and confirmed by the examples of all those who have <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi>
the truth of the word to the putting on <hi>a forme of Godlinesse,</hi> though
they come not up to the power, or saving practise of it; and truly I cannot but
admit, that any one, who hath had never so little experience in the work of
the Ministry, or made never so little observation of Religion, should once
suppose that all such persons, must needs be accounted true Believers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
