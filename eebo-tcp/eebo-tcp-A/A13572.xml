            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> of the king of Portugal <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> who was as then ſaid to be priſoner in Venice. This letter was directed to the moſt Chriſtian king, and I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it with all poſſible diligence I could vſe, and cauſed it to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to his Maieſtie. In the ſame packet there was alſo a further traduction of the ſame letter; which hauing thus happened to my hands, I acquainted diuerſe of my friends therewith, who made ſuch reckening and eſteeme thereof, as it were a matter beyond all other moſt rare and maruellous. This letter was of ſuch power, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked and kindled in the hearts of my ſaid friends, an extreme loue and affection towards the Prince, and begot in them likewiſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement deſire, to ſee him in libertie and peaceable poſſeſſion of his kingdome, as if themſelues had bene ſubiects thereto belonging. So (referring that to ſuch as were more obliged by dutie, and had more particular intereſt in ſuch buſineſſe,) after the receipt of this leeter, I laboured all I might to vnderſtand ſome tydings of his eſtate and ſucceſſe. Hauing then learned, that a Religious man, of the order of the preaching Friers (named brother <hi>Ioſeph Texere</hi> a Portugueſe, one knowne to the greateſt and meaneſt in Europe, as alſo here very well) had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this Citie to a Biſhop a friend of his, a diſcourſe of matters happening ſince the ſaid king began to enterpriſe his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke voyage: I ſo much importuned a nephew to the ſayd Biſhop, who kept this diſcourſe in his hands to ſend to his vncle, as no excuſes might ſerue from transferring it to mine. The reading thereof was to me ſo pleaſing and agreeable, as both it encouraged and cut off all ſuppoſition of labour, in the ſpeedie writing and copying it out. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by this meanes this verſion in mine owne power, I thought I ſhould commit an inexcuſable fault, if I ſhould reſerue to my proper vſe ſuch a ſtrange accident and worthy regard.

Of all which particular notes, I moſt humbly intreat your Maieſtie to heare onely but two. There is a merchant here, who ſome fiue and twentie yeres ſince was wont to trade into Portugall: this man being at Lisbon before king <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> paſſed into Affrick: mark what befell him. As he was vpon the ſea ſhoare, ſtopping his ſhippe that had receiued a leake, he ſaw a farre off the King comming, making a goodly horſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he rid, to mount and coruet very ſprightly vnder him: and he not knowing him to be the King: this beaſt (quoth he) what will he breake his owne necke? The King and others of the traine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe words, gallopped the horſe ſo mainely toward the merchant, and made him in ſuch a fearefull taking, as the poore man verily thought he ſhould looſe his life. But when he knew him to be the King, he fell to the ground, and weeping (on his knees) deſired pardon, for he feared leſt his lauiſh tongue might haue made him to be truſſed vp. The King as he was euer full of clemencie, commaunded him to ſtand vp, intreating him verie honorably, and beſtowing ſundrie fauours vpon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> ſeeing the ſame merchant here in our citie, before he was arreſted as a priſoner, demaunded of him (vnasked) if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred ſuch a matter, and ſo acknowledging the one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diuerſe things paſſed betweene them which happened at that preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, this King (I would ſay this priſoner) when he was at Meſſina, knowing that there dwelt a gentleman of a verie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous familie, who had accompanied him in his voyage to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke: he went and found out his houſe, and vpon ſome priuate paſſages betweene them, they kindly renewed their former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Beſides, ſince his arriuall here in our citie, and before his impriſonment, he writ diuerſe letters to the ſaid gentleman, and receiued likewiſe letters backe againe from him. And by his expreſſe meanes, was a man and letters ſent into Portugall, to ſundrie faithfull Lords of that kingdome: but we heare that this man ſo ſent to Portugall, died in thoſe parts, but vnknowne how,

At point of death, he named for principall heire his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Muley Abdela Xarifa</hi>: conditionally, that he ſhould giue to his two brothers part of his kingdomes. <hi>Muley Abdela</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus his father, not onely denied to fulfill his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but concluded vpon the death of his brethren.

From thence he iourneyed with his power into Barbary, and there after diuerſe fightes with the king his nephew, he tooke poſſeſſion of Teza, which was yeelded to him without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſiſtance. And proceeding onward, he came to Fez, where then was <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> with thirty thouſand horſe, and ten thouſand harquebuziers: there was likewiſe an Andaluſian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnell, that came and ioyned eighteene hundreth Andaluſians with him. The ordinance on either ſide played very roughly, <hi>Muley Mahamets</hi> part did ſmall dammage, but <hi>Muley Malucos</hi> very much, diſcomfiting almoſt all his nephewes horſemen, and forcing them to a ſpeedy flight. On the other ſide, the foote (after diuerſe hote skirmiſhes) came to handy blowes, continuing the fight ſo long, and with ſuch fury, as darke night was faine to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the battell. <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> beholding his troupes thus vanquiſhed, and conſidering it was beyond his ſtrength to make any further counter-quarrie againſt his vnckles forces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe into Morocco, and ſuch in his company as bare him beſt affection.

The king parted from Lisbone, taking with him about thirty religious perſons of my order (to whom he bare very kind affection, and repoſed truſt inough in them, for he vſed to call them his brethren.) One of their number was our Prouinciall of Portugal, who commanded the orders through all the gouernement of the kingdome, and as well in Europe as in Affricke, Aſia, and America, named brother

               <p>When the heauy newes was brought to Portugal, and that I had intelligence therof: becauſe of the intreſt I had in the iourney, I was conſtrained to go to Lisbone, being fourteene leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from Santeren, to vnderſtand whether they were true or no. Where arriuing the 25. of the ſayd moneth, I met with mine vnckle, who was the ſelfe ſame day returned from Affricke.

(A diſcrete anſwere out of an infidels mouth, conſidering he was better grounded in good ſpeech, then gouerned by the rule of truth: becauſe among the attributes which we giue to God, one of the moſt proper is, that he is an vpright Iudge, and the iudgements of all truth are iuſtified by himſelfe, as the kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> euidently ſhewes vs in the 18.

And becauſe (quoth he, proceeding) that I hold it for moſt certaine, that he is aliue, know that I came from the battell with him, and with the king <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> my deare brother, and riding along the riuer of Larache, to paſſe on the other ſide, certaine Moores gaue vs the chaſe ſome ſixe leagues from the field of battell.

Moreouer, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes did ſo certainly aſſure themſelues of their king <hi>Dom Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtians</hi> life, that a Portugall Maſon was ſo bold, as to publiſh himſelfe to be the ſaid king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> and found in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very many followers: who went with him ſtraight to Lisbon, and if he had entred the euen of <hi>S.

Whereupon, being forſaken of his aſſociates that followed him like vnarmed fooles, he was taken and hanged, and cauſed diuers others to be hanged likewiſe, of royall authoritie; among whom (to his owne great ill hap) was a Preſident hanged.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in a certaine Prouince of Portugall, called <hi>Beyra</hi> a poore Portugueze of meane condition, gaue out himſelfe to be the King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> and this was deliuered for a matter ſo true and confident, as the Cardinall of Auſtria, who at this day is Archduke, and earle of Flaunders, being Viceroy in Portugall, determined to withdraw himſelfe thence into Caſtile. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, following the counſell of the fiue Gouernours of Portugall, who gouerned the kingdome conioyntly with him, he ſent to Captaine <hi>Gil de Meſa,</hi> who now is one of the gentlemen of the chamber to the moſt chriſtian King, that he ſhould go with his companie of two hundred men, and to take the man there, and

and on this booke of the moſt holy Euangeliſts, which I touch with my hands; that I a miſerall ſinner, haue ſeene with mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy eyes, my Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſpread abroad vpon the croſſe, in manner following.</p>
            <p>I being with mine armie in the land which is neare to the riuer Tagus, in the Prouince of <hi>Campo d'Ourique,</hi> to giue battell to <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and to foure other kings of the Moores, who had with them infinite thouſands of men at armes: and my people being ſomewhat ſad and fearefull, to behold ſuch a numberleſſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of warriours, came vnto me and ſayd, that it would be ouer-much boldneſſe in vs to bid them battell. Whereupon, being very much afflicted with what I heard and ſaw, I began to ponder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by my ſelfe what I were beſt to do. In my pauillion I had a booke, containing both the old Teſtament and the new of Ieſus Chriſt; I opened it, and hapning to reade the victorie of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> I began thus to ſay to my ſelfe: Thou knoweſt ô Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that for the loue of thee, I haue vndertaken this warre againſt thine enemies: Lord, it is in thy hand to giue me and mine ſtrength to vanquiſh theſe blaſphemers of thy name. And ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo I fell aſleepe vpon the ſayd booke, and ſleeping, I ſaw an olde man come to me, ſaying: <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> take good courage, for thou ſhalt vanquiſh and put to repulſe all theſe Kings here, and ſhalt breake their forces, and God ſhall ſhew himſelfe to thee. As I was in this viſion, ſuddenly came to me <hi>Ferdinand de Souſa</hi> gentleman of my chamber, who awaking me, ſayd: Sir, raiſe your ſelfe, for here is an olde man come to ſpeake with you. Let him enter, ſayd I: if he be any of our friends. When the man was come in, I knew him to be the ſame good olde man which I had ſeene in my viſion; he ſayd vnto me: Sir, be of good cheare, you ſhall vanquiſh, you ſhall vanquiſh, and you ſhall not be vanquiſhed. God loues you, for he hath caſt the eyes of his mercy vpon you, and on your race, euen to the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth generation, wherein your ligne ſhall be weakened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. Neuertheleſſe, in this diminution and feebling, there ſhall be no want of his diuine fauour and ſuccour. He hath commaunded me to tell you, that when you do heare in the night enſuing, the bell of mine hermitage, wherein I haue liued ſixtie ſixe yeares among the infidels, and in the protection of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18887:14"/>
the moſt high: you ſhall come foorth of your campe, all alone without company and he will make his great mercy appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. I obeyed, and proſtrating my ſelfe in reuerence to the ground, worſhipped the meſſenger, and him that ſent him.</p>
            <p>And as I attended in prayer the ſecond watch of the night, I heard the bell, then (armed with my ſword and ſhield) I went foorth of the campe. Then I ſaw on my right hand toward the Eaſt, a bright beame in the element, the ſplendour whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed more and more. And as I held mine eyes reſpectiuely fixed on that quarter, I ſaw in that beame (ſhining brighter then the Sunne) the bleſſed Croſſe, and Ieſus Chriſt crucified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: likewiſe both on the one ſide and other, a multitude of young men ſeeming verie white, whom I accounted to be holy Angels. When I had beheld this viſion, I layd by my ſword, ſhield and garment, put off my ſhoes, and being proſtrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon the earth, I wept abundantly: then going to intreate ſtrength and preſeruation for my ſubiects, without any trouble I ſpake in this manner: Lord, to what ende doſt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to me? wouldſt thou increaſe the faith of him that only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues in thee? It were better (Lord) that theſe infidels ſhould ſee thee, to the end that they might beleeue: as for my ſelfe, from the day of my baptiſme, I haue knowne and acknowledged thee the true God, Sonne of the Virgin, and the Father eternall.</p>
            <p>This croſſe was of admirable greatneſſe, and eleuated from the earth about ten Cubites: and the Lord with a ſweete ſound of his voyce (which I heard with mine vnworthy eares) ſayd to me: I do not appeare vnto thee in this ſort, for increaſe of thy faith, but to comfort thy heart againſt this battell, and to fixe the chiefeſt Princes of this kingdome vpon a firme rocke. Courage <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> for thou ſhalt not onely vanquiſh and be conquerour in this battell, but likewiſe in all other which thou ſhalt fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of the croſſe. Thou ſhalt find thy men cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpoſed to the battell, and in the name of a king they will require thee to enter the fight; make thou no doubt at all, but liberally graunt whatſoeuer they demaund. For I build and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both Empires and Kingdomes, and I will eſtabliſh an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in thee and thy poſterity: to the end that my name may be ſpread and augmented, euen vnto the very vttermoſt nations.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18887:14"/>
And that thy ſucceſſours may know that I haue giuen thee thy kingdome, the Scutchion of your armies ſhall be fully beautified with the price whereby I bought mankind, and of thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Iewes bought &amp; ſold me: this ſhall be to me a ſanctified kingdome, for preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>auation of the faith, and louing of pietie.</p>
            <p>Hauing heard theſe wordes, I worſhipped and ſayd: For what merites (O Lord) doth it pleaſe thee to ſhew me ſo great grace? I will do whatſoeuer thou haſt commanded me: and Lord, looke fauourably on my poſterity as thou haſt promiſed me, and keepe my people of Portugall ſafe and ſound. But if any miſaduenture be to be endured, conuert it (Lord) rather againſt me and my ſucceſſours, and pardon my people whom I loue as my onely ſonne. Which the Lord ſhewing me he would conſent vnto: Neuer (quoth he) ſhall my mercie part from thee nor thine, for by them I am to prepare a great harueſt, and them haue I cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for my harueſt labourers in lands farre remote. This ſayd, he vaniſhed, and I (full of confidence and contentment) returned to my campe. And that theſe matters hapned thus, I king <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſweare by the holy Goſpels of Chriſt Ieſus, which I touch with theſe my hands. Wherefore I commaund my ſucceſſours that ſhall come for euer, that they beare in their armes fiue Scutchions parted in forme of a croſſe, becauſe of the croſſe and the fiue wounds of Ieſus Chriſt: and in each of them thirtie pence, and on the top or Creſt the Serpent of <hi>Moſes,</hi> being the figure of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And that this may be a memoriall to our generation; whoſoeuer ſhall go againſt it, let him be curſed of God, and with the traytor <hi>Iudas</hi> eternally tormented in hell. </p>

               <p>Now to returne to our armes: the King <hi>Dom Emanuel</hi> ſeeing himſelfe in Europe, Lord of the kingdome of Portugall, and of the Realme of the Algarbe, which is in the prouince of Spaine; in Affricke of the other Realme of Algarbe, which is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Barbarie; of all the coaſt of Guinee, euen to the Cape <hi>de bonne Eſperance,</hi> and from thence vnto the red ſea: and of a great number of the Iſles ſituate in the ſea of the ſaid Affrica; in Aſia of the Realme of Goa, and of a verie ſpacious Monarchie, conſidering he held nine Kings his ſubiects and tributaries, and foure Queenes: in America, of Breſil, a prouince of very large extenſion: he bare a Sphere for his deuice, which ſignified the rule that Portugall had in the foure quarters of the world.

And becauſe ſundrie perſons haue demaunded of me how they ſhould vnderſtand theſe Scutchions and pence: I here tell them, that the fiue Scutchions in the Azure field ſet in one ſhield, the field whereof is Argent, each of them figured with fiue white pence, do ſignifie fiue kings Moores, vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by one Chriſtian king.

               <p>WE finde in the hiſtories of Portugall, that in the yeare 1169. when Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt approued the election of the King <hi>D.

The King <hi>Dom Alphonſo</hi> ſoiourned then in the towne of <hi>Coimbre,</hi> which then was the capitall place of all the kingdome: within ſome few dayes after, the King departed from the ſaide towne, to be preſent at the ſiege with his ſonne and traine; and as he was vpon the way, there came before him two or three religious men of the ſaid order, who demaunded of him (on the behalfe of Frier <hi>Bernard</hi>) place for beginning the building of the monaſterie which he had promiſed. The King conſidering apart by himſelfe, and remembring that he had made this promiſe is his heart, and yet had not imparted it to any perſon whatſoeuer, and ſeeing that Frier <hi>Bernard,</hi> who was diſtant off from him more then three hundred miles, knew therof, he took it as a good augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or preſage, and began to hold it for certaintie, that the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Architect would not ſlack his grace toward him, but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt he ſhould conquer the ſaid citie. Hauing then giuen good and charitable welcome to the religious men, he ſaid: My brethren, you come in a verie apt ſeaſon, let vs iourney on toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I will recount it vnto you, as alſo make accompliſhment of my promiſe, ſo ſoone as I haue recouered the citie of <hi>Santa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Moores, which I haue beſieged by my ſon &amp; ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>Three dayes after the arriuall of the King there, the citiie was wonne and taken, more by the help of heauen, then by the valour and ſtrength of the Chriſtians: albeit no way to diſparage their deſeruing, they fought like hardie and very valiant men.

               <p>This may be verie wel applied to <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> my Lord and king: becauſe that after the twelfth of Ianuarie, the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his father died, aged but ſixteene yeeres and ſeuen moneths, till the twentie of the ſaid moneth, An. 1554. when he was borne: at <hi>Lisbone</hi> throughout all <hi>Portugall,</hi> day and night they made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall proceſſions, faſtings and prayers, with very much deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and great ſtore of tears, as the reuerend father doctor <hi>Sampaye</hi> makes known in his Epiſtle to the reader. The reaſon was, becauſe the Portuguezes feared, that the kingdom ſhould fal into the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards hands. For that when the King <hi>D. Iohn</hi> 3. grandfather to to King <hi>D. Sebaſtian,</hi> gaue his daughter <hi>Mary</hi> as wife to <hi>Philip</hi> then prince of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> it was ſaid by the contract of this mariage, that if it happened that the King <hi>D.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18887:21"/>
children, he that ſhould be borne of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be heyre to the kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> whereto the people then conſented (ſay ſome) but repented afterward, that they laboured not to contend rather by law or warre, which queſtionleſſe had not wanted, becauſe the Lord <hi>Dom Edward</hi> ſonne to the infant <hi>Dom Edward</hi> brother to the ſaid King. <hi>D. Iohn.</hi> 3. then liued, who was a Lord endued with many ſingular vertues, and as a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Prince borne of Kings by the ligue maſculine, did euermore claime the ſucceſſion of his anceſtors in the ſaid kingdome, which neuer yet fell vnto the diſtaffe. Hereupon the Portuguezes prayed to God ſo inſtantly, with ſo many proceſſions, faſts, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares, that it might pleaſe him to giue them a Lord and Prince. Thus by diuine grace was <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> giuen to the Portuguezes the firſt time, and thus now againe he giues him the ſecond time.</p>

               <head>An anſwere to the third demand.</head>
               <p>For manie cauſes (right reuerend Lord) it was not neceſſarie for the King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> to diſcouer himſelfe in <hi>Barbary</hi>: of al which we wil alleage but two. The firſt, if he had manifeſted himſelfe, he had run into great danger of his lifes loſſe, for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie could not more eaſily haue put him to death, then in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> There are a great number of officers kept in pay, who giue them ſuch morſels, which is called the Boccon, or poiſoned bit, as the poore patient cannot by anie meanes eſcape: they limit them to the yeare, moneth, daies: what ſhall I ſay? to verie houres and moments. The ſecond, if <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> had got him into his power, the leaſt that he would haue demaunded for his ranſome, had been the cities and townes which the Portuguezes poſſeſſe in <hi>Barbarie.</hi> This had beene a ſmall gift for him, <hi>Tanger, Arzile, Mazagan,</hi> and the other places which the Kings of <hi>Portugall</hi> do hold in <hi>Barbarie.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Septa</hi> had bin great loſſe to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, for it is the key of <hi>Affricke</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> And the <hi>Moores</hi> hauing that in their own power, at all times, and whenſoeuer they were thereto diſpoſed, they might paſſe into <hi>Spaine</hi> an hundred thouſand horſe and more, and from <hi>Spaine</hi> poſt to other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as ſomtimes they did, when they were not ſo well inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to warre, nor expert in Armes. Our hiſtories of <hi>Portugall</hi> doe tell vs, that the infant <hi>Dom Fernand</hi> being taken by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18887:21"/>
Moores in the field of the citie of Tanger, as he there held his ſiege: ſome few daies after, they came to demaund for his raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome onely the citie of Septa, which his father the King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> of worthie memorie, the Baſtard, had won from the Mores. The king (that then was) <hi>Dom Edward,</hi> for the ſingular loue he bare to his brother, reſolued with his people (who loued the Prince entirely) to giue what they had demaunded. The infant <hi>Dom Fernand</hi> being aduertiſed of his brothers kind reſpect, and the peoples goodwill to him likewiſe, found the meanes to write ſecretly vnto them, that they ſhould be very carefull what they did, ſaying: God forbid, that by my occaſion Chriſtendome ſhould endure ſuch a damage: I had rather be partaker among an hundred thouſand martyrs, or die in captiuitie in the Infidels cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie, then cauſe ſuch a manifeſt daunger to all Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>The Mores following ſtill their motion (yet vſing the infant and his companie with extreame crueltie) came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it was hindred much more by the ſaid infant, then the king his brother: whereupon they began to intreate him in farre better manner, that he might the gladlier conſent to his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But they could no way worke him, to preferre his owne particular benefite, before the weale publique of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So that the Moores growing much diſpleaſed hereat, put him into an iron priſon, without any bed or ſeate, and ſo placed him before the gates of the citie of Marocco, giuing him daily to eate certaine ounces of bread, and a little water to drinke. After ſome few moneths, this holy Lord rendred his ſpirit to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in that rigorous priſon, ſuffering a glorious martirdome, for the common good of all Chriſtians, after the example of his Lord Ieſus Chriſt, redeemer of the whole world. His bodie is buried in the Couent of our Ladie of victorie, which is of mine Order, commonly called <hi>de la Battaille,</hi> in the Chappell of king <hi>D. Iohn</hi> his father, where God (in regard of him) did continually many miracles, for aduancement of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>The religious Fathers of the ſaid Couent, on the day of his death do not vſe to ſing any Maſſe of <hi>Requiem,</hi> but that of all Saints, (becauſe he was not canonized, nor yet beatified) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is contained amongſt them. Frier <hi>Ierome de Ramos,</hi> a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man of mine Order, writ a booke concerning the life of this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18887:22"/>
glorious Saint, in the Portugall language. Which booke I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> hath both ſeene and read, and that in imitation of the ſaid Saint, who was brother to his fourth grandfather, I am certainely perſwaded, that he hauing ſo apt meanes to conceale himſelfe, would not be diſcouered: for ſhould he haue there bene reuealed to the Mores, they might haue come and demaunded for his ranſome, the townes and cities elſewhere ſet downe, nay the citie of Septa it ſelfe. And doubtleſſe, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes would haue giuen them all, nay rather much more, for the libertie of a King ſo good, ſo vertuous, and ſo holy, whome they loued with ſuch and ſo great affection, as if he had bene a God and their redeemer.</p>
               <p>The king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> (moſt worthie Lord) was naturally ſo Catholike and chriſtianly addicted, that for the adding but of a very pulſe breadth of ground to Chriſtendome, he would moſt gladly haue yeelded himſelfe captiue. And therefore we may well coniecture and credit his good nature, that when he could not get away without danger of his life, and likewiſe in reſpect of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendomes generall benefite, he held it much more glorious for him to die in priſon and ſlauerie in Barbarie, then to liue at libertie being Lord and Monarch of the world. Thus, right reuerend Lord, giue we end to the anſwer of your third demaund.</p>

               <p>Some do coniecture, that he hath bene amongſt the Moores in Barbarie many yeares. Which very well be ſo (although ſuch as haue not bene accuſtomed to frequent that countrey, do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it impoſſible) and oftentimes it hath ſo happened to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguezes, that they haue liued captiues in Barbarie for the ſpace of 10.12.15.20.25. and 30. yeares, without any tidings heard of them all. The reaſon is, that al ſlaues Noble do appertain to the King, and ſuch as hold them in their cuſtodie, are bound to make like deliuerie to him of them. Whereby very often the Lords of the Moores, knowing their ſlaues to be of noble race, diſſemble with them, that they may not loſe them: and that they may find meanes to be rid of them, graunting them for their libertie ſome reaſonable ranſome.</p>
               <p>So got out of captiuitie the Prince my Lord <hi>Dom Antonio,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:18887:22"/>
who died at Paris with the title of King of Portugall, becauſe he had bene elected, receiued, ſworne and confirmed by the people, King of the ſaid Realme: who being ſlaue to a particular man, his good fortune fauoured him ſo much as not to be knowne: and he mette with another ſlaue of his companie, an Affricane Gentleman, who ſpake verie well the language of the Coimbre, and called himſelfe <hi>Gaspar de Gran.</hi> This man made his maiſter beleeue, that this ſlaue <hi>Dom Antonio,</hi> was a Prieſt which would neuer be redeemed thence, becauſe his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were very glad of his life in impriſonment, for thereby they had in meane while the benefite of his goodes and rents: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gaue him counſell, that it were much better for him to make ſome reaſonable compoſition, then to be a looſer altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the end, the matter was ſo concluded, that for the raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Prince and the ſaid Gentleman, the ſumme of ſixe hundred Cruzadoes muſt be paid him, which are Crowns valuing fiftie ſolz or ſouſe Tournois. And the Mores parted thence with them, neuer trauelling but by night, but hiding them ſelues all the day time: and on the fift or ſixt day after they arriued in the night at the gates of Arzile, where entring maſqued, they left their ſlaues, receiued their money, and then returned backe to their houſes. If the Lord <hi>Dom Antonio</hi> had bene knowne for ſuch as he was, and had fallen into the power of the king of Barbarie, his matter had ſorted a quite contrarie way: for the ſlaues to the king are kept in very ſtrong guard, and if they hold tenne thouſand crownes rent, there will be demaunded fiftie thouſand for their raunſome, which if they will not make promiſe of, they muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſharpe baſtonnadoes. The ſlaues that are to other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, are much more nearer their libertie: either by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a ſumme of money, ſauing themſelues otherwiſe, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged at length by the meanes of their Miſtreſſes. It is a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ordinarie in Barbarie, worthie Lord, for the women Moores do extremely loue Chriſtians: &amp; many times they receiue libertie by the meanes of them, and likewiſe get very good gifts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.</p>
               <p>In like ſort diuerſe are freed and ſcape vnknowne, by meanes of the religious Fathers of the moſt holy Trinitie, which are called the Order <hi>De Redemptione captiuorum,</hi> in Fraunce we call them <hi>Mathurines.</hi> There is commonly Monkes of this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18887:23"/>
Order in Barbarie, who deale with the Moores for the raunſome of Chriſtians: which Monkes do paſſe through all the Realmes of Barbarie, clothed in their habits, with verie much libertie, and haue great credit with the Moores. Among whom, if they find ſome man of qualitie, that is not knowne at all, they compound imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly for his raunſome, and counting downe the money, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to pay it in a limited time, they ſet him at libertie.</p>
               <p>I thinke reuerend Sir (becauſe I can yet vnderſtand no further of matters paſſed) that my Lord the king <hi>Dom Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> hath neuer bene held as priſoner: or if he haue, it was his good happe to meete with an honeſt maiſter, with whome he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo long, as till he could obtaine his libertie, or compaſſe the meanes to make an eſcape. And as we do imagine, he hath bene wandring among the Aethiopians, as your worthie ſelfe may gather by the tranſlation of two letters written vnto me, the one from the Father doctor <hi>Sampayo,</hi> the other from <hi>Dom Iohn de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi>: the originals whereof remaine in my cuſtodie, with ſeuen or eight other letters of theirs, which they did ſend to me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Venice.</p>
               <p>In this demaund likewiſe, your reuerend Lordſhip praies me to tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what reaſon my Lord the king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> did not come into Fraunce, or to any place elſe, where doubtleſſe he might haue bene receiued according to his qualitie: namely, with better entertainment then he had at Venice? I anſwere, that being by Gods grace reſtored to libertie, himſelfe will deliuer the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that mooued him, to go and preſent himſelfe before the Lords there, and thoſe likewiſe which withheld him from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Fraunce or elſewhere, according as your ſelfe haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged. As for my knowledge of him, it ſufficeth me to heare the ſpeech of him, I being in one place, and he in another. But comming to the ſight of him, I can demaund and know diuerſe notable things of him, which is impoſſible for him to haue alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forgotten: for aſſuredly he can and will reſolue me in one or other. For ſince the time I became religious (which was at two and twentie yeares, and 26. daies of mine age) he being then aged 12. yeares, one moneth, and 28. daies, I haue ſeene him in diuerſe quarters of Portugall, and conferred with him of very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affaires. Before I was religious, he being aged ſeuen or eight yeares, I ſerued as a Page to his Grandmother, his fathers

mother, who was ſiſter to the Emperours <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and graund-mother to the moſt Chriſtian Queene <hi>Maria de Medicis</hi>: and for this reaſon he is very neare kinſman to the ſayd Maieſty, coſin germaine remoued by the fathers ſide, <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Catherine,</hi> and likewiſe coſin germaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued by his mothers ſide, <hi>Iane,</hi> who was eldeſt daughter to the ſayd <hi>Charles</hi> the fift brother to <hi>Catherine.</hi> This which hath bene ſayd (ioyned with the tranſlation of the two miſſiues enſuing,) may ſerue as anſwer to your fourth demaund.</p>

            <p>I Haue heretofore written to your fatherhood concerning this preſent matter, and becauſe I know not whether my letters haue bene deliuered you or no, I determined to ſend one more after the reſt. Perſwade your ſelfe (holy father) and euen as God ſhall deale with my ſoule in the article of death: that no other motiue ſtirres me hereunto, but onely brotherly affection, truth and zealous loue to the liberty of my countrey.</p>
            <p>The King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> our Lord, is priſoner here in this city, and ſo hath bene for two and twenty monethes: whom God (in his iudgements concealed to himſelfe) hath permitted to come hither, tranſported to this place very poorely, and robbed by fiue of his owne ſeruants which he entertained in Cicilie. But ſo ſoone as he arriued here in this city (where he hoped to find good fauor and ſupport) immediatly the Embaſſadour of Caſtile perſecuted him moſt cruelly: perſwading the Seigneurie, that he was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrois, a theefe, &amp;c. For this cauſe the Lords impriſoned him, and rigorouſly proceeded againſt him: here they keepe him cloſe

ſhut vp, not ſuffering him to be ſeene, nor enlarged, nor execute any act of iuſtice vpon him: <hi>Quia nullam inuenient in eo cauſam.</hi> Becauſe they can find no iuſt cauſe againſt him.</p>
            <p>Our ſinnes are great, great is the ſtrength of Spaine, and the malice of the Iewiſh Portuguezes in this countrey, whereof ſome weare red bonnets, and others blacke: but the laſt are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

            <p>I haue written to the Gouernour, and to many other; I know not what the ſinnes are of our Portugezes in Fraunce, who were wont to oppoſe their liues to extreame daungers, and hazard loſſe of their goods (with very good zeale) for a figure: and will they not now with ſo much honor, in an action of truth and glory, make their owne aduantage and benefit, not for a ſhadow, but for a rightfull King, whoſe life (both in the priſon and abroad) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſheth all the countrey with admiration, by the meanes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, prayers, and diſciplines? notwithſtanding all which, his ſtrength is not a iot impaired, for he is of very maruellous fortitude.</p>

In the end, hearing no tidings at all of them, he retired to this Citie, the aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med yeare, in the moneth of Iune, hauing about him but one poore Gazete, a peece of mony valuing three Liards of France. In this maner he lodged at a needie wretched houſe, where he remained ſome dayes not being knowne. Afterward, diuerſe particularly began to liſten after him: for they heard that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe firſt a Knight of the Croſſe, and then afterward, the King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian.</hi> As this brute ran abrode, <hi>Antonio de Brito Pimentel, Pantaleon Peſſoa,</hi> and many others came oftentimes to ſee him at his lodging: and by occaſion of this rumour, which ſpread it ſelfe more and more through the Citie, chaunging his lodging, he fell by misfortune into the hands of vile men, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18887:26"/>
being but verie bare themſelues, yet gaue him clothes and food at their charges. He got verie euill reputation by the companie of ſuch people, which was the principal cauſe or his ſtrange miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture. He was with thoſe companions at Padoa, whereof this Seigneurie being aduertiſed by the Ambaſſador of Caſtille, and of ſome tumults made among them: to foreſtall ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences as might enſue, they ſent to the Podeſtat of Padoa, that he ſhould by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement cauſe him to auoid the Towne within certaine houres, and by like certaine dayes to depart the places belonging to their Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon for ſome ſpeciall reaſons beſt knowne to himſelf, he returned againe vnto this Citie, where the Seigneurs thereof at the inſtance of the ſaid Ambaſſadour (who aſſured them that he was but a thiefe and a ſeductour, prouing it by the teſtimony of Iewiſh merchants Portugueſes, and other perſons of ſelfſame honeſt qualitie, who tooke their oathes he was not the King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> becauſe the true King died in the battell of Affricke, neither did he reſemble him in any degree, imputing to him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and verie enormous crimes) they ſent to apprehend him, and as a malefactour committed him to verie cloſe impriſonment: notwithſtanding, there were many perſons both before and ſince his commitment, that had knowne him verie well in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, and affirmed him to be the true king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At his firſt queſtioning withall, he declared to the Lords his miſhap in Affrica, and in what maner God had deliuered him. After, to diuerſe others he did the like, and perceiuing they would ſearch into all his ſecrets, yet vſing him verie hardly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, and one that had no way preiudiced their eſtate: v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his naturall and wonted inclination to choler, moued in a ſubiect of ſuch iuſtice and equitie, he refuſed to make them anie more direct anſwers, but one while ſaid one thing, then againe another; neuertheleſſe, he euermore maintained him ſelfe to be the true king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> deſiring the Lords therein to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, and if they approued him not to be the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to chaſtiſe him iuſtly as a falſe deceiuer, which as yet to this inſtant they would neuer do, nor yet permit him to be ſeene by any.</p>
                  <p>He is in a certaine priſon, where no man may enter or ſpeake to the priſoners: neither may one write vnto him, on perill of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18887:27"/>
the ſaylours life, if he ſhould but conſent thereto. He hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured verie great pouerties, and paſſed through many hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſes: being no leſſe reproched and miſpriſed, then the baſeſt priſoners with him. His life is very religious, addicted altogether to prayer and faſting, feeding but on bread &amp; water moſt dayes in the weeke. And yet notwithſtanding this auſtere abſtinence, he is verie ſtrong, as I haue heard by one of the priſoners relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of that priſon: who departed thence greatly affectionate to him, ſeeming to loue him highly, and reported matters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous of his ſtrength and other good parts.</p>
                  <p>As for the exteriour markes of his bodie, he wants not one of them which he had when as he raigned: the ſelfe ſame lip, looke, head, bodie, armes, thighes, legges and feete, not fayling of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one marke which he had naturally (imprinted as it were) on his perſon. He is wounded on the brow of the right eye, and on the head, as many witneſſed, when they ſaw him in the Affricke battell: he hath abundance of great wounds on his armes and legges: he ſpeakes Portugall as mingled or corrupted, wherein he is not much to be blamed, conſidering he hath not ſpoken it in the ſpace of two and twentie yeares, according to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he tooke with his friends and companions, becauſe they might paſſe the better vnknowne. His hand writing is the ſelfe ſame, obſeruing ſtill the ſame maner and method; all which are verie well remembred by diuerſe, that haue both ſcene and knowne them in times paſt. In the ſecret notes of his bodie, there is none likewiſe wanting, albeit he haue many &amp; very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as is iuſtified by good teſtimonie, approued by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Notaries of Portugall. It is impoſſible to find another man in the world, that ſhould haue all the ſelfe ſame markes, and it ſeemes that God had thus ſigned him from the wombe of his mother, with ſo manie rare and ſignall markes, to make him knowne (by meanes of them) in ſo vnhappie and miſerable a time, euen as he hath likewiſe preſerued him for the fulfilling of ſo great and auncient Propheſies, which haue ſo copiouſly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him. May it pleaſe God but to permit, that the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the accompliſhment yet remaining to him, may aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in like certaintie to the foretold aduerſities, which he hath paſſed alreadie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18887:27"/>Things ſtanding in this eſtate, we haue demaunded audience of the Seigneurie, which twice hath bene graunted vs by the Senate with verie good will. And there we deliuering the rumor that ran abroad, of the impriſonment of our King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> by meanes wherereof all <hi>Portugall</hi> was moued, and all Chriſtendom held it for meruellous and ſtrange: we requeſted that he might be ſeene and knowne, and if he were found to be the true King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> that he might be ſo held and eſteemed of euerie one. If vpon their ſuffering him, to be thus queſtioned and ſeen by vs, we returned and auouched him to be the ſame, we would ſubmit our ſelues to ſuch impriſonment as they thought meet, and ſuffer what puniſhment they would pleaſe to appoint, if herein we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled or dealt falſe with them. Before theſe audiences could be obtained, we offered them a Charter in parchment, whereby we gaue them to vnderſtand, that we deſired no other grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but what hath beene graunted in the like caſe by <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. King of <hi>Caſtille</hi> (he hauing more intereſt in this matter then they) about two Portuguezes, who in <hi>Portugall</hi> did feigne themſelues ſeuerally to be the true King <hi>D. Sebaſtian,</hi> he cauſed them to be kept in a publique priſon, where all the world might haue ſeene and ſpoken with them, to the end that they might not be abuſed by them, and they were ſoone found to be villaines and deceiuers, whereby the Portuguezes were quickly reſolued.</p>
                  <p>We required moreouer, that good order might be taken for his diet, and that his perſon ſhould be ſafely regarded, while this affaire were further proceeded in, leaſt his enemies might compaſſe his death by poiſon: for if anie ſuch thing ſhould ſo come to paſſe, the Portuguezes would report continually, that the Seigneurie of <hi>Venice</hi> had murdered their proper, naturall, lawful and true King, when it ſhould plainly appeare that he was no <hi>Calabrois,</hi> -whence would ariſe ſuch ill will betweene the Portuguezes and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as the Seigneuries name ſhould for euer be ſcandalized through the world. See here the ſubſtance of all that we could doe, yet we continued ſtill in our right, with all the diligence we could poſſibly vſe, calling neuer for anie other thing then iuſtice. And as we grew great in the poore opinion of our hopes, <hi>Diego Manuel</hi> chanced to arriue there, by whoſe comming we were ſomewhat more
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18887:28"/>
comforted, perſwading our ſelues now to obtaine thorowly what we deſired: becauſe he had brought letters of great importance, which mainly might ſet forward our earneſt ſute. And to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs yet more, <hi>Sebaſtian Figuera</hi> came hither likewiſe the 4. of this moneth, with letters from the States in general of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; from the Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> vnto the Seigneurie, in fauour of the King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> which were deliuered on the morrow, for the Lords had appointed vs to be heard againe as that daie.</p>
                  <p>Now aduiſe your ſelfe very well, whether I haue reaſon or no to thinke ſtrangely of you, and to expect your preſence here for obtaining of this glorie, wherein you haue ſo ſeriouſly trauailed vntil this day. If you haue any reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of heauen, or anie high and generous ſpirit, here haue you a ſubiect meet to employ it in. I beleeue you reſerue to your ſelf the ſur-name of a Portugueze, for nothing but to ioyne it only with that of <hi>Texere.</hi> This ſhould be the hidden treaſure, whereof in the end of the yeare 1598. you called to the finding your good friend the knight <hi>Buodo,</hi> when you made your paſſage into <hi>Holland.</hi> If you be deſirous of glorie and happineſſe, we ſhall ſoone haue you here: deuide your ſelfe in peeces for the Prince, and you ſhall find the effects thereof in the mercies of God. In ſooth I know not how you haue abſtained from comming barefoote hither, conſidering how zealous you haue beene for the good and profite of our countrie; and ſuch a profeſſed enemie beſide to the Spaniard; and (in times paſt) of high courage for vndertaking of anie worthie attempt; ſeeing (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen) is not the like caſe as here offers vnto you; beſides, being free for whoſoeuer to embrace. Awake your ſpirites either now or neuer, and ſeeing you haue ſo much credite in thoſe parts, pray, importune your friends in any place whereſoeuer, and if you may, obtaine letters from his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, the famous Queene of <hi>England,</hi> the generall States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and from all the Princes and Lords of <hi>France</hi>: that this Seigneurie may ſuffer the priſoner to be known what he is, true or falſe, or at leaſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large him, becauſe to this houre they will neither let him be knowne nor ſeene: but faile not to come, with what fauours you can compaſſe. And ſay that deniall herein maybe made vnto you, yet you muſt not ſlack your comming in a buſines ſo expedient: for you ſhall do no mean ſeruice to your Prince, as you haue done

heretofore and that verie notably, and had we but your preſence here, we ſhould hold it ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Doe not let fall to ground ſo great an aduenture, ſeeing you haue done ſo much alreadie for a ſhadow, and giue the like coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell vnto your friends; for neuer can hap like occaſion to this.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, let me thus condition with you, that you ſhall not be ſo couetous a louer of your ſelfe, as to make a ſole benefite of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this action, but to diuide ſome participation thereof to your friends.</p>
                  <p>I had forgot to tell you that the priſoner hath had of the Sieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neurie, fiue crownes of this mony monethly to diſpend, which is a little more then foure crownes of the Sunne; of which he giues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the moſt part to the poore for the honour of God.

And to <hi>Monſieur le Commaundeur de Chastes,</hi> ſay that the time is now come wherein I ſhall make knowne to him how much I reſt engaged and am readie at his ſeruice. And ſo pleaſe him to credite me: if he deſire to purchaſe ſupreme glorie and great eſtate, let his employment be intire on this Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, for thereby he ſhall gaine more honor and repute, then his higheſt thoughts is able to imagin I kiſſe the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of al our friends according to my dutie, and let each one receiue me as effectually his.

               </p>
               <p>It hath bene told me, that they expect at Venice the Lord <hi>Dom Chriſtophero,</hi> youngeſt ſonne to the king <hi>Dom Antonio,</hi> who is at Rome, and with him theſe Lords <hi>Manuel de Brito Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentel, Pantaleon Peſſoa de Neyua, Frances Antoine,</hi> and other Gentlemen of Portugall, of whom I can ſay nothing what they are, becauſe their names were not written to me. The newes that I haue at this preſent, are no other then thoſe contained in the ſaid letters from the Doctor <hi>de Sampayo,</hi> and from <hi>Dom Iohn de Caſtro,</hi> from each of whom I haue receiued diuerſe other, which neuertheleſſe ſort all to one ſelfe ſame end. There be ſundrie other letters here from other Portuguezes, that affirme this man to be the true king of Portugall <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> and approoue it for truth by many reaſons, giuing ſuch plaine apparance of veritie, that (according to humane iudgement) cannot be encountred or ratified on any other then himſelfe. So that I ſee nothing which may call me into doubt of his not being the ſame man, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt queſtionleſſe be a ſpirit or diuell: which cannot be, conſidering his life is ſo holy and perfect, his proceeding moſt ſimple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (to vſe the very ſame words which one hath written to me) it is all meere ſimplicitie. If he were a ſeductour, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpirit, he would expreſſe ſtore of artificiall crafts and frauds in his doings: beſide, a wicked ſpirit would neuer endure ſo long and rigorous an impriſonment. The aforenamed aduertiſements, inſtances and intreates from the ſpecified perſons, beſide reaſon it ſelfe, bind me (moſt worthie Sir) to part thus briefly, but I hope to viſite you againe to morrow after breakefaſt: and ſo I cloſe vp mine anſwer to your fift demaund.</p>

               <head>An anſwer to the ſixt and laſt demaund.</head>
               <p>For anſwer to the ſixt and laſt demaund, I ſay (right reuerend Lord) that it is to me very much diſpleaſing, to ſerue as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour in this buſineſſe, and by that meanes ſtand bound to keepe all vnder ſeale: for this reaſon I dare not anſwer categorically, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I feare to offend my moſt inward wel-willers in their truſt. Notwithſtanding, that I may induce the king of Portugall <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> my Lord into Fraunce, I promiſe to make the mightie truth ſo apparant, that it ſhall violently breake the very ſtrongeſt bars oppoſed againſt it, and ouerflow the whole earth, that with much glorie and proſperitie it may floate through al the Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion, and grace him home into his owne kingdome.</p>
               <p>When the Portugals ſhall haue their beſt loued &amp; deſired king at libertie: who ſhall offer reſiſtance? If Sir, you reply to me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding how I dare aſſume ſuch confidence in this caſe of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> ſeeing (in late proofe) we could not do any act of great importance, when we had <hi>Dom Antonio</hi> preſent with vs: I anſwer, that to iuſtifie my words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue a thouſand reaſons that make for me. There was great difference betweene <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Antonio. Antonio</hi> came to the Crowne by a very great hazard and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> from the wombe of his mother was borne Prince &amp; heire. <hi>Antonio</hi> employed his time to gouerne and viſite the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Priour <hi>de Crato</hi> (he was grand Prior of <hi>Malta</hi> in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, and for this reſpect, Lord ſpirituall and temporall of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene cities, and more then foure hundred villages:) <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to manage his horſes, and follow the exerciſe of armes. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi> as a man Eccleſiaſticall and regular, kept his ſword ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the ſcabberd: <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> like one ſecular and a King, caried his daily naked, ſhining brighter then chriſtall. To confirme what I ſay, me ſeemes (worthie Sir) that it is not neceſſarie to alleage all the reaſons which offer themſelues: it ſufficeth vs to know for certaine, that the king <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> hath at this day, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more had the will and hart of a Portugueze, which is as firme in ſeeking his ſubiects benefite and loue, as it was euer readie with his weapon to encounter his enemie.</p>
               <p>The Portuguezes know very well, that they haue alreadie felt for the ſpace of 21. yeares, one moneth, and 25. daies, the hony &amp; ſweet reliſh of his gouernment, &amp; that if they haue in all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18887:30"/>
time, taſted any thing vnſauorie in his actions (becauſe he was a little ſtiffe and ſharpe:) they haue ſince then bene ſo ouer-glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with gall, as they will find his very bittereſt behauiour, more ſugred and ſweete then the others beſt taſt. Moreouer, if there be great difference betweene man and man: euen ſo on the other ſide is there betweene time and time. The Portuguezes liue at this day, with an vnquenchable thirſt of their libertie, ſo that they would gladly caſt themſelues from the tops of high mountaines, to find a redreſſe for their ſlauiſh bondage. In the paſſed time, as they had neuer taſted but their owne naturall gouernment, ſo they knew not how to prooue the bitter, nor how well to eſteem the benefite of the ſweete. Hence grew ſo many parts taking, both before and after the election of <hi>Dom Antonio.</hi> He had with him the people, the Lords of the familie of <hi>Vimieuſe</hi> and others, with the moſt part of the eccleſiaſticall and regular perſons. The duke of <hi>Bragancia,</hi> he brought in his quarter many Lords of Portugall (for they were almoſt all deſcended of his houſe) and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which made neare the number of two hundred thouſand in Portugall. The Nobles of Portugall, which are there called <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuyers</hi> or <hi>Cheualliers d'vne Launce,</hi> &amp; are the principall ſtrength and ſinewes of the Realme, they betooke themſelues all to ſee the ſport of this play. The fourth part, which held for his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Maieſtie D. <hi>Philip</hi> king of Caſtile, becauſe of the diſcord and deuiſion of the reſt, was the ſtrongeſt, &amp; proceeded at more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in thoſe affaires. There was but one ſole part with the King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and to him they continued ſtill vnited firme: for it is a thing very publique, and knowne through the world, that the Portuguezes not only loued <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> as their king, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him as if he had bene a God. Wherefore (worthie Lord) I hold it for moſt certain, that ſo ſoone as they ſhould vnderſtand their King to be in France, they would immediatly ſhake off the yoake of Caſtile, they would ſend him mony to ſupply his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and would leauy an armie by ſea, with whom they would gladly come to ſeeke him, and no bodie could tell which way to hinder them, for they are in poſſeſſion, and hold all Portugall and his Monarchie properly in their hands.</p>
               <p>His Maieſtie Catholique holds nothing in Portugall which he can warrant or defend: for what can three or foure hundred ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18887:31"/>
do within the caſtle of Lisbon, when for defence of the ſame there ſhall need 10000. There is in this Caſtle a Pariſh that holds more then 500. houſes or make-fires, this caſtle was the pallace of our Kings, builded on a mountain all of earth, ſubiect to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining &amp; blowing vp. His ſaid Maieſtie keeps his Garriſon therin to no other end, but only for oſtentation: I my ſelfe was priſoner in it 3. moneths and a halfe, in the yeare 1582. after the death of the Lord of <hi>Strozzi,</hi> &amp; I haue heard Captains ſay, that if 10. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouldiers were in it, they would make them dance out ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in a moment, &amp; mockt ſuch as eſteemed it for a ſafe ſecuritie, if any rumor or tumult ſhould be blown through the citie. His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Maieſtie holds as impregnable the Tower of Bethlehem on the ſea, for guard of the port a league from Lisbon; at three leagues that of <hi>S. Iohn</hi>; at 4. that of <hi>S. Anthonie</hi>; at 5. that of Caſcayes. In the firſt, third, &amp; fourth, there is not aboue 100. men of war: in the ſecond, of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> admit there were more then 400. whoſoeuer is or ſhall be Lord of the land, ſhall be ſo likewiſe very eaſily of al thoſe towers. But ſay that <hi>S. Iohns</hi> is mighty &amp; ſtrong: I know for certaintie, that the 16. part of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his A. B. C. were enough to race &amp; batter it in 4. houres. (This A. B. C. are 24. Canons, which the Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> cauſed to be made for the batterie of Stenwick, &amp; tooke it perforce in the yere, 1592.)</p>
               <p>Moreouer, his Maieſtie Catholike hath an other Tower, which his father cauſed to be made in the middeſt of the ſea on a rocke, which is called <hi>Teſte ſeche</hi>: this tower ſerues to no end, but that the other of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> doth countenance it. At Setuball ſixe leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lisbon, there is alſo at entrance of the port a tower called <hi>S. Philip,</hi> of very ſlender importance, by being built at the foote of a high mountaine that commands it. I thinke beſides theſe, at the port of Viana, ſixtie leagues from Lisbon, he keeps a Garriſon of Spaniards in another tower: behold here the ſtrength of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie Catholike in Portugall. But of what import will they prooue, though he had much more aduantage, if the Portugals were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bined together? ſo much the ſooner enſued his loſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> king of Caſtile the firſt of that name, called himſelfe king of Portugal in the right of his wife, who was daughter to <hi>D. Fernand</hi> king of Portugall; the Queene mother, her kindred and allies, did likewiſe take part with the Caſtillians: but the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes knitting them ſelues in an vnity together, rent forth of his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18887:31"/>
hands whatſoeuer he had inſulted on, and chaſed him out of the kingdome, after they had ouerthrowne him in the battell of <hi>Alji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barota</hi>: albeit he had in his army foure and thirty thouſand men, and they were but 7. thouſand onely: afterward, they gaue him defiance againe at Valverde, at Trancoſo, and elſewhere, as is to be ſeene in our hiſtories (if your reuerend ſelfe but pleaſe to reade, you ſhall there find it agreeing with my words) and in purſuite they gaue him law at their owne pleaſure, as anon we ſhall tell you more in this anſwere.</p>
               <p>Thus we may eaſily perceiue, that it conſiſts not in the ſtrengh of the king Catholicke <hi>Dom Philip,</hi> both to guard Portugall, and keepe all the kingdome thereof vnder bridle, though he aſſembled all Spaine, and all his other commaund. Wherefore I am of the mind (moſt worthy Lord) that ſo ſoone as his Maieſty Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke is giuen to vnderſtand, how that the King <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> is come into Fraunce, he will immediatly ſend his Embaſſadours to him, and offer him the reintegration of his realme in quiet (ſwept cleane already of corne and chaffe) as much as to ſay, as without pretending any thing to him but loue and kindneſſe. And I thinke his Councel wil therto aduiſe him, if they haue any feare of God, if they be wiſe, diſcreet, or friends to the ſeruice &amp; welfare of their king. For if king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> come with ſtrong hand to the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Portugall, no way can hinder him the entrance of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, then into Caſtile, and from thence through all Sapine, whereby he will bring <hi>Dom Philip</hi> into ſuch diſtreſſe, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he will go neare to make ruine of all. And when he ſhall come to vrge his agreement, <hi>Dom Sebaſtian</hi> not onely will bind him to pay all his diſpence, domages and wrongs endured by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the warre: but likewiſe to reſtore him thoſe reuenues and profits, which the king his father and himſelfe haue hald out of Portugall, for the ſpace of more then twenty yeares, which will amount to more then forty millions. Nay, that which is more, to deſtroy him, and be gratefull to his friends, and them that aided him in the recouerie of his kingdome: he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him to render the realme of Nauarre to the king moſt Chriſtian: that of Aragon to the Duke of Lorraine, thoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Sicilie to his holineſſe, and likewiſe to the other Princes of Europe, all that he hath held from them perforce; for the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18887:32"/>
flower they are in comming to peace and concord, the ſwifter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the great loſſe and miſhap of Spaine.</p>
               <p>This which I ſay reuerend Sir, is not in bare and ſimple words onely, nor ſhall this be the firſt time, that Portugall hath taught law to Caſtile: ſuch as are pleaſed in reading hiſtories, ſhall find this very true, and of many that we might report and ſet downe in account, we will alleadge but onely one. <hi>Dom Peter</hi> King of Caſtile, ſirnamed the cruell (who was ſlaine by his baſtard bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that came to raigne afterward, and named himſelfe <hi>Henry</hi> the II.) left two daughters, the firſt called <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Iſabel,</hi> wife to <hi>Edmond</hi> of Langley brother to <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gaunt, the husband to the elder daughter <hi>Conſtance,</hi> of whom was borne a daughter named <hi>Catharine.</hi> The ſayd <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gaunt, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his wife <hi>Conſtance,</hi> qualified the king of Caſtile and Leon, and made his direct paſſage from Gaſcoigne (which then was in the rule of the Engliſh) into Spaine, with eighteene thouſand foote, and two thouſand horſe, and tooke the Groigne, with the ayde of <hi>Iohn</hi> the baſtard, elected King of Portugall, receiued, ſworne, confirmed, and obeyed by the Portuguezes, who were to him very good friends. Thence he went on to Portugall, whence he entred into Caſtile, and ſo on to the City of Burgos, diſtant from the place where he parted more then twentie ſixe leagues: tooke it at his arriuall, and made himſelfe maiſter of all the cities, townes and caſtles he came to: moreouer, they that were further off, came and for feare ſubmitted themſelues. And eaſily had he attained to a larger aduantage, but that his men died, who through their neglect in ordering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and ſmall prouidence in good husbandry, were ouertaken by famine, whereon a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enſued among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they were brought to ſuch ſcarſity of victuals, as they were forced to run to the enemies campe, which was vnder the guide of <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of Bourbon, who in fauor of king <hi>Iohn</hi> of Caſtile, came thither well acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, to requeſt wherewithal to ſaue their liues. Which the ſayd <hi>Iohn</hi> of Portugall beholding, complained to the Duke, ſaying, that it was not good for his ſouldiers to treate with the enemy, affirming that they would cauſe more preiudice then all the other: therefore he ſhould repeale them preſently, &amp; forbid all community of ſpeech with the contrary part. Otherwiſe when they ſhould enter fight,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18887:32"/>
all would by the edge of the ſword be deſtroyed, the one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of loue to the other. <hi>Thomas Walſingham</hi> an Engliſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, deliuers it in the ſelfe ſame termes, and ſayth, that the king of Portugall had with him foure thouſand Portuguezes, and all of them very well armed.</p>
               <p>Within few dayes after, certaine Embaſſadors ſent by the king of Caſtile, came to the Duke, deſiring peace of him in all humility, to whom the Duke wold giue no audience, Notwithſtanding, the hunger &amp; peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did enforce him, to withdraw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall to the towne of Trancoſo, whither they came againe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him, being ſent the ſecond time from the ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> king of Caſtile, &amp; to vrge once more the ſame requeſt: ſhewing the Duke by many reaſons, the great profit might be drawne out of a kind peace betweene them. The Duke then gaue them the hearing, &amp; condiſcended to their demand, although it was greatly againſt his will; chiefly, becauſe he heard that the king hf Portugall was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereto, and then (being touched therein by a more effectuall cauſe) namely, the intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the troubles beginning in France among the French and Engliſh, and ſome ſeditions at home in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: all which ſhewed him, that he could draw no freſh ſupplies thence, becauſe that there ſeemed to be greater need, and the mortality in his army did moſt of all require it.</p>
               <p>The accord betweene the King and the Duke was made in this manner. That <hi>Henrie</hi> eldeſt ſonne to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> named Prince of Caſtile, ſhould eſpouſe <hi>Catherine</hi> the onely daughter of the ſayd Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gaunt, and <hi>Conſtance</hi> his wife, and ſhould ſucceed in the kingdomes of Caſtile, Leon, and other Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuries: that the king ſhould endowe the mother and daughter, and ſo he did: giuing to the mother the citie of <hi>Guadalajata, Medina del Campo</hi> and <hi>Olmiedo</hi>: afterward, being with her in the ſayd <hi>Medina,</hi> he gaue her likewiſe <hi>Hueta.</hi> To the daughter he gaue the <hi>Eſturies,</hi> creating and naming her Princeſſe, and his ſonne Prince thereof. So from thence forward, the eldeſt ſonne euer bare the ſirname of this principalitie: as of Daulphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Fraunce, of Wales in England, of Girona in Aragon, of Vienna in Nauarre, &amp;c. Moreouer, he ſhould giue the Duke ſixe hundreth thouſand Franckes of gold, for his returne into England, and fortie thouſand Franckes in name of rent, beſide the ſayd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18887:33"/>
cities and townes during the liues of him an her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> of Caſtile accepted of all theſe conditions with right good will, yet he had Fraunce and the French on his ſide, and the King of Aragon (with whoſe ſiſter he was maried, of whom was borne the ſayd Prince <hi>Dom Henrie,</hi> and <hi>Fernand</hi> that after was king of Aragon, againſt the right of the true heires indeed) and <hi>Charles</hi> the III. king of Nauarre his brother: but he knew notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all theſe, that hauing ciuill wars in Caſtile, and Portugall for an enemy, fortune wold forſake him in all his realmes &amp; Seigneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Thus could and can the kingdome of Portugall beare head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reſt of Spaine. It is moſt certaine, that at all times, and as often as Portugall hath the fauour of Fraunce, of England, or ſome other ſtraunge Prince whoſoeuer it be, it compels the king of Caſtile (to whom that is a bridle) to make him yeeld to reaſon, and come at commaund, nay, to accept of conditions very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and preiudiciall. And thoſe of the Duke might haue bene much more aduantageable to this agreement, if the king of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall had bene willing: becauſe hauing the ſword in his hand, he might haue cut out his partage at his owne pleaſure. He was the Iudge, and it was done with his will: <hi>Qui habet gladium, poteſt diuidere campos.</hi> And hence it came, that the Duke departed not very well contented with him: although he gaue him in mariage his eldeſt daughter <hi>Philippe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this already rehearſed (worthy Lord) may be vnderſtood, that they who haue not the pearles of ſpotted affection in their eyes, may diſcerne, and others, whoſe harts are not fatted with hate to this good king, may know, that my wordes are neither bourdings nor ſongs. For if this King <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> the baſtard, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all Spaine, all Fraunce, and ſome of Caſtile his allies ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt him, for himſelfe only foure thouſand Portuguezes, and ſome Engliſh in weake eſtate, and yet then ſuſpected to, being withdrawne from Caſtile into Portugall, could make lawes to his enemies: what ſhall <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> do, accompanied with a great number of Princes of Europe, with his Portuguezes and his owne perſon, which degenerates not a iot from that of his graundfather <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> the baſtard, who for his faire deedes was ſirnamed, Of worthy memory: againſt a young king, ſlenderly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, and but badly armed? It is not to be doubted but he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18887:33"/>
ſhall reſtore Portugall, ſeeing God and the propheſies haue ſo made him promiſe; and that he ſhall cleanſe and purge the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards of their vices and abuſes, according as <hi>S. Iſidore</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, who ſince he floriſhed, it is more then a thouſand yeres. What contentment, what ioy ſhall the world receiue by ſight hereof, and namely they that are the children of God? What fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie for the Romane Church? What good for the weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of Chriſtendome? Let the enemie iudge this cauſe, and (as one ſaid in Portugall) let them cracke this nut, and know, that yet at this daye Portugall is farre ſtronger then Spaine, yea all Spaine in the time of the ſaid Baſtard. Then all that were ſouldiers, were skilful in handling the ſword, the launce, the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard and the croſſe or long bow: now at this day they can not be drawne from the harquebuſe or musket; for this reaſon the Portugals haue yet more ſouldiers then Spaine. Becauſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians, yea or the Spaniards that come from the garriſons of the king of Caſtile, do neuer part thence but lame and maimed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be ſome of the principal Gentlemen. Of the Portugueſes ſent from Portugall to the Eaſt Indies, there comes backe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the third part of them, and of them that are ſcattered in diuerſe places of Affricke the ſecond part. This is moſt certaine, for in the beginning of the raigne of our Lord D. <hi>Antonio,</hi> I found a rolle of the ſouldiers that were to be had in Portugall, wherein it was aſſured me, that within the prouince d'Entre, Douro and Migno, which is called in Latine <hi>Interamnis,</hi> which containes no more then eighteene leagues in length, &amp; twelue in breadth at the moſt, three thouſand old ſouldiers were to be found.</p>
               <p>To this aunſwere, it remaines for me yet to ſatisfie another obiection, which your reuered ſanctitie may make vnto me, to wit, Some that haue a mightie opinion of the King of Caſtilles ſtrength, would make the world beleeue, that he is infinitely powerfull, and can inuade Portugall with huge numbers of ſouldiers. To the firſt point I aunſwere briefely and ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: That the King of Caſtille is in no place more weake then in Spaine. To the ſecond: Whence ſhall hee gather ſuch ſupplies of ſouldiours? Shall hee furniſh him ſelfe out of thoſe garriſons and forces which hee hath from Spaine? Not ſo.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18887:34"/>
If in caſe he will cull out of the ſaid garriſons ſome ſouldiers to forrage Portugall, hee muſt at the leaſt haue foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths time to do it. In leſſe then foure dayes may men paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Brittanie to Lisbone. Could he bring fiftie thouſand men into Portugall, wherewithall wil he feed them? I would onely twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand. Moreouer, what would auaile fiftie thouſand ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in Portugal? All thoſe being there, could not impeach the King <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> from landing: for Portugall hath an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fortie leagues on the coaſt, and throughout is landing eaſily to be had. In ſome parts, they that are on land in one place cannot in a day giue ſuccour to the other, albeit they are diſtant but two leagues. If king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> did but ſet foote on land, all Portugall would preſently run to him: by which reaſon, ſtrange ſouldiers would be forced to yeeld themſelues, or throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues headlong into the ſea, or die with famine, or elſe by the hands of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Now giue I concluſion to this preſent diſcourſe, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching your worthie Lordſhip, to hold excuſed ſuch ſlips as are therein, becauſe in the writing thereof, I haue bene driuen to ſome nightly houres (which could not be verie manie ſince I receiued your laſt letter) for ſo long a certification by pen, and but that I was enioyned thereto by your expreſſe commaund, I could gladly haue excuſed my ſelfe from ſo tedious a trauel. But the honors and graces receiued from ſo worthie a perſon, haue bene ſo great, and continued in ſuch ſort, as they bound me to obey without all excuſe. If my pen haue erred in anie point (whereof I doubt not) this hope is left me, that one day I may giue your Lordſhip more ample, certaine &amp; aſſured ſatisfaction, in all whatſoeuer ſhall pleaſe you to require. I write in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilian language, becauſe your worthie ſelfe did ſo commaund me, and in regard you take ſome delight therein, as it hath bene often told me. But ſhould I confeſſe the truth, my loue would much more haue forwarded me, &amp; rather haue had me to write in my natiue Portugueſe. Our Lord gard and giue proſperity to a perſonage of ſuch honor. From Lions the 6. of Ianuary. 1601.</p>

And as I thought to depart on the Sonday after the feaſts, I could not do it, by reaſon we had intelligence, that on the way of Lions were disbanded ſouldiers of the Swizzers, who robbed and ill intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all paſſengers. Hereupon, I made account to depart in the companie of my Lord <hi>Monſieur de Sancy,</hi> who trauelled to the Fort of S. Catherine.

is ſo great, yea, in all perſons without anie difference, as if he were giuen as an onely remedie, to the trauailes and miſeries of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age. And that it may proue ſo, if auncient propheſies deceiue vs not, all Chriſtendome hath reaſon to hope much, of proſperitie and welfare by the meanes of this holy King.</p>
            <p>The newes that I haue, how he was ſet at libertie, are theſe. After that the Portuguezes had obtained audience of the Senate, which the Lords granted them with benigne and readie will: <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ego Manuell</hi> arriued there from France, and <hi>Sebaſtian Figuera</hi> from the States of Holland, with letters in fauour of this affaire, as elſewhere you haue heard before, and from Rome the Lord <hi>Dom Chriſtophero,</hi> with <hi>Manuel de Brito Pimentel, Pantaleon Peſſoa de Neyua,</hi> and <hi>Frances Antoine,</hi> with whom there ioyned manie Portugueſes more, that came from diuers parts. The eleuenth of this moneth paſt, the Lords entred into Councell (which they there terme Pregay) where commonly you ſhall haue two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Lords of the chiefeſt of that Seigneurie. The Pregay held for the ſpace of foure daies. On the laſt, which was the inſtant about ten of the clock in the night, the Lords concluded on their laſt reſolution in this caſe. They cauſed the priſoner to be brought, and commanded a Secretarie to ſet down this determination fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Becauſe he names himſelfe to be the King of Portugall <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> he is commanded out of this Citie within one day, and from the parts belonging to this Seigneurie within three daies more; on paine of commitment to the gallies for the ſpace of ten yeeres, with yron gyues at his feete. But if his indiſpoſition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die cannot ſuffer this paine: then he ſtands condemned to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual impriſonment. Moreouer, for puniſhment of his diſobedience committed, in not departing the lands belonging to the State at the time when by commaundement of the podeſtate of Padoa he was ſo enioyned, they had alreadie giuen him theſe two yeeres and 22. daies impriſonment, ſince the contempt.</p>
            <p>The ſentence pronounced, he was immediatly ſet at libertie; betweene eleuen and twelue of the clocke in the night. Some let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from certaine of Italie, ſpeaking in this manner, ſay: This was but a boxe of coriander comfites, to pleaſe the Spaniard withall, becauſe he is their neigbour: the gazetes affirme the ſame.</p>

At night after ten a clocke, the King our Lord was called to the Senate, where to him was intimated, the ſelfe intimation which had bene made to him by the Podeſtate of Padoa, the yeare 1598. It is ſaid, that when the king entred the Senate, and while the decree of his ſentence was reading, all the Seigneurs were vp on their feete, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with very much reſpect.

For all the ceſternes were loſt, alſo the wines, the ſpices, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and merchandiſes, that were in their lower warehouſes. This inundation began (as I ſaid) on tueſday at night the 19. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the day limitted for the Kings departing from the confines of the Siegneurie, as likewiſe notwithſtanding he did. A thing which bred a verie ſtraunge amazement among the men in thoſe parts, who held diuers opinions of this accident, and almoſt all aſſured themſelues, that the preſence of this holy King, was a wonderfull preſeruation to the citie.</p>
                  <p>All matters concerning this Prince, are accommpanied with extraordinarie ſignes from heauen.
