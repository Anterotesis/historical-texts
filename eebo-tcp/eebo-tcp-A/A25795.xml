            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MAny will expect, that I will speak of many
things, and according to their several <hi>Opinions</hi>
and <hi>Dispositions,</hi> so will bee their expectations
from mee, and constructions of mee, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to disappoint many, for I came not either to justifie
my self, but the Lord, <hi>who is holy in all his waies, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in all his works, holy and blessed is his Name;</hi>
               <unclear>neither</unclear>
come I to <hi>condemn</hi> others; I know many will expect
that I should speak against the hardness of the <hi>Sentence</hi>
pronounced against mee, but I will say nothing to it, I
bless the Lord, <hi>I pardon all men, as I desire to be pardoned of
the Lord my self; Let the will of the Lord bee done,</hi> that is all
that I desire. I hope that you will have more <hi>Charity</hi> to
mee now, than yee would have had at another time, since
I speak before the <unclear>Lord</unclear>, to whom I must give account
shortly. I know very well that my words have had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
weight with many, and that many have mistaken my
words; many have thought me a great enemy to those <hi>great
works</hi> that have of late been brought to pass<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But do not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55314:3"/>
mistake mee people, I speak it in the presence of the Lord.
I entred not upon the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> with any design
of <hi>advantage</hi> for my self, or <hi>prejudice</hi> to the King, or his
<hi>Government,</hi> as my <hi>Will</hi> (which was written in the year
1655<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then delivered to a friend in whose hands it
still remains) can show. As for those <hi>Calumnies</hi> which have
gone abroad of mee, I bless God I know them to bee no
more, and as I go to make a <hi>reckoning</hi> to my God, I am
free as to any of them concerning the Kings <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
I was real and cordial in my desires to bring the
King home, and in my indeavours for him, when hee was
at home, and I had no correspondence with his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Army, or any of them, the time His Majesty was in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> nor had I any accession to His late Majesties <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
by <hi>Counsel,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it, or any other manner of
way: This is a truth, as I shall answer to my Iudge; And
all the time H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Majesty was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I was still indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
his <hi>advantage,</hi> my conscience beareth mee witness
in it; <hi>That is for that;</hi> At this hee turned about, and said, <hi>I
hope Gentlemen yee will all remember this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess many looks on my <hi>Condition</hi> as a <hi>suffering-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
but I bless the Lord that <hi>hee that hath gone before mee
hath trod the Winepress of the Fathers wrath,</hi> by whose <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>
I hope that my sufferings shall not bee <hi>eternal.</hi> I bless
him that hath taken away the <hi>sting</hi> of my <hi>sufferings.</hi> I
may say my <hi>Charter</hi> was sealed this day; for the Lord
hath said to mee, <hi>Son bee of good chear, thy sins bee forgiven
thee:</hi> And so I hope my <hi>sufferings</hi> shall bee easie; and
yee know the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was made perfect through sufferings.</hi> I shall not
speak much to those things that I am <hi>condemned</hi> for, lest
I seem to <hi>condemn others;</hi> it is well known it is onely for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55314:3"/>
               <hi>Compliance,</hi> which is the <hi>Epidemical Fault</hi> of this Nation,
I wish the Lord may pardon them, I say no more. There
was an expression in my <hi>Submission</hi> presented to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
of the <hi>Contagion</hi> of the times, which may bee
mis-construed, as if I had intended thereby to lay <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
upon the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Reformation;</hi> but I declare I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no such thing, but it was onely in relation to the
<hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Failings</hi> of men, occasioned by the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi>
of the <hi>usurping Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I think there are <hi>three</hi> sorts of people
that take up much of the world, and this Nation: There
are 1. The <hi>openly prophane;</hi> and truly I may say though I
have been a prisoner, yet I have not had mine ears shut:
I hear assuredly that <hi>swearing, drinking</hi> and <hi>whoring</hi> were
never more common, and never more countenanced than
now; and truly if <hi>
                  <unclear>Magistrates</unclear>
               </hi> were here, I would say to
them if they lay forth their power for the glor<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fying of
God by the restra<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning of this they would <hi>fare the better,</hi> if
they continue in not restraining of it, they will <hi>fare the
worse;</hi> I say no more, but let either people shun <hi>prophanity,</hi>
or Magistrates restrain it, or assuredly the wrath of God
will follow on it.</p>
            <p>2. Others, they are not <hi>openly prophane,</hi> every one will
not allow that, but yet they are <hi>Gallioes</hi> in these matters, if
things go well as to their private interests, they care not
whether <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Chu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch</hi> of God <hi>sink</hi> or <hi>swim:</hi>
But what ever they think, God hath laid Engagements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Scotland,</hi> we are tyed by <hi>Covenant</hi> to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
those that were then unborn are ingaged <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o it, and in
our <hi>Baptisme</hi> we are ingaged to it; and it passes the power
of any under heaven to absolve a man from the <hi>Oath of God,</hi>
they deceive themselves, and it may be will deceive others
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55314:4"/>
that think other wayes. But I would caveat this; people
would be ready to take this as a kinde of <hi>instigation</hi> to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belion,</hi>
but they are very far in the wrong that think so and
tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty</hi> are not consistent; if any man se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
them, <hi>Religion</hi> is not to be blamed, but they: It is
the <hi>duty</hi> of every <hi>Christian</hi> to be <hi>Loyal,</hi> yet I think the <hi>order</hi>
of things is to be observed as well as their <hi>na<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he order
of <hi>Religion</hi> as well as the <hi>nature</hi> of it, <hi>Religion</hi> must not bee
the <hi>Cogboat</hi> but the <hi>Ship,</hi> God must have what is <hi>his</hi> as well
as <hi>Cesar</hi> what is <hi>his.</hi> And those are the best <hi>Subjects</hi> that
are the best <hi>Christians.</hi> And that I am looked on as a <hi>friend</hi>
to <hi>Reformation</hi> is my <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There are another sort that are <hi>truly godly,</hi> and to
those I must say, what I fear, and every one hath reason
to fear (it's good to fear evil) it is true that the Lord
may prevent it, but if hee do not, these <hi>times</hi> are like
to bee very <hi>sinning times,</hi> or very <hi>suffering times;</hi> and let
<hi>Christians</hi> make choice; there is a sad <hi>Dilemma</hi> in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
<hi>sin</hi> or <hi>suffer,</hi> and truly hee that will chuse the <hi>better
part,</hi> will chuse to <hi>suffer,</hi> others that will chuse to <hi>sin,</hi>
shall not escape <hi>suffering,</hi> they shall <hi>suffer,</hi> but it may be
not as I do here (turning him to the <hi>Maiden</hi> when hee
spake it) but worse, mine is but <hi>Temporal,</hi> theirs shall be
<hi>Eternal,</hi> when I shall bee <hi>singing,</hi> they shall be <hi>howling;</hi>
bewa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e therefore of <hi>sin,</hi> what ever yee beware of, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in such times. Yet I cannot say of my own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the Lord in this providence <unclear>hath</unclear> minded <hi>mercy</hi>
to mee, even in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if I had been more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
dealt with, I fear I might have been overcome
with tentations, as many others are, and I fear many
more will bee, and so should have gone out of the world,
with a more polluted <hi>Conscience,</hi> than through the <hi>Mercy</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55314:4"/>
God now I have; and hence my <hi>Condition</hi> is such now,
as when I am gone, will bee seen not to have been such
as many imagined. It is fit God take mee away before
I fall in those <hi>Tentations,</hi> that I see others are <hi>fallen</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and I fear many others will <hi>fall,</hi> I wish the Lord
may prevent it. Yet blessed bee his Name that I am
kept both from present <hi>evils,</hi> and <hi>evils</hi> to come.</p>
            <p>Some will expect that I will <hi>Regrate</hi> my own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi>
but truly I neither <hi>grudge</hi> nor <hi>repine,</hi> nor desire I
any <hi>Revenge.</hi> And I declare I do not <hi>repent</hi> my going to
<hi>London,</hi> for I had alwaies rather have <hi>suffered</hi> any thing,
than lye under such <hi>Reproaches</hi> as I did. I desire not that
the Lord should <hi>Iudge</hi> any man, nor do I <hi>Iudge</hi> any but
my self; I wish that as the Lord hath <hi>
                  <unclear>pardoned</unclear>
               </hi> mee, so
may hee <hi>pardon</hi> them for <hi>this</hi> and <hi>other things,</hi> and that
what they have done to mee may never meet them in
their <hi>Accompts.</hi> I have no more to say, but to beg the
Lord that since I go <hi>away,</hi> hee may bless them that stay
behinde.</p>
            <p>His last words immediately before he laid his
head upon the Block were the vindication of his
Innocency from that horrid Crime of the Kings
Murder in these words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I desire you</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>and all that hear me again
to take notice, and remember that now when I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
on</hi> Eternity, <hi>and am to appear before my</hi> Iudge,
