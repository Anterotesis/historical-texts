            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is <hi>GOD Himſelf</hi> who is the ſubſtantial Object of <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> Though we would not erre with them, who too much diſhonour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie Creatures, leſt we reflect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour on the Creator, and tempt Men to think baſely of the Author, as we do of the Work; yet we muſt ſay that compared with Him, they are <hi>a very little thing,</hi> yea <hi>as nothing,</hi> yea <hi>leſs than nothing,</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> Iſa. 40. 15, 17. And what they are, they are in that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on him and relation to him, without which they would be
<pb facs="tcp:58941:5"/>
ſtrictly <hi>nothing:</hi> Though the old Philoſophers did many of them think that ſo fair a Structure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be eſteemed, as <hi>Corpus Deitatis;</hi> yet Chriſtians are more wiſe and reverent than to approve the <hi>more modeſt</hi> aſſertion of <hi>them,</hi> who call it <hi>Veſtimentum numinis,</hi> or <hi>Accidentia Divina:</hi> yet the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an <hi>Accident</hi> is thus far apt, to tell us that all the Creature's <hi>being,</hi> is in its <hi>dependence</hi> on the <hi>Creator;</hi> and that it is <hi>nothing</hi> but what it is <hi>in him: For of him, and through him, and to him are all things,</hi> Rom? 11. 36. And <hi>in him we live, and move, and be,</hi> Act. 17. 28. To think therefore or treat of any Creatures, abſtracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leaving out the knowledge of the Creator, is not properly to <hi>know,</hi> but to <hi>dote</hi> or <hi>erre:</hi> He that does annihilate them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their very being, doth not <hi>know</hi> it, nor cannot <hi>teach</hi> it. Such fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries are all the buſieſt and moſt learned enquiries of thoſe Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,

who ſeparate Philoſophy from Theology, and think they have done fairly when they have once confeſt that God gave the World a <hi>being</hi> and <hi>firſt motion:</hi> as if he had then left it to its ſelf, or made it a ſeparate ſelf-ſubſiſting thing; or as if they might then proceed to treat of it, without any further thoughts, or mention of that God who is <hi>more</hi> to it than a <hi>Soul;</hi> and without whom it cannot be truly defined, no more than the <hi>beams</hi> without mentioning the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Accidents</hi> without the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the true <hi>Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> doth ſee GOD <hi>as all in all,</hi> in <hi>Phyſicks;</hi> ſo doth the true <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt</hi> in <hi>Ethicks.</hi> Well may our <hi>Religious Science</hi> be called <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> becauſe GOD is in it, the <hi>beginning,</hi> the <hi>middle,</hi> and <hi>the end;</hi> the <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it, and <hi>all in all.</hi> And as this is true of the <hi>Theory,</hi> it is as true of the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:</hi> (For it is one and the ſame

               <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Theology,</hi> which is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in the <hi>three conſtitutive faculties</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, as <hi>Scientia affectiva practica</hi>) It is a very apt and inſtructing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which is uſed. Heb. 4. 13. <hi>All things are naked, and opened to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi> It is moſt intimately pertinent to our Religion, to know GOD, as <hi>Him with whom we have to do,</hi> and to know <hi>how much</hi> we have <hi>to do with him!</hi> to know that we have <hi>more to do with him,</hi> than with all the <hi>Creatures</hi> in the World: Yea, that we have <hi>nothing to do</hi> with <hi>any Creature,</hi> but as <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>with him,</hi> and <hi>for him;</hi> and as that which is <hi>leſs</hi> than an <hi>Accident</hi> of GOD; That we have <hi>nothing to do</hi> with <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels, high</hi> or <hi>low, rich</hi> or <hi>poor, animate</hi> or <hi>inanimate,</hi> no not <hi>our ſelves,</hi> as <hi>ſeparate</hi> from God, or from his preſence, intereſt, and will; nor as co-ordinate (in <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>) with him; but only as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb facs="tcp:58941:6"/>
dependent on him, and ſubordinate, and ſubſervient to him: And that we have nothing to do in the World, but his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the fulfilling of his will: And to know how <hi>Great,</hi> and of what unſpeakable importance, our Daily and Hourly buſineſs is, in which we <hi>have to do with God.</hi> This will firſt fix us in the <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> part of our Religion, which is properly called GODLINESS; And then it will moſt effectually accompliſh the <hi>Negative</hi> part; in calling off our minds from every Idol, and killing our bruitiſh and unchaſt affections. While our hearts are ſeriouſly taken up with GOD, the Creature will ſeem leſs to us comparatively, than a Fly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a City, or an Atome to a Kingdom, or a Candle to the Sun. <hi>Overvaluing,</hi> and <hi>overloving,</hi> and <hi>overdoing</hi> for the World, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sign of our <hi>undervaluing,</hi> and <hi>underloving,</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> of GOD. For if GOD have <hi>his due,</hi> he
<pb facs="tcp:58941:7"/>
will have <hi>all:</hi> And if he had <hi>all,</hi> the World, and all things in it would have <hi>none;</hi> unleſs as it is ſent to GOD by <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo excellent is this converſe with GOD, that the nature of it may much convince us, that <hi>GRACE</hi> and <hi>GLORY</hi> are but as the <hi>Seed</hi> and the <hi>Plant,</hi> as <hi>infancy</hi> and <hi>manhood;</hi> and that <hi>Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> is begun on Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. One being but the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love,</hi> and the other of <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoying-love;</hi> and both being the <hi>Dwelling of the Soul in GOD,</hi> in ſeveral <hi>manners</hi> and <hi>degrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not wonder therefore, if the Reverend Author of this Treatiſe (my deſervedly-much valued and honoured Friend, and long a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Servant of Chriſt,) have choſen this Subject for his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and for his Readers benefit. For however perhaps the burning of the City, and the removal of
<pb facs="tcp:58941:7"/>
many Miniſters from their ſetled ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, might be ſome <hi>occaſion</hi> of his choice; yet the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no doubt, was the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of this truth, as ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the greateſt edification of Mens ſouls.</p>
            <p>I foreſee, that there are ſome that will ſay, that this running of Allegories ſo far, doth carry away the mind from the juſt concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the thing, and hinder, and delude the underſtanding, by drawing it into the by-paths of improper notions; and is the way of injudicious ſuperficial Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And I confeſs it is ſo in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Caſes: As 1. When meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors are choſen <hi>needleſly,</hi> inſtead of more plain ſignificant termes. 2. And when they are choſen <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly,</hi> and are not fitted to the matter ſignified. 3. When they are inſiſted on too far, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the proper notions, and tend indeed to ſeduce and carry away the mind. 4. When they
<pb facs="tcp:58941:8"/>
are run up ſo high, as to infer any falſe concluſions, or to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any groundleſs confectaries or applications. But if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the Allegory inſiſted on in this Treatiſe, you will have better thoughts and cenſures of it, upon theſe reaſons following.</p>
            <p>1. It is not about a <hi>created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> where we have ſtore of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notions; but about the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and our communion with Him, where we muſt have improper thoughts, and borrowed notions, or none at all: It is a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> whether one ſyllable <hi>Ens</hi> be ſpoken <hi>Univocally</hi> of GOD and of the Creatures? But that no other word is ſpoken <hi>Univocally</hi> of them, they are agreed. And the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> do not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon maintain, that <hi>Analogical At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution</hi> is not a third member, betwixt <hi>Univocal</hi> and <hi>Equivocal,</hi> but is truly <hi>Equivocal,</hi> as <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58941:8"/>
are. Talk not then againſt all Allegorical expreſſions about God, till you would forbid Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to talk of <hi>God at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Note, that it is not ſo much the <hi>matter</hi> of our <hi>communion</hi> with GOD, as the <hi>manner</hi> of it, which the Allegory is uſed to expreſs. For the <hi>matter</hi> on our part, I here tell you once for all, that it is not any Fryar - like, fanatical, notion, of <hi>deification</hi> by <hi>an indwelling in GOD,</hi> nor <hi>Andr.

               <pb facs="tcp:58941:9"/>
               <hi>Conſtancy, Familiarneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Of theſe.</p>
            <p>3. And conſider how <hi>apt</hi> and <hi>ſignificant</hi> it is: How fitly it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the <hi>Habits</hi> of Grace, the Souls <hi>fidelity,</hi> the <hi>courſe</hi> of duty, the <hi>contents</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> of a Believer in his GOD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is here fully opened to you: And how fitly it differenceth a Chriſtian indeed, (who <hi>dwelleth habitually,</hi> and <hi>devotedly</hi> in GOD) from all ſorts of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> who do but complement with him as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or ſtep aſide out of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, to ſpeak now and then with him, either in <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or in their <hi>extremity;</hi> and caſt an Eye towards him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the by. And that it is not a <hi>barren</hi> notion, but moſt <hi>practical,</hi> directing the thoughts of a Chriſtian to a conſtant, ſpiritual, holy life; yea, that it is a very <hi>Conſolatory</hi> notion, ſpeaking the beginning of Heaven on Earth,
<pb facs="tcp:58941:9"/>
and ſuited both to Grace and Glory, and apt to lead up our Deſires to the everlaſting Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which we have ſcarce a more familiar conception of, than by <hi>Dwelling with GOD!</hi> And who would not be at <hi>Home,</hi> that hath ſuch a <hi>Home</hi> prepared for him, when once <hi>He is</hi> prepared for it?</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly conſider, that it is a Scripture metaphore; yea, frequently there uſed: And what words of Scripture can ſeem more important to us, than 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16? <hi>GOD is Love; and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Love, dwelleth in GOD, and GOD in Him.</hi> And V. 15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of GOD, God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Him, and He in GOD.</hi> And V. 12. <hi>If we love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God dwelleth in Us, and his Love is perfected in Us.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. <hi>He that keepeth his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments dwelleth in Him, and He in</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58941:10"/>
               <hi>Him.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16. <hi>For ye are the Temple of the living GOD; As GOD hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their GOD, and they ſhall be my People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is another ſort that I foreſee will be offended, becauſe the Author hath ſaid ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the <hi>publick Aſſemblies</hi> and <hi>Worſhip, as now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,</hi> ſeeing he is ſilenced for Non-conformity Himſelf.</p>
            <p>To theſe I ſhall only ſay: 1. Why do they not wonder as much at the old Non-conformiſts, <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham, Paget, Brightman, Bradſhaw, Ball,</hi> with many more; who ſaid much more againſt ſeparation long ago?</p>
            <p>2. Conſider that the Author is an ancient experienced Divine, who hath lived to ſee the fruits of all extreams; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb facs="tcp:58941:10"/>
what the <hi>Love-killing</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating Spirit</hi> hath done in theſe Kingdoms theſe Thirty Years; He hath been the Tutor and Father of more faithful <hi>Teachers</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> than many other worthy <hi>Paſtors,</hi> have been of converted ſerious Chriſtians: And if the young unexperienced cenſures, will but ſtay till they come to his age and experience, and to half his Learning, Wiſdom, and Grace, and till they have done God's <hi>Church</hi> but the twentieth part of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that he hath done, it's like they will be themſelves of the ſame mind that he is. But I could wiſh for their own ſakes, they would not do by him, as they do by Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> who having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Book againſt Separation, which none of them can <hi>confute</hi> with truth and reaſon, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and confidently affirm that he <hi>conformeth,</hi> and then caſt by his Book through prejudice; and
<pb facs="tcp:58941:11"/>
few that I hear of, who moſt need it, do read it: Though he is ſo far from Miniſterial Conformity, that in the Epiſtle to that Book he ſtill declareth his old opinion againſt Infant Baptiſm. <hi>Partiality</hi> is a forfeiture of truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly ſhuts the Door againſt it. It will ſuffer Men to receive no inſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from thoſe that differ from them: And thoſe that differ not can ſcarce inſtruct them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Opinions are but the ſame, which they hold already. Alas, then what will become of the underſtandings of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? wherein there are ſo few, that are not in one Faction or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, poſſeſt with <hi>partiality</hi> and unreaſonable prejudice againſt the reſt!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> the way to eſcape this Soul-perverting Sin and miſery, is, that which this Treatiſe doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee in; even to <hi>dwell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58941:11"/>
               <hi>with GOD,</hi> who is the Original <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and in whom all wiſe and holy Souls, are united, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in delightful Harmony; And are no further divided, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant, contentious, uncharitable, than they depart from GOD! And to retire more in mind, from this dark, perverſe, confuſed World; which to the <hi>beſt</hi> is a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> though the way to Reſt; and to the <hi>Worldlings</hi> is a place of ſnares and ſin, a <hi>Babel,</hi> and a <hi>Bedlam</hi> Habitation, where the Prince of the Powers of the Aire, who ruleth in the Children of diſobedience, is buſily and ſucceſsfully fitting Souls, for a ſadder ſtate. Watch and pray, that thou maiſt be ſaved from <hi>this preſent evil World;</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, and above all thine Enemies, from thy <hi>Self!</hi> Happy is the Man whoſe <hi>Selfiſhneſs, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Luſt,</hi> do not ſubvert

and decent: Among and above many other things an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or reſting place for their bodies is needful to their outward happineſs, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be miſerable, whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things they may enjoy. Herein our bleſſed Saviour ſeems to prefer the felicity of Foxes and Fowles before his own. <hi>The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Aire</hi>

            <p>This meat and drink ſurpaſſeth all other upon a manifold account. 1.

               <hi>grace for grace;</hi> Not a fulneſs of abundance only, but a fulneſs of redundance alſo: out of which a ſufficient portion is diſtributed to every of his Members. There can be no want in him, where <hi>Riches</hi>

               <hi>not for the Meat which periſheth, but for that Meat which endureth to everlaſting life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto you.</hi> What is that? <hi>The Bread that I will give is my Fleſh. If any Man eat of this</hi>

            <p>This Meat and Drink is every Day received by this whole Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, not after a corporal and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner, (as thoſe Capernaites conceived Chriſts meaning. <hi>How can this Man give us his Fleſh to</hi>

He will not ſuffer any to dwell in him, who freely do not ſuffer him to dwell in them, in all the Scriptures we quoted out of the Apoſtle <hi>John's</hi> firſt Epiſtle, Characterizing them that dwell in God. We finde the<note place="margin">1 John 3 24.</note> dwelling to be mutual. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">4. 13.</note> you deſire to dwell in God, ſerve his deſire, which is, that he<note place="margin">15. 16.</note> may enter and dwell in you, in

your whole Man, in all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your ſouls, mind, will, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, memory and conſcience, and in all the ſenſes and members of your Bodies, Eyes, Ears, Mouths, Hands, Feet. But eſpecially he craves the heart, <hi>My Son give me</hi>

               <hi>Heads O ye Gates, and be ye lift up O ye everlaſting Doors, that the King of Glory may come in.</hi> Mens hearts are compared to Trap-doors, the lifting them up is the opening of them.

Now<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 10.</note> becauſe it is not every heart, that is fit to entertain God. <hi>The heart of the Wicked is little worth.</hi> The Query will be, what manner of heart it is, that God is willing and deſirous to dwell in. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reſolves the Query, <hi>It is an</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 19.</note> 
               <hi>honeſt and good heart.</hi> For only ſuch a heart is good ſoyle, fit for the good Seed of the Word to fall into, and God comes into the heart with his Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is an honeſt heart, and what makes it ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is an honeſt heart,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 21.</note> 
               <hi>That provides for things comely before God and Men.</hi> It was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſaid of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>Moſes: Go thou neer, and hear</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 27.</note> 
               <hi>all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it, and do it. They have well ſaid,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>all that they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but O that there were ſuch an</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:58941:101"/>
               <hi>heart in them, that they would fear me.</hi> The fear of God is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal grace that makes the heart honeſt. And then a Man fears God when, diſtruſtful of his own inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to do any thing that God requires, he is ſtudious and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give up himſelf to Chriſt, to be taught of him, and enabled by him to do all the will of God.</p>
            <p>A good heart is deſcribed, and<note place="margin">Acts 10. 33.</note> ſet forth in Scripture, by ſundry<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 8.</note> Names and Epithites; namely, new, broken, ſingle, whole, pure, perfect. And although it be true, that he that hath one of theſe, in truth, hath all, they are all one; Yet becauſe each of them requires a ſeveral notion to open it, and becauſe ſome can better diſcern of one, than of another, it will be needful to ſpeak a word or two to each of them.<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That is a New heart which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a new ſpirit; that is to ſay, new diſpoſitions, inclinations,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58941:101"/>
and habits; It's called new, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's oppoſed to the old ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that of the World, and of the Devil, who by breathing on Men makes them go an end into old courſes; And becauſe its ever freſh and green, and comfortable to them that have it.</p>
            <p>That is a Broken heart, which is<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> ſmitten and pierced with remorſe<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4, 5.</note> for ſin, broken down and brought low, all high thoughts laid flat<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 3, 8.</note> and level, Broken off from the<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 3.</note> wayes of ſin and ſtubborneſs in purſuit of thoſe wayes, Broken up as fallow ground, made ſoft, and tender, as <hi>Joſiahs</hi> was.</p>
            <p>That's an open heart, which is enlightned to ſee our eſtate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 14.</note> and bewail it; And to ſee comfort in Chriſt, and rejoyce in it; To have it alſo enlarged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God's faithful Miniſters, as <hi>Lydia</hi>'s was towards <hi>Paul,</hi> and his fellow-labourers, who conſtrained them to come into her Houſe, and abide there; as alſo to run the<note place="margin">Pſal 119 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

way of God's Commandments.</p>
            <p>A Single heart is oppoſed to eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 22. 2 Cor. 1. 12. &amp; 2. 17. Pſal. 12. 2.</note> and to carnal wiſdom, and to double mindedneſs, and to guile.</p>
            <p>A Whole heart is a willing heart;<note place="margin">John 1. 47. Pſal. 110. 3. Jer. 17. 5. Hoſ. 10. 2. Jer. 5. 23.</note> when we are willing to a thing, (we uſe to ſay with all our hearts;) It's oppoſed to a heart withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, and to a heart divided, willing to lay hold on God, and the World too, and that fulfilleth not to walk after God.</p>
            <p>That heart is pure, that ſuffers no ſin to abide in it, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance. It being both againſt<note place="margin">1 John 3. 3.</note> the judgment and will, and when after falling into ſin, there is a ſpeedy riſing again with ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring.</p>
            <p>1. A Perfect heart includes inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and uprightneſs. The heart is then intire, when it is ſanctified throughout, and when there is a ſtudy and deſire to attain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees, and a readineſs to do all whatſoever God calls
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58941:102"/>
for, and a conſtant holding unto God, <hi>Following hard after him,</hi> Keeping race with him. And it is then upright, when it is ſolid and true, great, juſt; and when it is led by a right rule, and aimes at a right end.</p>
            <p>Such a heart as this God loves and dwells in, and if you provide ſuch a dwelling place for God, he will be your dwelling place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But is all this, or any of this, in the power of meer natural Men; Such as you have been all this while perſwading and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to do? Is it not ſeverally taught and held, that no Man can do any thing to help forward, or further his own converſion? Is it not a truth that no natural Man hath any deſire of grace, or of the means of grace, never thinks of it, becauſe he is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and how can a dead Man deſire Life? or uſe any means to attain it? Nor when God by his Word makes offer of his grace, can he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58941:103"/>
perceive it? Nor when he doth by God's Word and Spirit, beginning to enlighten him in ſome meaſure to perceive it, is he able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it? Becauſe wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity againſt God, and becauſe he is under the power of Satan? And is not the Religion of<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> convinced of groſs error for teaching that the natural man, is able both by his free-will to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> himſelf for grace, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of grace when it is offered: Yea to deſire it, like the Man that lay in the way to <hi>Jericho</hi> half<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 5.</note> dead; yea, and to do ſome good works.</p>
            <p>If all this were true, yet it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not; but that God's Miniſters may and ought to call upon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men, to do what they can to reach forth their utmoſt towards grace, for the obtaining of it. <hi>Hear ye deaf, and look ye blind, that ye</hi>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58941:103"/>
for not doing what they could. <hi>Ye Hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the Skie, and how is it that ye cannot diſcern this time?</hi> Yea, and why even of your ſelves (That is, your own Conſcience dictates to you ſo many proofs of God's<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 56, 57.</note> truth, and God's Kingdom being ſet forth ſo clearly unto you, by ſo many marks and tokens:) <hi>Judge ye not what is right?</hi> that is to ſay, that I am the <hi>Meſſias</hi> you have ſo long looked for. They had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore power to judge of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Grace, and God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in the Verſes following, they are told they neglected the time of God's patience. It would befall them as a Debtor, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf to be impriſoned, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wearying out his <hi>Creditor,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhould finde no more grace or pardon at his hands. <hi>Seek</hi>

            <p>Nor ought Nature to be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-low, Grace is Nature's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58941:104"/>
what does it but repair the decayes of Nature? Nature is the matter, and Grace the Forme of God's Kingdom, both in Earth and Heaven. It Figures and Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Nature to the Image of God. Moreover, this is the way of God's exhibiting grace, there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Natures concurrence. Firſt, this muſt precede, as we are taught to pray for our daily bread, before forgiveneſs of ſins. God cannot ſave an unwilling Man, the will being uncapable of force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and all poſſibilities divine are carried on in an ordinary way of Man's induſtry; who muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carry on himſelf as far as he can: which whoſo doth not, hath no ground to expect common grace. He that doth, may expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſupernaturals common; And he that abides with God in theſe, may probably expect ſupernaturals ſpecial.</p>

And this is that which God's Miniſters are bound to preſs upon Men, that are in a natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to do matter of duty, to ſet themſelves as objects of the ſpirit of God, attending upon Divine Ordinances. As a neglected Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſets himſelf in the Kings ſight, ſtanding and waiting where he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually paſſeth; and there humbly faces him. It is obſerved that the<note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 12.</note> Spirits out-goings are only upon ſuch as face him. He goes right on, and turns not as he goes. They muſt do as <hi>Eſther</hi> did, who eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf as lovely as ſhe could

a Man makes himſelf an object of the grace Life: a handle for the Spirit to lay hold upon, when he harps upon the ſtring of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: Cries out of his ſin, implores mercy, and waits for grace in the uſe of means. And it is not only poſſible that he may be tranſlated out of the ſtate of nature into the ſtate of grace, but probable he ſhall be ſo.

and you are in the number of thoſe thrice happy People, whoſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> is. With<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> whom we are next to deal.</p>
            <p>And firſt with thoſe whoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,<note place="margin">

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Lord is theirs, that he dwells in them, and they in him: but many of them know not that they have this knowledge, and ſome of them deny it; yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and conclude that they are out of God, and as far from him as Hell from Heaven. That it's poſſible for Men to know a thing, and not to know they know it, yea to deny that they know it, appears by theſe words of <hi>Thomas</hi> in the name of all his fellow Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to our Saviour, who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured

               <hi>they knew, and knew the way, Lord we know not whither thou goeſt, and how can we know the way?</hi> They knew both, but they knew not that they knew either. And that Men in the ſtate of Grace, and abiding in God, may be ſo far from any ſenſible and comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their intereſt in God, of his love and favour towards them, that they may ſeem to be aſſured of the contrary, apprehend him as their mortal Enemy, appeares by thoſe words of <hi>Job. He teareth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 16. 9, &amp; 13. 24.</note> 
               <hi>me in his wrath, who hateth me, Mine Enemy ſharpeneth his Eyes upon me. Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Grounds and Reaſons why many precious Souls have ſuch doubts and feares, and are apt to paſs ſuch a ſad concluſion againſt themſelves, that they are without God, are many. Two of them, we will mention and anſwer: in which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58941:110"/>
the reſt are included and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. They never entered in by the Door, this they make out, and put it on thus. No Man can dwell<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note> in God, in whoſe heart Chriſt dwels not by faith, coming to Chriſt and believing in him are all one. <hi>He</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 6. 35.</note> 
               <hi>that cometh unto me, ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> No Man is called to come to Chriſt, that is not throughly and truly humbled for ſin. The Univerſal is reſtrained,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You that labour in the Souls and Conſciences, by a lively feeling of your ſins, and terrour of God's Judgments due unto you for them. Such are intended, who being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of their ſins, and Satans Yoak, by panting and groaning under it. Now they never had any ſuch deep humiliation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have reaſon to queſtion Chriſt's dwelling in them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58941:110"/>
theirs in God, they never had this preparatory work.</p>
            <p>To theſe Objections againſt themſelves, and the work of God's Grace in them, I have theſe things to ſay. 1. By way of Conceſſion, that ſound humiliation ariſing from the ſight and ſenſe of ſin, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Divine wrath is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to qualifie Men for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt. <hi>They that be whole,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>need not the Phyſician, but they that be ſick. I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> (ſenſible Heart-ſmitten, affrighted, Soul afflicted-ſinners.) <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſeek,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Them who ſee and feel themſelves quite undone and loſt, by reaſon of their ſins. <hi>The Lord hath anointed me</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 61. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>to preach good tidings unto the meek. He hath ſent me to binde up the broken hearted, to Proclaim liberty to the Captives; The open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Priſon to them that are bound, to comfort them that mourn.</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:58941:111"/>
Till Men be thus humbled, they<note place="margin">Numb. 21. 9.</note> will not care to come to Chriſt, nor have deſire of him, nor prize him, and be willing to part with<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 7, 8.</note> any thing for him. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſt he was willing to part with all to win him, counted all loſs and dung for him. What alone, was this <hi>Paul?</hi> one that had ſo deep a ſenſe of his ſins, that he counted himſelf the chiefeſt ſinner in the World. No Man can believe the Goſpel, till the Law hath wrought Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in him, the foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a deep ſenſe and ſorrow for ſin; Nor will Men hold Chriſt with any retentiveneſs, if this were not firſt wrought in them.</p>
            <p>If Men be not weary of Sathans Yoak, they will ſoon be weary of Chriſts. Want of humiliation is<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20. 7. 9. Gal. 3. 10, 24.</note> the cauſe of all Apoſtacy. And therefore there is great need that Miniſters preach and preſs the Law to bring Men to a ſight and ſenſe of their ſins. Which is ſo far forth a bleſſing, as it is neceſſary to drive
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58941:111"/>
us to Chriſt. To ſhew us how wretched we are without him, to make us pant and groan, and mourn after him. They erre, that hold that Men are fit enough without any ſuch legal terrors preceding, that never felt their hearts broken, to come to Chriſt to dwell in God. As there is no natural birth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome precedent pains of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in the Mother: So neither is there any ſpiritual birth, without ſome ſuch in the Child. God hath ever uſed to take this courſe to caſt down ſinners, to lay them as low as Hell, convincing them of their dark and damned condition, giving them the ſpirit of bondage<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 8, 10.</note> to fear the Vengeance of Eternal Fire due to them, and then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37. 9. 6. 16. 29.</note> and comfort them; And ſo by the Suburbs of Hell, to bring them to Heaven. Thus he dealt<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> with our firſt Parents, and all along<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 11, 12.</note> downward to this Day. As the great and ſtrong Wind renting the Mountains, breaking in pieces the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58941:112"/>
Rocks, and the Earth-quake, and<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 4—7.</note> Fire went before the ſtill ſmall Voice; And the noiſe and ſhaking<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 3.</note> before the Reſurrection of the dry bones; and a Voice from Heaven, as the Voice of many Waters, and<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 3. Hoſ. 12. 10.</note> as the Voice of a great Thunder, more terrifying and diſtinct, before the Voice of Harpers, harping with their Harps; and as plowing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes ſowing, and the Needle the Thread, and melting the Mettle before the caſting of it into a new form: So muſt humiliation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede regeneration. Woe to them that being laden with many ſins, feel them light as a Graſs-hopper, that have ſworn a thouſand Oaths in their ordinary diſcourſe, have told a thouſand lies in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary jeſting, officious, pernicious, committed prodigious filthineſs frequently with themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Have made the Lord's days the Devil's, by going their own wayes, Finding their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſpeaking their own words, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58941:112"/>

Theſe Men ſhall finde one<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> Day every of their ſins, which they feel ſo light, to be heavier than a Mountain of Lead; when they ſhall<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 16.</note> call to the Mountains to fall on<note place="margin">Rev. 18. 7.</note> them, and the Hills to cover them, and the more pleaſure they have felt in any ſin, the more ſorrow and torment ſhall be given them. <hi>Woe unto you that laugh now, for</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 25. 6. 25.</note> 
               <hi>ye ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, but now thou art tormented. Every idle, and much more, every evil word ſhall be an unſufferable load upon their Conſciences to all Eternity.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58941:113"/>
Unleſs voluntary humiliation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come into that place of torments, prevent it. As for you<note place="margin">Mark 10. 49.</note> that feel your ſins preſſing you as low as Hell, take comfort in this, that you are in the way to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.<note place="margin">Zech. 12. 10.</note> And I may ſay unto you, as the People to the blind Man, be of good comfort, Chriſt calleth thee. There is a fountain opened<note place="margin">With 13. 1.</note> for ſin, and for uncleanneſs, for them that can mourn over him, whom they have pierced.</p>
            <p>2. By way of Correction, though all before Converſion are humbled, yet all are not ſo in a like degree. They that have been notorious wicked livers. Such as <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 33. 12.</note> was, muſt be humbled greatly, as he was. So they that killed the Lord of Life were punctually pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. So the Jaylor, and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and thoſe whom God means to beſtow more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts upon, or to employ in great buſineſs for him, he humbleth deeply. Others that have been
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58941:113"/>
civilly educated, never guilty of any hainous, hideous crimes, but alway lived unblameable moral lives; Theſe have the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation dropt inſenſibly into them, never feel ſuch pangs, and terrors, and heart-breaks; nor know the time when God began to work upon them. Theſe fearful doubting Chriſtians, that I am dealing with, may, and ought to take comfort in this, that they cannot deny, but that they have been truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled though in a lower degree. It being the truth, and not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that warrants ſinners to come to Chriſt, and qualifie them for faith in him. He ſaith not, come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden in ſuch a degree. But all that labour, and are heavy laden in a true degree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the loweſt degree of true Humiliation?</p>

As when a Man is extream poor, and knows himſelf to be ſo, having never a Penny in all the World, and owes a very great Summe, and that to ſuch a one as will not abate one farthing of the Debt, but exact the whole; and for default of payment will caſt him into Priſon, there to lye and rot; nor has he a friend in all the World to help him, only he hears of a rich Man that is able to pay all he owes, who hath diſcharged the Debts of many in his caſe, but alaſs he dares not adventure for a good while, to go and ſpeak with him, becauſe he hath no intereſt in him. In this caſe he is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly caſt down, not knowing what to do, yet at laſt neceſſity forcing,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58941:114"/>
he is reſolved to go to him, and ſeek ſupply from him, relying wholly upon his goodneſs, having heard how mercifully he hath dealt with all that have ſo done.</p>
            <p>Is not this thy caſe, poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent Chriſtian? Haſt thou not ſeen thy Soul totally empty of Grace, yet indebted to God Ten Thouſand Talents, whoſe Juſtice thou knoweſt will exact the utmoſt Mite? do'ſt not thou ſee fulneſs in Chriſt, and all-ſufficiency, that he is able to ſave them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that come unto God by him, to diſcharge their debt, were it ten thouſand times greater? Though thou did'ſt not dare to go to him for a while, yet at laſt did'ſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, being encouraged by what others in as bad a condition have found, and by ſundry gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and promiſes, excluding none that have an heart to come. Upon which promiſes thou do'ſt in great humility roll thy Soul, and reſolveſt therein to reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:58941:115"/>Thus the Prodigal ſaw, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 14, 22.</note> in himſelf knew there was fulneſs in his Fathers Houſe, was moved to go to him, truſting in his gracious diſpoſition.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the ſignes of a poor Beggar. He is full of complaints to ſuch as can relieve him, full of requeſts. No need to teach him rhetorick, Induſtrious to get main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; out he will, though the Law be againſt it. The Belly hath no Eares. If he be blind, he will get ſome to lead him; if lame, he will get a Crutch to uphold him.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58941:115"/>
He is more-over meek, patiently bearing checks and reproaches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtay his leiſure of whom he begs, and expects an Almes, full of obſervance alſo towards him, ready to obey his commands, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at his frownes, and greatly thankful, if he give him but a Crumb. And if he hath offended, is at no reſt till his anger againſt him be appeaſed, and his favour and good will regained. Thou canſt not but finde all theſe ſignes in thy ſelf, in reference unto God, and therefore mayeſt take comfort in thy poverty. Add unto this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſure evidence of true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; namely, thou eſteemeſt ſin the greateſt evil, and Jeſus Chriſt the greateſt good: put na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Chriſt in one Scale, and all the pomp and glory of the World in the other, and whether of theſe would weigh the moſt, in thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and valuation?</p>

comfort in them, that they deny there is any good in them, any good fruit brought forth by them; They believe themſelves, &amp; would have you believe ſo too. <hi>That their Vine is of the Vine of Sodom, and of the Fields of Gomorrah. Their Grapes are Grapes of Gall.

true foundation of life and grace. Or if they have brought forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fruit at any time materially good, the root, and manner, and end have been all naught, ſtark naught, worſe than naught. They never did any thing for God, in obedience, and out of love to him, or with an intent to honour and pleaſe him thereby.

For in ſo doing thou ſhalt commit two great evils, one againſt thy ſelf, in leaning upon a bruiſed Reed; for thine own Spirit may fail thee, and be overwhelmed, and thy heart may reproach thee; another againſt the Lord, making an Idol of that gift of his, which cannot be ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in without ſin.

            <p>Finally, give not credit to thy miſgiving heart, that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee thou haſt no aſſurance that God is thy Habitation: For thou haſt that degree of aſſurance which is neceſſary to the beeing of Grace; the loweſt degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, which is in every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, conſiſting in an application of adherence. Whereby the Soul of a penitent ſinner caſts it ſelf upon Jeſus Chriſt, with a reſolved humble recumbency, cleaving to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58941:123"/>
him, as the Ivy doth to the Oak, Eagle to the Carkaſs, goes out of it ſelf, renouncing its own Merits, and relying upon the Perſon and Merits of Chriſt, his active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience for forgiveneſs of ſins, and for Life and Salvation. This is the act of Faith, and every<note place="margin">John 1. 12.</note> one that thus receiveth him with an Obediential affiance knows that, and that through him dwelling in his heart, he hath his dwelling in God.</p>
            <p>You therefore, as yet that have not any comfortable aſſurance, ceaſe hence-forth to doubt and fear, and aſſay to joyn your ſelves with them that have; with whom we are next to deal, as <hi>Saul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to joyn himſelf to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Who will not at all, as they were awhile of him, be afraid of you: but receive you joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into their bleſſed Society.

For there are many, whom Satan and their own heart have deluded in this point, who are ſtrongly perſwaded that God is theirs, never doubted of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, make no queſtion, but the Lord is their Habitation, who entered not in by the Door, never received the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to fear, have no fear of offending God, no care to pleaſe him, but live in known ſin againſt the light of knowledge, and checks

            <p>The great benefit and neceſſity of this knowledge of aſſurance, may be motive ſufficient, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to give all diligence, in the uſe of all means, to preſerve, and increaſe it. You will be ſure to meet with temptations, to doubt of your intereſt in God, of your being in him, to queſtion whether you are Children of this Family. Chriſt himſelf was thus aſſaulted, though dwelling in the boſome of his Father. <hi>If thou be the Son of</hi>

drives you out of your Earthly; How full of Horror and Torment muſt your Hearts needs be! not knowing whether Heaven or Hell muſt be your dwelling place to all Eternity: Whereas, if you knew you were in the ſame Houſe with Chriſt, this would quiet your heart from all fear. As ſoon as Chriſt was come into the Ship, wherein the Diſciples were toſſed, the Wind preſently ceaſed. God through<note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 1.</note> Chriſt being your Habitation, your Light and Salvation, whom or what ſhould you fear, while you live, and when you die? <hi>God is our refuge,</hi>

               <hi>therefore we will not fear.</hi> And this, and this only is able to make and keep your hearts lightſome in every condition. Yea, knowledge of your abiding in God, will give a ſweet reliſh, as to every comfort: So to<note place="margin">Neh. 9. 25.</note> every croſs. I have loſt a dear Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Wife, Child, Friend, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable dwelling, but not my dear God.

Now the means to preſerve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe aſſurance, are the ſame wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you gained it. The outward are thoſe Ordinances of God, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of his holy Religion, which he hath ſanctified to this end, to bring us unto, and into himſelf, and to work in us a comfortable aſſurance thereof, eſpecially the Word, Sacrament, and Prayer.

               <hi>you, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you into his Kingdom of Glory:</hi> Of God, whoſe Livery you wear, whoſe Image you bear, of whoſe Houſhold you are.

you come to the end of your Journey, when you ſhall receive the end of your Faith, even the ſalvation of your Souls.</p>
            <p>The particular duties are many; in ſundry references both to things and Perſons. The firſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort we will dwell awhile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are Earthly Houſes and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Some whoſe dwelling Place the Lord is, have no Houſe on Earth, which they can call their own. Of thoſe that have, ſome are not ſuffered to live in them; and of them that have this liberty, ſome have very poor Houſes, with as poor Furniture, or other Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Others have convenient Dwellings, with an indifferent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate, and ſome few have gentile and ſtately Edifices, with riches and honour in abundance.</p>
            <p>1. To thoſe that have no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Houſes of their own, but are in a ſtate of beggary, or next to it, of whom ſome there are, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any, others had comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

ones, but have loſt them by Fire, or other caſualty, and ſo are for the preſent Houſleſs; to theſe I have this word of Exhortation. Let not your hearts be troubled.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe you are not without Fellowes and Companions, better than your ſelves, that are in the ſame Houſleſs condition: you have heard of ſome, <hi>Of whom the World was not worthy. Who wandred in</hi>

               <hi>Who had not where to lay his head.</hi> And you know how little it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled theſe holy Ones, that they were thus deſtitute, how well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their want, it being their Heavenly Fathers good pleaſure, that it ſhould be with them as it was. And how <hi>joyfully</hi> thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Hebrews took the ſpoyling of their Goods, knowing that they</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. You are not without a Houſe, which likes you beſt, and which you would not change for the beſt Houſe in the World: You hear God asking you, as <hi>Elkenah</hi> did <hi>Hannah,</hi> Am not I better to thee than Ten Sons? Had you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoy me, and do you not finde more comfort in me, than in Ten Houſes? And your Heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, truth Lord. And can it then be troubled? It may be ſaid of all Houſes, compared with this of yours, as it's ſaid of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are as <hi>nothing, leſs than</hi>

I think this one conſideration need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be ſuggeſted to them all, namely what power God's grace uſeth to have in all them that dwell in him, to take off their

For Religion bindeth Men and Women to be good Husbands, to ſeek to preſerve and encreaſe their eſtates that God hath given them; yet to make them willing to part with Houſes and Lands, and whatſoever is deareſt to them in the World, if they cannot hold them with Gods favour.

theſe Three Perſons, above innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable others; whom God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not chooſe to have their dwelling in him, and whom the Holy Ghoſt never wrought upon, to accept this, as he hath upon you. There are who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you otherwiſe, that is, that God the Father hath in his decree of Election done no more for you, than he hath for other Men, whom he from Eternity chooſe to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his happineſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, that is, if they would, as you have done, accept it offered to them, as it was to you: becauſe he fore-ſaw that you would receive Chriſt into your hearts by faith, he therfore determined to receive you into himſelf, to make you eternally happy; becauſe he fore-ſaw others would not, he therefore paſſed them by, and rejected them, and decreed to damn them; for he loves all Men equally, deſires and wills the Converſion and Salvation of every Man alike, unfeignedly and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58941:147"/>
that God the Son manifeſted in the World, who came in the World to ſave ſinners, dyed for all without difference, intended to give himſelf a ranſom for all, and every one equally; that the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Holy Ghoſt, and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation accompanying the Word, calling Men out of the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into the ſtate of Grace, is only by moral perſwaſion: and that it is in the power of every Mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, to accept or reject this grace; Theſe are plauſible, but pernicious Errors, againſt which I ſhall bring a few Scriptures, to antidote and fortifie your judgments, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them in the contrary truths.</p>
            <p>1. Touching the Decrees of God the Father's predeſtination, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes it abſolute, definite, and irrevocable: So as the number of the Elect can neither be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or diminiſhed. <hi>The Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

All that the Father<note place="margin">10. 28.</note> giveth me ſhall come to me; I know my Sheep, and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 23.</note> never periſh.

               <hi>faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> As for this only General Election of all, and every Man to ſalvation upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of faith, it is indeed (alone) no Election, becauſe it predeſtinates no Man actually, ſevers no one from another, writes no Name in the Book of Life, ordains no indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual to have his habitation in God, but only preſcribes the manner of coming to ſalvation, promiſcuouſly to all: neither by it is it decreed, who ſhall be ſaved, but what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men. Moreover, who holds this Univerſal Election alone, muſt alſo grant an Univerſal reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if God will only have all to be ſaved indefinitely, if they will believe, he willeth likewiſe that all ſhall be damned that do not believe; and ſo God neither chooſeth or refuſeth any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. Finally, this opinion makes Man's will to over-rule God's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Nor can you believe God's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

            <p>3. Touching the efficacy of God<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26.</note> the Holy Ghoſt working Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it is not to be reſtrained to moral perſwaſion only, which Man's will may embrace or reject, and finally reſiſt, is abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by that one Text, where the Apoſtle heaps up ſo many em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical and ſignificant words, on purpoſe to declare the power of the ſpirit of God, put forth in the converſion of a ſinner. That they<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 18.</note> may know what is the hyberbolical greatneſs of his power to us-ward,<note place="margin">19, 20.</note> who believe according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his mighty power, which he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58941:150"/>
wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead. To which many more may be added, and that it depends not upon Man's free-will, which can neither convert it ſelf, nor overcome divine grace, to put forth for his converſion. The Scripture every where plainly and expreſly teacheth, I mean, that grace which is given with an abſolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to convert. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 22. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.</p>

errour, eſpecially if Fundamental. The one from the nature of ſuch an errour, it is like a Canker or Gangreen, a Malady ſo contagious that it preſently ſpreads it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next Members, and ſo by degrees deſtroyes the whole Body; being once admitted into the ſoul, it will glide into it, to the total extinguiſhing of the ſpiritual life thereof: And having poſſeſſed it<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 19, 20.</note> ſelf in one of the Members of the Church, will ſpread over all the Body of it, if it be not withſtood in time.

Theſe are called Churches, and of theſe there are two ſorts, falſe and true, and your duty is to ſeparate from thoſe, and hold fellowſhip with theſe. Three things are required to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of true Churches.</p>
            <p>1. That the Word of God, and Doctrine of Salvation be truly

            <p>2. That there be Paſtors and Miniſters lawfully called, How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? pray the Lord of the Harveſt, that he will ſend ſorth Labourers into his Harveſt, Chriſt hath given his Miniſtry to his own Church.</p>

            <p>Hereby may be diſcerned, which are falſe Churches, and which true: The <hi>Roman</hi> Political Church, as the Conſtitution of it is falſe, and of Man's Invention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> They have the Apoſtles Creed, the Books of Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Baptiſme.</p>

A Thief may ſhew a true Man's Purſe, but that proves him not to be a true Man: and they overthrow
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58941:165"/>
inward Baptiſme, the life of that Sacrament, imputed righteouſneſs and holineſs, which in Gods Church muſt go together with the outward Element.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, there is the hidden Church of God mingled, as a little Wheat with much Chaff, as a little Gold with much Droſs. So that though the Church of God be where Anti-Chriſt ſitteth, yet the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is Head, is no Church of God; for there are no means there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, or preſerve ſpiritual life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we regard Doctrine or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak plainly, it is a part of the Univerſal Viſible Church of Chriſtians, ſo far as they profeſs Chriſtianity, &amp; acknowledge Chriſt their Head; but it is the Viſible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Trayterous Uſurpers, ſo far as they profeſs the <hi>Pope</hi> to be their Head: juſt as if a Traytor ſhould

From this Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of Harlots and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, no Spouſe of Chriſt, but a Strumpet, no Houſe of God, but an Habitation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, once indeed a famous Church, but now dead and buryed (and as is the Mother, ſo is the Daughters) God's People are bound to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

            <p>I know with whom I am deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Perſons that have a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table aſſurance that they dwell in God, and therefore are willing to hear any thing that may tend to the increaſe of their comfort, and unwilling to retain any errour in their judgments or practice, that may defile and diſhonour their dwelling place, or cauſe it to be evil ſpoken of by them that are without; whoſe mouthes you know your abſenting your ſelves from all the Solemn Aſſemblies, open wide to caſt a ſcandal upon your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as prophane, and upon that ſtrict profeſſion of walking preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the Rule of the written Word, which they think gives you no Warrant for your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58941:168"/>
from their Society in the ſervice of God: and my humble and earneſt requeſt to you is to lay aſide your prejudice, and examine by that good Word, whether your ſeparation be not ſinful.</p>
            <p>I ſhall preſume you will freely grant both, that it's neceſſary to Salvation, that a Man be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Gen 9. 27.</note> of the true Viſible Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Word you finde the profeſſion of the true Religion; yea, the very hope of Salvation,<note place="margin">Eſay 33. 24.</note> and joyning to the true Chruch, going together: and that ſo long<note place="margin">44. 5.</note> as God continueth the Doctrine of Salvation to a People, and his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip; ſo long he dwells<note place="margin">Lev. 26. 12.</note> among that People, and Salvation may be had there, and that no ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Pſal. 76. 2.</note> ſeparation may be made from thoſe Aſſemblies, where God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and where Men may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> to finde Salvation, though<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note> there may be many great corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both in Doctrine and Worſhip, in thoſe Aſſemblies. There were<note place="margin">James 1. 21.</note>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:58941:169"/>
ſo in the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in Chriſt's time, the Prieſts and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">John 6. 67, 68.</note> were ignorant and wicked, and had a corrupt and unlawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into their Calling; and the People were like to the Prieſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, notoriouſly and obſtinately ungodly; and the Worſhip uſed in that Church was wofully corrupt, many ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, the Obſervation whereof were more ſtrictly urged, than the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ordinances of God; the Temples made a Den of Thieves, the Diſcipline and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhamefully abuſed, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was corrupt in many points, and the great Sacrament of the Paſſover ill timed: yet the Word tells you, Chriſt (whoſe example it binds you to follow) and you profeſs your ſelves followers of him in all imitable things) made no ſeparation from this Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf a Member of it, was by Circumciſion incorporated a Member of it, received Baptiſme
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58941:169"/>
in a Congregation of that People, was a hearer of their common-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and their Teachers, allowing and commanding his Diſciples to hear them, communicated in the Paſſ-over with the People and the Prieſt; no more did his Apoſtles make ſeparation from this Church, after his Aſcention, till their Day had its period. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went to their publick Prayer in their Temple. So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> in their Synagogue. By their example it appeares, that till God hath forſaken the Church, no Man may forſake it; and that it is no ſufficient warrant to ſeparate from a Church, becauſe it is guilty of ſuch ſins and corruptions, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves God ſhould forſake it, and for which he hath threatned in his Word, that he will forſake it: till it appear that God hath put in Execution that which he juſtly threatned, we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and receive it, as his Houſe, and not to refuſe to dwell with
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58941:170"/>
him in it. For ſhall Man be holier than God, and hate corruption more than he? And yet we may not communicate with it, by conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any corruptions that are, or ſhall be detected, or proved to be in it, wherein we have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's example to guide us. All this I take for granted, that you will ſurely grant, becauſe many Books largely aſſerting all this, have been many Years in the hands of thoſe, who have led away many to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a ſyllable whereof they have not gain - ſaid: and they are in yours; nor have I heard a word of your diſſenting. But this I hear you ſay, that you queſtion the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that you cannot joyn with their Congregations in Divine Worſhip, becauſe they ſtand under an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Government, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in them is a deviſed worſhip. Touching the conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have no more but this to commend to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58941:170"/>
namely the anſwer, that was long ſince given to the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> to which I never ſaw reply given. Their Objection was this, that the People of <hi>England</hi> were never rightly called; for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Reign, they were by her command, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, compelled to embrace the Proteſtant Religion, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to God's worſhip: whereas in the New Teſtament, we have no Example of People compelled to the Service of God, chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Fiſhermen to convert ſouls by preaching, not Princes to make Diſciples by compulſion: Therefore the church of Chriſt had no right conſtitution. The Anſwer, to the ſeparation of old, is this, that if we ſpeak of a Church firſt planted, the people of ſuch a Nation are firſt called by the word, before they come to be a Church; but it is not ſo of a Countrey, where for a long time, true Religion hath been profeſſed, which is our caſe.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58941:171"/>
And as to that part of the Object, that there is no ſuch example in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>1. The Magiſtrates were then Enemies to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>2. It ſufficeth that we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Old Teſtament. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 21. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. 33. Nor have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes leſs power in their Dominion, to aboliſh Idolatry, and by Law, and penalties, to compel their Subjects, where there is a parity of reaſon.</p>
            <p>3. We finde that private Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in the New-Teſtament, have required, and brought in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, to embrace, and profeſs the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 53. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 21. &amp; 16. 34. &amp; 18. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. But that theſe did any more than teach, and command them to learn, conſent, and profeſs, ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, if they did ſo much. And ſo much they did, may, and ought to do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 9. And whether a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate may do more. For
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58941:171"/>
though it's out of all doubt, that not only all external duties of the Second Table, but alſo all ſuch of the Firſt Table of the Moral Law, are directly and properly of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cognizance; yet they doubt much, whether any Evangelical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, or Formes of Worſhip, which relate to Chriſt be ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſupernatural, and Conſcience is the only Rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Merit of thoſe Duties is to be Judged, which muſt be ſatisfied before any <hi>Papal</hi> Injunction can be impoſed, or obedience can be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded: and therefore they would have the ranged not among the eſſential, but among the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingentials of Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But they earneſtly deny that any internal duties and matters of Faith, and Evangelical Doctrine fall within the ſpheer of that cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, either directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe no humane power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to acts of the Soul, and it is the duty of the Miniſter, and not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58941:172"/>
of the Magiſtrate, to reform even in ſuch matters: and yet the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may, and ought to exerciſe his power, for reſtraining and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the fruits and effects of ſuch Errours, when the peace of the Common-wealth comes to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed thereby; but he has no warrant to puniſh the misbelief, or incredulity concerning Articles of Chirſtian Faith, no nor Idolatrous Formes of Worſhip, unleſs they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the errour or obliquity of their Subjects wills, the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof is the abſolute and adaequate end of all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the exerciſe of all Political Power: but puniſhments were never ordained for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the underſtanding. To return to ſatisfie the Objection, It is not neceſſarily nor generally true of all Members of the Viſible Church, that they be called by the word: if this be granted which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, that as among the <hi>Jewes</hi> Men were incorporated into

the Church by Circumciſion; ſo they are under the Goſpel by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and that as in thoſe times, many for by-ends, and through fear joyned themſelves to the Church, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 8. 17. ſo it may be, and hath been under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the greateſt part of our people are ignorant, and unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; yea, prophane Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ignorant and prophane Perſons have alway been in the Church: It was ſo in the Church's Infancy, and ſo in her perpetual growth, and ſo ſhall be to the end of the World, at leaſt till Chriſt come the ſecond time; but theſe are not of the Church, which hath its denomination of the better part.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But we want the Form of a true Church. <hi>Viz.</hi> a Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appeares not in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, any thing more was required to make Church-members of the Church-Univerſal, than aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to Evangelical truths, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and profeſſing Chriſtian Religion, and receiving Baptiſme; wherein all in our Church enter into a Solemn Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it when they come to years of underſtanding. And moreover to ſettle them in particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the Apoſtle made Biſhops or Elders over them in every Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. and required the People to obey them, hear and honour them. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 17. 24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. And thoſe that conſented to this, and did ſo, were Members of that particular Church: ſo that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, as a Man cannot be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Univerſal Church, (if at age) without his own conſent;
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58941:173"/>
ſo neither can he be of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church: (however he may be antecedently obliged to conſent.) But that this conſent was wont to be ſignified by any expreſs Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, between the Paſtors, and the Flocks, no Scripture mentioneth. It is <hi>conſent ſignified</hi> only which God requireth: But whether this conſent be ſignified, 1. By the Peoples Election of the Paſtors. 2. Or by a Covenant. 3. Or by lifting up the hands, or any ſuch ſign. 4. Or only by conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance with the Church on all God's Ordinances there, God hath no where determined; ſave only as circumſtances may make one of theſe more fit than another, and ſo oblige us to it in prudence. And he which maketh Duties, which God hath not made, is a maker of ſuperſtition, and a falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Speaker of God and his Lawes, and addeth to them.</p>

they ſtand under a Deviliſh Anti-chriſtian Government, and the Worſhip in them (by a number of Common-prayers) is a deviſed Worſhip. All that I deſire of you is only this, that laying aſide paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, you will but pauſe and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is alledged to give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to this Objection; which may cool at leaſt the fierceneſs of your Spirits, and abate that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate prejudice you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt the Government and Worſhip eſtabliſhed in theſe Churches. Touching the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Government in general, you know it is not of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of a Church; and as to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Churches by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (ſpeaking of it only as they are Superiour to Presbyters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out medling with the extent of their Dioceſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) when you finde ſo much written with ſo much confidence, that Epiſcopacy is the true ancient Apoſtolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58941:175"/>
of the Chriſtian Church: That it was received in profeſſion and practice in all Ages, and is ſo far Divine, that Biſhops were in the very time of the Apoſtles, that they were ordained and appointed by the Apoſtles themſelves: That there was an approved ſucceſſion of them in the Apoſtolical Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: That in all the following Ages, all the Churches in the World were governed by them, for more than Fifteen Hundred Yeares, without any oppoſition, ſave by the <hi>Arrian Aerius,</hi> who was therefore cryed down as an Heretick by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers. That the firſt reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtant Churches caſt not off Epiſcopacy with any averſneſs to the Order, as appeares by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> confeſſion, to which <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf ſigned: That ſome of thoſe Churches are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Superintendents, the ſame with Biſhops. That there was long ſince a challenge made to them, that have averſneſs to the degree
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58941:176"/>
or <hi>order,</hi> in theſe words. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to finde out, but one Church upon the Face of the Earth, that hath not been ordered by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Regiment: which to this Day (as they ſay) is not anſwered. Theſe allegations may (me-thinks) ſo far allay your heat, as to reſtrain your thoughts and Tongues from paſſing ſo ſore a cenſure upon the Government, that it is Deviliſh and Antichriſtian, till you can ſolidly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all theſe Arguments; though notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid, you are perſwaded that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church Government may be better. And that there is no cauſe why you ſhould refuſe communion with theſe Churches upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe Biſhops are chief Rulers there. Touching the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Worſhip objected, do but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate upon what you have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently heard and read, and you will ſee little reaſon to condemn ſtinted Prayers, becauſe invented and deviſed by Men. For how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58941:176"/>
inventions of Men are there of the ſame nature in God's worſhip, which you approve of: namely, ſet-formes of Catechiſing, ſtudyed Sermons, Interpretations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, diviſion of it into Chapters and Verſes, Contents of Chapters, Marginal references, putting <hi>Pſalms</hi> into Meeter, with a multitude more. True it is, invented or deviſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is unlawful, yet it is lawful to ſerve God in a Form of words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed: For the Form is not worſhip, but the Prayer tendered in that Form. And therefore they do not well, that ſay, a ſtinted Form of Prayer is a means of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not ordained of God, and that there is no warrant for it in the Word of God. For God's Word warrants things, not only by ſpecial Inſtitution (as all ſubſtantial means of Worſhip: and by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſo the Tranſlation of the Scripture is warranted, becauſe it muſt be read to edification, and edifie it cannot, unleſs it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood)
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58941:177"/>
but alſo by the Light of Nature and Reaſon, according to the general Rules of Scripture. And thus accidental means of Gods Worſhip, which are only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Celebration, as time, places, order, method, phraſe, and ſorme of words in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy things of God; yea, Pulpit to preach in, and Bells to call People together are warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If all ſuch means of worſhip muſt be ordered by ſpecial Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or they ſhall be unlawful, God muſt (upon the matter) have no Worſhip at all from us in the meanes, which he himſelf hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, becauſe it is impoſſible to uſe theſe meanes, and not to do many things which he hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. To return to Prayer, that a true Prayer may be made to God in a Set form, cannot be denyed, becauſe things agreeable to God's will may be diſpoſed therein, as in the Lord's Prayer; and it's poſſible for the heart and affections to go
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58941:177"/>
along with it, and faith, and other graces to be exerciſed in it. But you queſtion whether Miniſters may read in the Congregation preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Formes of Prayer impoſed? Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it were unlawful for them to do it, yet it is warrantable for you to be preſent at ſuch Prayers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Prayers wherein you joyn are ſtinted to you, and you are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the forme of words uttered by him that prayes: nor is a holy good prayer made evil to him that hears it, for the poſſibility afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>

kind, an unbloody ſacrifice offered up for quick and dead, the real Preſence, ſatisfaction for Venial ſins, temporal penance for mortal ſins, blotting out the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or confounding it with the Firſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Blackneſs and Darkneſs: and what is the matter of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Liturgy, reading the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in a known Tongue; the calling upon God in the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and not upon Angels and Saints, for the living, and not for the dead; the adminiſtration of the Holy Supper in both kinds, ſinging of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all White and Light.</p>

due to her ſelf, being the rich Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies which Chriſt bequeathed to his Church, which Anti-chriſt had ſeized upon: the Good therefore in the Maſs - Book belonged not to Anti-chriſt, but the foul groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which are purged out of ours.</p>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58941:179"/>
Prayer, when he exerciſeth his own gifts; is this a ground ſufficient to ſeparate from the Ordinance of God, or reject the good for that which is amiſs? Nor is there any doctrinal paſſage in any of the Prayers, that may not bear a good conſtruction, and ſo Amen may be ſaid to it. Charity binds us to take every thing in the beſt ſenſe: nor can you think it pleaſing to God, for ſome evil that may be faſtned upon ſome paſſages, to with-draw communion, eſpecially when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion may be had without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of any of the errours or corruptions; though we do not for their ſakes with draw from the communion of the Churches, while they are exerciſed.</p>

How far the charge is true or falſe, I ſhall not now meddle; In ſome Countreys, I am ſure that there are many ſober godly Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox able Preachers, yet in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the publick places.

            <p>The laſt ſort of Perſons, are thoſe of your own Houſe, Fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Family, and your Fellow-commoners: your duty in reference to theſe is manifold. I ſhall earneſtly commend this one; namely, to live in Unity with them: to move you effectually hereunto, behold how good and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant it is for Brethren to dwell in unity together. It is like the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oyntment upon the Head that ran down upon the Beard, even <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Garments; as the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and as the Dew that deſcended upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Zion.</hi> For the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the bleſſing for evermore. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. a Song of Degrees pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely pend for the knitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Hearts of God's People in the bleſſed band of Unity, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58941:181"/>
propounding both the profit and pleaſure redounding there-from. Behold (a matter worth the marking) how good in regard of profit) and how pleaſant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of delight) it is for Brethren both by nature and grace to dwell together in Unity, both of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affection. Next, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, and ſo proves the pleaſure, and the profit of this two-fold U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Firſt, by parable and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, which is double, to ſhew the pleaſure he compares it to, that odoriferous anointing Oyl, which God commanded to be made and compounded after the Art of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary, which when it was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Aaron</hi>'s head, ran down upon his Beard, and thence went to his Skirts: So this ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſpiritual grace, cunningly compoſed of united minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, paſſeth down from Chriſt our Head, not only upon the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Profeſſours, which are as great an Ornament to the Church, as a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58941:181"/>
Beard is on the Face of a Man, but alſo to the meaneſt and weakeſt Chriſtian Members. To ſet forth the pleaſure of it, he compares it<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 28, 39.</note> to Dew, which is a ſpecial bleſſing ſent upon the Earth, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing thereof, which falls freely (and therefore is ſaid to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God) and finely diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down in ſo ſmall drops, that it<note place="margin">Job 38. 28.</note> cannot be perceived till it be laid, and fully (it falls into loweſt Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, as well as higheſt Hills) and fitly (in Spring for growth in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt for ripening) and fruitfully<note place="margin">Eſa. 55. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> (making the Ground bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly) So it is in all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects with ſpiritual graces, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with this. And then he proves it by plain, ſtrong, and binding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration: where this Unity is, God commandeth the bleſſing, and life for ever-more; that is, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and fully performes it in this life, ſpiritually, and corporally, and hereafter Eternally.</p>
            <p>I hinted this Unity to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58941:182"/>
and will ſpeak a little to both. Firſt, of mind and judgment, it is a thing greatly to be wiſhed and ſought after, that all God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants dwelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the ſame Houſe, might be of one mind, and judgment in all points. The Apoſtle oft earneſtly preſſeth this, frequently ſtriketh upon this String. <hi>Now I beſeech you Brethren, by the Name of our</hi>

               <hi>one another.</hi> The Conſcience being but a correſpondency and relation of a Man's Spirit unto the Law, to bind or unbind, condemn or abſolve him. Moreover the good Laws the <hi>Heathen</hi> made to puniſh the evils forbidden, and to draw People to practice the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the endeavour of many of them to act accordingly, argues the Unity of both Laws. The reaſon of which unity is the unchangeableneſs of God, who is alway the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What need was there of the repetition and renovation of this Law? Or if there was need, Why was it not ſooner?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the former Branch, though Nature brought the ſame things, yet it did it very weakly, and many concluſions were oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and others much obſcured; and all Mens hearts were weakly drawn to obey this Law, very ſtrong to obey the Law of ſin. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Law of Nature could
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:58941:201"/>
ſcarce never have been extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in Principles and Grounds, yet it might, and was, and would have been more in Applications. Men took evil for good, and good for evil, and grew more and more vain in their imaginations.</p>
            <p>To the latter Branch, Man's heart was not after his Fall throughly humbled, but thought his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient for his Guide; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would leave the World a while to try them, and let them ſee their own weakneſs. Beſides, ſin was not come quickly to ſuch a pitch and height, as afterward it did, and yet we finde that God did by peece-meal, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally teach them this Law preſently and almoſt equipollently before its ſolemn Proclamation. The Unity of theſe two Laws lets you ſee, as the conſtancy and Immutability of your God, who is not as other Law-givers, who build, and pull down, and whom a Man knows, as well how to pleaſe, as ſhape a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58941:202"/>
Coat for the Moon; So alſo the neceſſity of the obedience of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to the Moral Law. 'Tis as inſeparable, as its very being, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible to receive a being, and not with it a bond of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men when they ſin ſpurn not only againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> but againſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature. He that owns the ground owns the Fruit alſo. We are not our own in any of our actions. And how eaſie a way Men have to choak temptations to Atheiſme! Let them take leave to deny <hi>Moſes,</hi> and trample him under-foot, yet in their Souls they finde written in very le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Letters, every Commandment of this Law: 'twas born with them, and ſuckt from Natures own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Why then ſhould they ſuſpect the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and think it a trick foyſted upon them, to deprive them of their pleaſures, Nature bearing witneſs that <hi>Moſes</hi> is no Deceiver? Finally, How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable Men are, that live in ſuch an Age, wherein they have
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58941:202"/>
both theſe Laws; One to confirm the other? Two witneſſes, if both accuſe us at the laſt Day, how ſhall we eſcape condemnation? Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold are the uſes this written Law of God doth ſerve unto: Some common to the Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <hi>Viz.</hi> to ſhew the excellency of Man's Nature before the Fall, when he had power perfectly to keep it, and the excellency of that ſupernatural condition in the life to come, when there ſhall be the ſame, yea, a more glorious power: and the corruption of our preſent condition, how ſhort we come of due perfection: and the Lord's right, notwithſtanding to require perfect obedience of us, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us for default in the leaſt point. It ſerves alſo to illuſtrate the Law of Nature obtenebrated by the Fall, the Law of incorrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being the ſame in ſubſtance with the Decalogue; alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and convince all Men of ſin, and their obnoxiouſneſs to eternal

Death, to be a Bridle to reſtrain them from groſs ſins; and finally, Men are taught thereby what a one God is, and how he ought to be worſhipped, either proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Elect, it ſerves as a guide to point thèm to Chriſt the Mediator, and to kindle a deſire in them to ſeek eternal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalvation by him; and when they are in Chriſt, to be a Rule of Thankfulneſs, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by him.

Pſal. 27. 13. Dan. 6. 23. Eſa. 50 10. 26. 3. Heb. 10. 39. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 24. And reaſons ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Scripture, come in as Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries. 1. From the Object of Faith, namely the promiſes which
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58941:211"/>
are meet matter to maintain life. <hi>Phil. 2. 16. John 6. 63. Jer. 15. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 2. Eſay 55. 1. 12. 3. 66. 11. Cant. 2. 5. Job</hi> 15. 11. 2. From the Nature and Office of Faith, which is to reſt upon God's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, for the performance of theſe promiſes, it certifies and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Soul, that all ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be made good. <hi>Pſal. 89. 34. Numb.</hi> 23. 19. By this means ſaith gives a Chriſtian actual preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all good things, even in their abſence; <hi>Faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> 
               <hi>hoped for:</hi> that is, it gives ſubſtance to things that have no Beeing, <hi>The evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> that is, that it both convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the judgment, that ſuch things muſt come to paſs, and it makes the mind conceive them really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Joh. 8. 56. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 3. 3. From the fruits, or if you will, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Daughters of Faith, which are attendant on her, and helpful to her, in maintaining life, namely hope, which keeps the heart alive,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58941:212"/>
by expecting better, when things are at the worſt, baniſheth deſpair, is compared to an Helmet and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. 2. Joy, this is the juice of Faith, the Souls ſtrength, baniſheth ſorrow, eats up all Earthly griefs 3. Courage and boldneſs, which expells fear. 4. Love, this makes bitter things ſweet, cauſing a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful willingneſs to ſuffer the hardeſt things for the ſake of the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. 5. From a ſingular property and power that is in Faith, to break through all difficulties, leap over all carnal objections, and remove all impediments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18—22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> How may we mannage our Faith, ſo as to maintain this life of joy and comforts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Your care muſt be to make this ſure, not only that you are within the compaſs of God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Covenant (to them that are out of this belong no promiſes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but threatnings and curſes) but alſo that theſe ſpecial qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are in you, which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:58941:212"/>
to particular promiſes, the fruition whereof depends upon the practice of ſome choice part of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which if you neglect, you do but preſume and tempt God in making title, and laying claim to them. Compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11, 12. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>2. This done, learn Four things concerning the promiſes: 1. The matter, which is ſupply of all good, and deliverance from all evil: 2. The kind or quality of them; the principle promiſe indeed, is abſolute, but all the reſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, theſe ſhall all be literally fulfilled for you, ſo far forth as they may be ſubſervient to that.</p>
            <p>3. The manner of propounding them; ſome promiſes are expreſly declared, both general and ſpecial ones, others are by conſequence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the examples or prayers of the faithful.</p>
            <p>4. The ſeveral wayes of God's performing his promiſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he gives his People the very
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58941:213"/>
thing he promiſeth: Sometimes he denyeth that, and gives them ſome thing equipollent proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtead of it, or elſe that which he knows is far better for them.</p>
            <p>5. You muſt in every ſtate of life, when you finde need, ſet your Faith on work, both to fetch in proviſion out of the Word, and to prepare it, and to apply it.</p>
            <p>1. The way to bring in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (for the maintenance of life) is by the memory: whatſoever faith doth in the Soul, it doth it by the help of this faculty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 5, 6. Forgetfulneſs is the cauſe of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all time, therefore of need: when-ever you are brought to any ſtreight, that you can ſee no way of eſcape, or means of relief, but begin to faint and ſink under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and vexation of mind, call to mind ſuch promiſes, as are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your condition. For there can be no condition imagined, but there are promiſes ſuited to it, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58941:213"/>
a Chriſtian wiſdome muſt be to accommodate the remedy to the ſore and malady of his heart. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what word there is in God's Book to ſtill the tempeſts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of your ſpirits, and then make application of it: Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes faithfully remembered and well digeſted, will arm and fortifie your Souls, that they ſhall be able to put any caſe of trouble inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and come off victoriouſly and triumphantly. Put caſe you be as poor as <hi>Job, Lazarus,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Widdow: Call to mind the promiſes of temporal bleſſings in abundance. Put caſe you be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the tongues or hands of wicked Men, call to mind the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that you ſhall be delivered, &amp; your enemies confounded. Put caſe your hearts be heavy for ſome great loſſes of Goods or Friends: Call to mind the promiſes, that you ſhall be gainers by your loſſes. Put caſe your ſpirits be wounded with the ſenſe of Divine wrath:
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58941:214"/>
Call to mind the promiſes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, peace, and reſt. Put caſe your Graces be weak, and corruptions ſtrong: Call to mind the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſanctification and quickening. Put caſe ſome great eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threaten you: Call to mind the promiſes, that nothing ſhall hurt you; that every thing that befalls you, ſhall work together for your ſpiritual and eternal good.</p>
            <p>2. Proviſion thus brought in by the Memory, the next work of Faith, is to prepare and make it fit nouriſhment. This is done by ſearching for, and finding out that Grace, or part of obedience, upon which, the fruition of the promiſe depends; to which ſufficient hath been ſpoken already: nor will it be diſheartned for weakneſs, if there be truth, yea, if no more than a true deſire. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3—6. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt chief work of Faith, is application of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes<note place="margin">Jer. 15. 16.</note> to your ſelves in particular,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58941:214"/>
this is feeding upon the proviſions brought in and dreſſed. Faith firſt does its utmoſt, to aſſure the ſoul,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 1.</note> that what God hath promiſed, is already done. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 24. 15. 28. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. Yea, and it makes it<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 56, 57.</note> good thus. 1. It hath Chriſt, and he is all. 2. It hath, if not the thing promiſed, as good, or better. 3. When it findes much ado; It goes to God, and ſeeks help of him. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 23. 24. 27. and concludes with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> 60. 12. 73. 1.</p>
            <p>You will be ſure to finde, while you live here on Earth, the Devil ever anon throwing his Fiery darts into your Souls. You muſt take the Apoſtles advice, to ſtand alwayes Armed with the whole Armour of God. <hi>Above all, taking the Shield</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 13-19.</note> 
               <hi>of Faith, whereby ye ſhall be able to quench all his Fiery Darts.</hi>

            <p>YOu have heard what the Daily Duty is, of all who live and dwell in God, <hi>viz. To live by Faith.</hi> How faith maintains the Soul in life, and the Apoſtle bidding you to take the Shield of Faith, and to uſe, and move, and mannage it, according to the place, Satan caſting his Darts at you, aimes at, and according to the kindes of his temptations. I ſhall give you a truth, and taſt how faith may be mannaged, and what the ſeveral acts of Faith are, by which the fierceneſs of theſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58941:216"/>
Darts of Satan may be quenched:</p>
            <p>There are ſix Fiery Darts (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many others) which Sathan throwes at the Souls of thoſe that dwell in God, whereby he works them much diſquiet and trouble. The firſt and worſt, is concerning the forgiveneſs of ſins. He would and often doth perſwade them, that their ſins are unpardoned, and that God will damn them for their manifold tranſgreſſions, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſins. The apprehenſion of this fills their Souls with horror, nor can the greatneſs and grievouſneſs of this affliction be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>A ſecond is, Concerning their ſpiritual Eſtate, he would make them believe, they are yet in a ſtate of Unregeneracy; and that the Root of the matter is not in them, but that they are but paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>A third is, Concerning Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Luſts, and Sanctification of Life, neither of which they have attained, and they are afraid they never ſhall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:58941:217"/>A fourth is, Fear of Poverty, and temporal Miſery; what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them in ſickneſs and old Age, they cannot tell, want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them like an Armed Man, this Dart ſets on Fire many Luſts.</p>
            <p>A fifth is, Concerning the right uſe of proſperity and adverſity: Satan perſwades them they neither do, nor ever ſhall uſe either rightly.</p>
            <p>A ſixth is, Fear of falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Faith rightly mannaged, will blunt the piercing points of all theſe Darts, and take away all the burning Poyſon in them; and ſo repell them, that the Soul ſhall not be hurt at all by them: though until Faith have done, it ſuffer much affliction by each of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now undertake to ſhew what be the ſeveral acts of Faith, that have force to overcome theſe ſeveral temptations, but will declare very briefly, what thoſe acts are, whereby Faith ſupports,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:58941:217"/>
and ſettles the Soul, and makes it victorious in any trouble or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever, inward or outward, which may be applyed to any of the caſes fore-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What uſe will this Doctrine be to thoſe that are not under any trouble, that have no manner of affliction upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no Chriſtian that<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 34.</note> is at any time of his life free from all affections: no Day comes<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note> ſo fair over any godly Man's head, wherein he meets not with ſome matter of grief, yea ſo much, that<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 14.</note> he findes enough ado to ſuſtain and maſter it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe that are now free from affliction (may, they know not how ſoon) be hem'd in, compaſſed about, and overwhelmed with variety of afflictions, as <hi>Job</hi> was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 23.</note> ought to live in continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 17.</note> of croſſes and diſtreſſes, publick, domeſtical, perſonal; and<note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 6, 7.</note> although there are great hopes of peaceable times, yet hopes may be<note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 1.</note>
