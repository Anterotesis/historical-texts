            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And now I do conjure you, <hi>Basilino,</hi> by the power of a King, that hath deposed himself, rather to pray than to command, to change this your desire of leaving us, into any other you can think of, and stay here; and by the gods we wish may move you; with us, the agreement to it shall be esteem'd a blessing to us.</p>

                  <p>O that the angry gods would pitty me so much, that I might now obey you in a fatall silence. It is not a feather'd fancy that carrieth me to fly above my will, but a weighty misfortune that bears me down before you, to demand ease for my oppression, which I must have some time and distance to discharge my self of. Nor hath my curse been so defective in any circumstance, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract me quite, and so free me from the sense of all your interests; but it seems to admit an unsensiblenesse of all my own, to keep me wholly from the survey of you, whose contradiction of my ease is the refinedst torment. But I could provide, by engagement to you, Sir, against any important prejudice my absence may but threaten; if I might hope as well to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for your large offer, Sir, I am so reduced, I had but this one to ask of you, the which to ease you, I am content to deny my self.</p>

                  <p>The life of man protracted to a miracle were yet too short to tell the wonder of thy faith, much more that instant is but left me now for admiration of it. The Prince is instantly resolv'd to leave his fathers Kingdome, and hath obtain'd his leave. And hath chosen me the only partner of his thoughts, and his companion in his meane disguise. So as heaven finding thy vertue such as it might easily draw into a miracle, resolved to raise it more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence by this farther tryall. And I for this their end am punished with love, and trust of <hi>Basilino.</hi>

                  <p>The time we had resolv'd for consummation of our wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es we must now differr till our return. Sure <hi>Fidamira</hi> thou hast refin'd thy selfe so neere Divinity, thou art above the being enjoy'd by sense. And it were insolence in me to hope for such a temptation in this absence, as you have mett with, but even the love of Queens is not so impossible as my embracing it. The Prince's parting doth depend on nothing now but my returne. Which he is almost as impatient of, as I of staying here; which is a blessing I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine so much to leave, as I have need of't.</p>

For the differring of our wishes, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is so strange, it doth import the will of heaven.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27459:11"/>
And for the tryall of my faith it is too easie, and assured a thing for heaven to intend, if heaven meaneth a miracle in mine, it must by it's intirenesse after the breach of yours which to me would seem such a miracle, I should not wonder though my own should be preserved for my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>But this sad Digression hath no reason for it, but the distracted sense of your departure. Go then, <hi>Agenor,</hi> and serve that glorious Prince with such succesfull faith, as he may think, at your returne, not knowing of our loves by the opinion of thy faith, that nature meant our faith's only to match one another, and for improvement of our joyes, he may have his share in the bestowing them; stay not for any thing but for a confirmation of my wish.</p>

In any kind it were injustice to require of our senses the carrying of us above ground, when they were not ordained to flie. Their motion is towards fixt-materiall-objects, which they can reach, and are not bound to comprehend Lover's descriptions, that enlarge beauty into a spaciousnesse, where it loseth it selfe, because it cannot be compassed. Take this rule Sir, Sense is not bound to follow any thing out of sight, and within those bounds it can injoy all it meets.</p>

                  <p>The ingenuousness of this institution is such, as we may joy we owe it not unto antiquity. It derives it self no higher then this King's grandfathers time, who had a daughter called <hi>Sabina,</hi> a Lady of that strange beauty and perfections, as this, was but one of the miracles she left us to admire her by. The virtue of her resolution takes off much from the wonder of her witt. Which seemes to have remain'd imperious and not flexible to her distresse. She was sought by two Princes, The Dolphin of France, and the Prince of Navarr: whose passions seem'd so equall, as the most powerfull could not beare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deniall, and the weaker found himselfe so arm'd by his passion as he despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the anger, which the power of France had vow'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, if he were preferr'd. <hi>Sabina's</hi> inclination to Navarr drew down the power of mighty France, upon this Prince of Vallance. But the hope of fair <hi>Sabina</hi> which he seem'd to think himselfe a gainer by, after the losse of most of his country. Then <hi>Sabina,</hi> whom it seemes the love of virtue only had made partiall to Navarr, found the way to exalt her virtue more, then by persisting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst difficulties which seem'd to take off from the glory of it, by the abatement it procur'd where it intended an advantage. And so fearing left his sufferings might raise his virtues to such an estimation, as he might be thought to have<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d served her, and so the matching of herselfe might lessen her, resolved to take the glory wholly with the sufferings to her selfe. And so sent to the victorious Dolphin (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat had allready made himselfe Prince of Navarr, and bragg'd that with that title he would wo <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Dolphin whose successe had nourished his love with hope even in <hi>Sabina's</hi> direct denialls, swallowed this as an assurance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27459:17"/>
of his wish, without examining the words, beleeving his own flattering omen more security then even <hi>Sabina's</hi> promise. He accepted the conditions, and presently resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his conquests though the Prince refused the treaty, and the future peace. Yet he instantly performed all that <hi>Sabina</hi> asked, who now resolved to publish the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her vow. 'Twas sure the gods that did infuse these thoughts, for a reward of so supream goodnesse, and made the monument of her admiration a Sanctuary for distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed virtue, so to convey to future times a blessing with the memory of her. She begg'd of her father leave to make a vow of chastity and desired a propriety of this place as her dowre; which nature seemes to have made of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match't delightfullnesse, as if she had meant to brag, that she made a stage onearth worthy of <hi>Sabina's</hi> acting on this her divinest part.</p>
                  <p>Hither then by the consent of her indulgent father, <hi>Sabina</hi> came, attended by many Nobles of both sexes, whom love to <hi>Sabina,</hi> or admiration of the action brought with her. Of which she made this Order. And authorised by her father, erected this regall government, and enacted all the lawes you have heard read; which have been so inviolably kept, as a punishment here would seeme a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. She enjoyed the regality during her life, and then left the propriety of all unto the Queen. Who is eligible as you have heard. The peace and setlednesse of this place is secured by natures inclosure of it on all sides by impregnablenesse, as if it were only for chastity to make a plantation here. At one passage only, the rocks seeme to open a way of themselves, so as to let in the Kings care in a Garison. Which he maintains for safety of the place, which delivers all strangers to us as sutors, not invadors. Thus Sir I have inform'd you of the institution of the order of the Shepheard's, which is called by the Foundresse, <hi>The Shepheards Paradise</hi> As being a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

severest executions. Now Sir, I must needs tell you the generous end of the Prince of Navarr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you may see, there was nothing accessary to this heavenly Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that had not such a transcendent newnesse of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very as they seeme made for such a divine novelty. The Prince as it seems hating the earth, whose safety had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the losse of <hi>Sabina,</hi> In scorn of it forsook it, and came hither in a disguise.</p>
                  <p>And was admitted into the Order, where he lived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and dying without making himselfe known unto <hi>Sabina</hi>; but at his death, left such a notorious memory as all ages shall study to display, and put it to the royallest ornaments can be due to Princes. The Queen ordained a particular ceremony to be performed every yeare at his Tomb, which is justly observed.</p>

                  <p>This is so heavenly a tradition, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes best our delivery. This order seemes a match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene love, and honor, and chastity, which you are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py sir in being the Preist to. But give me leave to wonder, why the brothers are excluded out of the election, which is to be guided most by beauty, of which sure they be the best Judges.</p>

                  <p>The reason Sir, that I have heard was then given by the Foundresse, That it had been to have made them Judges in their own causes. Since there is none but hath a particular interest that doth prepossesse his choyce. Whereas all women are rather Inquisitors, then admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of one another. And being voyd of passion, no freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can incline them to yeeld priority in beauty.

                  <p>The wisdom, Sir, of the Foundresse was such, as it carries away our admirations, even with this our prejudice. I have one more satisfaction to desire of you, which the omission of, I do beleeve, in your opinion might render me unworthy of these I do allready owe,

                  <p>'Tis not above a yeare since she was received so, that, had she not had such a transcendent beauty, as might have endured the abatement of the envy, which so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine an election might have taken from her, and even after that deduction have remained incomparable, sure she had not been chosen Queen. It was thought <hi>Pantamora</hi> the precedent Queen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would have been relected. She is by birth a stranger, of some part of France. And brought with her marks of noble birth. Her pretention was an intention of her father to dispose of her to a person of great wealth and quality, who then loved another so passionatly, as the contestation with his father about his consent was so lowd, as the voyce of it came to the ladie's eares. Who moved, as she said then, with the true honor of her sex, resolved rather out of due to her perfections then pride of them, not to expose them to such an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation, as the dispute of being enjoyed. Therefore left she her fathers house and repaired to this Sanctuary for protection of her beauty, which was in danger of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation. This was received of all as an acceptable plea for her admission, as a trium<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ence by a surprise of happinesse, which enters so fast my eyes, as I must fly back unto my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27459:25"/>
memory in haste to bring out my sorrows. For I have such a new unluckinesse made of purpose for me, as I ought to feare that this joy breaks in upon me, but to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away my memory, and with it, my pretence to this divine reliefe, and so to make this instant lightning a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall storme. Now I must first addresse my selfe unto my own sex for judgment, in what you Ladies cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciders for want of experience in it. Loving against scorn, I was so humble, as I had no scruple left in all my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but that of disappointing her I loved so well.</p>
                  <p>I could have wished that even her scorne had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before my wishes. So that I must excuse my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy by Fate, since it occasioned such a fault in her, as this injustice you shall heare. In this continuation of my passion, which was so unhappy, I may now call it so, as to afford me many services done to her, which I will not expect so much reward for as their repetition. At last, fortune made one day my owne life, which was so contemptible to me the deliverer of hers, and the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of what punishment she should appoint the barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempter. Whose threats had allmost saved the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive spilling of her blood, by that cold exanimation fear had drawn over her. Which notwithstanding did her that service, as to send forth some faint cries that guided me to the rescue, in a wood where despaire had carried me, to envy the life of plants, and to despise mine owne. There I found her on her knees, prepared to be a Sacrifice to that blow was moving toward her.</p>
                  <p>I, when I came to intercept it, (guilt is so weak, as tis no vanity to say,) I easily became as much master of his life, as he was of hers: and offered her to purge the ground, that had borne such a monster, with his blood. She then, I may say properly coming to her selfe, seemed to beg of me more earnestly his life, than she had don her owne of him; as if her soul had been allready carried up to heaven, and owght him this fright as a bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him only, obeyed her. And gave him not only his life, but more then my own. When he was gone she told me she forgave him, since he had freed her from an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Her life was only welcom to her, to retract her neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of me. Which she would recant as farr as faith and honor would warrant her. I was impatient to know how far these limitations did extend Whether my wishes were shut out by them. She told me, the execution I had stayed was upon a condemnation, where I had witnessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against her, which somewhat qualifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

joy of having made her happy. After this hard command, to soften it, she steept it in such teares, as I grew rather ashamed, then resolved. Then she began to prayse, and magnify the bravery of this my action. So as I was afraid to heare her long, lest vanity should seem to share with love, in the perswasion to this obedience. I gave her instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my promise of complying with her will, and to adde somwhat even to her own wish, I said I would conduct her to her servant, and never more but once againe accuse her of cruelty. And joy, that my accusation of her might now prove meritorious to her. And this settled in peace, and confidence with him, I should make him witnesse of my vow, so to secure her future joyes. This I did the same day, and so left her there, where she began to be sensible of my company. And resolved to repaire to this Sanctuary with so much devotion to forgetfullnesse, as nothing but the hope of my admission here, could have perswaded to the repetition of this story. Which if it do procure me, I may triumph over fortune. Whose depression of me hath but sunke me to the center of rest and peace.</p>

Love may rise to this transcendent height, that it may seem to look down on all things, and despise even enjoying: but, likely, our thoughts in this elevation stay not long, but growing dizy fall. Therefore when our imaginations settle at such a pitch, as our senses are within distance of them; then possession is a foundation to maintain Love at that height: and such love, <hi>Camena,</hi> remaines unmoved, and seeth the ruine of many aspiring passions that fall down by it. Therefore possession what it takes off from loves summer-prospect in the height, doth recompence it with strength, and security against the change of seasons.</p>

Thus I am so miserable as before I plead my cause, to make my judges justly parties against me; but, this wonder past, and pardoned, then the consequence may easily be beleeved because it is successively naturall, A Father and a Son being the subjects of this wonder. The passion of the son was first. The father followed it unknown to the son; of which the father meant to apply the first discovery, only to benum and dead what was left of life. This was that only pretence which the fury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He said, he would reduce himselfe to a condition should defeat even my pitty, and in revenge of my crosse-will would frustrate even my power of helping him. And there he seemed to prove, this purpose was designed above, since nature had curst him unto the making of his curs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27459:31"/>
end too was destined to him, and even for such a cause, as was a greater torment then the act. Therefore he said, his thoughts condemned his son of more then parricide, his intercepting of my love to him, and he should be sacrificed to this suspition. So little did the love of twice himselfe prevaile, set by his love to me. And this he said, he did acquaint me with, that my virtue which had been his tormentor, might have the paine of being the cause, and knowing this detestable effect without the meanes of a prevention, which his instant execution should make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. And thus he seemed to fly from me, as if the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this act already had displaced that of his being with me. Then I, counselled by virtue in this strange surprise, which seeing as her self she had not power to divert this rage, did prompt me to disguise her into a shape might please his fancy for a while, and so delude this fury by its own resemblance. Then I persuing him with haste stayd him, seeming to embrace his rage, not wrestle with it. Then I told him that I did allow this brave resolve, as a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation high enough to justifie my yeelding to. And I could never have thought to have mett a humor worthy the matching mine unto. I told him, mine was none of those warme tender hearts that sighes could blow into a flame. It had an adamantine temper, which only blood can soften; and that he had done like to that Painter, that had the figure of a lyon running mad, and wanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>othing but the foame to represent, grew so distracted with despaire of hitting it, as in a rage he threw his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at it, and by this chance did rarely perfect his aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned worke: and so his fury had, throwing it selfe into so high despaire, made up that figure, which only could have taken me.</p>
                  <p>I told him, that his feares were true, and that his son was guilty of interposing between him and me. But his offence was only naturall, not active against him, whose having of a son, had resolved me, not to submit the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27459:32"/>
of my bed to a minority in any thing. Therefore he that could intend to kill his son to impossibilitate his joyes, will easily do it to assure them. Which if he would promise, on the beleefe of his brave minde, that had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced me to such proofes of it, I would advance his possession of me, even this night, before the ceremoniall rites. He agreed to this with so much joy, he seemed to have made and not destroyed a son. That night, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken up the time on such a pawne as this, made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the best of it, and layd it out so, as I thought the use of it should pay the principall. Therefore I sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to the son; and, by tokens, that I had taken from the father as pledges of his word, assured him his death was purposed by his father, and that night. That there did remain no time for any thing but flight. This he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving did fly instantly. Which I assured of, my next part was now, to unmask my virtue, whose vizard grew offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. Therefore thus winged with innocence, I did resolve to fly over these seas, which part our neighbouring lands, leaving a Letter which might clear my virtue, from that black engagement I had made. And coming hither, the kinde gods presented me with the selfe equall report of so divine a body, as it offers it to the releife of all nations &amp; sexes, and my arrivall here I cannot ascribe to lesse then a divine direction.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you heard a Story, whose strangenesse needs so much of your pitty, it must first aske your credit as a charity; which if you do vouchsafe, I cannot doubt a fair commiseration.

I do not think her dead, no more then a disguise may be a preparation to it. As death may have a better pretence to seise her then as not her selfe, than in the lively illustration of her selfe, to whom all lives are due. And to let thee see, kind Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime, how due to me this thy ingenuous yeelding was, I will direct thee to an ease of all thy miseries, while mine are unreleevable.

Alas, good King, how patient have I been to allow your sorrowes victory, striving with mine, which these were too that you brought forth. For <hi>Fidamira's</hi> flight belongs simply to me, and hath no comfort but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her virtues, which this happy meeting with the King hath so exalted as the wonder mingles with the sense of my disappointment, and so tempers it into a hopefull patience. The kings counsell is so good, it will serve for more then he intends it, and I hope for as much joy to him, as he meant ease to me. I will goe back direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Prince, and now assure him that the Princesse of Navarr is dead, to stop his fathers course. And as I finde his thoughts are fixt or moved from <hi>Fidamira,</hi> so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his returne; the which will quickly unconceal my <hi>Fidamira,</hi> who must needs be hid in some neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privacy secure from her virtuous feares.</p>
                  <p>This penance of not seeing her, I take as due unto these faulty eyes that have been pleased with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object. Which now redeemed shall make me watch their straying motions with a stricter care.</p>

so, as men may feare the being loved, and women may justly leave from loving, since nothing but dying can shew that they can love enough. Behold and pity me whom death keeps thus alive by my despaire. In living to proclame his Triumph, not only in my love, but in my life, I am that wretched he, that shame unto my sex, that was beloved by such a one, as had not sin enough to dy, but death was faine her virtue to imploy.</p>
                  <p>This treachery did death use me with, whilst I was as I may say even in his company, as much as darknesse and absence represent him. In this separation then, death I may say betray'd love too: for 'twas the deadly sinn of lust, armed with the power of a Prince that did assault the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this matchlesse Shee. To save whose life she gave her own to death delivering it with her own hands. Which being not strong enough to defend her innocence, were innocent in the defeate of her own life when it stood against her innocence. After this, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I pretend admission here for comfort, but bound to seeke through all the world the place which is the truest enemy to lust, and death, which all consent is this; for that virtue which defyes the first, defeates the last of his power. Therefore I must implore your ayde in this, that in revenge of this injurious life which nature is not so kind as to allow me hope of a justifiable freeing of my selfe of, I may live here where only life is such, as it despiseth death.</p>

                  <p>I must confesse, I am eased of all the pain that I have ever heard of; and that which doth remaine doth not detract from your virtue Madam, since I ought to think your knowledge of it, would but improve it. In not having seen the Princesse, I attribute rightly unto the Prince, who as I conceive could not possibly arrive in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi> before her death.</p>

                  <p>Sure, love is very injorious, or it is injured much by mens complaints; for, since my comming hither I have heard no pretence to a misfortune, but Love hath had the imputation of it.

                  <p>I shall retract all my complaints if I be so happy as to be the first, that informs you Madam what love is, and shall doe so great a service unto Love it selfe, as it hath but one recompence great enough for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:27459:42"/>True Love, Madam, is a Spirit extracted out of the whole masse of virtue; and two hearts, so equall in it as they are measured by one another, are the vessels where it is refined, heated naturally by each others eyes, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by pipes as subtill as our thoughts, by which it runs so fast from one into another, as the exchange and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne are but one instant. And to confirme this doctrine, you Madam by this receit may make it when you please.</p>

                  <p>The reason then that I have heard Love cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a poyson, is, when this Spirit is intended to too high a degree of heat.</p>

                  <speaker>Mor.</speaker>
                  <p>If it be drawn from good ingredients, it cannot rise to an excesse. Pure Love is a virtue Madam that hath no extream; and wild desires take but Love's name, as rash blasphemers do repeat the gods by an habitual sinne, by which they only do prophane themselves. It is desire, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you have so oft heard called poyson. 'Tis true, that's a mineral which if it be not well tempered and prepared, is very dangerous; but, so disposed, it quickens the virtue of all it mixeth with.</p>

                  <p>Loves perfection Madam, is such a blessing as the gods have, not left in the power of any one to consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, to indear it by the difficulty, have ordained it should depend on the consent of two. This rarity in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture else, would prove too cheap if every single heart could be possest of it. Therefore I conclude that loves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection must be such a compacted union of two hearts so close, as there's not so much as even a wish left out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27459:43"/>
having set their Image on them; and so our hearts are rather wrought into subjection, then that equal union you describe.</p>

                  <p>I confesse, Madam, there may be men as vain as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens fears: but, vanity though it take many marks upon it selfe, yet leaves but seldome any. It is so light, Love ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feels it as it passeth over it; therefore Madam, Vanity doth but polish Love in its own conceit, and so sees it self in it, and pleaseth it self with the reflex without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression left. But a mans heart possest with true love as soone as it perceives but the least gentlenesse, where it is applyed to move, then with humble insinuations it works it self under that heart, it means to raise in this injection of it self into it; so that the womans heart is not subjected but exalted by this union.</p>

                  <p>I could have resolved on any thing that could have fallen on me; but this suspension is a Rack, whose wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring flackness is the heighth of torture, which exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a patience towards the ease of the indurance. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impute these words to chance. I am enlightned even thus far for a curse, to see she understands my passions. I shall declare my self, and joyne the name of Prince to that of Lover, to assist me. No, I will try once more the single strength of <hi>Moramente,</hi> which if it prove too weak, I'le call that of Prince for my Auxiliary; which must needs help me to be wondered at, if not beloved. Sure <hi>Martiro</hi> hath not broke his faith for so little as <hi>Bellesa</hi>'s infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; it must be for his own indearment, and my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from her.</p>

                  <p>Love, Madam, appropriates what it joynes unto it selfe, and doe you think a partner in the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty of your selfe were not halfe a deposition?</p>

                  <p>This insensiblenesse you counsell <hi>Martiro,</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an admission to equality, leaving all hearts free, and <hi>Bellesa's</hi> can be no more it selfe. Tis an enlargement of her soveraignty to take homage from such hearts as shall bow down to offer it. If you will give selfe-love <hi>Martiro</hi> the empire that women should glory in, how limited will that be when they shall have no subject but themselves? All I counsell the Queen is, that she would know her selfe too. For beauty sees it selfe best, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflexes that it makes on objects whereon it shines.</p>

                  <p>A heart that looks at first for so much from the Queen as an acknowledgment, sets too high a price upon it. Should every meanest subject pretend to have his name known to his Soveraign because he is what he should be? It must be some eminent service must allow him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for a reward. And the soveraignty of love is distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced more from the approach of any subject to it. No blood, qualities, nor no fortune rayseth neerer then the common prostituted crowde. All are commons in an equall sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and the pretention to advantage is rebellion.</p>

Which being such a crime as nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but once, can be punishment enough for't, she hath ordained you not only to wish it, but hope it too, and to see her as often as you will that upon the rack of hope she may dayly torture you by the intention or remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, as she shall please. This onely she thinks an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation proportioned to your fault; and hath sent me with this sentence to you, which I hope I have delivered so, you understand it.</p>

                  <p>How justly am I afflicted by my owne offence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy? The Prince's change is fallen out to punish mine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27459:63"/>
And he is so happy that even his change doth prove a service unto <hi>Fidamira,</hi> as it revenges her on me. I will not add so much unto my guilt, as a detraction from her, in the beliefe that he could preferr any thing before my offer, but a well grounded hope of <hi>Bellesa's</hi> Love.</p>
                  <p>None but I could do so new a thing, as to preferr des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. How well doth my curse sute with my sin? My addresse to <hi>Gemella</hi> for conveyance of my passion to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesa,</hi> that had already undertaken <hi>Moraments</hi>? My obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath assur'd it me, without the helpe of my sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition. And I am punish't as it were by fate with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from the Prince's trust, before he can know a reason for't. O how deceitfull and ensnaring joyes, are Prince's highest trusts? They doe subject us more then even our nature or their power can. They raise us so above the sense of all their other benefits, as we are only fixt on that which they may so easily take away, as even cessation doth remove it. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o we do expose, not only all the joyes we have acquired, but even the imbred ease of our own soules. Which might have rested in their own levell, but cannot in a declination from that height. So subjects hazard more then Princes give! Yet methinks love is so much above reason now, as it proves the Princes trust a convenience, not a losse, as it may warrant my profession of my passion to <hi>Bellesa,</hi> which I will do in so resolved a boldnesse as it shall be significant humility, as it must imply the extreame of all despaire.</p>

                  <p>There's nothing speakes so truely of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesa</hi> as my opinion of her. I will beleeve my admiration before my senses. I am so far from crediting what I hear of her, as I do not beleeve her selfe. Her modesty will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the knowing of her selfe so well as I do. For though my thoughts in their highest extasie pitch not at the top of all her vertues, yet they get up so high, as to assure
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:27459:64"/>
how low and neere the earth her soule can fall. Though I cannot imagine all the good that she can do, yet I can satisfy my selfe how neere she can come to doing ill, to which she can never approach so neer as loving; Though that be farr from ill, yet as it is but ordinary, it may be counted too much ill for her. Shee's somwhat of her selfe; I know not what to call her, so unlike to all things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary, that we may better think the humility she beares chose rather to be a woman, then that heaven meant her one; Unlesse it set her in this way, that passing through it she might rise unto a higher glory, then if she had been first created an Angell. I do not wonder at the received opinion of her loving. I would not have the knowing of her be common as to undeceave every body; and for those that hope it, they have made themselves a curse. I cannot pitty enough, as it is a madnesse they will never beleeve it to be one. <hi>Moramente</hi> is a person worthy the knowing <hi>Bellesa, Gemella's</hi> womanish officiousnesse will be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the frustration of it. The election is now within two dayes, we shall see who remaines here. Accordingly I will apply my pitty of <hi>Moramente</hi> to his conversion in the beliefe of the divine <hi>Bellesa.</hi>

                  <p>I have left the Queen and <hi>Moramente</hi> together: I beleeve between them two, the execution will be gentler then the sentence. I am come my selfe to such a perfect knowledg of all men, as I am too farr from envying even <hi>Bellesa,</hi> as I am scrupulous of my contribution towards her loving one. The best of all the sex which I will allow the Prince to be, can secure me no farther of his faith, than that, if it be possible that there can be one in all the world prove constant, it is he.</p>
                  <p>I do now so much neglect all men, as I have no sense so low, as to be moved with any of their injuries. I do
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27459:64"/>
forgive <hi>Agenor</hi> so, as all the memory I have now left, is of my own fault, that it was ever in the power of a man so to offend me. I confesse I could wish his repentance, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expiate that fault of mine, by shewing how much I repent of it, by being now incapable of such an exposure of my self againe. I am not so vain as to believe my looks can perswade him to this repentance, therefore I have thought a way how they may fright him to it, and for that I must put on this colour's contrary, and like a ghost appear unto him. His guilt will joyne with me in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of it. Thus I will watch him the next evening, as he goes to the Temple. His fears would now be welcomer then his love; but he may chance be so vain, as to beleeve that even dead I cannot choose but follow him: for vanity even feeds on dreams and apparitions, and loving <hi>Bellesa</hi>: he had need sustain his love with such like airey nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I am resolved I will once more change my disguise: I am sure it cannot succeed worse with me then this hath done.</p>

                  <p>How well hath fortune shewed, I am her own, in having thus imployed my self to betray that strength of happinesse which was impregnable, and must have been delivered thus by me, since her self could not take it? Sure fortune grew Jealous, least the world should thinke she was in love with me, and there's nothing so detracting from fortunes reputation, as the opinion that she can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten her selfe to any one. She is the whole world's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and her loose variations entertain all her servants in variety of hopes, and so drawes on those generall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses which busie and divert her so. Me-thinks she might have counted me her child, and so have justified
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27459:67"/>
unto herself her tendernesse of me. For when my Infant-bloud seemed destined to the thirst of multitudes; even there she took me in her armes, and set me at the breasts of Princes to be nursed; and not content with that, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me so unto them, as if I had sucked their hearts into me, and they lived by me. This hath been confirmed unto me by such a disposition of their powers, as if they had no power but this of giving me so much: and because all this might be thought subject still to fortune, she provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me a blessing above her power of resuming <hi>Fidami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> Love. And sure 'tis that which hath incensed my mother Fortune thus against me, that repulse that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in her attempting <hi>Fidamira</hi>: for never was fortune more affronted, than in her refusal of the Prince. It must be so that she grew jealous of my being set above her reach, and finding her self so weake, hath got Love to joyn with her to take me by my selfe, that I might give away what could not be resumed. And now I am so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleately miserable, I cannot call my affliction misfortune. I have this circumstance to perfect it, the attribution of it wholly to my self. I have told <hi>Bellesa</hi> my passion so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, she seemes not to understand it. Sure it had so wild a boldnesse, it looked liker Madnesse then Love. It is but just, that I that have so much neglected truth, should be discredited by it. Whither but to my self should I repair for satisfaction, since I am my owne offender? Therefore from thence I derive a happinesse that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie even fortune, the adoration of the not epitheted <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesa</hi>; it shall be so little subject to chance or change, it shall make despair a reason for it, to be sure to defie both those. Nay I will not exact lesse of my self then the doing what was never done before, the allowing <hi>Bellesa</hi> to love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and even proportion my joy in this, to what she shall receive in that. Thus I am so resolved, as I could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven already tell it <hi>Fidamira.</hi>

She is here your delegate on earth. Tell me, blessed spirit, wert thou not sent down to visit her?

For me, I doubt not but you will approve so of my adoration here, as in pitty of my want of spirit and soul enough you will inspire some such transcendency, as may lessen the disproportion is between the admiration of all mortalls and the divine <hi>Bellesa.</hi>

it is in the inversion of the conditions it receives. All the effects I have found of it yet, have been so.

                  <p>As the humors are Madam, some say all they thinke, and yet thinke all they can too little. Others say no more then what just will serve a man to guesse at what they thinke.</p>

                  <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sure that is best <hi>Gemella.</hi> For so women retaine a power of rewarding modesty, and punishing presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which is so easily don, as by saying nothing. But what say you <hi>Gemella</hi> of <hi>Genorio's</hi> passion, that is so bold as to fly to me for sanctuary? I had thought friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship had been the highest passion. Beleeving that <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> greifes running through <hi>Genorio</hi> had left this sad tincture on him. Is there no friendship so bold <hi>Gemella</hi> as to admitt a rivall to the trust of emulous desires?</p>

                  <p>Passion, Madam, is so shie of all things, as it scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters our thoughts abroad upon all aproaches can be made to it: And is so farr from admitting any body, as it is afrayd even of its own shaddowes doubt, and suspition which it never shines but it will make. But I wonder most
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27459:76"/>
that <hi>Genorio</hi> in so desperate a passion, should seek a reason for your will, though it be to neglect him. Perfect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility bows into it self, and finds reason there to justifie its adoration, by an incapacity of a fault in her it is devoted to.</p>

                  <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>And sure, Humility is incouraged so, as by finding this reason, it leaves neglect lesse reason then it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but what reason doth <hi>Genorio</hi>'s wildnesse prey upon?</p>

And now I find it was a suppression, not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of her, to beleeve there could be any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to her, which I confesse I did beleeve her loving was. <hi>Moramente,</hi> who was most concern'd by my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath already begun to correct it by his scorn of my counsell, which I gave him as boldly, as if <hi>Bellesa</hi> had been no where but in my fancie. I will allot no lesse then all my life for recantation, and pay this blessed place all that for my conversion.</p>

let them judge what a joy it will be to a father, to whom you have been so long a stranger. And though it seemed misfortune cannot afford you lesse then a Crown, yet you ought not to make that Crown, which nature hath made yours, unfortunate. Therefore heare the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses of the King your father, that cry so lowd in the complaints of the losse of you, as they hear not the cries of all his kingdom for their exposure to the first strong pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that will seize it. His age must quickly leave the first invader for his heir. You know your brother and your sister, the Prince <hi>Palant,</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Miranda,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished both infants at the seige of the cursed <hi>Pamlona.</hi> Since, the King your father having destin'd you to the Prince of <hi>Castile,</hi> a Prince thought a match for your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as well as your condition.

I upon whose trust this misfortune lay like Treason, have been ever since in the search of you, and now the gods have been pleased to blesse my dispaire with what they have so long denied my hope, the finding you, Madam. I must now addresse my selfe not only to you, but all this society for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this pretence of a King, and a Nation, which in a new way demands reliefe, not by admittance but dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
