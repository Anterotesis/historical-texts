         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Inſtances.</head>
               <p>Inſt. 1. <hi>BEgin we firſt with his impious Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the</hi> Bleſſed Trinity, <hi>of which he thus
ſpeaks,</hi> The Divinity is threefold, as the three Perſons are, &amp;c.
<hi>And from hence the reaſon may well be, why</hi> Luther <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punges
out of the Litany this Verſe,</hi> Holy Trinity, one
very God, have mercy on us. <hi>And hereupon he is not afraid
to ſay,</hi> that the word Trinity is but an Human Invention,
and ſounds coldly. <hi>And then further adds,</hi> that his Soul
hates the word Homouſion, <hi>or</hi> Conſubſtantial; <hi>for thus he
writes,</hi> Anima mea odit Homouſion, &amp; optime exigerunt Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani,
ne vocem illam prophanam &amp; novam regulis fidei ſtatui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liceret.
My very Soul hates the word Homouſion, [<hi>or</hi> Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,]
and the Arians, not without reaſon, requir'd, that
it ſhould not be lawful to put this prophane and new Word
among the Rules of Faith. Luther's <hi>Blaſphemy againſt the</hi>
B. Trinity <hi>was ſuch, and ſo odious, that even</hi> Zuinglius
<hi>did purpoſely write againſt</hi> Luther <hi>about this very point.
[So relates</hi> Zuing. <hi>of</hi> Luth. tom. 2. in reſp. ad confut. Luth.
fol. 474. Luth. in Ench. praecum ann. 1543. Luth. in

               <p>Inſt. 2. <hi>Concerning the</hi> event of things, Luther <hi>holds,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52259:3"/>
That all things come to paſs through a certain Stoical and
Fatal neceſſity; <hi>for he defending this Hereſie, thus writes,</hi>
Nullius eſt in manu, &amp;c. It is in no man's power to think
good or evil; but all things (as <hi>Wickliff's</hi> Article, condemn'd
at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> did rightly teach) proceed from abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity.
<hi>And again,</hi> fate or articulum &amp;c. I do confeſs <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff's</hi>
Article, of all things coming to paſs by Neceſſity, to
have been falſly condemn'd in the Conventicle of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
[In aſſert. damnat. per Leonem, art. 36. Luth. de ſervo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio
c. 32.]</p>
               <p>Inſt 3. <hi>To the diſhonour of</hi> Chriſt's Paſſion, <hi>and alſo
to the Merit of his</hi> Redemption, <hi>he teaches, that Chriſt
not only ſuffer'd in Body, but likewiſe his Divinity
ſuffer'd too; for thus he writes,</hi> Cum credo, quod ſola hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana
Natura pro me paſſa eſt, Chriſtus vilis, nec magni prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii
ſalvator eſt, &amp;c. If I believe, that only the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Chriſt ſuffer'd for me, then is Chriſt a Saviour but of
a baſe and ſmall worth; and himſelf needeth a Saviour. <hi>And</hi>
Luther <hi>ſpeaking of this point in another place, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the</hi> Zuinglians; The Zuinglians did contend againſt
me moſt pertinaciouſly, that the Divinity of Chriſt could not
ſuffer. <hi>A Doctrine ſo Blaſphemous, as that it was refuted
not only by the</hi> Zuinglians <hi>in</hi> Luther's <hi>days, but even by</hi>
Beza <hi>too.</hi> [Luth. in Conf. Majore in Coena Domini. Vide
In Concil. part. 2. Ep. Theol. c. epiſt. 60.]</p>
               <p>Inſt. 4. <hi>Concerning the</hi> Adminiſtration of the Word and
Sacraments, Luther <hi>teaches,</hi> that all men (and women alſo)
have authority and power to adminiſter. <hi>Theſe are his own
words,</hi> The firſt Office of a Prieſt is to preach the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But this is common to all: Next, to baptize; and this alſo
all may do, even women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third Office is to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
Bread and Wine: But this alſo is common to all, no
leſs than Prieſts; And this I avouch by the Authority of Chriſt
himſelf ſaying, Do this in remembrance of me: Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all then preſent, and to come afterwards. If that then
which is greateſt of all is given indifferently to all Men
and Women (I mean the word and Baptiſm,) then that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52259:3"/>
which is leſs (I mean to conſecrate the Supper) is alſo given
to them. <hi>Thus</hi> Luther. <hi>Nay,</hi> Luther <hi>proceeded ſo far
herein, that (as Dr.</hi> Covel <hi>witneſſes, in his Defence of
Mr.</hi> Hooker, art. 15. p. 101.) <hi>he was not afraid to affirm,</hi>
that the Sacraments were effectual, tho adminiſtred by Satan
himſelf. <hi>With Dr.</hi> Cavel <hi>agrees the Proteſtant</hi> Hoſpinian,
<hi>thus writing,</hi> Lutherus eo uſque progreditur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Luther
proceeds ſo far herein, that he maintains the Sacrament to be
a true Sacrament, <hi>etiamſi a Diabolo conficeretur,</hi> tho it were
to be Conſecrated by the Devil. [Luth. tom. 2. lib. de Min.
Eccl. inſtit. fol. 368, 369. Vide lib. de abrog. Miſſa privata,
tom. 2. fol. 249. &amp; lib. de captivit. Babilon. c. de ordine. In
hiſt. Sacr. par. altera fol. 14.]</p>
               <p>Inſt. 5. <hi>For abſolute denial of Temporal Magiſtrates
(an Hereſie indifferently condemn'd both by Catholicks
and Proteſtants) we find</hi> Luther <hi>thus to write,</hi> Among
Chriſtians no man can, or ought to be a Magiſtrate; But every
one is to other equally ſubject, &amp;c. <hi>And again,</hi> As Chriſt
cannot ſuffer himſelf to be tyed and bound by Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
alſo ought not the Conſcience of a Chriſtian to ſuffer them.
[Luth. de ſeculari poteſt. in tom. 6. Germ. Luth. in tom. 7.
Wittenb. fol. 327.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſt.</hi> 6. Concerning <hi>Luther's</hi> denial of certain Books of
Scripture. And firſt, the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi> is call'd by
<hi>Luther, Contentious, ſwelling, ſtrawy, and unworthy an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Spirit.</hi> The Book of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is alſo rejected
by <hi>Luther,</hi> by the acknowledgment of <hi>Bullinger,</hi> for which
he ſays <hi>good and learned Men were offended with him.</hi>
I will add <hi>Luther's</hi> contempt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſome of the
Apoſtles: againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> he thus writes, <hi>Habuit Moyſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecunda
labia, irata, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>Moyſes habuit labia dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſa
felle &amp; ira.</hi> Of St. <hi>Peter</hi> he ſays, <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>did live,
and teach,</hi> extra Verbum Dei, <hi>contrary to the Word of God.

Inſt. 7. Luther <hi>alſo taught an Hereſie whereby the
Propagation of Chriſtian Religion is much endanger'd;
to wit,</hi> That it was not lawful to wage War againſt the
Turks; <hi>his words are theſe,</hi> Praeliari contra Turcas, eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnare
Deo viſitanti iniquitates noſtras per illos. To wage
War againſt the Turks, is to reſiſt God viſiting our ſins by
them. <hi>Of which</hi> Eraſmus <hi>thus writes,</hi> Many of the <hi>Saxons</hi>
following herein that firſt Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> deny'd to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
and K. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Aid againſt the Turks, <hi>&amp;c. declaring,</hi>
they had rather fight for a Turk not Baptized, than for a
Turk Baptized. [Luth. in tom. 2. Witt. In aſſert. damnat.
per Leonem decimum aſſert. 34. In ep. ad fratres Inferioris
Germaniae.]</p>
               <p>Inſt. 8. <hi>Concerning</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> good Works, Luther <hi>taught
an Hereſie diſallow'd by all learned Proteſtants. He ſays,</hi>
It is impiety to affirm, that Faith without Charity juſtifies
not. <hi>Nay he adds further,</hi> Fides niſi ſit ſine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Except
Faith be without the leaſt good Works, it doth not juſtifie;
nay it is not Faith. <hi>And laſtly, the more to debaſe good
works, he thus ſaith,</hi> Works take their goodneſs of the
Worker; and no Work is diſallow'd of God, unleſs the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
be diſallow'd before. [Luth. upon Gal. Engliſh'd, in

               <p>Inſt. 8. <hi>Finally, to omit divers other points, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
Luther <hi>never diſſented from the Church of</hi> Rome,)
Luther <hi>ever maintain'd, that</hi> the Government of the Church
is Monarchical, <hi>and neither</hi> Ariſtocratical <hi>nor</hi> Popular: <hi>of
which point</hi> Luther <hi>thus writes;</hi> Cum Deus voluerit, &amp;c.
Seeing God would have one Catholick Church, throughout the
whole World, it was needful, that one People, <hi>imo unum
aliquem Patrem iſtius unius populi eligi,</hi> yea ſome one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this one People ſhould be choſen, <hi>ad quem &amp; ſuos

               <p>Thus much to ſhew, that <hi>Luther,</hi> after his Revolt from
the Catholick Church, did ſtill retain many Catholick
Doctrines, that are denied by modern Proteſtants, and
conſequently was no <hi>true Proteſtant.</hi>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS in Anſwer to the Vindication of Martin
Luther's Spirit, Printed at the Theater in Oxford.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Vindicator</hi> of <hi>Luther's Spirit</hi> ſeems to have writ with
the <hi>ſame ſpirit.</hi> His firſt Cavil is at the <hi>Conſiderer's</hi> Rule
of trying the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of the Teachers of new Doctrines, <hi>by their
fruits.</hi> And he is willing (p. 2.) to ſtand to this Teſt, and that
<hi>Luther's ſpirit</hi> ſhould be try'd by his <hi>morals;</hi> but yet he ſees
no neceſſity neither of his ſubmitting to ſuch a Rule (the reaſon is
obvious, of which more afterwards,) and therefore he chuſes
rather to appeal to St. <hi>John, 1 Ep. 4. 2. every ſpirit that confeſſeth
that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God.</hi> But certainly
ſuch Confeſſion muſt be fruitful of good Works, or elſe what
differs it from that of the Devils. But be the ſenſe of this Text
as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> would have it, yet <hi>Luther</hi> gains nothing by
it: For he that denies that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is Conſubſtantial with the
<hi>Father, is not of God.</hi> But this did <hi>Luther,</hi> as is evident from
the Inſtance of his <hi>hatred</hi> to that Article of the Chriſtian
Faith.</p>
                  <p>Next, The <hi>Vindicator</hi> endeavours to clear <hi>Luther</hi> of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifidean</hi>
Doctrine, contrary to <hi>Luther's</hi> own words cited by the
<hi>Conſiderer,</hi> as alſo <hi>Inſt.</hi> 8. in this Paper.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Concerning <hi>Luther</hi>'s vilifying Vows, Acts of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
Pennance, ſingle Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before he makes any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
he puts the Queſtion, why the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> in giving ſo long
a Liſt of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrines, ſlipt that of <hi>Indulgences?</hi> For the
Anſwer of which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is referr'd to the <hi>Conſiderer</hi>'s
Tract of <hi>Pennances</hi> and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> that for ſo many years has
baffled the moſt Celebrated of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and
therefore may ſafely defy his leſs conſiderable Pen. As to the
Charge againſt <hi>Luther</hi> concerning Vows, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> replies,
that <hi>Luther</hi> was not utterly againſt them. But yet afterwards
he pleads for the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Luther</hi>'s breaking his Vows,
without aſſuring us, that he could not by continuing in his
Cloyſter, and uſing the ordinary means of Prayer and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
have kept them. That Text of <hi>Scripture</hi> urg'd by the
<hi>Vindicator, All men receive not this ſaying, Mat.</hi> 9. 1. does not
prove, that God denies this Gift to any, or that any ever fail'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52259:6"/>
the attaining of it that ſincerely endeavour'd after it: Tho the
Church of <hi>England</hi> Verſion in favour of this looſe opinion (to
ſay no worſe of it) has in this place corrupted the Original.
And thereupon the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſeems to applaud <hi>Luther</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing
his Habit, his Canonical Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſake of
<hi>Bora,</hi> (a Proſtitute Nun, a fit Mother of ſuch a Reformation,)
as incapable of Marriage as himſelf. <q>For how could he have
the leiſure and the retiredneſs of the Cloyſter (ſays the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator)</hi>
to perform all thoſe Acts of Devotion, when the
Burthen of the Reformation [and <hi>Bora]</hi> lay upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</q>
But if I well remember, the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> killing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that <hi>Luther</hi> might break his Vow and Marry, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Coſterus</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis leſs ſin for Prieſts to Fornicate than to Marry.</hi>
Therefore for <hi>Luther</hi> to Marry was no ſin. A wiſe Conſequence!
But ſuppoſe this Quotation out of <hi>Coſterus</hi> to have its full force;
yet if he held Fornication a mortal damnable ſin, as certainly
he did, neither Prieſts nor the <hi>Vindicator</hi> would be any gainers
by it; for both he that <hi>fornicates,</hi> and he that <hi>marries</hi> after
Vows, are equally liable to eternal Damnation. But if <hi>Luther</hi>
could have liv'd continently, as he ſays he did whilſt a Monk,
(and nothing appears to ſhew he could not) what can be alleg'd
in defence of his doubly wicked ſacrilegious Marriage?</p>
                  <p>4. To the Objections of <hi>Luther's</hi> rejecting the Authority of
the preſent Church, and the denying it to be a true Church,
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> knows not what to anſwer. However, to blind
the matter, ſomething muſt be ſaid, and therefore the Church
which <hi>Luther</hi> contemn'd muſt be the <hi>Court of Rome.</hi> But then
to the Queſtion, which himſelf puts, concerning the <hi>Viſibility of
the Church for many Ages,</hi> even according to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Note of
it, <hi>viz. the true and ſincere preaching of the Word,</hi> he gives you
no other Anſwer than what might be expected from an ordinary
<hi>Quaker; That in all that dark midnight of Popery</hi> (Midday is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſome ſort of Creatures) <hi>which filled the Earth for ſo many
Ages there were ſtill ſome Gleams of Light, ſome Witneſſes that aroſe
to give Teſtimony to the Truth, to proteſt againſt Innovations:</hi> But
whether thoſe Gleams, thoſe Witneſſes, were <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi>
or <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> or <hi>Cranmerians,</hi> or <hi>Parkerians,</hi> he knows
not. They ſeem to me to have been an inviſible people, and
(like the <hi>Spaniſh Black-Bills</hi> in <hi>Oates's</hi> Plot) to have liv'd under
ground; or at leaſt the ſaying there were ſuch people, may ſerve
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52259:6"/>
or a time to beguile the unwary, and to keep on foot and carry
on the <hi>holy Cheat.</hi> But inſtead of a proof that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Viſible Church of Chriſt, he refers us to a teſty ſaying
of <hi>Scaliger's,</hi> that has nothing of Truth in it.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſeems much offended, that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould
be charg'd with denying the Validity of the former Clergy's
Ordination: Yet he does not reflect, that <hi>Luther</hi> argued no true
Conſecration of the Euchariſt from the defect of Ordination, as
being convinc'd of it by the Devils argument. And as for the
Flouriſh he ſpeaks of, 'tis his own, not <hi>Luther's.</hi> Nor doth <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi>
proceeding in the Work of the Miniſtry prove, that he
own'd his Miſſion from the preceeding Church; but rather that
he look'd upon himſelf to have had an extraordinary Miſſion,
or otherwiſe what Authority could he pretend (and certainly
ſo great an Apoſtle would do nothing without juſt Authority)
to Ordain and Commiſſion others? Of which in its proper place.
To <hi>Luther's</hi> calling the Pope <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> Biſhops his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
and Univerſities his <hi>Lupunaria;</hi> the Vindicator ſeems to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
and applaud him in it; and I doubt not but he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
his Faggot towards the Burning of him in effigie. But
yet this is an Error exploded by learned Proteſtants, <hi>Hammond,
Thorndyke, Grotius,</hi> and others; and has been preach'd againſt
in this Univerſity by much learneder men than the <hi>Vindicator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I muſt beg leave to digreſs with the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> to two
groſs miſtakes of his, p. 27. whereby he thinks he has given the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a terrible blow. The firſt is, That to give an
inferior ſort of Cult or Reſpect to the Elements, is to worſhip
them with Divine Worſhip; which is falſe <hi>ex terminis,</hi> unleſs
it be true, that an <hi>inferior worſhip</hi> is the <hi>ſupreme.</hi> The ſecond
miſtake is, That for a Prieſt to <hi>operate the preſence of the Body
and Blood of Chriſt</hi> (which Church-of-<hi>England</hi> Miniſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to do after their faſhion) is neither more nor leſs than to
<hi>make God.</hi> So then to <hi>operate the preſence of a thing</hi> is to <hi>make the
thing.</hi> To <hi>operate, e. g.</hi> in Baptiſm <hi>the preſence of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>
is to <hi>make the Holy Ghost.</hi> And ſo alſo to <hi>occaſion</hi> the preſence of
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi> in the Divinity or Logick School, would
<hi>make him a Vindicator of Luther;</hi> which is utterly impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>5. To <hi>Luther's</hi> rejecting Councils, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> writes <hi>pro</hi>
and <hi>con;</hi> 1. That he did ſo, when (in his private Judgment)
they went contrary to Scriptures; and ſo (ſays he) do all the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52259:7"/>
                     <hi>Reformed;</hi> he might have added, and all Hereticks in the world,
all of them preferring their <hi>private interpretation</hi> of Scripture to
that of the Church: But ſecondly, <hi>Luther</hi> did not ſo, becauſe
<hi>he never refus'd</hi> (if we may believe his Defender) <hi>to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Authority of a Council legally ſummon'd.</hi> The noiſe
of his Adverſaries (ſays the <hi>Vindicator)</hi> who were perpetually
crying Councils and Canons, when they had nothing elſe to
ſay for their Cauſe (and was not that enough?) might perhaps
force out an expreſſion or two from him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He had fire in his
temper, and a <hi>German</hi> bluntneſs, and upon theſe provocations
might poſſibly ſtrain a phraſe with too great freedom. And
what was the innocent freedom this <hi>Reformer</hi> took? It was only
to aſperſe the moſt ſacred and famous Councils that ever were,
the Apoſtolical at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Nicene,</hi> (ſubmitted to
by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves). Arguing from the Injunction of
the firſt, <hi>to abſtain from Blood and things ſtrangled</hi> (which was
only Temporary) that it is lawful not to obey the Decrees of
Councils. And ſaying of the ſecond, That its Canons were
Hay, Straw, Wood, Stubble; and particularly concerning the
Third Canon of that Council, prohibiting the Clergy to have
with them in their Houſe any Women unleſs their Mother,
Siſter, Grandmother, or Aunt, <hi>That he did not underſtand tbe
Holy Ghoſt in this Council.</hi> What? <hi>Has the Holy Ghoſt nothing
to do but to bind and burden its Ministers with impoſſible, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and unneceſſary Laws?</hi> And, laſtly, he affirm'd, <hi>That the
Christian Doctrine receiv'd more Light from the Children's Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm
than all the Councils.</hi> This one Text, <hi>beware of falſe
Prophets, Mat.</hi> 17. 15. (ſays ſwaggering <hi>Luther)</hi> may ſuffice
againſt the Authorities of all the Popes, Fathers, Councils, and
Schoolmen, who attribute to Biſhops and Miniſters the ſole
power of Judging and Deciding Controverſies. In the very
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the beſt that ever was before or ſince, even then
began they to make Laws and claim that power.—Wherefore ſince
ſuch an Error, and ſo great Sacrilege, has been able to prevail ſo
long, <hi>I will (and command) once for all, that thoſe Sophisters hold
their Prating, &amp;c.</hi> And is all this in a <hi>Reformer</hi> nothing elſe but
<hi>straining a phraſe;</hi> and ſo great a wickedneſs in him no ſin?</p>
                  <p>6. The Arraignment of <hi>Luther</hi> for ſpeaking contemptuouſly
of the Fathers, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſays is a rank Calumny. But is
at a Calumny to ſay he ſpeaks contemptuouſly of the Fathers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52259:7"/>
who was not afraid to aſſert, In the Writings of every one of
the Fathers how great Errors are there? how oft do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
themſelves? who is there of them that does not very
many times wreſt the Scriptures? Is not that a Contempt of
the Fathers, to call the <hi>Thomists.</hi> Blockheads, for proving the
<hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs</hi> by a multitude of the Fathers, and ancient
Cuſtom? And to averr, That if there be nothing to be reply'd in
anſwer to the Fathers, better however to deny all the Fathers
than grant the Maſs to be a Sacrifice? What <hi>Luther</hi> drolls upon the
Fathers in his Table-talk will not paſs with the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to have
been in earneſt, becauſe (I ſuppoſe) he thinks it was in his Cups.
But it is ſtrange, that his ſerious preferring <hi>Melancthon</hi> before
all the Fathers, ſhould by the <hi>Vindicator</hi> be call'd not an affront
or contempt againſt the Fathers, but a complement to <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon?</hi>
And yet ſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Learned, have been heard to ſay, That they do not ſee
why Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sherlock, &amp;c.</hi>
may not paſs for Fathers of as good Authority in the Church,
as St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Austin, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. To the Proof of <hi>Luther's</hi> ſetting up his own Authority
againſt the Church, and maintaining his own Doctrines as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
nothing is anſwer'd. The inſtance which the <hi>Conſiderer</hi>
gives, is the Doctrine of <hi>Conſubstantiation,</hi> wherein <hi>Luther</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
Certainty and Revelation in God's Word. Could any man
<hi>have perſwaded me</hi> (ſays <hi>Luther Epist. ad Argent.) there was
nothing but Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, he had much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
me. For being in great perplexity, I took great pains in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing
the point; I endeavour'd with all my might to extricate
and free my ſelf, as well perceiving I ſhould thereby very much
incommode the Papacy. But I ſee I am caught, there is no way
of eſcaping left me: For the words of the Evangelists [This
is my Body,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>are too plain and clear to be forc'd to any
other meaning.</hi> It is evident, that in this Doctrine <hi>Luther</hi> was
neither <hi>Catholick,</hi> nor Church of <hi>England Protestant.</hi> But yet
ſo much a <hi>Catholick</hi> he was, as to hold the <hi>real preſence of the
Body and Blood of our Lord in the Sacrament.</hi> Being forc'd to
it (as himſelf Confeſſes) by the words of Scripture. But how
one that holds a Doctrine ſo contradictory to the ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a Church of <hi>England</hi> man, ſhould deſerve the extravagant
Encomiums of the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> I cannot underſtand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52259:8"/>
8. To <hi>Luther's</hi> altering the publick Liturgy, and reforming
the Service of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> the Vindicator replies in great fury,
that the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> has miſtaken <hi>Hoſpinian.</hi> But yet he ſaves me
the labour of examining the Quotation, and rectifying the Folio,
by his yeilding the cauſe. For he confeſſes, that <hi>Luther</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to throw out all that Part of the Service of the <hi>Maſs</hi>
that made the Sacrament a Sacrifice. And what is throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, but Altering and Reforming the Service of the
<hi>Maſs?</hi> But then he ſays, <hi>Luther</hi> did not impoſe his Form
as obligatory. Not as obligatory; <hi>ſi quid melius illis revelatum
fuerit,</hi> if any new Revelation could ſupply them with a better.
But can any one ſay, he did not impoſe it as obligatory, before
and inſtead of the ancient Form of the Church? Or otherwiſe
what ſignified his writing a Book for the aboliſhing the moſt
ancient and venerable Service of the <hi>Maſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>Luther's</hi> taking upon him the Authority of Ordaining Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Miniſters, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> admits the fact; but ſays,
it was done not out of <hi>choice,</hi> but <hi>neceſſity.</hi> A worthy Anſwer!
What neceſſity was there? Were there no Biſhops in <hi>Germany</hi>
at that time? Or does it any where appear, that ever the Church
allow'd of any ſuch neceſſity? Yes, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> preſents us
with a well known paſſage of St. <hi>Austin, In Alexandria &amp; per
totum Aegyptum, Si deſit Epiſcopus conſecrat Presbyter.</hi> This
paſſage is well known not to be St. <hi>Austin's,</hi> but the words of
another Author, (ſee St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Works, <hi>Qu. de utroque Teſt.</hi> 101.)
Nor does the word <hi>Conſecrat</hi> ſignifie Ordaining: The <hi>Presbyters</hi>
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or any other place, being never permitted to Ordain
upon any pretence whatſoever. But <hi>Conſecrat</hi> here may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the ſame with <hi>Conſignat;</hi> and by this is meant Conſecration
of <hi>Chriſm,</hi> which tho proper to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> yet, it ſeems, in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
was done by <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Biſhop's abſence. But it was
not for the <hi>Vindicator's</hi> purpoſe to give the true ſence of this
paſſage: For if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordination fails, where will
the Church of <hi>England</hi> find Refuge, when her own Ordination
ſhall be call'd in Queſtion?</p>
                  <p>10. To <hi>Luther's</hi> ſentencing the Canon-Law, conſiſting of the
Decrees of Councils and Popes, to the Fire, and Burning them
in a ſolemn Aſſembly of the Univerſity of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
owns the fact to be true. But he denies that it was done
upon <hi>Luther's</hi> own Authority: For he had a Commiſſion as a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52259:8"/>
Preacher of God's Word; and he had taken an Oath at his going
out Doctor, to confound as much as in him lay all pernicious
Doctrines. A very ſolid Defence! <hi>Luther</hi> it ſeems did paſs
ſentence upon the Decrees of Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the confounding
Doctrines which in his own private Judgment he thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious:
But he did it as a Preacher of God's Word, and a Doctor,
not as the Arch-Reformer <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> But the <hi>Vindicator</hi>
diſtruſting this Argument, ſays, <hi>Luther</hi> had other motives. And
what were thoſe? His Books had been ſolemnly burnt at <hi>Rome</hi>
as Heretical: His own people were ſtartled at it; ſo that he was
fore't boldly to make Repriſals, to buoy up his Followers cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
A fair Conceſſion. The <hi>Church</hi> Cenſur'd <hi>Luther's</hi> Books
as Heretical, <hi>Luther</hi> returns the Cenſure upon the <hi>Church,</hi> and
Condemns her Decrees as pernicious. And yet this in a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
was no Uſurping an Authority, but only declaring his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
as the Scholars did at the <hi>Oxon</hi> Decree againſt <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>
and other <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> without knowing or being able to ſhew, that
thoſe Writers held any ſuch pernicious Tenets.</p>
                  <p>11. To <hi>Luther's</hi> pronouncing <hi>Anathema's,</hi> and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Reform'd</hi> that diſſented from him, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in a Queſtion, <hi>Is there no difference between a Judicial Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,
and a Wiſh of Execration?</hi> So that <hi>Luther</hi> might Curſe,
but not Anathematize his Diſſenting Brethren. The <hi>Monks,</hi>
ſays he, writ upon their <hi>MSS. Anathema</hi> to all that ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
them. I ſuppoſe he means by <hi>MSS.</hi> the Regiſters of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Statutes, and Donations belonging to Monaſteries: The
weight and effects of which Curſes (if we may believe Reform'd
Writers themſelves) are both felt and dreaded to this very day.
But the <hi>Vindicator</hi> after three or four unhandſom Sarcaſms, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to prove his point from the <hi>Conſiderer's</hi> own words, <hi>[Luther</hi>
requir'd not Conformity to his Doctrines out of any Authority
he claim'd to impoſe them, which Authority he renounc't;]
Here the <hi>Vindicator</hi> leaves off in the middle of a ſentence very
politickly, and like a <hi>Reform'd Controvertiſt,</hi> leſt the other end
ſhould ſting him. The ſentence goes on [but yet (which is
ſomewhat more) he required a Conformity to his Doctrines from
a Certainty of Divine Truth which he pretended to be in them]
And ſo the Obedience he refus'd as a Magiſtrate, he claim'd as
an Oracle; and would have his own pretended <hi>Apoſtolical cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Doctrine</hi> ſet up inſtead of the Church's Authority; and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52259:9"/>
thoſe that would not ſubmit, muſt expect his <hi>Apoſtolical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;</hi>
notwithſtanding it was eaſie for Diſſenters to produce
more reaſons for leaving him, than he could for leaving the
Church.</p>
                  <p>Yet this <hi>Certainty of Doctrine</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> calls <hi>Proteſtant
Certainty,</hi> and is much in love with it, and wonders the <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>
ſhould not underſtand it; I gueſs he means, when one of
ſo narrow a capacity as himſelf fully comprehends it. But I
dare challenge him and all his Party, to ſhew me which of the
Proteſtant Churches is the true, wherein this pretended Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Doctrine may be found. A little after, the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
compares <hi>Luther's</hi> Condemning his Brethren the <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi>
and their returning the Cenſure (notwithſtanding the
great difference between them in the point of the <hi>Real Preſence)</hi>
to the feud of <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
of <hi>Victor</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops, of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> The
very recital of this abſurd paſſage is a ſufficient Reflection.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>Luther's</hi> Evil-ſpeaking (ſo ill becoming an Apoſtle) the
<hi>Vindicator</hi> does not undertake to defend; but confeſſes it to be
ſuch as neither Friends nor Enemies could approve. However
he would have <hi>Luther's</hi> way of Writing to be the Humour of
the Age. But why ſhould then the <hi>Tigurine</hi> Divines blame his
<hi>Confeſſio Parva?</hi> That it was full-fraught with Nick-names, as
<hi>Devil, &amp;c.</hi> and other Unchriſtian terms of Reproach; ſo cramm'd
with lewd, naſty, ribaldry ſtuff; ſo full of anger, maliciouſneſs,
fury, and madneſs, that none (that were not as mad as <hi>Luther</hi>
himſelf) could read it without aſtoniſhment at ſo unfortunate
and unheard-of an Example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And another <hi>Zuinglian</hi> ſaid,
That God for <hi>Luther's</hi> pride had taken from him the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and given him a Lying one in it's ſtead. And does not the
whole current of Writers of his own time, in a manner, ſay the
ſame thing? For a Gentleman to write a ſcurrilous Satyr (even
upon an Heretick) may be a great fault; but for an Apoſtle to
be an Evil-ſpeaker, a Blaſphemer of Kings, of the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and of God Almighty himſelf, is certainly an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
Crime.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conſiderer</hi> obſerves of <hi>Calvin</hi> (another principal <hi>Reformer)</hi>
that he was of the ſame Spirit with <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and gave as
ill Language where he ow'd ſubmiſſion and obedience. This the
<hi>Vindicator</hi> calls ſtepping out of the way, and thinks himſelf not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52259:9"/>
oblig'd to take notice of it, becauſe perhaps leſs able to defend
him than <hi>Luther.</hi> In the ſame page the <hi>Vindicator</hi> takes up the
<hi>Conſiderer,</hi> for ſaying St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Example not Doctrine was falſe;
and will have St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Doctrine to have been falſe; and he
gives you this reaſon for it, <hi>Elymas</hi> withſtood <hi>Paul, Alexander</hi>
withſtood <hi>Paul,</hi> and they err'd in Doctrine, therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi>
Err'd in Doctrine. Why ſo? becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood him, and it is
highly probable that he withſtood <hi>Paul</hi> again, and ſo became an
<hi>Elymas.</hi> Good God! that ſuch a blaſphemous Argumentation
ſhould be Licens'd in a Chriſtian Univerſity. But I ceaſe my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when I hear that lately a whole Sermon was Preach'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Univerſity againſt this great Apoſtle, and paſs'd Uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd.</p>
                  <p>13. Proceed we next to <hi>Luther's</hi> famous Diſputation with the
<hi>Devil. Luther</hi> confeſſes it. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> will have it to have
been either a Dream or a ſtrong Temptation. But which ſhould
know beſt, <hi>Luther</hi> or the <hi>Vindicator?</hi> Mr. <hi>Walſingham,</hi> in King
<hi>James</hi>'s time, was convinc'd by it. He went to the King, as Head
of the Church, to be ſatisfied: The King ſent him to the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and he turn'd him over to his Chaplain
Dr. <hi>Covel</hi> for ſatisfaction, who had nothing to Reply, but what
Confirm'd this Gentleman in the belief of this ſtory of <hi>Luther</hi>
[and of the Devil's being the Author of the Reformation].
His Book call'd <hi>His Search,</hi> then Baffl'd the whole Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and remains unanſwer'd to this very day. This Argument
likewiſe convinc'd the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it after his Lapſe, ſays only, That for ought he knew it
might be a Melancholy Dream, (and it might not). No force
at all of an Argument in this; as indeed in none of his Replies to
his own Motives. Which made the Learned Proteſtants ſay, That
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> had better have ſleighted and contemn'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
than to have return'd ſuch weak Anſwers to them as were
not able to bring <hi>his own Old Mother</hi> back again to the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> To return to the <hi>Vindicator:</hi> Afterwards he ſeems to
own the Diſputation, and endeavours to vindicate the Devil's
Arguments, as being the ſame that are now uſed by the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi>
The Devil's firſt Argument; <hi>That in the Church</hi> (of which
<hi>Luther</hi> then profeſs'd himſelf a Member) <hi>there was no true Faith,
or knowledg of Chriſt, no true Prieſthood;</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> paſſes by,
as knowing that the Learned Proteſtants have left the Devil in
this point, and for him to appear on his ſide alone, would look
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52259:10"/>
ridiculous to his own Party. The Devils ſecond Argument was,
<hi>That according to Chriſt's Inſtitution the Priest ought not to Celebrate
the Bleſſed Sacrament alone,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> had done for many years;
The <hi>Conſiderer</hi>'s Anſwer is ſolid, and not touch'd by the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator.
Luther</hi> might have anſwer'd, That his partaking it alone
was not his fault: Nor yet the fault of others, who were no
way engag'd to Receive it with him ſo often as he Offer'd it. But
this did not hinder, that he might not partake himſelf, when
others did not. Nor was he oblig'd by any Precept of our Lord,
to forbear either Partaking or Offering, tho there were none to
Communicate with him. And as for the ſenſe of thoſe Texts of
Scripture urg'd by Satan (and now by his <hi>Vindicator)</hi> he was
to adhere, not to Satan's, or his Own, but the Church's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereon. And the Church always judg'd (as is manifeſt
from her practice) that the Conſecrator might partake alone
when no others preſented themſelves. The Devil goes on to
object, That <hi>Luther</hi> (in his publick <hi>Maſs)</hi> did not give the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
entire (becauſe not in both kinds) to the People. The
<hi>Conſiderer</hi> replies, That <hi>Luther</hi> might have anſwer'd the Devil,
as the Church doth her Adverſaries, That there is no Precept of
our Lord's commanding a neceſſary receiving in both kinds.
Neither modern nor ancient Church ſo interpreting the words
of Inſtitution; the ancient Church frequently giving the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi>
to Sick, and to Abſents from the publick Service, <hi>only in
one kind;</hi> holding that ſhe Offended herein againſt no Command
of our Lord. To this the <hi>Vindicator</hi> anſwers, That the Biſhop
of <hi>Meaux</hi> on this ſubject ſays the clear contrary. But then he
muſt ſay it contrary to the Fathers (St. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in the ſecond
Age, <hi>Eccl. Hier. c. ult. prope finem. Tertul. l. ad Uxor. St. Cypr.
Serm. de Lapſis. n.</hi> 10. in the third Age. <hi>St. Ambr. Orat. de ohitu
Satyr. &amp; Euſ.</hi> in the Fourth Age. In the fifth, <hi>St. Austin l. adv.
Julian, Pelag. c. 4. prope finem &amp; Tom. 2. Ep. 106. poſt medium.)</hi>
Leſt therefore the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſhould ſeem to have ſaid nothing,
he advances a ſtale Objection, many times urg'd, and as often
anſwer'd. I ſhould perhaps have paſs'd it by, had it not been
lately vigorouſly preſs'd by ſome of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Divines to a
ſerious Gentleman for the Confirming him in the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> The Objection pretends, that Communion in one
kind was Decreed in a Council with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of the Primitive Church. The Decree of the Council, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52259:10"/>
to this point, Defines, That altho Chriſt Inſtituted this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sacrament, and adminiſtred to his Diſciples in both the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of Bread and Wine, and that after Supper, <hi>tamen hoc non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi>
yet notwithſtanding ſuch Inſtitution, and adminiſtring in
both kinds, and that after Supper, yet the Church hath and doth
Obſerve and Command, That this Sacrament may not be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
after Supper, nor be receiv'd by any that are not faſting,
unleſs in ſuch caſes of Neceſſity allow'd of by the Church. And
in like manner, That altho in the Primitive Church this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was receiv'd by the Faithful under both kinds, yet for the
avoiding ſome Hazards and Scandals, this (the preſent) Cuſtom
was upon good reaſon introduc'd, of Conſecrating under both
kinds, and the Laities Communicating under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Bread
only; it being firmly to be believ'd, and no way to be doubted,
but that the whole Body and Blood of Chriſt is truly contain'd
under either <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as well that of Bread as that of Wine.
All ſides grant, that our Saviour Inſtituted in both kinds, and
that he did it after Supper; but where does it appear, that he
commanded all ſhould receive in both kinds, and that they
ſhould receive after Supper? And yet if he in his words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
commanded the one, he alſo commanded the other; for
both are equally contain'd in thoſe words. And if the Church
can Interpret and Command (as alſo the Church of <hi>England</hi>
does) that people ſhould communicate faſting, why may ſhe not
alſo Interpret and Command, that people ſhall receive in one
kind only? Thus much of this fraud. But is it not a ſhame,
that ſuch falſities ſhould be Authoriz'd by an Univerſity that was
Founded for the defence of Truth, and the increaſe of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
Church; and not for deluding of unwary Souls.</p>
                  <p>The Devil's next Objection againſt <hi>Luther's</hi> being a Prieſt is,
That the Mind and Inſtitution of Chriſt was, That other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
alſo ſhould communicate in this Sacrament; but <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
was Ordain'd not to give the Sacrament to others, but
to Offer Sacrifice. The <hi>Conſiderer</hi> replies, That according to
this argument, neither would the Prieſt have Authority to give
the Sacrament to himſelf. And beſides, that <hi>Sacrificare</hi> in the
Church's ſenſe, takes in alſo the diſtributing part. Here the
<hi>Vindicator</hi> pretends, that it is not the Church's ſenſe; and he
takes his argument from the Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent
(Cap. de Euch. §.</hi> 75.) There (ſays he) the Euchariſt is ſaid to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52259:11"/>
be Inſtituted upon a double account; the one, that it might be
a ſpiritual Food for our Souls; the other, that it might be a
Sacrifice for our Sins. From whence he infers, that certainly
the Miniſtring the Euchariſt to the people belongs to it as it is
the Food of our Souls; and therefore as a Sacrament, not as a
Sacrifice. The Church in this place holds, that it is Miniſtred
to the people as a Sacrament, but does ſhe not alſo hold, that it
is Offer'd to God Almighty as a Sacrifice firſt, and afterwards
diſtributed as a Sacrament? And does not the word <hi>Sacrificare</hi>
include both? The <hi>Vindicator</hi> would have baffl'd himſelf, if
he had but put down the remainder of the Paragraph; which
expreſly explicates the Euchariſt's being both a Sacrifice and a
Sacrament, by its Figure and Type the Paſchal Lamb, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt Offer'd by the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a Sacrifice, and then
Eaten as a Sacrament. But for a fuller account of the Church's
ſenſe, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is referr'd to her Decrees, where he will
find, that Prieſts have power given them of Conſecrating, Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Diſtributing the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as alſo to
Remit and Retain Sins, to Bleſs, Govern, Preach, Baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And is not all this more than to Offer Sacrifice? In this point
the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> are at odds. The <hi>Devil</hi> urges the
nullity of <hi>Luther's</hi> Orders, upon the account of his being a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
Prieſt.</hi> The <hi>Vindicator</hi> diſtinguiſhes upon him, That tho
the Form (of making him a <hi>Sacrificing Priest)</hi> ſhould be a little
defective, yet where the Church Intends to convey Orders, there
they are actually convey'd; and his being made a <hi>Sacrificing Priest</hi>
did not prejudice <hi>Luther's</hi> Orders at all. That is to ſay, he
might be <hi>a Sacrificing Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>a not-Sacrificing Priest,</hi> by the
ſame Form. Had he alſo, by the ſame Form, a new Authority
given him of beginning a new Ordination, that ſhould be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to that of the whole preceding Church? Theſe are the
<hi>Goliah-Arguments</hi> in which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> expoſes himſelf and
his Party to defie the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>The Devil proceeds to another Objection againſt <hi>Luther's</hi>
Orders, His uſing the Maſs as a Sacrifice Propitiatory for Sins,
contrary to Chriſt's Inſtitution. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> cloſes with
him, and waving the word Propitiatory, puts the Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be truly a Sacrifice? In which he might have ſatisfied
himſelf out of any of the Catholick Writers, who would have
told him, that the Maſs is a true, proper, unbloody Propitiatory
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52259:11"/>
Sacrifice for Sins; and that according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, who
at his laſt Supper gave his Body for his Diſciples, Offering it
up firſt to God as a Sacrifice, before he gave it to them as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>This is my Body which is given (to God) for you.</hi> And the
ancient Fathers are full of Teſtimonies to this purpoſe. See <hi>Bell.</hi>
The <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſeems not to have read the Fathers, and therefore
is advis'd to conſult them before he Replies, and take great care
how he denies the Daily Sacrifice of the Church, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
only Propitiatory Sacrifice for Sins.</p>
                  <p>13. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> takes no further notice of <hi>Luther's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:</hi>
But is very angry, that the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> ſhould meddle
with his Friend <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> another principal Reformer; and that
he ſhould ſay of him, that he alſo had a Viſit from an Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that help'd him to an Interpretation of <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi>
for the eſtabliſhing his <hi>Virtual Preſence;</hi> and that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
it, with this aſſeveration, <hi>vera narro adeoque vera, &amp;c. What
I tell you is true, nay ſo true, tho I would have conceal'd it, yet
my Conſcience forc'd me to utter what the Lord would have me
impart, notwithſtanding the many Scoffs and Jeers to which I know
I ſhall expoſe my ſelf thereby, &amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, that <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid
of it, <hi>That it was as clear as the Sun at Noon-day, that the Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Hereſie was nothing elſe but the Mockery of the Devil, who
had ſhamm'd Zuinglius with a ſorry but crafty Interpretation.</hi> This
Apparition to <hi>Zuinglius</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> calls an ordinary Dream,
as if he himſelf had had many ſuch. But does he not at the
ſame time deny the Teſtimonies of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther?</hi> And
he that will give the Lye to his own Party, even thoſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Vindicate, what Arguments can be ſufficient to convince
him! If ſuch a clear Diſcovery of the variety and ſubtilty of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's</hi>
temptations and wiles, as the <hi>Conſiderer,</hi> conſonant to the
Word of God, has made, (which all good men thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive),
is therefore rejected, becauſe it condemns the principal
Reformers out of their own Works and Confeſſions, what wiſe
man (that conſults his eternal good) will not rather abominate
ſuch Reformers than deny the Truth.</p>
                  <p>14. To the Reſemblance of <hi>Luther's</hi> Change of Religion in
ſeveral particulars with that of <hi>Mahomet's,</hi> the <hi>Vindicator</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
That he was almoſt tempted to return the kindneſs with
a Parallel between <hi>ſome body</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> Intimating, that every
one that leaves the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and becomes a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52259:12"/>
muſt be a <hi>Judas.</hi> And conſequently, that the Greateſt and
moſt Excellent Perſon in the Nation muſt be ſo too, and yet at
the ſame time remain the Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But he not daring to ſpeak out what he meant by <hi>ſome
body,</hi> chuſes rather to aſperſe Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> as if he had begun
a new Kingdom in the Church about fifteen years before <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
For the proof of which he gives us no Argument, and yet
he would have us believe it; tho at the ſame time Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on our ſide will not convince Proteſtants of <hi>Luther</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
a new Kingdom. As to the Book he mentions, call'd
<hi>Turco-Papiſmus,</hi> if he means by it, that <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are
<hi>Turks,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> will not bear him out
in it. Unleſs ſuch as lamented the taking of <hi>Buda,</hi> and wiſh'd
leſs proſperous ſucceſs to the Chriſtian Arms. But upon the
whole matter the <hi>Vindicator</hi> thinks the Parallel childiſh, and
the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> not skill'd in hitting features. Let us ſee then:
Did not <hi>Luther</hi> reſemble <hi>Mahomet</hi> in thoſe particulars urg'd by
the <hi>Conſiderer?</hi> As, 1. In rejecting the Senſe and Expoſition of
Scripture receiv'd in former times. This Innovator urging, that
the Senſe and Meaning of the Scriptures, as the other that the
Words and Writings thereof, were falſified. And was it not
<hi>Luther</hi> that ſaid, <hi>That he ſcorn'd to ſubmit himſelf or his Doctrine
to the Judgment of Biſhops</hi> (the Fathers of the Church), and
<hi>that the World had been long enough guilty of ſuch a fooliſh Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</hi>
And did <hi>Mahomet</hi> ever ſay any thing more rebellious?
2. Did not <hi>Luther</hi> reſemble <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the manner of his
Coming. Neither of them working Miracles, yet pretending to
an extraordinary Authority in Reforming the World. Both of
them deſtitute of the Virtues of the Holy Spirit, <hi>temperance, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
&amp;c.</hi> propagating their Principles, the one by his Railing
Tongue, the other by his Sword. Some of <hi>Luther's</hi> own Brood
ſaid of him, <hi>That he had much of the Evil Spirit in all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs,
very little of the meek amicable Spirit of God.</hi> Even his
Friend <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſaid little leſs, when he wrote to <hi>Calvin, That
for twenty years he had expected Baniſhment from</hi> Luther, <hi>upon
the account of ſome difference between them, concerning the Bread-Worſhip
of ſome of</hi> Luther's <hi>Followers.</hi> 3. Did not <hi>Luther</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<hi>Mahomet</hi> in Senſuality, and the indulging his Appetites;
pleading much for the Neceſſity of Marriage; ſcouting the
Counſels of Perfection and of a ſtricter Life, as Celibacy, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52259:12"/>
Poverty, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Diſpenſing with his own Vows.
The <hi>Vindicator's</hi> Argument, pag. 23. That <hi>Luther</hi> might Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with his own Vows without having recourſe to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church is <hi>new Divinity;</hi> for tho it be true, that no
Power in the Church can Diſpenſe where the cauſe is not juſt,
yet it is as true, that the Votary <hi>(v. g. Mart. Luther)</hi> is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of judging of the juſtneſs of the cauſe, or taking upon him
Authority of Diſpenſing in his own caſe. And therefore the
Reaſons that <hi>Luther</hi> and his <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſeem to offer, that his
Vow was not binding, ought to have been weigh'd in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and have paſs'd the Judgment of the Church: His own
private thinking his Vows null not being ſufficient to make them
ſo, unleſs his pretended extraordinary Miſſion could alſo give
him an extraordinary power of Diſpenſation. The <hi>Vindicator's</hi>
darling reaſon of <hi>Luther's</hi> picking out <hi>Bora, for the making the
Preſident he was going to ſet the more conſpicuous, and the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
openly, that the Quarrel between</hi> him <hi>and</hi> Rome <hi>was irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable,</hi>
is the publiſhing his own and <hi>Luther's</hi> ſhame. And what
he ſays againſt <hi>Celibacy</hi> (one of our Lord's Counſels of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that many that made profeſſion of it liv'd wicked lives, may
as fitly be apply'd againſt Matrimony (one of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments),
and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> as eaſily there be found (for I
do not read that any in thoſe Cities profeſs'd a ſingle Life), and
yet both <hi>Celibacy</hi> and <hi>Matrimony</hi> remain Holy Inſtitutions in the
Church of Chriſt for bringing Souls to Heaven. 4. Did not
<hi>Luther</hi> reſemble <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his attempting to degrade the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
receiv'd Head of the Church upon Earth, as <hi>Mahomet</hi>
did the Head thereof in Heaven; pronouncing the Chief Paſtor
of Chriſt's Flock <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the Church of God his <hi>Spouſe;</hi>
applying to him all the Marks of that great falſe Prophet, whoſe
ſteps <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf notoriouſly follow'd. The <hi>Conſiderer</hi> gives
more Inſtances of the Parallel: But I remember what the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
anſwers to the <hi>Conſiderer's</hi> preſſing <hi>Luther</hi>'s preferring
<hi>Turciſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi>
to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> That here his fancy had made a Gyant of a Windmill.
The <hi>Conſiderer</hi> had no thought of Windmills, but the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
it ſeems had, which made him ſlip (as he phraſes it) from
one Paragraph to another, without anſwering the Arguments
of any of them.</p>

Laſtly, To the <hi>Conſiderer's</hi> Sentence upon <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Saviour's Rule, <hi>(by their fruits you ſhall know them),</hi>
That it was eaſie to diſcern this Perſon <hi>(Martin Luther)</hi>
not to have been poſſeſs'd with the Good, but the Bad Spirit,
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſeems to anſwer, That one that teacheth true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may be a bad man; and that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles
and the Primitive Church is ne'r the worſe for ſuch men's Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. But he ſhould have obſerv'd, That <hi>Luther</hi> was no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Preacher, but the Beginner of a new Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Life ſhould have been like that of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> To
prove that it was ſo, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> parallels him with St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
p. 25. in <hi>wreſtling against Principalities and Powers, &amp;c.</hi> there enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating
the greateſt part of that Apoſtles Virtues; adding, I could
not forbear ſetting down this Panoply of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> wherewith
<hi>Luther</hi> compleatly arm'd himſelf in his Spiritual Warfare; and
I do not know whether this Deſcription belongs ſo juſtly to any
man as him ſince the days of the Apoſtles. And in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his Book he is more extravagant in the Praiſe of this
monſtrous <hi>Reformer.</hi> Such abſurdities need no Reflections. The
few Inſtances given in this Paper, more largely inſiſted on by
the Judicious <hi>Conſiderer,</hi> are I think ſufficient to ſatisfie any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd
Reader, That <hi>Luther</hi> was not a St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or indeed
any Saint, or good Chriſtian; but on the contrary, a Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Inſolent Oppoſer of the Catholick Religion, that under the
ſhew of Reformation divided the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If therefore what is ſaid in the <hi>Conſiderations of the Spirit of
Martin Luther</hi> be true, the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in her Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
and Abetting ſo notorious a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> in the <hi>very Act</hi>
of Separating himſelf from the Whole, True, Viſible, Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Church of Chriſt, muſt be <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> And that what is
ſaid in the <hi>Conſiderations, &amp;c.</hi> is true, evidently appears from
the preceding <hi>Reflections;</hi> wherein is briefly and plainly ſhew'n,
That the <hi>Oxford Vindicator</hi> has prov'd nothing to the contrary.</p>
