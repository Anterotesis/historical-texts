            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>They may well, for the like border of trees are not at this day in al the land again, for they be in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber within these walles two Hundred, foure-score, and eleauen, beside those other standing west-ward without, to the number of some foure or fiue and thirtie.</p>

and those which I remember so called, now stand on the the west side within these walles, the first of them at the corner of the middle walke west-ward, was first of all placed by Sir <hi>Leonard Hollyday</hi> then Lord Maior: the next on the corner north-ward at the steppes comming downe, by a Captaine, being a Gentleman of good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: the third by a Citizen, and Sonne to Sir <hi>Leonard Hollyday,</hi> which standeth next to his Fathers trée. There standeth néere vnto that, a trée called the two brothers, planted by two little boyes, and sonnes to a Citizen here in London, there is likewise a trée called the thrée sisters, by the name of thrée maydens that set it, and another the thrée brothers: there is a trée likewise on the north-west corner, which I saw set vp (called <hi>Stubs</hi> his trée) by one <hi>Christopher Stubs,</hi> one of the principal Porters of Black-well hall, a man well beloued, and of good credit. Many others were set vp by our Citizens, which I thinke néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to speake of, nor tell of the bountie they shewed to the worke-men, at the planting of these same trées.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Citiz.</speaker>
               <p>Onely as a punishment for those that lay any fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thing within these fields, or make water in the same to the annoyance of those that walke therein, which euill sauors in times past haue much corrupted mans sences, and supposed to be a great nourisher of diseases.</p>

               <p>The cost hereof they regard not, and the more they bestow hereon, the more honour they tye vnto our Citie, and the causers of these walkes hath deserued high commendations, making their posterities famous by these their déeds.</p>

               <p>Their purpose is not fully knowne, but surely their intents are inclined to bountifull procéedings, as I heare, the building of certaine houses for shelters for mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens hauing their clothes lying there a drying, if at any time it should chance to raine.</p>

               <p>All England may take example, at your Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Citizens, who not onely séeke for their owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but striue to profit others, shewing themselues good common-wealths men, and as they be called the Fathers of the Citie, so be they cherishers of the poore and succour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>

might shoote, nor the ancient persons walke for pleasure in these fields, but that either their bowes and arrowes were taken away, or broken, or the Citizens arested for walking, saying, that no Londoner ought to go out of the Citie, but in the hye wayes. This so gréeued the Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that in the sixt yeare of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Eight, a great number of the Citie, assembled themselues in a morning and a Turner in a Fooles coat, ran crying the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Citie, Shouels and spades, Shouels &amp; spades, by which meanes followed so many people, that it was a wonder to behold, and within lesse than thrée houres all the hedges about the Citie were cast downe, the ditches filled vp, and euery thing made plaine, such was the quicknesse of these diligent workemen, after this the fields were neuer more hedged in.</p>

               <p>First to shew you the first antiquity thereof, that place was in times past an Hospitall, commonly called Saint Mary Spittle, builded by <hi>Water Browne,</hi> Deane of <hi>Paules,</hi> in the yéere 1197. first named by him <hi>Domus Dei,</hi> but at the suppression of Abbies bring surrendred to King Henry the eight, it was valued to bee worth yéerely 478 pound, wherein was found (besides the ornaments of the Church) and other goods belonging to the Hospital, a hundred and fourescore Beds well furnished for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate of poore people, for it was an Hospitall of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe: but now touching the custome why thrée Sermons be made there in the thrée Holydayes of Easter wéeke, I
<pb facs="tcp:9689:9"/>
finde that in the yeare 1398. King Richard hauing procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Rome confirmation of such statutes &amp; ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as were made in the Parliament, begun at Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and ended at <hi>Shrew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bury,</hi> he caused the same confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to bee read and pronounced at Paules Crosse, and at Saint Mary Spittle in the Sermons, before al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Phillip Malpas,</hi> one of the Shriefes in the year 1439. gaue twenty shillings by the yéere, to the thrée Preachers at the Spittle. <hi>Steuen Foster</hi> Mayor in the yeare 1454. gaue forty poundes to the Preachers at the Spittle and <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse: I find also that the said house wherein the Mayor and Aldermen doe fit at the Spittle, was builded for that purpose of the goode, and by the executors of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Rawson</hi> Aldermen, and <hi>Isabell</hi> his wife in the yeare 1488. Likewise in the yeare 1595. the Pulpet being olde, was taken downe, and a new set vp, the Preachers face turned toward the South, which was before towards the west: Also a large House on the East side of the said Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, was then builded for the gouernors and Children of Christes Hospitall to sit in, and this was done of the goods of <hi>William Elkins,</hi> Alderman lately deceased, but within the first yeare the same house decaying, and like to haue fallen, was againe with great cost repated at the Cittyes charge.</p>
               <p>And now héere is to bee noted, that time out of mind, it hath béene, and is a lawdable custome in London, that on good Fryday in the after-noone, some especiall learned man, by appoyntment of the Bishops, hath Preached a Sermon at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse treating of Christes passion: and vppon the thrée next Easter Hollydaies, Monday, Teusday, and Wednesday, the like learned men, by the like appointment, haue vsed to preach on the fore-noones at the saide Spittle, to the same effect, and then on low sunday, one other learned man at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse, to make rehearsal of those foure former Sermons, either commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or reproouing them, as to him by the iudgement of
<pb facs="tcp:9689:9"/>
the learned Deuines was thought conuenient, and that done, he was to make a sermon of his owne study, which in all were fiue Sermons in one. At these Sermons so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally preached, the Mayor with his breathren the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are acustomed to be present, in their violet gownes at <hi>Paules,</hi> on good Fryday, &amp; in their Scarlet gownes at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spittle vpon Monday, and Teusday, on the Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in their violets, and on Low sunday in their Scarlets againe at Paules Crosse, which is vsed to this day.</p>
