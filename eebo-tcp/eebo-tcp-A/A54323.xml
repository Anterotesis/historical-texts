            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis History of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, is onely a small part of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary or Epitomy of the general History of <hi>France,</hi> which I have composed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King, and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his Majesty. It having been my intention onely to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all that might serve to form
<pb facs="tcp:29592:8"/>
a great Prince, and render him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reigning well; I have not thought it convenient to enter into a particular Recital of things, or to recount at length all Wars and Affairs, as Historians do, who are to write for all sorts of persons. I have onely took the Sum, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted those Circumstances I have judged the fairest, and the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive; leaving apart all the rest, to shorten matter, and to give in epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy an account of all that passed, which might inform the spirit of the King, without surcharging his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. This hath been my designe: if it hath not succeeded so well as could be wish'd, I hope, <hi>READER,</hi> that my Endeavour will appear praise-worthy. I doubt not but there are in this Work some Mistakes which I may not have perceived, but which cannot escape Eyes more
<pb facs="tcp:29592:8"/>
clear-sighted. The History is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with so many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that it is almost impossible not to be deceived in some: Yet I believe I have written nothing for which I have not my Warrant. And if you finde in any Author the contrary of what I have said, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to consider that our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians do in many things so differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, that who takes the judgement of one, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily contradict the other. In this diversity I have followed those whom I believed the best and most assured. I acknowledge likewise that I could not refrain borrowing from them whole Paragraphs where they have pleased me, and that I have thought I could better explain my self by their Expressions, then my own. However, if this be a fault, it is but a light one, and ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:29592:9"/>
pardoned, since ingenuously confest. For other more remarkable ones I may have committed, I presume on your goodness, that, <hi>Reader,</hi> you will not treat me with the utmost rigour; but that you will have as much indulgence for me, as I have in this Work had Zeal for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my King, and Affection for the good of <hi>France.</hi>

Renown conserves the Splendour of his fair Actions in the Hearts and Mouthes of Men, as lively and entirely as in the time of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.

               <p>In truth, Sir, that praise-worthy Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which your Majesty hath testified (when I presented our History to your reading) to come to this glorious Reign, and for it to leave behind seven or eight others of Kings that preceded him, is a most certain proof that you desire him for your Model, and that you have resolved to study his Conduct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it in the Government of your Estates. Your happy Birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your Inclinations whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Royal, lead you to it: The Hopes and Votes of your Subjects agree to it: The Necessities of your Kingdom, afflicted with the Miseries of the longest War it ever sustained, oblige you to it; and Heaven hath disposed you to it by so many Graces and eminent Qualities, that it would be difficult for you not to follow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29592:10"/>Yes, Sir, he hath to you, as well as to the King your Grandfather, given a generous Soul, good and beneficent; a Spirit elevated, and capable of the greatest things; a Memory happy and facile; a Courage Heroick and Martial; a Judgement neat and solid; astrong and vigorous Health: but he hath moreover given you one Advantage this great Prince ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had; that is, A Majestick Presence; an Air and Port almost Divine; a Person and Beauty worthy the Empire of the Universe, which attracts the Eyes and Respects of all the World, and which without the force of Arms, without the authority of Commands, will gain you all those by whom your Majesty shall make your Self be seen.</p>
               <p>I will not speak of the Prosperities of your Estates since your happy Advancement to the Crown; how you have been proclaimed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer as soon as King; how by the assisting Counsels of your great Ministers, your Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers have been extended on all sides, and your Enemies everywhere defeated: but I ought not to forget that singular Grace which Heaven hath conferred on you, by instructing you in the Catholick Religion, and in true Piety, by the continual Diligences and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Queen your Mother; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> which was without doubt wanting to the Youth of our <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You cannot, Sir, with so fair Dispositions, with so many super-excelling Favours of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, be confined beneath the Glory and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29592:11"/>
of this great Prince. Remember, if you please, that you have done me the honour to tell me more then once, that you ardently aspire to a like Perfection, and that you have no greater Ambition. All <hi>France,</hi> who at present have their Eyes upon you, rejoyce to see the Effects already second your Desires, and that you strive as puissantly to imitate, as you have passionaaely desired to hear the Recital of so fair a Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your Majesty knows that Wills pass but for Weaknesses, when they render not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves efficacious; and are so far from being worthy praise, that they condemn those who have them so much the more, because they see well what they ought to do, and have not the heart to attempt or enterprize it. The way of Vertue at first glance seems rude, but it conducts to the Temple of Glory; where it is certain we arrive not by simple Thoughts, and idle Discourses, but by Labour, Application and Perseverance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have often taken the Liberty to represent to your Majesty, That Royalty is no Infant-Mystery; That it consists almost altogether in Action; That a King ought to make his Duty his Delights; and, That he ought to know how to Reign; that is, how to hold himself the Helm of his Estate, the better to Conduct them with Vigour, Wisdome and Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Who knows not that there is no Honour in bearing a Title, without executing the Functions of it? That it is in vain to have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29592:11"/>
acquisted the best Knowledge, without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to reduce it into practice? That it is ridiculous to propose to our selves a great Model, unless it be effectually imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And in fine, that it is nothing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by heart all the Maximes of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if we apply them not to their right Use? Without lying, he that hath Eyes, and will not open them; who hath Arms, and will not take the pains to move them, is in a worse estate then the Blinde or the Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot dissemble, Sir, that unspeakable Joy I have sometimes conceived, when I have understood from the Mouth of your Majesty, <hi>that you would chuse rather never to have wore a Crown, then not your Self to govern it,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble those Infant-Kings of the first Race, who, as all our Historians say, served onely as Idols to the Majors of their Palace; and who had had no Name, but onely to mark the year in the Chronologie.</p>
               <p>But it will be enough to make <hi>France</hi> know how much your Majesty condemns that sleepy Lethargie, to tell them that you are at present resolved to imitate your Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who hath been the most active and most laborious of all our Kings; who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated himself with most Diligence to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Affairs, and who hath cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his Estates and People with most Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and most Tenderness. This is to declare that your Majesty hath taken a firm Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29592:12"/>
to put your hand to the Work; to know both the inside and outside of your Realm; to preside in your Counsels; to give feet and motion to all Resolutions; to have a continual Eye over your Revenues; to cause a true, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and exact Account to be given; to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Graces and Recompences to those of your Creatures shall prove worthy: in fine, fully and amply to enjoy your Authority. It is thus the incomparable <hi>Henry</hi> acted, whom we are about to see reign, not onely in <hi>France</hi> by right of Blood, but over all <hi>Europe</hi> by the esteem of his Vertue.</p>
               <p>In effect, since the first foundation of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, the History furnisheth us not with any Reign more memorable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great Events, more repleat with the wonders of Divine Assistance, more glorious for the Prince, and more happy for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then his: and it is without Flattery or Envy that all the Universe hath given him the surname of <hi>Great;</hi> not so much for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Victories, however comparable to those of <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi> as for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Soul and of his Courage: for he never bow'd either under the Insults of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or under the Traverses of his Enemies, or under the Resentments of Revenge, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Artifices of Favorites or Ministers: he remained always in the same temper, always Master of himself. In a word, he remained always King and Soveraign, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging other Superiour then God, Justice and Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29592:12"/>Let us then proceed to write the History of<note place="margin">The Life of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Great, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts.</note> his Life; which we shall divide into three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts.</p>

               <p>But before all, it is necessary we speak something briefly of his Genealogie.</p>
               <p>He was Son to <hi>Anthony de Bourbon,</hi> Duke of<note place="margin">His Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie.</note> 
                  <hi>Vendosme</hi> and King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and of <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Albret,</hi> Heiress of that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> descended in a direct and Masculine<note place="margin">Who <hi>Antho. de Bourbon</hi> his father was.</note> Line from <hi>Robert</hi> Count of <hi>Clermont,</hi> fifth Son to King St. <hi>Lewis.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This sage Pre-caution served well to his Descendants, to maintain themselves in the Degree of Princes of the Blood, which those

he who was destined to be an extraordinary Prince, should begin the first motions of his life in a Camp, at the noise of Trumpets and Cannon, as a true childe of <hi>Mars.</hi>

               <p>The Counsel of the King fearing to hazard all by a fourth Encounter, judged it more to the purpose to plaister up a peace with that<note place="margin">The peace of <hi>Arnay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-Duc.</hi>

               <p>During this time, our <hi>Henry</hi> exquisitely<note place="margin">1572.</note> dissembled his discontents, though they were very great; and notwithstanding those vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which might trouble his spirit, he cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed his visage with a perpetual serenity, and humour wholly jolly. This was without<note place="margin">His great dangers &amp; troubles at Court.</note> doubt the most difficult passage of his Life: he had to do with a furious King, and with his two Brothers, to wit, the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> a dissembling Prince, and who had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29592:22"/>
in massacres; and with the Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzon,</hi> who was deceitful and malitious; with Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> who mortally hated him, because her Divines had foretold his reign: and in fine, with the house of <hi>Guise,</hi> whose puissance and credit was at present almost boundless.</p>
               <p>He was doubtless necessitated to act with a<note place="margin">His wise &amp; prudent conduct.</note> marvellous prudence in the conduct of himself with all these people, that he might not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in them the least jealousie, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a great esteem of himself; make submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and gravity accord, and conserve his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Life: in the mean time he dis-engaged himself from all these difficulties, and from all these dangers, with an unparallell'd address.</p>
               <p>He contracted a great familiarity with the<note place="margin">He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts friendship with the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
                  </note> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was about his own age; and they often made secret parties of pleasure together: but he agreed not so well with the Duke of <hi>Alenzon,</hi> who had a capritious spirit; nor was he over-much troubled at his ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with him, because neither the King nor Queen-mother had any affection for this Duke.

               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:29592:22"/>He shunned likewise other snares laid for him, but yet not all: for he suffered himself<note place="margin">but lets himself be overcome by the beauty of Ladies:</note> to be overtaken with the allurements of some Ladies of the Court; whom it is said that Queen served her self expressly of, to amuse the Princes and Nobles, and to discover all their thoughts.</p>
               <p>From that time, (<q>for Vices contracted in the blossome of youth, generally accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men to their tomb</q>) a passion for women<note place="margin">which was his greatest weakness.</note> was the greatest feebleness and weakness of our <hi>Henry;</hi> and possibly the cause of his last mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: for God punisheth sooner or later those who wickedly abandon themselves to this criminal passion.</p>
               <p>Besides this, he contracted no other crimes<note place="margin">1572.</note> in this Court; and it ought to be attributed<note place="margin">He fell not into any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the horrible Vices of the Court.</note> to a particular grace of Heaven, that he was not infected with all; for there was never any more vicious nor more corrupted.

               <p>His extream malady gave birth to a league<note place="margin">A league made at Court, into which <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> enters.</note> made by the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> the Marshals of <hi>Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Cossé,</hi> and some Catholicks, with the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, to deprive the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother of the Government, and drive the <hi>Guises</hi> from the Court, where they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puissant.

               <p>The Queen-mother having understood these practices, caused him and the Duke of <hi>Alenson</hi> to be arrested and committed to Guard. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> saved himself happily in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Henry</hi> could not escape from the<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape as he desires.</note> Court so soon as he desired: he was diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watched, and his very Domesticks were as so many spies over him.

               <p>In the mean time the Queen-mother, who with so much diligence kept him at Court, could have been well contented he had been gone.

                  </note> it was the better: thus his fault will be worthy of excuse, nor can he be accused but for not having the true light.

but Atheists, and horrible wicked persons. It hath been held, that they followed him against his will; that truely he had served himself of them in some intrigues, but that it was himself who by secret advice obliged the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to demand their expulsion.</p>

A very sensible injury to a young Prince full of courage; but he knew most wisely how to dissemble it at present, because he had not power to revenge it; and generously forgot it, when he had the means to do it.</p>
               <p>About this time the League took birth, that<note place="margin">The birth of the League.</note> puissant faction, which for twenty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tormented <hi>France;</hi> which thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the <hi>Spanish</hi> Domination, and which would have renversed the order of the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Royal family, under the fairest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text in the world, to wit, the maintenance of the Religion of our Ancestors.</p>
               <p>At other times, under the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, there were divers Leagues and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociations made in <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> to defend the Church against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> (I leave it to judge whether those who rendred themselves Chief of them, had most Zeal, or most Ambition) but they were not pressed so

forward, nor so diligently formed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore became extinct. The Grandees of the<note place="margin">These Leagues a fair path for the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to rise by.</note> Realm however might by them observe, that if at any time such associations were made, it would be a fair means to elevate to a great height him who could render himself their Chief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who had a King-like<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> makes himself chief of the League.</note> heart, had in all likelyhood this thought; or if he at first had it not, the favorites of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, by persecuting him, forced him to entertain it, and to apply himself to this party, to defend himself against them. There were of his house seven or eight Princes, all brave to the utmost extent. The principal of them were the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de Guise</hi> his brothers, the Duke <hi>d' Aumarle,</hi> and the Marquiss <hi>d' Elbeuf</hi> his Cousins.</p>
               <p>Now the Evasion of <hi>Monsieur,</hi> of which we<note place="margin">The War of <hi>Monsieur,</hi> &amp; his joyning with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> the cause of the League.</note> have spoken, to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious peace after granted them, made the League show it self, which was but little in its commencement. Those who to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves puissant desired a new faction in the State, took this subject, to make it be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Emissaries the great danger in which the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion was, and to remonstrate the excessive puissance of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who had on their side the two first Princes of the blood, and <hi>Monsieur</hi> who was their friend. What would it be, said they, if he should come to the Crown with such ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? that therefore they ought to advise
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29592:29"/>
in good time, and fortifie themselves against that danger which threatned the holy Church. They whispered at present these Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other like them, into men ears; and when they had disposed their spirits, published them aloud.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Burgesses of <hi>Peronne,</hi> a free<note place="margin">The Cities of <hi>Picardy</hi> begin it, and why.</note> City, and which was accustomed to have so puissant a Governour, refused to receive the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> because a <hi>Hugonot.</hi> He made his complaints to the King, and demanded the execution of the treaty of peace. The <hi>Picards</hi> opposed him, and were the first that made a League or Union for the defence, as they said, of the <hi>Catholick, Apostolick,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> could never have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and was constrained to retire into <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>d' Humieres,</hi> was made Chief of this League in <hi>Picardy;</hi> and <hi>Aplincourt</hi> a young Gentleman took the Oath of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Peronne;</hi> by whose example the Cities of <hi>Amiens, Corbie,</hi> St. <hi>Quintins,</hi> and many others, did the like. <hi>Lewis de Tremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> began one likewise in <hi>Poictou.</hi> The Queen-mother secretly favoured this designe, to the end she might retain her authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these discords and disturbances.

hindred for the present the progress of this conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Those who were the first inventors of it, had deliberated among themselves, that to the end to give it means to aggrandize it self, and to keep the spirits of the people still warm, it was necessary to continue the war with the <hi>Hugonots:</hi> for this purpose, they stirred up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers persons who surprized their places, and committed a thousand affronts against our <hi>Henry</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> And much<note place="margin">The Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the King to call the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.

                  </note> more, they raised so many factions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints on all sides, of people who demanded the summoning of the Estates, that the King was obliged to agree to it. They assembled then at <hi>Blois,</hi> and began in the month of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> in the year 1575. The <hi>Hugonots</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were not at all troubled at this Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, because they imagined that the third Estate, which ordinarily is the strongest, and which hath most reason to apprehend the war, would cause the peace to be confirmed: but<note place="margin">War resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Juncto</hi> of those which were for war, was so strong, that it was resolved puissantly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute it.</p>
               <p>They judged it notwithstanding convenient to depute before-hand some persons of the Assembly to our <hi>Henry</hi> and to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> to exhort them to return into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the Catholick Church.

               <p>The Treaty being concluded, the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother<note place="margin">1578.</note> made a voyage into <hi>Guyenne:</hi> she<note place="margin">She makes a voyage to <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and carries with her her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi>

Henry</hi> now kept his little Court at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac:</hi> he had before kept it at <hi>Agen,</hi> where he was beloved of the people by reason of his justice and goodness: But it happened, that at a Ball<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> looses <hi>Agen</hi> and <hi>la Reole</hi> by two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of youth.</note> or Dance some young people of his own train blew out the Candles, to commit insolencies; which so scandalized the inhabitants, that they delivered their City to the Marshal of <hi>Byron,</hi> whom the King had sent Governour into the Province of <hi>Guyenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little time after, <hi>Henry</hi> likewise lost <hi>la Reole</hi> by another folly of his young people. He had given the Government of it to an old <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi> Captain named <hi>d' Ussac,</hi> who had his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29592:30"/>
horribly deformed: his deformity how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hindred him not from becoming passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of one of the Ladies attending the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; for she had brought many of the most bewitching with her, to kindle a fire eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. The Viscount of <hi>Turenne,</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> aged at present about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one or twenty two years, with some others of his age, would make Raillery of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: our <hi>Henry,</hi> instead of commanding them silence, made himself of their party; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fluent spirit, assisted them in lancing out some mocks &amp; jeers against this doting Lover. There is no passion renders a heart so sensible as this. <hi>Usac</hi> could not suffer this Raillery, though proceeding from his Master; but in prejudice of his Honour and Religion, he yeilded and delivered up <hi>la Reole</hi> to <hi>Duras;</hi> a Lord who having been in favour with our <hi>Henry,</hi> had quitted him, out of envy, because he testified less affection to him then to <hi>Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laire,</hi> who was without doubt one of the most honest and most pleasant men of his time.</p>
               <p>These two losses of <hi>Agen</hi> and <hi>la Reole,</hi> gave him, and ought to give all Princes, two very necessary instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The first, that a Prince ought well to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern<note place="margin">Two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</note> his Courtiers; the rather, because all their disorders are imputed to him: and that it is presumed when they do them, that it is himself commits them, because obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to hinder them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:29592:31"/>
                  <q>The second, that above all things he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from Raillery: for there is no Vice which makes so many enemies, nor which is more dangerous, because others may be concealed. Such a word as issuing from the mouth of a particular person, would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but a light jest, is like a stab of a ponyard from that of a Prince; and leaves in the heart mortal resentments. Nor must great ones be flattered with this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their subjects or their inferiours ought to suffer all things from them: for where honour is concerned, the more the person that wounds is superiour, the greater is the wound; as the impression of a body is deeper, the more feet it hath, and the higher it falls.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen-mother had taken with her, as<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-well love her husband, nor he her:</note> we have said, Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> to her husband. Neither the one nor the other of the two Spouses were over-well content. <hi>Margaret,</hi> who loved the splendour of the <hi>French</hi> Court, where she swam, if we may so speak, in full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, believed to be in <hi>Guyenne</hi> was a kind of banishment: and <hi>Henry,</hi> knowing her humour and carriage, would rather have chose her room then her company. However, seeing it a remediless ill, he resolved to suffer it; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her an intire liberty: he considered her rather as a Sister of his King, then as his Wife. He likewise pretended some nullities in the Marriage, but attended time and place to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29592:31"/>
make them known. In the mean time, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating himself to the season, and to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity<note place="margin">but he draws ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from her intrigues.</note> of his affairs, he endeavoured to draw advantages from her intrigues, and from her credit. He received no small one in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which he and the Deputies of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> had at <hi>Nerac</hi> with the Queen-mother: for whilst she thought to inchant them by the charms of those fair Ladies she had expresly brought with her, and by the eloquence of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac; Margaret</hi> opposed the same Artifices, gained the Gentlemen who were near her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the attractions of her Ladies; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed so well her own, that she enchanted the spirit and will of the poor <hi>Pibrac</hi> in such manner, that he acted not but by her motion, and quite contrary to the intentions of the Queen-mother, who, not distrusting that a man so wise could be capable of so great folly, was deceived in many Articles, and insensibly carried to grant much more to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> then she had resolved.</p>
               <p>Scarce were eight months spent since the peace, but the Queen-mother, <hi>Monsieur</hi> and<note place="margin">The Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, <hi>Monsieur</hi> &amp; the <hi>Guises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> weary of the peace.</note> the <hi>Guises,</hi> began to be weary of it. The Queen-mother, because she would not have the King rest any long time without having need of her Negotiations and intermission: <hi>Monsieur,</hi> because by re-kindling the War, he thought to render himself redoubtable to the King, and to make him give him forces to carry into the Low-Countries; which being revolted from <hi>Spain,</hi> demanded him for their Soveraign:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29592:32"/>
And in fine, the <hi>Guises,</hi> because they feared lest the ardour of the League should by too long a calm, grow cold.</p>
               <p>In these wishes, they pressed the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand<note place="margin">1579.</note> the places of security granted to the<note place="margin">They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand perswade the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to a Rupture;</note> 
                  <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and under-hand <hi>Monsieur</hi> and the Queen-mother caused it to be told to our <hi>Henry,</hi> that he should not surrender them, but hold it out that his cause was just, and that his safety consisted in his Arms. <hi>Margaret,</hi> who knew his weakness, and who likewise wisht the War, excited him by the perswasion of Ladies whom she fostered to this designe; and by the same means animated alike all those braves who approached her; nor spared she her self with the Viscount of <hi>Turenne</hi> for this purpose: so that this Prince, possibly with very little ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and certainly to very ill purpose, was carried to a rupture, and engaged the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in a new Civil War, which was named for the reasons I but now spake of, <hi>The War of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the most disadvantagious they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">which proves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to him.</note> yet made: by it they lost a great quantity of strong places; and were in such manner weakned, that had the pursuit of them been finished, they could never have regained strength.

                     <hi>Monsieur</hi> procures the peace.</note> all the forces both of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party into the Low-Countries, made himself Mediator of the peace, and obtained it by an Edict, which was concluded after the Conference of <hi>Fleix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:29592:32"/>This peace was the cause of almost as many evils to the Estate, as all the former Wars had<note place="margin">Of much damage to the Estate, being the cause the two <hi>Henries</hi> plunged themselves in pleasure</note> been.

themselves despised; in such manner, that they rendred themselves odious to all the world: and the hate carried to them, fell likewise upon the King, whilst that violence which they obliged him to use towards his Parliaments, to confirm his Edicts of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Imposts, augmented it yet more: for if his Authority made his Wills pass as absolute, he drew the peoples curses; and if the vigour of the Soveraign companies, as often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, stopt them, he attracted their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>
               <p>The people, who easily licentiate themselves to Rebellion against their Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they have lost for him all sentiments of esteem and veneration, spoke strange things of him and his favorites. The <hi>Guises,</hi> (whom the Minions<note place="margin">Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the League, &amp; to the loss of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</note> (for so the favorites were called) opposed in all occasions, endeavouring to deprive them of their Charges and Governments, to re-invest themselves) were not wanting to blow the fire, and to increase the animosities of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; particularly of the great Cities, whom favorites have always feared, and who have always hated favorites. These were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Dispositions to the aggrandizing the League, and to the loss of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>It is not to our purpose to recount here: all<note place="margin">1584.</note> the intrigues of the Court during five or six years; nor the War of the Low-Countries, from which <hi>Monsieur</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29592:33"/>
but disgrace. It is onely necessary to tell, that in the year 1684. <hi>Monsieur</hi> died at <hi>Castle-Thierry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The death of the Monsieur begets thoughts of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor to the Crown.</note> without having been married; that <hi>Henry</hi> the third had likewise no Children; and that it was but too well known he was unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ever having any, by reason of an uncurable disease which he contracted at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> in his return from <hi>Poland.</hi> See here the reason why, as soon as <hi>Monsieur</hi> was judged to death by the Physitians, the <hi>Guises</hi> and Queen-Mother began to labour each on their side to assure themselves of the Crown, as if the succession had been open to them: for neither the one nor the other accounted for any thing our <hi>Henry;</hi> so much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was beyond the seventh degree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which in ordinary successions is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no kindred; and because he was not of that Religion, of which all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have been since <hi>Clouis,</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence incapable to wear the Crown, or bear the Title of <hi>Thrice-Christian.</hi> Adde to this that he was two hundred Leagues distant from <hi>Paris,</hi> and as it were shut up in a corner of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> where it seem'd to them easie to<note place="margin">The Queen-Mother designs to give the Crown to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of her daughter married to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
                  </note> ensuare him or oppress him.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother had a design to give the Crown to the Children of her Daughter married to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom she would have treated as Princes of the bloud, as if the Crown of <hi>France</hi> could fall under the command of the Spindle. Nor was she carried to this onely out of the love she had for them,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29592:34"/>
but out of a secret hatred she had conceived against our <hi>Henry,</hi> because she saw that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all her wishes, heaven opened him a way to come to the Throne.</p>
               <p>Besides, she was too much deceived, for so able a woman, to believe that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> would favour her in her design: there<note place="margin">A belief that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to Reign himself.</note> was much appearance, and after affaires suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently testified it, that seeing himself per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the Favorites, and ill treated by the King himself, for their sakes he had thoughts to assure the Crown for his own head. <q>For ill treatments work at least no other effect then to cast into extreme despaire, Souls so Noble and Elevated as that of this Prince.</q> But he knowing well that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he could not arrive at so high a pitch, and that specially because it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to divert the affection which the people of <hi>France</hi> naturally have for the Princes of the Bloud; he advised himself to gain the old Cardinal <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> who was Uncle of our <hi>Henry:</hi> he promised him therefore, that the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third Arriving, he would employ all his power, and that of his Friends, to make him King: and that good man doting with age, permitting himself to be flattered with these vain hopes, made himself the Bauble of the Dukes Ambition, who by this means drew to his party a great number of Catholiques, who considered the house of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Question was, if the Uncle ought to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29592:34"/>
precede the Son of the Elder Brother in the Succession: and to speak truth, the business was not without some difficulty, because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custome of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Capital of the Realm, and many other Customes, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral representation hath no place. This point of right was diversly agitated by the Reverend Judges; and many treats were had, some in favour of the Uncle, and others of the Nephew: but these were but Combats of words; the sword was to decide the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. It seemed to many great Polititians, that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> acted contrary to his own interests and design, by acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> ought to Succeed to the Crown; this being to avow, that after his death, which could suffer no long delay, it would appertain to our <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry</hi> 3. knew his design, or was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of it by his favorites.

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> 3. knew well his design, or rather was advertised of it by his Favorites, who saw in it their certain ruine, and therefore so much desired to bring back the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, to the end he might deprive the <hi>Leaguers</hi> of that specious Pretext they had to entertain the <hi>League:</hi> He sent therefore to him the Duke <hi>d'Espernon,</hi> who Essayed to Convert him by reasons of interest and policy. Our <hi>Henry</hi> hearkened to him; but he testified that those were not motives sufficiently puissant to make him Change; and sent him back with many Civilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:29592:35"/>The <hi>Hugonots</hi> were so vain, as to publish and cause to be Printed the conference of this Prince with <hi>Espernon,</hi> to shew that he was unshaken in his Religion, and possibly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> profits himself of it.</note> to engage him more strongly in it. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was not wanting to profit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of it, and to remonstrate to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique people the stubbornness of this Prince; and what they might hope, if he came to the Crown with such sentiments.</p>
               <p>To stop therefore his way to it, he made the<note place="margin">The League Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> zealous openly renew the League; and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bringing it into <hi>Paris,</hi> where some new religious persons inspired this Ardour into peoples souls by Confessions, held the first publique Assembly at the Colledge de <hi>Fortet,</hi> which was called <hi>the Cradle of the League.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Burgesses, many Tradesmen, and likewise some Clerks of <hi>Paris,</hi> entred into it. They carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to <hi>Rome,</hi> and presented it to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. for his approbation; but he never<note place="margin">The Pope disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it.</note> would give it: and continually, so long as he lived, disavowed it.</p>
               <p>So soon as it grew a little great and strong, those who had engendred it, made it appear that it was not only to provide for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion for the future, but that at present they might approach themselves neer to the Crown; and that they not onely would have it against the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was<note place="margin">It is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</note> to Succeed, but against <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who now reigned: They kept in Salary certain new Divines, who durst openly sustain, that a

Prince ought to be deposed who acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not well of his duty: <q>That no power but that which is well ordered, is of God; otherwise, when it passes due bounds, it is not Authority, but Usurpation: and that it is as absurd to say that he ought to be King who knows not how to govern, or who is deprived of understanding, as to believe a blind man a fit guide, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Statue able to make living men move.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was retired to his Government of <hi>Champagne,</hi> feigning himself discontented; but it was to make the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> sign the League, out of hopes he would cause his Son to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Crown, to which he pretended to have right by his Mother, Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. He held to this purpose a<note place="margin">The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> where the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> enter into the League, &amp; furnish money.</note> Treaty at <hi>Joinville,</hi> where he likewise found Agents from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who signed to the Treaty, and as it was reported, did by Letters of Exchange supply the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> with great sums of money.</p>
               <p>At his departure thence, the Duke assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Troops on all sides: his friends seized<note place="margin">The League seize ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places.</note> on as many places as they could, not onely amongst the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> but likewise amongst the <hi>Catholiques.</hi> The King might easily have dissipated these Levies, had he taken the field. But the Queen-Mother, like to self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested Physitians, who would for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit augment the disease, withheld and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29592:36"/>
amused him in his Closet, perswading him that if he would leave to her the management of this affair, she would easily reduce the Duke to his obedience. To this purpose she<note place="margin">The Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother enters into conference with <hi>Guise;</hi> who breaks it when he sees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in an Estate to fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

               </p>
               <p>The King astonished, prayed his mother to conclude an accommodation upon any terms: which she did by the Treaty of <hi>Nemours,</hi> by which she granted to the Duke and other Princes of his house, the Government of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces, many great sums of money, together with a most bloudy Edict against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which forbad the profession of any other Religion then the <hi>Catholique,</hi> under Penalty of Confiscation of Goods and Estate; with Command to all Preachers and Ministers to depart the Realm within one moneth, and all <hi>Hugonots</hi> of what degree or quality soever within six months, or otherwise abjure their false Religion. This Edict was called the Edict of <hi>Juillet,</hi> which the League farther constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King to carry himself into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cause it to be ratified.<note place="margin">1585.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A little after arrived news from <hi>Rome</hi> that<note place="margin">Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, who succeeded <hi>Gregory</hi> the eighteenth, had approved the League, and had besides fulminated out terrible Bulls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and Prince of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29592:36"/>
                  <hi>Conde,</hi> declaring them Hereticks, Apostates, Chiefs, Favourers and Protectors of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and as such falling under the Censures and Pains concluded on in the Laws and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, depriving them and their descendants of all Lands and Dignities, incapable to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to any Principality whatsoever, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> and not onely absolving their Subjects from all Oaths of Fidelity, but absolutely forbidding them to obey them.</p>
               <p>It was now that our <hi>Henry</hi> had need of all<note place="margin">The vertue of our <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> the forces both of his Courage and Vertue to sustain so rude assaults. He seemed in a manner lull'd asleep by his pleasures: when the noise of these great assaults awakened him, he recalled all his Vertue, and began to make it appear more vigorously then ever before. And certainly he afterwards avowed that his enemies had highly obliged him, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting him in this manner: for had they left him in repose, that rest had possibly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed him in a corner of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and he not have been constrained to think of his affairs; so that at the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, he would not have been in an Estate to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or entertain the Crown.</p>
               <p>He now did two Actions of great renown:<note place="margin">He doth two noble actions.</note> the first, was his commanding <hi>Plessis Mornay,</hi> a Gentleman of excellent Education, and who could be reproached with nothing but being a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> to answer the <hi>Manifesto</hi> of the League by an Apologie, and by a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29592:37"/>
which he caused to be drawn. In this last piece, (the Chiefs of the League having spread abroad divers calumnies against his honour) he with all submission besought the King his Soveraign, that he would not be offended if he did pronounce, saving still the respect due to his Majesty, that they did falsely and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously lye: and moreover, that to spare the blood of his Nobles, and shun the desolation of the poor people, those infinite disorders, and above all, those blasphemies, burnings and violations which the license of War must cause, he offered to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> chief of the<note place="margin">He defies the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to single Combat.</note> League, to decide this quarrel by his person against his, one to one, two to two, ten to ten, or what number he should please, with Arms generally in use by Cavaleers of honour, either in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> or in such place as his Majesty should command, or else in such place as the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> himself should chuse.</p>
               <p>This Declaration had a great effect o'er peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples spirit. They said, That force could not justly be employed against him, who so far submitted himself to reason: and the greatest part of the Nobility approved this generous procedure; and proclaimed aloud, that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> ought not to refuse so great an honour.</p>
               <p>That Duke wanted no courage to accept the<note place="margin">Why the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted not the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> Defiance; but he considered, that drawing his sword against a Prince of the blood, was in <hi>France</hi> accounted a kinde of Parricide; that otherwise he could willingly have reduced
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29592:37"/>
the cause of Religion, and of the Publick, to a particular Quarrel. He therefore prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered, That he esteemed the person of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and would have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with him; but that he onely interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself for the Catholick Religion, which was threatned; and for the tranquillity of the Kingdome, which onely and absolutely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the unity of Religion.</p>
               <p>His other Action was thus. Having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood<note place="margin">The other gallant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> the noise of those paper-Thunder-bolts which the Pope had thrown out against him, he dispatched one to the King to make his Complaints to him; and to remonstrate to him, That this procedure concerned his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty nearer then himself; That he ought to judge, That if the Pope took upon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide concerning his succession, and should seize to himself a right to declare a Prince of the blood unable of the Crown, he might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards well pass further, and dethrone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as <hi>Zachary</hi> is reported to have formerly degraded <hi>Childeric</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Upon these Remonstrances, the King hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the publication of those Bulls in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. But our <hi>Henry,</hi> not contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">He causes to be fixed up at the corners of the chief streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5.</note> there with, knowing himself to have friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> proved so hardy as to fix his and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> his opposition at the corners of the chiefest streets of the City: by which those Princes appealed from the sentence of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Peerage</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> giving the Lye to whoever accused them of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29592:38"/>
the crime of Heresie; offering to prove the contrary in a general Council: and in the end, professing that they would revenge upon him, and upon all his successours, the injury done their King, the Royal Family, and all the Courts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>It could not but be supposed, that this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position<note place="margin">who at first is incensed, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stèem for him.</note> would incense to the utmost the spirit of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth; and indeed at first he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified a very furious emotion. However, when his Choler was a little asswaged, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the great Courage of that King, who at such a distance had known how to revenge himself, and fix the marks of his resentment even at the gates of his Palace: in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he conceived so great an esteem for him, (so true is it, that Vertue makes it self be reverenced by its very enemies) that he was often afterwards heard say, That of all those who reigued in <hi>Christendome,</hi> there was none but this Prince, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>Enland,</hi> to whom he would have communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those great things which agitated his spirit, if they had not been Hereticks. Nor could all the prayers of the League ever oblige him to furnish any thing towards the charges of this War; which possibly overwhelmed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of their Enterprizes, because their hopes in part depended on a Million which he had promised them.</p>
               <p>Now as on their side, the Chiefs of the League endeavoured to engage on their party all the Lords and Cities they could; our <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:29592:38"/>
on his part re-united with him all his friends<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> makes a League to defend himself.</note> both of the one and the other Religion: the Marshal of <hi>Damville-Montmorency</hi> Governour of <hi>Languedoc:</hi> the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> Prince of the blood, who was Governour of <hi>Poictou,</hi> with his Son the Prince of <hi>Dombes:</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who held a part of <hi>Poictou,</hi> of <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge,</hi> and of <hi>Angoumois:</hi> the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> his brother. Of these five Princes of the blood, the three last were his Cousen-Germans, the two first were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one degree further; and all professed the Catholick Religion, save onely the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> He had likewise on his part <hi>Lesdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres,</hi> who, from a plain Gentleman, had by his Valour elevated himself to so high a point, that he was Master of the <hi>Daulphinate,</hi> and made the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> tremble: <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius de la Trimouille,</hi> who possessed great Lands in <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Brittany,</hi> and was sometimes before turned <hi>Hugonot,</hi> that he might have the honour to marry his Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Condé: Henry de la Tour,</hi> Viscount of <hi>Turenne,</hi> who either out of complacency, or true perswasion, had espoused the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: <hi>Chastillon,</hi> son to the Admiral of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny; la Boulaye</hi> Lord <hi>Poitevin; Rene,</hi> chief of the house of <hi>Rohan; George de Clermont d' Amboise; Francis,</hi> Count of <hi>Rochefoucaud;</hi> the Lord <hi>de Aubetterre; James de Caumont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-force;</hi> the <hi>Seigneurs de Pons; Saint Gelais-Lansac:</hi> with many other Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of remark, all, or most, of the new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

At the same time he dispatched to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> such able Agents, that they joyned all together in a strong Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, The One to maintain the Other: so that all these being united, all things arrived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the League expected; and our <hi>Henry</hi> found himself fortified in such manner, that he had no longer any apprehension of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppressed, without having the means to defend himself.</p>
               <p>I shall not make here a particular Recital of the Actions either of the one or the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty during the years 1585. and 1586. because I have observed nothing very considerable.</p>

Our <hi>Henry</hi> hereupon did an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great Generosity; which he managed in this manner: There had a Truce been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon for the security of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in such sort, that if either party broke it, they were in fault, and might justly be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested: now some of our <hi>Henry</hi>'s followers, feigning to be Traytors, had enticed some of the Catholick-Captains, too greedy of the booty, to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> which they would have let them take: by this means the Catholicks would have remained convict of perfidy, and he had had good pretence to arrest the Queen-mother: but this generous Prince, having understood the carriage of this foul play, was extreamly troubled against those who contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and forbad them to continue it. Was not this to have the true sentiments of honour founded in his Soul, and not onely in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Carriage?</p>
               <p>And as he testified his Generosity in that<note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in the whole conference.</note> Rencounter, so he made known his Constancy and the power of his Spirit in all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. The Qeen demanding of him what

it was he would; he answered, regarding those Ladies she had brought with her, <hi>Madam, there is nothing that I would have:</hi> as if he would have said, That he would not longer permit himself to be drawn away by such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements. She endeavoured above all things to disunite him with the other Chiefs of his party, or to render him suspected, offering all that he demanded as to his particular: but he, knowing well her stratagem, held firmly to this point, That he could not treat any thing without communicating it to his Friends.</p>
               <p>After a long entertainment, she once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him if the pains she had taken should produce no more fruit, especially to her, who onely wished for repose; he answered her, <hi>Madam, I am not the cause of it; nor is it I who hinder you from resting in your Bed: it is you that hinder me from resting in mine. That pains you take, pleaseth and nourishes you; for Repose is the greatest enemy of your life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He made many other Replies, very lively and full of spirit: but above all, that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable which he made to the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> of the house of <hi>Gonzague,</hi> who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Queen-mother.

                  </note> that if he should have occasion for money at <hi>Rochel,</hi> he would scarce have the credit to raise one impost; he fiercely replyed, <hi>Sir, I</hi>

                  </note> were nothing in comparison of what was done towards the end of the Summer.

At the same time the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had gathered his forces towards <hi>Rochel,</hi> and endeavoured to come to meet them unto the Bankes of the <hi>Loire;</hi> but he was hindred by an Army of the Kings, commanded by the Duke of <hi>Joyeuse,</hi> who had order dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to pursue him.

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29592:41"/>By reason of all these defaults, this Army<note place="margin">It doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpose.</note> could never take any good Resolution.

But the Duke of <hi>Joyeuse</hi> obstinately pursued him; imagining he fled, because in effect he avoided fighting, having no other end then a Conjunction with the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This new Duke was much declined in his favour with the King, who had received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that he inclined much to the League; not that he loved the <hi>Guises,</hi> but because he had permitted it to be put into his head by his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, that he deserved to be Chief of that great party; and he held the destruction of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> so certain, that he had obtained from the Pope the Confiscation of all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Territories of our <hi>Henry.</hi> Desiring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The Army of <hi>Joyeuse</hi> was, as one may say,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29592:42"/>
all of Gold, shining with Silver and Gold La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; with Damasked Arms; with Feathers in great Plumes; with Embroydered Scarfs; with Velvet Coats, with which every Lord, according to the mode of the times, had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his Companies: but the Army of the<note place="margin">What that of the King.</note> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was all of Iron, having no other then Grizled Arms, without any Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with great Belts of Buff, and labouring Habits. The first had the advantage in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, having six hundred Horse, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, more then the other; the half of its Infantry, Dragoons; its Cavalry almost all Lances, and most mounted on managed Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: it had besides for it, the Name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King, and assurance of Rewards; but the better half of it was composed of new Troops, which wanted Order and Discipline: It had a General without Authority; an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Chiefs in stead of one; and all young people, elevated in the Delights of the Court; having sufficient Heart and Courage, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Experience.</p>
               <p>The other on the contrary was composed of all the choice men of its party: the old rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Battails of <hi>Jarnac</hi> and <hi>Montcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;</hi> people bred up in the mystery of War, and hardned by the continual endurance of Fights and Adversities. It had at its Head, three Princes of the Blood, the Chief of them well obeyed and reverenced as the presumptive Heir of the Crown, the love of the Souldiery, and hope of all good French-men: besides, it
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29592:42"/>
was armed with a necessity either to overcome or die; Armour of more proof then either Steel or Brass.</p>
               <p>Orders being given, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his Army, and to the Princes of the Blood.</note> called all his Chiefs; and from a little rising ground, exhorted them in few words, but such as were agreeable both to his Quality and the time; taking Heaven to witness, that he fought not against his King, but for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Religion and Right. Afterwards addressing himself to the two Princes of the Blood, <hi>Condé</hi> and <hi>Soissons; I shall say nothing else to you,</hi> said he, <hi>but that you are of the house of</hi> Bourbon; <hi>and if God live, I will now shew you that I am worthy to be the first-born of that Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Valour that day appeared above that of all others. He had placed on his Head-piece a Plume of white Feathers, both to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known, and because he loved that colour: so that some putting themselves before him, out of designe to shelter and defend his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he cryed out to them, <hi>To your Quarter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His valour &amp; bravery.</note> 
                  <hi>I pray you, and do not shadow me; for I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi> 
                  <q>A Bravery without doubt absolutely necessary for a Conquerour, but which would be temerity and an unsupportable fault in a Prince well established.</q> He broke the first ranks of the Enemy, and took Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with his own hand, and came even to handy-gripes with one named <hi>Chasteau-Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> Cornet of a Company of <hi>Gens <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arms,</hi> saying to him, <hi>Deliver thy Colours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:29592:43"/>The Battail being gained, some having seen the Flyers, who made a halt, came to tell him, that the Army of the Marshal of <hi>Matig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> appeared: he received this News as a new subject of Glory; and turning bravely towards his people, <hi>Let us go, my Friends,</hi> said he; <hi>this will be a thing never before seen, two Battails in one day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not onely his Valour made him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be admired in this occasion; it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his Justice, Moderation and Clemency: for his Justice, we may recount what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>He had debauched the Daughter of an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer<note place="margin">An Action of great Justice, and Christian Humility.</note> of <hi>Rochel;</hi> a thing which had dishonoured that Family, and very much scandalized him among the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> A Minister, as the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons were almost ready to go to the charge, and that the Prayer was to be made, took the Liberty to remonstrate to him, That God could not favour his Arms, if he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demand pardon for that offence, repair the scandal by a publick satisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Honour to a Family he had deprived of it. The good King humbly hearkned to these Remonstrances, fell upon his Knees, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God pardon for his fault; prayed all those who were present to serve as witnesses of his repentance; and to assure the Father of the Maiden, that if God gave him the grace to live, he would repair as much as possible the Honour he had deprived her of. So Christian a submission, drew tears from all the Assistants:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29592:43"/>
nor was there any who would not have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a thousand Lives for a Prince who so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially inclined himself to do Reason to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.</p>
               <p>Having thus overcome himself, God made him Conquerour over his Enemies: and who knows but that he exalted him, because he so Christianly humbled himself? The Enemies<note place="margin">The Battail of <hi>Coutras,</hi> which he gains.</note> Army was wholly defeated, with the loss of five thousand men: all their Cannon, baggage, Ensignes, and all their chief Commanders, were taken Prisoners, except two or three, among whom were the Duke of <hi>Joyeuse,</hi> and of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joyeuse</hi> slain.</note> St. <hi>Saviour</hi> his brother, who were found dead on the place.</p>
               <p>That night, our Conquerour finding his Lodgings full of Prisoners and wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Enemy, was constrained to cause his Bed to be carried to those of <hi>Plessis Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay:</hi> but the Body of <hi>Joyeuse</hi> being laid forth on the Table in the Hall, he was there forced to mount on high; and there, while he supt, were presented unto him the prisoners, fifty six foot-Ensignes, and twenty two Standards and Cornets.</p>
               <p>It was a fair and glorious Spectacle for this Prince, to have under his feet that Enemy who had obtained from the Pope the Confiscation of his Territories; to see his Table environed with so many Noble Captains, and his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber tapistred with Ensignes. But to speak truth, it was much more agreeable to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souls, to see, that amongst so many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29592:44"/>
of Vanity and Pride; and in so just resentments of those bloudy injuries done him, (things which often transport the sweetest Souls to insolence and cruelty) there could not be observed either in his words or countenance, the least sign that might breed any suspition, that either his Constancy or<note place="margin">His mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and admirable Clemency in his Victory.</note> Goodness were ever so little altered: but on the contrary, shewing himself as Courteous and Humane in his victory, as he had shewed himself brave and redoubtable in fight; he sent back almost all the Prisoners without ransome, restored their baggage to many, took great care of the wounded, and gave the body of <hi>Joyeuse</hi> and <hi>S. Saveur</hi> to the Viscount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who was their Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and dispatched the next morning his Master of Requests to the King, to intreat peace of him: from whence it was judged, that so great a courage would overcome all its enemies, and that nothing would be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to renverse his fortune, whom so great a prosperity was not able to move.</p>
               <p>He was however blamed, for not having<note place="margin">He pursues it not, and wherefore.</note> hotly pursued his victory, and for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that Triumphant Army to break by, not again employing them in some great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit. It was believed, and there was much appearance for it, that he would not press things too forward, for fear of too much offending the King, with whom he desired yet to keep some measures; hoping daily that he might reconcile himself to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29592:44"/>
to Court, where it was necessary he should be, that he might be in a condition to take the Crown, when <hi>Henry</hi> the third should dye. In fine, were it for this reason, or other, he retired into <hi>Gascoigne,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Bearne,</hi> under pretext of some affairs; carrying with him only Five hundred horse, and the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> whom he kept neer him, out of hopes to make him Espouse his sister.

Their Prognosticks were seconded by a a number of terrible Prodigies which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> there were great Earth-quakes, along the River <hi>Loire,</hi> and likewise in <hi>Normandy.</hi> The Sea was for six weeks together disturbed with continual tempests, which seemed to confound both heaven and earth.

               <p>It was truly a great losse for him: he was now alone to Support all the weight of affairs; and being denuded of this assister, remained more exposed to the attempts of the League, who had now only to give a like blow to his person, to remain Conquerours in all their affairs.

               <p>There were an infinite number of people who had signed the League: and in the sixteen Quarters or Wards of <hi>Paris,</hi> when they could not gain the Quarteniers or Aldermen, they chose one the most violent of the Leaguers to act in their function; by reason of which, they afterwards called at <hi>Paris</hi> the Principal of this party, and their faction,<note place="margin">What the <hi>sixteen</hi> were.</note>

He was always seen in the most dangerous places, to accelerate Labours, animate his Souldiers, sustain them in Sallies, comfort the wounded, and cause Money to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst them. He observed all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into all, and would himself with the Marshal of the Camp, order the Lodgings of his Souldiers. He observed strictly what was done in the Army of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. where though he often found faults, he concealed them, out of fear to offend those who had committed them, by discovering their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29592:53"/>
and when he believed himself obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to take notice of them, he did it with so much Circumspection, that they could not finde any reason to take it in ill part. He was never niggardly of giving praises due to Noble Actions, nor of Caresses and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deport to those came near him: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained himself with them when he had time to do it; or at least so obliged them with some good word, that they still went away satisfied. He feared not at all to make himself familiar, because he was assured that the more men knew him, the more they would esteem him. In fine, the conduct of this Prince was such, that there was no heart he gained not, nor no friend he had who would not willingly have become his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</q>

               <p>This Prince, who had been the object of the peoples hatred, being now no more, it seemed that that hatred should cease, and by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:29592:54"/>
consequence the heat of the League relent: but on the contrary, not only all those who compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that faction, but likewise many others who had held it for a Crime to League themselves against <hi>Henry</hi> the third, their <hi>Catholick</hi> and Legitimate King, believed themselves in Conscience Obliged to oppose themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our <hi>Henry,</hi> at least till such time as he should return into the bosome of the true Church: a qualification they believed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary for that him should succeed <hi>Charlemagne</hi> of <hi>S. Lewis.</hi> So that if the League lost that heat which hatred gave it, it gained one much more specious, from a zeal to Religion; and had likewise a most plausible pretext not to lay down Arms till <hi>Henry</hi> should Profess the Religion of his Ancestors.</p>
               <p>It was very difficult to judge, whether the<note place="margin">Problem, if <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a time favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. or not.</note> point of time wherein this unhappy Parricide arrived, were good or ill for him: for on one side it seemed that Providence had not drawn him from the utmost parts of the Kingdom, where he was like a banished man, and led him by the hand to the fairest Theatre in <hi>France,</hi> but only to make known his goodness and virtue, and put him in an Estate to gain that Succession, to which, had he been absent, he had never been called. But on the other side, when the multitude of his Puissant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which armed themselves against him, are considered, the small Treasure, and few Forces he had, the Obstacle of his Religion,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29592:55"/>
and a thousand other difficulties, it could not be certainly judged, whether the Crown was ordained for him to enjoy, or fallen upon his head to crush him in Pieces: and there might be reason to say, that if this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture Elevated him, it was upon a Throne trembling, and erected on the brink of Precipices.</p>

This Proposition was very dangerous: for if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, he incensed him; and if he accorded to his demand, he opened the way to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make the like, and so the Kingdome would be rent in Peices. It was only his great spirit and understanding, which could walk safely in so dangerous a path: he therefore charged <hi>Sancy</hi> to assure him on his part of his affection, of which he would willingly in time and place give him all the markes a good Subject could expect from his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; but at the same time, he furnished him with so many puissant reasons wherefore he could not accord to what he desired, that <hi>Sancy</hi> being himself first perswaded, found it not difficult to work the same effect on the spirit of <hi>Byron;</hi> whom he obliged not only to renounce that pretence, but likewise to protest that he would never suffer any peice of the Estate to be dismembred, in favour of whomsoever.</p>
               <p>We may without doubt conclude, that the great <hi>Henry</hi> did reason puissantly; and that he explained his reasons in the best manner, since he could in occasions so important, perswade such able Spirits against their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per interests.</p>

As for the <hi>French</hi> Troops of the Defunct King, it was not so easie to gain them. The Lords who Commanded them, or who had their Chiefs under their dependance, had every one divers designs; one would have one thing, and the other ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to their several interests or Caprichio's.</p>

Nevertheless, hoping to find things better, they resolved to declare in his favour; but with such Conditions as should restrain and bridle him, and in some manner oblige him to depend on them.</p>
               <p>For this purpose there met an Assembly of<note place="margin">Assembly of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at <hi>d' O's,</hi> who would have the King converted.</note> some Noblemen, at <hi>d' O's</hi> Palace (a man Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, Prodigal, and by consequence not very scrupulous; but who at present made Conscience a Cloak to render himself necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) who there resolved not to acknowledge him, till he were a Catholick. <hi>Francis d' O</hi>

So that the most part of his friends counselled him to take the title of King: but when he went about to sound this Gulfe, he found that this proposition was neither agreeable to the people, nor yet to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> from whom he received, and was to receive his Principal stay, and means of Subsistence.<note place="margin">Two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels given him.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon two other Counsels were given him: the one, to accord willingly with the new King, who without doubt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture wherein things were, would grant him most advantagious conditions: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he should by Declaration publish to the Catholicks of the Royal Army, that all resentments remaining Extinct by the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, he had no other interest then that of Religion: That that point being of Divine obligation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding all good Christians; he summoned and conjured them to joyn with him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to return to the Church; upon which, they promised to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him immediately for King: but if that he refused to do it, they protested to Substitute in his place another Prince of the blood. This advice was the best. And indeed it was proposed by <hi>Jeannin</hi> President of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29592:58"/>
Parliament of <hi>Burgongne,</hi> one of the wisest and most Politick heads of his Councel, and who acted in his affairs without Sleights or Stratagems; but with great judgement, and singular Honesty.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> equally rejected<note place="margin">He rejects them, and causes to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the old Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
                  </note> both these advices; and took a third, to wit, the causing the old Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> (who was at present detained prisoner by order of our <hi>Henry,</hi>) to be proclaimed King; still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to himself the quality of Lieutenant-General of the Crown. He published after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Declarations, one of which he sent to the Parliament, the other to the Provinces and the Nobility, inviting them to endeavour to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their King, and defend their Religion.</p>
               <p>At the same time the King tried by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers<note place="margin">The King tries in vain seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Duke.</note> Negotiations, and caused him to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted rather to seek his advancement by his friendship, then by the troubles and miseries of <hi>France.</hi> But to this the Duke answered, that he had engaged his Father in the Publick cause, and given Oath to King <hi>Charles</hi> the tenth, (for so they called the old Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was named <hi>Charles</hi>) to whom, according to the sentiment of the League, the Crown appertained, as to the nearest Kinsman of the Defunct. And in the mean time, he entertained Plots and Conspiracies in the Royal Army; where his emissaries from day to day debauched many persons, even of those whom the King believed most assured.

to resist the temptations of Silver: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was proof against the intrigues of the Ladies of <hi>Paris,</hi> who cunningly attracted the Gentlemen and the Officers in the City, sparing nothing to engage them.</p>
               <p>The King knowing that there daily remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some catch'd in these snares, and having just reason to fear that those which returned, tempted by their Mistresses, might bring back some per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But before he dislodged, he writ to the Protestant Princes, to give them an account of what he did, and to assure them that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be capable to shake his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, or separate him from Christ: and he spoke at present according to his thoughts and Conscience, not having any desire to change: which yet the Ministers of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would not believe, but watched him so close on this Subject, that they became importunate.</p>
               <p>It was oertainly an unspeakable trouble,<note place="margin">His trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for 4. years to content both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks &amp; <hi>Hugonots.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Those last devoirs he desired to render his Predecessor, served as a fair pretext for raising his Siege from before <hi>Paris.</hi> To put<note place="margin">Hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Corps of <hi>Henry</hi> the third to <hi>S. Cornille de Compeigne.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:29592:60"/>There were three advices given, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place to which he ought to retire,<note place="margin">Three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices touching the place to which he should retire.</note> when he raised his siege from <hi>Paris.</hi> The first was, to repass the <hi>Loire,</hi> and abandon to the League all the Provinces on this side it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could difficultly maintain them. The second, to re-advance along the <hi>Marne,</hi> and seizing those Bridges and Cities, expect an assistance from the Protestant <hi>Suisses</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> promised to come to him.

that the Parliament at <hi>Tours</hi> sent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to him a Master of Requests; propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<note place="margin">The Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament at <hi>Tours</hi> counsel him to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</note> as the onely expedient they saw to save the Estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the associating him and the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> his Uncle in the Royalty; giving to One the conduct of Civil Affairs, and the Other of Martial.

                  </note> they make known the defaults of that great Body of the League: and the true causes which hindred its progress, and reduced it to nothing, I finde three principal ones.</p>
               <p>The first, was the distrust which the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> for though he could not be without them, yet he could not but regard them as his secret Enemies; and they assisted him not for love of himself, but out of the designe they had to profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of the calamities of <hi>France.</hi> And therefore when they saw that he concurred not with them for their ends, and that he thought onely of his own advantage without theirs, they afforded him but seeble succour; in such manner, that they let him fall so low, that when they would themselves have done it, they could not raise him.</p>
               <p>The second, was the jealousie of the Chiefs,<note place="margin">The jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chiefs of the League</note> who never agreed among themselves. They thought more of crossing and ruining one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then of weakning their common Enemy; and confounded themselves in such manner by their delusions and partialities, that they were ever wanting in the greatest Enterprizes: whereas in the party of the King, there was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29592:62"/>
onely one Chief, to whom all was reported, and by whose Orders all passed.</p>
               <p>The third, was the heaviness and dulness of<note place="margin">The sloth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
                  </note> the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who at all times moved slowly. His Flatterers called this Gravity. This default proceeded principally from his nature; and was augmented not onely by the mass of his Body, great and fat beyond all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and which by consequence required a great deal of nourishment, and much sleep; but likewise from a coldness and numness, which a certain malady he had contracted at <hi>Paris</hi> a little after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, had reduced to a habitude in his Body; of which, say some, he would very unhandsomely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was not of the same<note place="margin">Great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and vigilance of <hi>Henry</hi> 4.</note> temper: for though he very much loved feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to divert himself with his familiars when he had leisure; nevertheless when he had Affairs of War, or any other nature, he never sate at Table above a quarter of an hour, and never slept above two or three hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth being well informed of his manner of living, and that of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> confidently prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <q>That the <hi>Bearnois</hi> (for so he called him, as all the Leaguers did) could not fail to have the better of it, since he lay no longer time abed then the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> sate at Table.</q>

               <p>It seemed to me that, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our History, it was necessary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these Circumstances, which are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely essential, and very instructive.</p>

               <p>In the mean time, he fell all of a suddain upon <hi>Normandy,</hi> and almost wholly reduced it; took the Cities of <hi>Dompfort, Falaise, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieux, Bayeux, Honfleur;</hi> this last by a very bloody Siege: after his return from thence, he took likewise <hi>Meulan</hi> on the <hi>Seine,</hi> seven leagues off <hi>Paris,</hi> and laid Siege before <hi>Dreux.</hi>

               <p>At the noise of these Conquests, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> was obliged in reputation, to come forth of <hi>Paris,</hi> to assemble his Troops, and to receive, contrary to his inclination, fifteen hundred Lanciers, and five hundred Carabines, from the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Low-Countries: these forces were Commanded by the Count <hi>d' Egmont.</hi>

The other, because he perceived so great a rejoycing throughout all his Army, who seemed to leap for joy, when they were told they should go to find out their enemy; demonstrating by their outward appearances, that a day of fighting should be unto them as a day of feasting.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> was not of opinion that he ought to engage his fortune and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the hazard of one day, especially considering the valour of the Kings forces, in comparison of his; the great experience, and incomparable vertue of that Prince: and with all this, his great fortune, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gained so great an ascendant over his, that he believed he could no better overcome him, then by avoyding encounters with him.

places in six months, without having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to succour any of them; led him as it were perforce to the relief of <hi>Dreux:</hi> and when he was so near it, the false advice he had, that the King retired towards the City of <hi>Verneuil au Perche,</hi> and the Bravadoes of the Count of <hi>Egmont,</hi> who boasted himself capable with his Troops alone to defeat the Army of the King, engaged him with an extraordinary diligence to pass the River of <hi>Eure,</hi> over the Bridge of <hi>Yvry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To speak truth, both the King and he were equally surprised: the King, to understand that he had so soon passed; and the Duke, to see that the King, whom he believed to have taken the way towards <hi>Verneuil,</hi> came directly towards him: but now though they would, they could neither withdraw; but of force<note place="margin">Battail of <hi>Yvry, March</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>His rare intelligence, his wonderful genius,<note place="margin">Wonderful intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</note> and his indefatigable activity in the Mystery of War, were all admired. It was wondred how he knew how to give orders without
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29592:66"/>
perplexing his intellectuals, but with as little Confusion as if he had been in his Closet; how he could know so perfectly to range his Troops; and how, having observed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies design, he could in a quarter of an hour change the whole order of his Army: How during the fight, he could be every where, take notice of every thing, and himself give orders, as if he had had a hundred eyes, and as many armes: The noise, confusion, dust and smoak, augmenting rather then troubling his judgement and knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Armies being ready to joyn, he lifted up his eyes to heaven; and joyning his hands, called God to witness of his intention, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">His pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God.</note> his assistance, and praying that he would reduce the Rebels to an acknowledgement of him whom the order of Succession had given them for Legitimate Sovereign: <hi>But Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>if it pleaseth thee to dispose otherwise, or that I should be of the number of those Kings whom thou dedicatest to thy anger, deprive me of my life with my Crown; consent that I may this day fall a victim to thy holy will: let my death deliver</hi> France <hi>from the Calamities of War, and my blood be the last that shall be shed in this quarrel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately after, he caused to be given him his Habiliment for his head, on the top of which he had a plume of three white fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and having put it on, before he pulled<note place="margin">His exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Decision of the Battail having been a long time uncertain, was in the end favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him. The Principal glory being due to himself alone, so much the more, because he Charged most impetuously on that formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable body commanded by the Count of <hi>Egmont;</hi> and that having entred that forest of Lances with his sword in his hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them useless, and constrained them to come to their short Arms; at which his had a great advantage, because the <hi>French</hi> are more agile and active then the <hi>Flemings:</hi> so that in less then a quarter of an hour, he pierced them, dissipated them, and put them to rout; the cause of the entire gain of the Battail.</p>
               <p>Of sixteen thousand men which the Duke<note place="margin">Great loss of the Leaguers.</note> had, there were scarce four thousand saved. There remained above a thousand horse on the place with the Count of <hi>Egmont,</hi> four hundred prisoners of Note, and all the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for the Lansquenets were all cut in pieces.

They took all his Baggage, Cannon, Ensigns and Cornets; to wit, twenty Cornets of Cavalry, the white Cornet of the Duke, the Colonel of his <hi>Reistres</hi> or <hi>German</hi> horse, the great Standard of Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> and sixty Colours of foot.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> behaved himself as<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> escapes to <hi>Mantes,</hi> and thence to <hi>Paris.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Remonstrance was approved by all those that heard it; and the Principal Chiefs took the liberty to entreat the King, not to expose any more his person; but to consider,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29592:67"/>
that God had not destined him to be a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetier, but to be King of <hi>France:</hi> that all the armes of his subjects ought to fight for him; but that they would all become lame and benummed, should they lose their head, which gave them motion.</p>

               <p>He chose rather to receive the Battalions of the <hi>Suisses</hi> on Composition, then to cut them in pieces, as he might have done: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored them their Ensigns, and caused them to be reconducted into their Country, by his Commissaries; by which he gained the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of five little Catholick Cantons.</p>
               <p>He had nothing more in his heart, then to make his Subjects know, that he desired to spare their blood, and that they had to do with a mild and merciful King, and not with a cruel and implacable enemy: he caused to be proclaimed in the rout, <hi>Save the</hi> French, <hi>and let your blows fall on the stranger.</hi> He took to mercy all those which demanded quarter, and saved them as much as he could from the hands of the Souldiers flesh'd in the slaughter. He treated the Prisoners, particularly the Gentlemen, not only with humanity, but likewise with courtesie: and he loaded with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29592:68"/>
honour, praises and thanks, all the Nobility which had fought for him; sharing with them<note place="margin">His Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Justice.</note> the glory of the day, and giving them embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as earnests of those recompences they might expect from him when he should be in power.</p>
               <p>I cannot forget one Action which he did, of<note place="margin">A Noble Action he did.</note> wonderful goodness, and which was of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful efficacy to assure to him the hearts of his Officers and Gentlemen. Colonel <hi>Thische,</hi> or <hi>Theodoric</hi> of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> commanding some Troops of <hi>Reisters,</hi> had been enforced the evening before the Battel, by the clamours of those Brutes, to demand of him those Musters were due to them; and to represent to him, that upon less Conditions they would not fight. The <hi>Suisses</hi> and <hi>Allemans</hi> of that time, used often to act so; of which Histories furnish us with an hundred Examples. The King, much incensed at such a demand, answered him, <hi>How, Colonel</hi> Thische! <hi>is this done like a Man of Honour, to demand money when you ought to receive Orders for the Battel?</hi> The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel retired much confused, without replying any thing. On the morrow, the King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving arranged his Troops, remembred that he had ill treated him; and thereupon, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed forward by a motion which could finde no place but in a generous Soul, went to seek him, and told him, <hi>Colonel, you see we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in an occasion which obliges us to no long stay; but it is not just I should take away the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of so brave a Gentleman as your self: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:29592:68"/>
                  <hi>therefore that I acknowledge you for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man, and one incapable of committing any thing unworthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This said, he cordially embraced him; and the Colonel having the tears standing in his Eyes, with tenderness answered him, <hi>Ah, Sir, by restoring me that Honour you had deprived me of, you deprive me of my Life; for I should be unworthy if I should not this day lay it down for your service: if I had a thousand, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly spend them all at your feet.</hi> In short, he was slain in this occasion, as were many other brave Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>I will yet recount another worthy Action,<note place="margin">Another worthy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> which may admirably demonstrate how our <hi>Henry</hi> spared neither Civilities nor Caresses to Gentlemen who served him well: At night, when he supt at the Castle of <hi>Rosny,</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized that the Marshal <hi>d' Aumont</hi> came to render him an account of what he had done, he went forth to meet him; and having strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced him, carried him in to supper, and made him sit at the Table, with these obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging words, <hi>That there was great reason he should be at the feast, since he had so well served at his Nuptials.</hi>

                  </note> loss of this Battel, that if the King had gone directly thither, there could no doubt have been made but they had received him without much difficulty. Some said, that it was the Marshal of <hi>Byron</hi> who diverted him; fearing lest afterwards, not having more need of him,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29592:69"/>
he should consider him less. Others thought that it was the <hi>Hugonot</hi>-Ministers and Captains disswaded him, because they feared lest he should accommodate with the <hi>Parisians</hi> for Religion; and therefore they counselled him<note place="margin">Devilish counsel.</note> rather to gain this great City by famine: which the Marquiss <hi>d' O,</hi> at present Superintendant, pressed very strongly; to the end the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it by this way, might treat it as a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City, draw thence great Treasuries, seize the Rents of the <hi>Hostel de Ville,</hi> making Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupt of the Burgesses for the Debts of the King, which were very great.</p>

                  <hi>Paris</hi> being blocked up, the Legat and the <hi>Sixteen</hi> forgot nothing to encourage their people.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:29592:70"/>
and contributed all that was demanded, either of their Purse or Labour, towards its Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>There is no finer passage in the Histories of that time, then the Relation of this Siege, the Orders which <hi>Nemours</hi> gave in the City, the Garisons he established in divers quarters, the Sallies he made for the first month, the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he used to animate the people, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and divers Practices of the Kings Friends to bring him into the City, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations held in one part and the other to essay a Treaty of Accommodation; how Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions diminished, how they sought means to make them last, how notwithstanding all their oeconomy, the Famine was extream; and how in the end, that great City being within three or four days of utter perishing, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall observe onely some Particularities<note place="margin">Number of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> very memorable. There were in <hi>Paris</hi> when it was blocked up, onely two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand persons; and there were of them near thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand of the Country-people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who had there refuged themselves; and there were retired near one hundred thousand of the natural Inhabitants: so that in those times there were no more then three hundred thousand Souls in <hi>Paris;</hi> whereas it is now believed, that there are twice as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>The King was made hope, that so soon as<note place="margin">It proves not so easie to take it by famine.</note> the <hi>Parisians</hi> had for seven or eight days seen
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:29592:71"/>
the Granaries and Markets without Bread, the Butcheries without Meat, the Ports without Corn, Wine, and other Commodities with which the River is accustomed to be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they would go take their Chiefs by the throat, and constrain them to treat with them: or at least if a seditious humour did not so soon prompt them to it, Famine would force them in fifteen days. In effect, they had but five weeks Victuals, but they managed them carefully; and those who had said that, knew not well the people of <hi>Paris,</hi> for they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully patient: nor is there any extremity they are not capable to suffer, provided they have those know how to conduct them; and principally when they act for their Religion. It cannot be read without astonishment, how blinde was the Obedience, and how constant the Union of that fierce and indocile people, for four whole months of horrible Losses and Miseries. The Famine was so great, that the People eat even the Herbs that grew in the Ditches: Dogs, Cats, and Hides of Leather, were Food; and some have reported, that the <hi>Lansquenets,</hi> or Foot-souldiers, fed upon such Children as they could entrap.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hugonots,</hi> ravished with delight to<note place="margin">The <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> would have it taken by force, but the King will not.</note> hold that City blocked up which had done them so much mischief, insisted strongly in the Kings Council; and not onely cryed it there themselves, but made it be cryed aloud among the Souldiers, That it should be assaulted by lively force; and that in six hours it would so
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29592:71"/>
become a desolate thing. But the good and wise King took no heed to follow those passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counsels: he knew well, that they would take parts by force, that they might murder all, in revenge of the Massacres of St. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew.</hi> 
                  <q>And moreover, he considered that he should lay desolate a City, the ruine of which, like a wound struck in the heart, might possibly prove mortal to all <hi>France:</hi> That he should in one day dissipate the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and almost the onely Treasure of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; and that no person would be benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, but onely the simple Souldiery; who, becoming insolent by so rich a booty, would either overwhelm themselves in their Delights, or as soon abandon him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Those who within had taken the care of the<note place="margin">Useless mouths starve <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
                  </note> Politick part, had committed a great fault in not putting forth the poor, populary and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less mouths. The scarcity augmenting, they sought too late means to remedy it: but not finding any, they deputed some to the King, to gain permission of him to let a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber depart; who, hoping for this grace, were already assembled near the Gate of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> and had taken leave of their Friends and Neighbours with those Regrets which even rent asunder the Hearts of the most insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>The King was so good and merciful, that he permitted himself easily to yeild to grant them his Favour: but those of his Council op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it so strongly, that for fear to disgust
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:29592:72"/>
them, he was at first constrained to send back those miserable People. His Clemency ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless<note place="margin">Great Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the King, to let the miserable people go forth.</note> could not for any long time suffer their violence: for having understood by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who fearing death less then Famine, had leapt from the Walls, the pitiful estate of the City, and they having truely represented unto him what they had beheld of their horrible necessities, with the incredible obstinacy of the Leaguers; his heart was in such manner overburthened with grief, that the tears start out of his eyes; and having a little turned himself away, to conceal that emotion, he cast forth a great sigh, with these words: <hi>O Lord, thou knowest who are the causes of this:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words.</note> 
                  <hi>but give me the means to save those, whom the obstinate malice of my enemies would make pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In vain did the most averse of his Councel, and especially the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> represent to him that these Rebels merited no favour; he resolved to open a passage to the innocent. <hi>I wonder not at all,</hi> said he, <hi>if the Chiefs of the League, or if the Spaniard have so little compassion on those poor people: they are only Tyrants; but for my self, who am their Father and their King, I cannot bear the recital of these calamities, without being touched to the bottome of my soul, or without ardently desiring to remedy them. I cannot hinder those whom the fury of the League possesses, from perishing with it; but for those who implore my clemeney, and who are only guilty of the Crimes of others,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:29592:72"/>
                  <hi>I will stretch forth my armes to them.</hi> This said, he commanded that they should permit those miserable people to depart. There were some who crawled, and others were fain to be carried. There came out at this time more then four thousand, who all with great and unanimous shouts, cryed out, <hi>Long live the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that day, since they knew it offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Those of the Army send victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als into <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> him not, the Captains that kept the Guards let daily great bands escape, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise took the boldness to send victuals and refreshments to their friends, and to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hosts, and particularly to the Ladies. <q>For <hi>Paris</hi> being the common Country of the French, there are few people who love it not, and who have not there some gage of friendship, which forbids them from procuring its loss and utter ruine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the example of the Captains, the Souldiers licensed themselves to convey to them meat, bread, and barrels of wine over the walls; receiving in Exchange some rich goods at a vile price, and making themselves brave at the expences of the Merchants: that which these were in some manner constrained to tolerate, because the others had no money wherewith to pay them. This made <hi>Paris</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Which makes them sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</note> subsist near a month longer then it would have done: but it is almost impossible but this should always happen in like occasions, as hath been seen not long time since. God be pleased for ever hereafter to preserve <hi>France</hi> from so great ills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:29592:73"/>After all, the King knew certainly that that great City could not long subsist; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to gain absolutely their hearts, to the end he might undermine the very foundations of the League. For this reason he combated their Obstinacy with an excess of Indulgence. He gave Passe-ports to the Scholars, not able to refuse them to their Parents who were with him; after, to the Ladies and to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks; and in the end, to those who had shewed themselves his most cruel enemies.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, to hasten a little the<note place="margin">The King takes all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs in one night.</note> Chiefs of the League to come to a Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was agreed in his Councel that he should render himself master of the Suburbs. The evening of the 27. of <hi>July,</hi> he caused them all to be assaulted at once. They were forced in less then an hour, and all the gates blocked up; his Souldiers having first fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their quarters, and thrown down the houses nearest the ditch.</p>
               <p>By this last action he took the <hi>Parisians</hi> by the throats, and pressed them in such sort, that they could scarce breath: for which cause their Chiefs apprehending that neither their defences, exhortations, or fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments would be longer capable to retain them, concluded after ten or twelve delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to enter into conference with the King; not out of a cordial intention to treat with him, but only to spin out things to a length, that they might give time to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> to make an attempt to succour them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:29592:73"/>They received intelligence from that Duke twice every week, and each time he promised<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> advances to <hi>Meaux,</hi> but dares not relieve <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> them that he would be with them with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant Army in five or six days. Having fed them with these hopes for five or six weeks, he advanced in the end to <hi>Meaux,</hi> where <hi>Vitry</hi> was Governour, and from thence gave them some greater hopes of relief: however, he was too weak to hazard it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had order from <hi>Spain</hi> to go joyn with him, and not to spare any thing for the relief of <hi>Paris,</hi> came with great unwillingness. He feared lest during his absence the Council or Cabinet should appoint a Successour in his Government; and that he should loose more in the Low-Countries, then he should gain in <hi>France:</hi> Notwithstanding he received Commands so express, that he was constrained to obey. He parted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> comes to joyn with him with an Army from the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> from <hi>Valencienne</hi> on the sixth of <hi>August,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Meaux</hi> on the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth. He brought along with him onely twelve thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse; but Artillery and Ammunition, for an Army thrice as great; and fifteen hundred Waggons of Provisions to refresh <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was without doubt the greatest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">He had so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived all things, that he was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to raise the siege of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> amongst strangers of the Age he lived, for all Exploits which depend on profound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and judicious Conduct: he had so well laid the Model of his Designe in his Head, so well taken his Measures by the exactest Mapps of the Country, and so well meditated on all
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29592:74"/>
that could arrive him, and all that he could do, that he held himself assured of success.</p>
               <p>Those who were about the King, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways<note place="margin">The King never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he would quit the Low-Countries.</note> made him believe, that this Duke would not leave the Low-Countries; and said, That if he did either, that he could not raise so great a power as to dare engage in the heart of <hi>France:</hi> or that if he raised any great Army, he would not arrive time enough to deliver <hi>Paris.</hi> The King suffered himself to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle carried away with these false Reasons: but when he understood he marched in this manner, he began already to fear that which arrived; and the danger appeared so much more, because he had less foreseen it. In these Apprehensions he was well content to renew the Negotiation with the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He renews the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who feigns to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, to amuse him.</note> who on his side feigned to desire an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation more then ever; to the end he might amuse him, for fear he should assault <hi>Paris</hi> by plain force; and to entertain the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians</hi> with the pregnant hopes of their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: for the Famine made them despair in such manner, that it was no longer in his power, with all his inventions, to retain them from sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry for more then five or six days at most.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was within two days Journey of <hi>Meaux,</hi> he caused it to be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the King, That the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> could no longer treat but conjoyntly with him. At present the Council of the King was<note place="margin">The Kings Council mech iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> much astonished, and in a great irresolution, not knowing what to do. It was without
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:29592:74"/>
doubt a great shame for the King, and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diminishing of the Reputation of his Arms, to raise a Siege which had endured four months; and it must needs be a most sensible displeasure to this Prince, who was brave and glorious, to raise it on the Eve of the taking of that great City, the reduction of which had been a mortal wound to the League.</p>
               <p>He had therefore but one course to take,<note place="margin">The King would take a place of battel, and not raise the siege.</note> but which was without doubt very hazardous; nevertheless the King resolved it: this was, to leave a part of his Troops in the Suburbs, and chuse a place of Battel, where the rest of the Army might make head against the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and not raise the Siege. To this effect, the King, confirmed in it by the advice of <hi>la Noue, Guitry,</hi> and <hi>Plessis Mornay,</hi> left onely three thousand men on the side of the University, and put the rest of his Army in Battalia, in the Plain of <hi>Bondy,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Paris</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Marshal of <hi>Byron,</hi> disanulling abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely<note place="margin">

It was not known whether he was carried to this advice either out of jealousie, because he had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the first counsel, or because it seemed to him too dangerous to remain so near <hi>Paris,</hi> from whence there might sally fifteen or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand men on the day of battel to charge them behind. However it were, his Authority was so great among the Men of War,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:29592:75"/>
and it was so dangerous in this Conjuncture to contract that hot spirit, that they were forced to believe him, and absolutely raise the Siege to go encamp at <hi>Chelles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> seeing that, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not convenient to fight, retrenched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self readily in a Marish so well, that he feared not to be forced: he boasted likewise that the King should not in that Post know how to force him to discharge one Pistol; and yet that he would take a City in his sight, and open a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage on the Rivers to send Provisions into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> In sum, he executed punctually what he<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> takes <hi>Lagny</hi> in the sight of the King, &amp; relieves <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> had said. It was not in the power of the King to oblige him to fight; and he took <hi>Lagny</hi> on the <hi>Marne,</hi> whilst he was not able to relieve it. Thus <hi>Paris</hi> was absolutely deliver'd, receiving on the morrow a very great quantity of Boats,<note place="margin">Abundance of Victuals carried to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> laden with all forts of Provisions. Yet their Joy was not equal to their Comfort: for their too long Misery had in such manner weakned their Bodies, and supprest their Courages, that they were not capable of any sentiments of rejoycing.</p>
               <p>The Troops of the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> having regained heart by this refreshment, sallied dayly with the most couragious of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geffes, and cut off all Provisions from the Kings Camp, in such manner, that a little Scarcity being got amongst them, Sicknesses began to multiply; and the Gentlemen who had flocked thither out of the hopes of a Battel, began to grow impatient; which the King seeing, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

He found, that throughout his whole Army there were very ill dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that he had better make a Retreat, then expose himself to greater Affronts: but being loth to quit the Enterprize of <hi>Paris,</hi> he tryed in passing to carry it by storm on the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity-sides, between the Gates of St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Marceau:</hi> which having done in vain, he retired to <hi>Senlis,</hi> and thence to <hi>Creil.</hi> In the end, not able to do better, he took <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Beauvoisis,</hi> which incommodated <hi>Senlis</hi> and <hi>Compeigne.</hi> Afterwards he put a<note place="margin">The Army of the King constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> part of his Troops in the Cities about <hi>Paris;</hi> sent another into the Provinces, to re-assure them in their Obedience; and kept onely with himself a flying Army.</p>

                     <hi>Corbeil</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained by storm.</note> to hear of the loss of <hi>Corbeil,</hi> which had cost him so much. <hi>Givry,</hi> Governour of <hi>Brie</hi> for the King, re-gained it in one night by storm: and the League, whatever instances they made to him, could not oblige the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to stay in <hi>France</hi> till they had re-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. He left them onely eight thousand Men of his, promising to return at the Spring with a greater Army, and counselling them in the mean time to amuse the King by Treaties of Peace until the next <hi>Campagne:</hi> a Counsel which the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> was not wanting to follow; which kept many Cities to his party, were ready to abandon him.</p>
               <p>The expedition of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> retarded much the Affairs of the King, but advanced not at all those of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne:</hi> on the contrary, it embroiled them, and begat those dispositions which in the end ruined them. For the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defaults of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> That he was very improper for the advancement of their interests, being both too weak, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> counsels the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to become chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the League.</note> too little Authority to keep in Unity so great a Party; too jealous, too slow, and too idle to give order in all things: that therefore it was necessary that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should take care of the League, and become absolute Master of it. That to this effect he should
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29592:76"/>
gain the Ecclesiasticks; and the people of the great Cities; who having a great desire to see the Estate of the Government changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause under the last Kings it had been very oppressive to the people, would be easily indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced either to joyn the Cities together in form of <hi>Cantons,</hi> or make a King, whose power should be so limited, that he could never weaken them, either by Taxes or by Arms, as the two last Kings had done.</p>
               <p>In effect, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> finding this way<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spain</hi> no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> but thinks to render himself Master of the great Cities by factions.</note> most commodious to his designes, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it to change <hi>France</hi> into a Republick, or make a King who should onely subsist by him, considered no longer the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> so much as he had done, and assisted him but weakly, and endeavoured to create facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among the great Cities, and particularly that of the <hi>Sixteen</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> not sparing any money: so that many believed he expended such great sums in this way, that had he laid them out in raising Armies, he had conquered a good part of the Realm.<note place="margin">The King endeavours to re-gain the Duke.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now our <hi>Henry</hi> considering his designes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured on his part to frustrate them. And first, as to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> he flattered him with Kindnesses and many good Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which he did for two ends; to wit, to essay to gain him, and likewise to render him more suspected to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> To the same effect he endeavoured to augment in him the disgust he already had for that Nation; and withal, promised him great Advantages if
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29592:77"/>
he would accommodate with him. By these means he daily a little restrained him, cool'd his ardour, and hindred him from carrying things to exreamities. And as for the people, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the people.</note> that it was the ill Government of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor which had altered their Affections, and had furnished them with the pretext and occasion of the League to cause their emport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he omitted no diligence nor no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which might reduce them sweetly to their Duty.</p>
               <p>This good King considered, that to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a disease, it is necessary that the causes be taken away; and that to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he was to correct and sweeten the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which had put the Estate into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. His sight of it had likewise made him know, that three things principally had rendred his Predecessor odious and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The first, was his softness and saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness;<note place="margin">Three means by which <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 3. lost the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his subjects. His negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and inapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which made him, in stead of employing those fair Talents which God had given him to rule in his Estate and act in the functions of a King, to neglect to apply himself, and not take sufficiently to heart the conduct of his Affairs, but addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wholly to his pleasures. As if Royalty, which is the greatest and most eminent of all things here below, were onely a vain diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as if God had made Kings one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the love of themselves, and not for his glory, and the common good of men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:29592:77"/>
                  <q>The second, was his ill management, and the wasting his Revenues; which obliged<note place="margin">The wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</note> him to seek extraordinary and oppressive ways to exact money. Now he had not onely consumed his Revenues by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream profuseness, and by the immense Gifts he made to his Favourites; a thing which made the people desparate: but much more by his negligence, because he would not give himself the trouble to take knowledge of, or watch over those to whom he trusted their Administration: who, forgetting that they were onely his dispensers, became pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal in a thousand foolish expences; and distributed them to their Creatures, as if they had been their proper Goods.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third, was the little belief they had in<note place="margin">His ill kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his word.</note> his Faith; and his manner of acting with his subjects too subtil, too fine, and too clouded; in such manner, that he had always this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, they were in continual distrust of him; insomuch that all his words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons seemed falsities, and they thought they did prudently in believing quite contrary to all he would have them believe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now our <hi>Henry,</hi> having known that these ill ways had conducted his Predecessor to a Precipice, resolved, as well out of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he had to good, as out of good Policy, to follow paths quite contrary.<note place="margin">Three other ways quite contrary, by which <hi>Henry</hi> 4. gained the esteem and affection of his subjects</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, he would shew to the League, who disputed the Scepter with him, that he was worthy to carry it. And for this effect, he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29592:78"/>
acted continually not onely in the Field, and in matters of War, but in his Cabinet by his deliberations of important Affairs, by his Negotiations, by the order and distribution of his Revenues, by his dispensation of his Charges and Employments, by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the principal Laws, the order and policy of his Realm; and in fine, in all his Actions, like one who contents himself not with the name of a King, but would be one in effect. He would have faithful Ministers,<note place="margin">His activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and greatness of soul.</note> but would have no Companions. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them the care of his Affairs in such manner, that he still remained the absolute Master, and they the servants. He loved them tenderly, as it was just, and used a great familiarity with them; but yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them not to be wanting either in submission or respect. If he took their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, it was by form of advice; and he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them much oftner by reason to follow his, then he followed theirs. He honoured them with his Graces and with Benefits, but in proportion and measure: he gave them not all to one alone, or to two or three; but like a common Father, distributed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenses to all those he judged worthy: and he would that they should receive them from his hands, and not from others; for he knew that to give and do good is the most glorious Attribute of Soveraignty, which ought not to be communicated to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:29592:78"/>
                  <q>In the second place, he took a most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care to cause his Revenues to be<note place="margin">His care of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</note> well administred: to which, four motives obliged him. The first, because he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, though not covetous, yet a good husband, and one who hated profuseness. The second, because he loved his people, and would spare them the most he could possibly; for he made conscience of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money out of their purses, except up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most necessary occasions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he never kept near him any of those blood-suckers of the Court, who draw all to their Coffers, and who never care from whence it comes, so that they have it. The third, because the necessity he had often been in, had made him know the value and need of money; and that it was good to manage it well, because hard to recover it. And the fourth, because not having been bred up ignorant in affairs, as too often Princes are, he had been well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the greatest part of those ills which had afflicted <hi>France,</hi> proceeded from the ill administration of publick monies.</q> And therefore among all the cares he took to govern well his Estates, he had none grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor more continual, then that of ordering well his Revenues, and to clear this matter. The Superintendants had imbroyled and perplexed them with an hundred thousand knots, so that they could neither be loosned nor distinguished; and they had acted in such
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29592:79"/>
manner, that this management, as a Treasurer of that time said, was a kind of Black Art, where nothing could be seen; so that thus the goods of the Prince and the blood of the poor people remained ever at their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He who at present had care of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Francis d' O</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pender.</note> was a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman, named <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis d' O,</hi> who had been Superintendant since the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. This man, to speak the truth, was horribly prodigal in all sorts of Expences: his profuseness rendred him more ingenious and more subtil to find out new inventions to grasp the substance of the people, even to their very marrow; and to perplex more and more the order of the Revenues, to the end it might not be discovered what spoil he made. Now though<note place="margin">The King constrained to suffer him in this charge, but pares his nailes.</note> the King knew him well for such as he was, nevertheless, because he had a strong <hi>Cabal</hi> with the Minions and Servants of the Defunct <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who acted the parts of zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Catholicks, he was constrained to suffer him in that charge, expecting while his affairs were in a better Estate. In the mean time, to give a check to his insatiable Covetousness; he by little and little himself took knowledge of the management of his monies; and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introduced some orders, now by one means, and then by another, so that he knew in time how to bridle him; and reduced things in such manner, that he could take but little in comparison of what he had done before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:29592:79"/>It will be superfluous to tell with what Nobleness and what freedom our <hi>Henry</hi> acted<note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word, and freedom.</note> with all the world. <q>We may see through the whole course of his life, that his very enemies had more confidence in his word alone, then in the writings of all others. He used much prudence in all his conduct; but he used no deceit, cunning, or artifice. The Prudent man never walkes, but by wayes streight and vertuous; and the cunning man, on the contrary, by paths oblique and wicked. The Prudent cannot but be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and good; whilest the other cannot but be base, deceitful, and unworthy. Now it is certain, that all the life of this great King was nothing but generosity, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sweetness, and clemency; having a wonderful inclination to oblige all sorts of persons; at least with kindnesses, embraces, and sweet words, when he had no other means: he acknowledged the least services, when he could do it: he shewed himself easie and affable to all the world, familiar<note place="margin">His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> to his Souldiers, pitiful to the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people; so that he would often excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them when occasion presented, for the evils they suffered; protesting, that he was not the cause of them, but desired ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that peace which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to <hi>Christians;</hi> and that it was his enemies which forced him to make that War, which of himself he detested, as the source and fountain of all crimes and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:29592:80"/>
miseries. There appeared in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a certain alacrity, in his discourse a vivacity and particular Grace of Spirit, in all his actions a resolution and prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which contented the most difficult, and animated the most frozen. Though he were yet a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> he spoke with respect of the Pope and of the Ecclesiasticks, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Great ones and Gentlemen as his Companions, and flattered them with the glory of being the right hand of his Estate, and the upholders of the Crown on his head. He scarce knew what vengeance<note place="margin">He pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and never knew ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</note> was; his great heart was without any gall: he pardoned injuries, and likewise easily forgot them, so as he knew those that had committed them did repent, and were disposed to do good, or at least to do no more ill. It was with these Arms, rather then<note place="margin">This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, rather then his sword.</note> with his Sword, that he vanquished his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellest enemies, that he forced the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate and envenomed hearts to love him, and that of the most passionate <hi>Leaguers,</hi> he made his most faithful servants; esteeming it a procedure agreeing with the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and goodness of a Sovereign, not to lose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those he might gain; and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw men from their faults, rather then ruine them in them.</q> See here how he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ways quite contrary to those his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor had taken.</p>
               <p>After the departure of the Duke of <hi>Parma<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">1591.</note> the two parties, that of the King, and that of<note place="margin">Divisions and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies in the party of the League, and that of the King.</note>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:29592:80"/>
the League, remained some time in great weakness; and both were equally tormented with that mischief of Divisions and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: but with this difference, that those on the Kings party were extinguished by his good conduct, and those of the League daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</p>
               <p>There was a furious jealousie between the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> brothers by the mothers side. Nor was it less between the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and greater much between the same and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who raised a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand traverses against him, by means of <hi>the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen:</hi> for as he could not suffer them for Companions, they could not suffer him as Master; but desired above all things, that the League had another Chief then he.</p>
               <p>In the party of the King, there was likewise<note place="margin">In the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King, three factions of <hi>Hugonots, Catholicks,</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</note> three or four factions. The first, of the rigid and obstinate <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who would not that the King should speak of permitting himself to be instructed; threatning to abandon him, if he thought of it; and to this effect, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him continually, and as it were count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his footsteps. The second, that of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who were zealous, or who feigned to be so; these endeavoured to draw him from the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and murmured when he either gave them charges or employments, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them particularly. The third was that of the Servants and Courtiers of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, whom the humour of our <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:29592:81"/>
displeased, because he gave them not all they would, and permitted himself not to be led by their fancy. These were for the most part Atheists, and Libertines; nevertheless com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and caused much inquietude to the King.</p>
               <p>Of these two last factions joyned together, was a third party formed. <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was called <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> whilst the old Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> lived, was the Chief of it: This Prince, vain and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, imagining that the Crown would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, if his Couzen <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth should be excluded, stirred up the Catholicks to press his Conversion, out of the belief he had that the Conscience of that King, and his affairs not being yet disposed, he could not hearken to it; and would by consequent, by these heedless shifts, be taken for an obstinate Heretick, and oblige the <hi>Catholicks</hi> to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and after turn on his side. This faction was the most dangerous affair that ever our <hi>Henry</hi> had to deal with, though he seemed to despise it, and called those who were of it, <hi>les Tiercelets,</hi> or <hi>the Thirdlings.</hi> It shone not out with an unmasked face, nor did ever open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separate it self from the other; yet for that it self it was the more to be feared: but it produced in the end that good, that he was constrained to let himself be instructed, and wrought to his Conversion.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> when they saw that he<note place="margin">The <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Protestants to send <hi>Henry</hi> 4. powerful assistance to hinder him from turning Catholick.</note> lent an ear to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctors, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29592:81"/>
with themselves, to the end they might entangle him so that he could not escape them, that they ought puissantly to sollicite Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> to send him great forces; by whose help they believed they might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the League, after which there was no need of his Conversion, and in the mean time they would continually keep him as it were besieged by those strangers forces. In effect, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had zeal for the Protestant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, interested her self very strongly in the cause of this King, daily generously assisted him, and strenuously sollicited the <hi>German</hi> Princes to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the same time the <hi>Hugonots</hi> pressed with all their force, that he would grant them an Edict for the Free exercise of their Religion: they pursued it so strongly, that he was forced<note place="margin">An Edict granted to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>
                  </note> to accord it them; and they sent it to the Parliament sitting at <hi>Tours,</hi> but they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain it to be confirmed by them, but with these words, <hi>by proviso only:</hi> shewing themselves as much enemies to this false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as they were to the factions of the League.</p>
               <p>During this time, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. died,<note place="margin">Death of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5.</note> leaving in the Treasury of the Church Five Millions of gold, which he had heaped up.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29592:82"/>
gates against him, that they might exclude him from his Royalty.

               </p>
               <p>It is convenient to understand, that neither the one nor the other party having any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to keep continually their Armies on foot, they only (as we may say) made War by intervals.

               <p>After all, these Bulls produced no great effect at present; and the Cardinal of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> tormented himself in vain, to make the assembly of the Clergy which was held at <hi>Chartres,</hi> declare against the Arrest at <hi>Tours.</hi> Nor did the Army of the Pope do any great exploits, but was almost quite dispersed, ere it came to render any Service.</p>

the <hi>Daulphinate,</hi> which was <hi>Lesdiguieres;</hi> who held that Country, having reduced the City of <hi>Grenoble;</hi> and who saved <hi>Provence</hi> for him, of which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> thought to seize himself, and dismember that piece from the Crown. This Duke being Son-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law to <hi>Philip</hi> the second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the puissance of his Father-in-law had raised his Ambition and Courage, and made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that constant affection which his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors have almost continually had for <hi>France,</hi> insomuch that they have held themselves much honoured to be Pensioners to our Kings. But the Conduct and Valour of <hi>Lesdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi> made him repent all his high, designs, especially by the battails of <hi>Esparon de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieres,</hi> and of <hi>Pont-Charra,</hi> where that Duke received as much loss as confusion.</p>
               <p>About this time, our <hi>Henry</hi> conceived a<note place="margin">He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate of the fair <hi>Gabriella.</hi>
                  </note> passion for the Fair <hi>Gabriella d' Estrees;</hi> who was of a very noble house: and that passion by degrees grew so strong, that whilst she lived, she held the Principal place in his heart: so that after having had by her three or four Children, he had almost resolved to marry her, though he knew not how to do it, but by hazarding great troubles, and very dangerous difficulties. Having taken the City of <hi>Noyon,</hi> he gave the Government to Count <hi>d' Estrees,</hi> Father of this fair one; and a little after, gave him likewise the charge of Great Master of the Artillery, which had formerly been held by <hi>John d' Estrees,</hi> in the year 1550.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:29592:84"/>Not long after the Siege of <hi>Noyon,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the escape of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> escapes from prison</note> after many other attempts, had got at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon out of the Castle of <hi>Tours,</hi> where he had been in prison since his fathers death. The News at first no less touched the King, then it surprized him: he feared this great Name of <hi>Guise,</hi> which had given him so much trouble; and he doubted lest this young Prince should re-ingross the love of the people, which his father had possessed to so high a pitch: he was troubled to have lost such a Gage, which<note place="margin">The judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. on his escape.</note> might serve him in many things. However, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had a little meditated, he diminished his apprehensions, and told those who were about him, <q>That he had more reason to rejoyce then be troubled: for of force it must hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that either the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> must take his party; and that if he did so, he would treat him as his Parent and Kinsman: or that he must cast himself into the League; and then it would be impossible that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and he could continue any long time without contending and becoming enemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Prognostick was very true. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> having seen those Rejoycings which all the League testified at this News; the Bonefires made in the great Cities, those Actions of thanks which the Pope caused pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to be rendred to God, and the hopes which the <hi>Sixteen</hi> conceived to see revived in this Prince the Protection and Qualities of his

Father, which they had idolatrized: the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> I say, seeing all this, was struck<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> becomes jealous of his nephew</note> with a very strong Jealousie: and though he sent him monies, with entreaties that they might have an Interview; yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he looked not upon him as a new renforce, but as a new subject of inquietude and trouble to him.</p>
               <p>In effect, this young Prince immediately<note place="margin">The <hi>Sixteen</hi> lean to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and would lose <hi>Mayenne.</hi>
                  </note> knit himself in firm bond with the <hi>Sixteen,</hi> and promised to take their protection. By this means, and by the help of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they emboldened themselves in such manner, that they resolved to loose the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> not ceasing to cry down his Conduct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.

                  </note> there was some amongst them who writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> by which they cast themselves into his Arms, and intreated him, if he would not reign over them, to give them a King of his Race, or to chuse a Son-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law for his Daughter, whom they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with all Obedience and Fidelity. They advised themselves besides this, to make a new form of Oath for the League, which excluded the Princes of the Blood; to the end they might oblige all suspected persons, who would not swear a thing so contrary to their thoughts, to depart out of the City, and to abandon their Goods to them.

               <p>There remained nothing now but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Parliament, who watched them day and night, and stopt their Enterprizes. They had pursued the Condemnation of one named <hi>Brigard,</hi> because he had Correspondence with the Royalists; and the Parliament having pardoned him, they were so incensed, that the most passionate, by conspiracy amongst<note place="margin">By a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt they cause to be hanged the President of <hi>Brisson,</hi> and two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours.</note> them, and by their private Authority having caused those of their faction to take arms, went to seize on the persons of the President <hi>de Brisson,</hi> and of <hi>de Larcher,</hi> and <hi>de Tardiff,</hi> Counsellours, whom they carried prisoners to the <hi>Castelet;</hi> and after some formalities, one of them pronounced against them the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death: in execution of which, they caused them all three to be hanged at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Chamber, and on the morrow to be carried to the <note n="*" place="margin">The publick place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution in <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>Yet there were some of these <hi>Sixteen</hi> found<note place="margin">Some would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise kill the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> but want heart to do it.</note> so determinate as to pass farther: they said, They must finish the Tragedy, and rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> if he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he being at present at <hi>Laon:</hi> That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, they might assure to themselves the

They could catch but four, whom he caused to be hanged in the <hi>Louvre;</hi> the other five saved themselves in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The most remarkable of these five, was <hi>Bussy le Clerke,</hi> who had been constrained to yeild the <hi>Bastille</hi> to the Dukes people.

               <p>This terrible blow having quite quelled the

with a Pistol-shot, on the Reins, which had been mortal if the Bullet had had more force; but it pierced only his cloths and his shirt, and somewhat razed the skin. His valour and his good fortune, both equally contributed to draw him out of this peril, and to bring, after so sharp a check, both his person, and what remained of his Troops, into safety.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> admired this action;<note place="margin">Grave answer of the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> concerning the Kings action.</note> but praysed the Courage which our <hi>Henry</hi> had testified, more then his Prudence: for when he was demanded what he thought of this Retreat, he answered, <q>That in effect it was very gallant; but for his part, he would never bring himself into a place where he should be forced to retire. <hi>This was tacitely to say, that a Prince and a General ought to secure themselves better.</hi>
                  </q> And so all the Kings faithful servants came the same evening to intreat him that he would spare his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, on which the safety of <hi>France</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

               <p>After the raising the siege of <hi>Rouen,</hi> the greatest part of the Kings Army passed into <hi>Champagne,</hi> in pursuit of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and laid siege before the City of <hi>Espernay,</hi> and<note place="margin">Byron <hi>killed at</hi> Espernay.</note> took it.

as he was viewing the place. His eldest Son, who was named the Baron of <hi>Byron,</hi> as great a Captain as the Father, and much loved by the King, was a little after honoured with the same Charge of Marshal of <hi>France:</hi> but he lost his Head somewhat less gloriously then his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> being parted ill satisfied one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was not difficult to renew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the first and the Royalists:<note place="margin">Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> however, things were not yet ripe; there were some seeds sown, which some time after brought forth fruit: for the King consented that he would within six moneths permit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be instructed by those means which might not wrong either his Honour or his Conscience. He gave leave likewise to the Catholick Lords of his party, to depute some towards the Pope, to let him understand the duties he applyed himself to, and to intreat him to add his Authority; and that in the mean time, Peace should be dayly treated of.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and his party deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Conditions so advantagious, that they were ill resented; and, to speak truth, many things in this Conjuncture did much trouble our <hi>Henry:</hi> that which most of all perplexed<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> calls the Estates to <hi>Paris</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a King.</note> him, was, that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed by the instances of the Pope, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the remonstrances of those great Cities which took his party, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29592:90"/>
likewise by the necessity of his Affairs, had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Estates-General to <hi>Paris</hi> to proceed to the Nomination of a King.</p>

               <p>To the end therefore he might hinder this<note place="margin">Expedient which the King finds to hinder this electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> mortal blow, he wisely advised with himself to propose a Conference of the Lords of his Party, with these pretended Estates. The Duke of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mayenne</hi> was well content with this Expedient, because he saw well that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> desired that he who should be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, should espouse his Daughter <hi>Isabella-Clara-Eugenia;</hi> and thus the Election could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him, since he was married, and had Children: but likewise out of fear lest they should hearken to an acknowledgement of our <hi>Henry,</hi> he under hand stirred up some Doctors to say, That this Conference with a Heretick was unlawful; and by vertue of this advice, he wrought in such manner, that the Estates agreed they would not confer with him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

directly nor indirectly, touching his Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, nor touching the Doctrine of the Faith; but that they would confer with the Catholicks holding his party, for the good of Religion, and the publick Repose.</p>
               <p>The Legat knowing well what this would come to, endeavoured with all his power to hinder the effect of this Deliberation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states: but in the end, he was constrained to lend his hand to it.

               <p>The Spaniolized Leaguers feared above all things this change, which would take from them all pretext: the good <hi>Catholicks</hi> ardently wished it; they onely feared lest his Conversion should be feigned: the rigid <hi>Hugonots</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to divert him; threatning him with the Judgements of God if he abandoned, said they, the Evangelical Truth.

               <p>In pursuance of this Truce, the King came to St. <hi>Denis;</hi> where there met many Prelates and Doctors, by whose care he caused himself to be instructed.

               <p>It was almost a miracle, how that there<note place="margin">It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a wonder how he became master of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> being four or five thousand <hi>Spaniards</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garisoned in <hi>Paris,</hi> and ten or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand factious persons remaining of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> of <hi>the Sixteen,</hi> who all cruelly hated the King, he could nevertheless render himself master of it, without striking stroak, or without shedding blood, except that of five or six Mutineers, who came into the streets to cry to Arms. His Troops having by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence seized on the gates, ramparts, and publick places, he entred triumphantly into the City by the new gate, by which <hi>Henry</hi> the third had unhappily fled six years before, and went directly to <hi>Nostredame,</hi> to hear Mass, and cause <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be sung: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he returned to the <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After Dinner he gave the <hi>Spanish</hi> Garison a sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Garison departed about three a Clock, the same day of his entrance, with twenty or thirty of the most obstinate Leaguers; who chose rather to follow strangers, then obey their Natural Prince. He would needs see them depart,<note place="margin">He sees the Spanish Garison depart; and what he saies to them.</note> and regarded them passing from a window by <hi>St. Denis</hi> gate: they all saluted him with their hats very low, and with a profound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: he returned the salutes to their Chiefs with great courtesie; adding these words, <hi>Recommend me to your Master; go in a good hour, but return no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same day that he entred into <hi>Paris,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Pelleve</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Sens,</hi> a passionate Leaguer, expired in his Palace of <hi>Sens.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Placentia,</hi> Legat from the Pope, had safe-Conduct to retire home; but he died by the way. <hi>Brissac,</hi> for recompence had the Staff of Marshal, and a place of Honourable Counsellor to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: a favour very rare in that time. <hi>D' O</hi> was re-placed in his government of <hi>Paris,</hi> which he had had under <hi>Henry</hi> the third: but he enjoyed it not long, dying<note place="margin">Parliament at <hi>Tours</hi> recalled to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> soon after. That part of the Parliament which was at <hi>Tours</hi> was recalled, and that which was at <hi>Paris</hi> re-enabled (for it had been interdicted) and both re-united to serve conjoyntly the King.</p>
               <p>By noon of that day on which our <hi>Henry</hi>

familiar with the Souldiers, the Artificers worked in their shops: In a word, the Calme was so profound, that nothing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, but the Ringing of the bells, the Bonfires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Dances which were made through all the streets, even till midnight. It is certain, that that which caused this joy and wonderful tranquillity, was the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which the people had conceived of the generous goodness of this Prince, and the Commands he gave for the orderly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>There were two actions which he did the<note place="margin">Two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy actions of the King.</note> same day he entred <hi>Paris,</hi> worthy observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeding from an admirable Justice, Goodness, and Policy.</p>
               <p>The first was, that he suffered the Baggage<note place="margin">The one of Justice.</note> of <hi>la Noue,</hi> one of his principal Chiefs, to be Arrested at his entring into <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, for the debts of his Father contracted in his service: and when <hi>la Noue</hi> went to complain to him of this insolence, he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publickly: <hi>La Noue, you must pay his debts, for I pay likewise those of mine.</hi> 
                  <q>But after that, he took him apart, and gave him some precious stones, to engage to his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, in stead of the Baggage which they had seized. Was there ever a more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful goodness, or more exact Justice?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, that the same evening he<note place="margin">The other of Policy.</note> played at Cards with the Dutchess of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensier,</hi> who was of the house of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the most vehement Leaguess of the Party.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:29592:96"/>
What could be seen of more Policy?</p>
               <p>After this reduction of <hi>Paris,</hi> the other Cities and their Governours hastened like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise<note place="margin">Reduction of <hi>Rouen, Abbeville, Troyes, Sens,</hi> &amp;c.</note> to conclude their Treaties. <hi>Villars</hi> made his for <hi>Rouen;</hi> so gaining to himself the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in chief of this City and Bailiwick, and that of the Country of <hi>Caux,</hi> with the charge of Admiral, which he was to take out of the hands of <hi>Byron,</hi> for that of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal of <hi>France,</hi> twelve hundred thousand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres of present money, and sixty thousand Livres of pension. At the same time, or little after, <hi>Montreuil</hi> and <hi>Abbeville</hi> in <hi>Picardy, Troyes</hi> in <hi>Champagne, Sens</hi> and <hi>Riom</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne, Agen, Marmande,</hi> and <hi>Villeneuve d' Agenois</hi> rendred themselves obedient; and their Governours had all they could demand of the King. The City of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and the Country thereabouts, treated likewise by means of its principal Magistrates; and the Marquis of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> Governour for the League, seeing he could not hinder the Revolution, permitted himself to be drawn in with them, and composed with the King, who left him the Government of that Province.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> likewise, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated<note place="margin">And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29592:97"/>
hopes that the assistance of <hi>Spain</hi> might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain give his affairs the upper hand. He was retired into his Government of <hi>Bourgongne,</hi> because that remained yet most entire to him; though to keep to himself <hi>Dijon,</hi> he was forced to make use of an odious cruelty, in cutting off the head of the Mayor, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, who laboured to reduce it to the Kings service.</p>
               <p>Now since it was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note place="margin">1595.</note> him in his obstinacy, and who made<note place="margin">The King declares war against the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>
                  </note> War against the King in his name; it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and agreed in the Councel, to assault them with an open War; to the end that being imployed at their own homes, they might lose the desire and leasure of coming to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the King in his. For they not only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted him by force of Arms, and by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which encouraged the people in Rebellion; but moreover they would have had his life, and endeavoured to murther him, by base and execrable waies. They contrived or favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many conspiracies against his Sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">Two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts on his person.</note> which were well discovered. Those two which made most noise, was that of one <hi>Peter Barriere,</hi> and that of <hi>John Castel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first was a Souldier aged about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of</hi> Peter Barriere,</note> seven years, who being discovered at <hi>Melun,</hi> in the year one thousand five hundred ninety three, as he sought the execution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable blow, was condemned to have his right hand burned, holding the Knife with which he should have struck the King; after
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29592:98"/>
to have his flesh torn off with burning Pinsers, and to be broken on the wheel alive.</p>
               <p>The second was a young Scholar aged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">
                     <hi>and of</hi> John Castel.</note> eighteen years, son of a Merchant-Draper of <hi>Paris,</hi> keeping Shop before the Palace: this villain about the end of the year fifteen hundred ninety four, having thrust himself with the Courtiers into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the fair <hi>Gabriella,</hi> where the King was, would have struck him with a Knife into the belly; but by good fortune the King then bowing to salute some one, the blow chanced on his face only, piercing his upper lip, and breaking a Tooth. It was not known for the present who had struck it: but the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> seeing this young man affrighted, stopt him by the arme. He impudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that he had given the blow, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that he ought to do it. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condemned him to have his right hand burned, his flesh torn off with red-hot Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, and after to be torn in pieces by four horses: This detestable Parricide not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any sign of pain; so much had they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his spirit, that he would offer a Sacrifice acceptable to God, by taking out of the world a Prince relapsed and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. The Father of this miserable villain was banished, his house before the Palace demolished, and a Pyramide erected in its place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jesuites</hi> under whom this Miscreant<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jesuites</hi> exiled the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> had studied, were likewise accused for having
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:29592:98"/>
instructed him with this pernicious Doctrine; and they having many enemies, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment banished the whole Society out of the Kingdom by the same Arrest of their Scholar. Yet these Fathers were not wanting, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the times were contrary to them, to labour to sustain their honour; but writ many things to justifie themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their charge. And truly those who were not their enemies, did not at all believe the Society culpable: so that some years after the King revoked the decree of Parliament, and recalled them, as we shall mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>The success of the War declared against <hi>Spain,</hi> was much different from that which the King maintained against the League; and made it apparent, <q>That it is another thing to assault a stranger equal in puissance, over whom nothing is to be gained but by force of Arms, then to have to do with rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects, and in ones proper Country, where intrigues and intelligences make more then one half of the enterprizes.</q>

               <p>This year the Cities of <hi>Beaune,</hi> of <hi>Auton,</hi> and of <hi>Aussonne</hi> reduced themselves under the Kings obedience. Those of <hi>Mascon</hi> and <hi>Auxerre</hi> were returned the year before. The City of <hi>Dijon</hi> followed their example, and fortified it self against the Castle which <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> went to besiege. But in the mean time the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> descended with a great Army of <hi>Millanois</hi> into <hi>Bourgongne</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:29592:99"/>
by the <hi>French County,</hi> and passed the <hi>Saone</hi> at <hi>Gray</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Mayenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King who was gone into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">The King goes into <hi>Bourgongne</hi> against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army.</note> had the assurance to advance as far as <hi>Fountain-Franzoise:</hi> it was there that with only fifteen hundred men, he made head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that great Army, and did an exploit of War scarce imaginable. <hi>Villars-Oudan</hi> and <hi>Sanson,</hi> two of the Principal Chiefs of<note place="margin">Battail of <hi>Fountain-Franzoise,</hi>
                  </note> the enemies Army, charged furiously on his Troops: <hi>Villars</hi> charged a body commanded by the Marshal of <hi>Byron,</hi> and <hi>Sanson</hi> another on the side of it: they made them both give ground and retreat, flying within sight of that of the King. It was reported that <hi>Villars</hi> knowing he was there, so puissant is the name of a King, durst not assault him, but retired on the left hand: but <hi>Sanson</hi>
                  <note place="margin">where the King shews his valour; but is in danger of his life.</note> was not so happy; for the King having with him but one hundred horse, but all chosen Gentlemen of note, and mounted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, with his sword in his hand ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongst them and cut them in pieces. <hi>Sanson</hi> endeavouring to rally his people lost his life, by acquitting no small honour.</p>
               <p>The King was in so great danger in this fight, that he said himself, <q>That in other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein he had been engaged, he had fought for Victory, but that in this he had fought for his Life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having therefore made the Constable by<note place="margin">The <hi>Spanish</hi> Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</note> this occasion see in what manner he was to act, he so much abashed his courage, that he durst

enterprize nothing; but a little after, retired. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> likewise despairing at<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> despairing, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </note> such ill success, and not knowing longer where to hide his head, had resolved to retire to <hi>Sommerive</hi> in <hi>Savoy;</hi> from whence he would send to demand safe-conduct into <hi>Spain,</hi> to give an account of his Actions to King <hi>Philip</hi> the second. But the goodness of the King<note place="margin">The King hath pity of him, and offers him an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, and place of retreat.</note> tooke care to divert him from this Precipice, and to lay open to him ways of accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He to this effect sent to seek <hi>Lignerac</hi> his Confident; entertained him of the good will he always had for that Duke; testified to him, that he pitied him; and assured him, that he would be always disposed to receive him into his favour; permitting him to retire in all safety to <hi>Chalons</hi> on the <hi>Saone,</hi> till they could finish a Treaty of Accord.</p>
               <p>The Duke accepts this favour; and having understood that the Pope was disposed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the King into the Church, he demanded a general Truce for the rest of his party.</p>
               <p>The greatest part of the Kings Council, who considered the Delays and Artifices which he had for six years used, having begun fifty Treaties without ever concluding any, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that the King should grant him no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, but pursue him to the utmost. But the prudence and goodness of the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not with this Sentiment, because he was not ignorant of two Maximes, which are most true ones: the one, <hi>That Kings may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when they please reduce the most rebellious</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:29592:100"/>
                  <hi>to their duty;</hi> the other, <hi>That it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make great persons despair, especially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the quality of the Duke of</hi> Mayenne.

That which followed after, demonstrated well that this sage Prince had more knowledge then all his Ministers; and how prejudicial it would have been to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests to do the contrary.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, of those three Cities<note place="margin">

               <p>This loss did in such manner excite the indignation of the Loyal <hi>French</hi> against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> that the greatest part of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing, fled into the Low-Countries, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain,</hi> where they found at first a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reception, and good Employments; by which they did very great mischief to <hi>France.</hi> Amongst others was a valiant Captain named <hi>Rosny;</hi> who, imagining that they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their utmost rigour upon such, who not

               <p>This was he who inspired the Count of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes</hi> with the designe to besiege <hi>Cambray</hi> after he had forced <hi>Cattelet,</hi> and who perswaded him to facilitate this great Enterprize to take <hi>Dourlens</hi> first, to the end the <hi>French</hi> might not bring an Army to relieve it.

               <p>But News most important and long time expected, comforted the King for these two great losses of <hi>Dourlens</hi> and <hi>Cambray:</hi> which was, that he received advice, that the<note place="margin">The Pope absolves the King.</note> holy Father, passing by all those difficulties which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> formed, had granted his Absolution on the sixteenth of <hi>September,</hi> by the Negotiation and pursuits of <hi>d'Ossat</hi> and <hi>du Perron,</hi> his Procurers in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> who were afterwards, upon his Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, honoured with Cardinal Caps.<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> in the end makes his Treaty with King.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> having no more Excuses, nor more Hopes longer to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29592:101"/>
resolved to treat. It was very late; and he could not well expect other then an utmost ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, if the Generosity of the King had not been greater then his obstinacy. It is most true, that the fair <hi>Gabriella,</hi> very officious to those who sued for his favour, and being at present in hopes to create her self friends and supports to come to the marriage of the King, to which she aspired, did not a little assist to obtain a most favourable Accommodation. Certainly the terms of the Edict which the King granted him, and the Conditions, are so<note place="margin">Hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Conditions</note> honourable, that never Subject had greater Advantages from any King of <hi>France:</hi> but they had been greater, if that before his party had been so much ruined, he had treated for those great Cities who yet held him as their Chief, and whom by this means he might still have kept firm to his interests.</p>
               <p>Some time after, he came to <hi>Monceaux</hi> to<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaux</hi> to salute the King.</note> salute the King; who seeing him coming along an Alley where he was walking, advanced some paces towards him with all Alacrity and good Countenance possible; and thrice straitly embracing him, assured him, that he esteemed him so absolute a man of Honour, that he doubted not of his word; treating him with as much freedom, as if he had always been his most faithful servant. <q>The Duke surprized with his goodness, said at his departure, That it was now onely that the King had compleatly vanquished him.</q> And he ever after as well remained in the duty of a most

               <p>At the same time that this Duke had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Treaty, and obtained an Edict from the King which confirmed it; the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>

               <p>His elder Brother, one of the most noble and generous Courages was ever known, died the year before of a strange malady, which made him vomit through the mouth, and through all his pores, even to the last drop of his blood.

                  </note> Moreover, it happened when he least thought of it, that the Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, incited by the counsels of that <hi>Rosny</hi> of whom we have spoke, came to fall upon <hi>Calais;</hi> and that <hi>Rosny,</hi> who was a great Captain, having at first took the Forts of <hi>Risban</hi> and <hi>Nieule,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forced the place on the 24 of <hi>April,</hi> and put<note place="margin">Taking of <hi>la Fere</hi> by the King.</note> all to the sword. A little after, the King took <hi>la Fere,</hi> which surrendred for want of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.

                  </note> was redoubled by that of the Cities of <hi>Guines</hi> and <hi>Ardres;</hi> which were likewise taken by the industry and valour of <hi>Rosny,</hi> who had done many such other exploits, if some months after he had not been killed, happily for <hi>France</hi> at the Siege of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now the noise of these four or five great losses received one upon another, cast some terrour into the hearts of the people; and the Emissaries of <hi>Spain</hi> excited as much as they could new seeds of division in their spirits; serving themselves to that purpose of all sorts of pretexts, but above all, of that of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the people. Truely it was great; but it was caused by the pillages of War, and by the necessity of Affairs, rather then the Kings fault; who had no greater desire then to procure the ease of his Subjects, as we shall see.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:29592:103"/>This cast him into a great affliction and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because he had no Treasure to continue the War; and he foresaw by the murmurs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready excited, that if he crushed the people more, he should raise against himself a new tempest. In this trouble, he had recourse to that great Remedy accustomed to be practised when <hi>France</hi> is in danger; which is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Estates: but because the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<note place="margin">The King to have mony, calls an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Chiefs to <hi>Rouen.</hi>
                  </note> necessity gave him not time to assemble them in a full body, he called onely the chiefs of the Peers of his Estate, of the Prelates, and of the Nobility, with the Officers of Justice, and of the Revenues.</p>
               <p>He desired that the Assembly should be held<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their sitting.</note> at <hi>Rouen,</hi> in the great Hall of the Abby of St. <hi>Ouen:</hi> in the midst of which, he was seated in a Chair elevated in form of a Throne, with a Cloth and Canopy of Estate. On his sides, were the Prelates and Lords; behinde, the four Secretaries of Estate; beneath him, the first Presidents of the soveraign Courts, and the Deputies of the Officers of Justice, and of the Revenues. He made his Overtures to them by a Speech worthy a true King; <q>who ought to believe that his Greatness and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority consists not onely in an absolute power, but in the good of his Estate, and the safety of his people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I should account it a glory</hi> (said he to them)<note place="margin">His Speech</note>

                  <hi>but my ambition tends to something higher then well-speaking; I aspire to those glorious Titles of Redeemer and Restorer of</hi> France. <hi>Already, by the favours of Heaven, by the counsels of my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, and by the sword of my brave and generous Nobility, (from which I distinguish not my Princes, the Quality of Gentleman being the fairest Title we passess) I have delivered it from Slavery and Ruine. I desire at present to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it to its former force, and to its ancient splendour. Participate, my Subjects, in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond glory, as you have participated in the first. I have not called you hither as my Predecessors have done, to oblige you blindly to approve my will: I have caused you to be assembled to receive your counsels, to believe them, to follow them; and, in a word, to put my self in Guardianship under your hands. This is a desire which seldome pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses Kings grey-hair'd and victorious like my self: but the love I bear my Subjects, and the extream desire I have to conserve my Estate, makes me finde all things facile and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Assembly, moved even to the bottom<note place="margin">The Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly grant money for the War.</note> of their hearts by such tender words, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with affection to finde wherewith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the War: and to this effect they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should be gathered one years payment of all Officers Salaries; and that for two years only there should be be imposed one <hi>Sol per li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre</hi> on all which entred into walled Cities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely for Corn, which is the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the poor. This last means caused much trouble in the Provinces beyond the <hi>Loire.</hi> But <hi>Rosny,</hi> whom the King had some moneths before made Superintendant, no less able then faithful, as we shall speak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, joyned to this stock a great sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which the Receivers had diverted, and which he made return to the Kings Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">King of <hi>Spain</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the peace.</note> the forces both of his body and minde to diminish by a languor, which after degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a horrible malady, feared lest his weakness should cause Revolts in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries so distant one from the other. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he had expended his Revenues, and passionately desired to give the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to his dearest Daughter <hi>Isabella:</hi> and for these Reasons had made known to the holy Father, that he desired peace; and his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had sent the General of the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> to dispose him more particularly to it.</p>
               <p>But now when some progress was made in<note place="margin">Surprizal of <hi>Amiens</hi> by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards the peace.</note> it, there happened an accident, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded it for more then a year. <hi>Hernand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Teillo</hi> Governour of <hi>Dourlens</hi> for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being advertized of the evil order which the Burgesses of <hi>Amiens</hi> kept in the Guard of their City, surprized it one morning about nine of the Clock when they were at Sermon, it being Lent-time, having caused the Gate to be pestred with a Cart laden with Nuts, of which a sack was purposely spilt, to amuse
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29592:104"/>
the Souldiers of the Guard. So trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some news astonished the King so much the more, because he was at present rejoycing and divertizing himself at <hi>Paris.</hi> 
                  <q>He had given order that all important packets should be brought directly to him, and not to others; and that they should bring him them at what hours soever: so that being in a profound sleep after dancing a Ball, a Currier came to waken him, to tell him this accident.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He immediately leapt out of bed, and sent for three or four of his greatest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, to consult with them. They all judged that it arrived in a very unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, because the Duke of <hi>Merceur</hi> was powerful in <hi>Brittany,</hi> the rest of the factions being yet concealed under their ashes, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> making <hi>Cabals</hi> or secret Councels; the consternation of <hi>Paris</hi> being very great,<note place="margin">1597.</note> which beheld it self by this means become a Frontier. But this Heroick courage whom so many perils could not affright, was not startled by this; on the contrary, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">The King resolves to besiege <hi>Amiens.</hi>
                  </note> to encounter it at first, and go immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to invest <hi>Amiens,</hi> before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were longer setled in it.</p>
               <p>His greatest Captains were not of this advice: but notwithstanding that, he, who had greater knowledge and more constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then them all, enterprized it coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously; not so much, said he, out of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of humane means, as out of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:29592:105"/>
he had in God, who had alwaies done him the grace to assist him. And in truth it may be said, that he assisted him more visibly in this occasion then he had ever done.</p>
               <p>For he discovered many conspiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies discovered.</note> his person, amongst the rest, of one under Religious orders, whom an agent of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as it was said, would have induced to kill him; and very dangerous <hi>Cabals</hi> which the mony of the same King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held at <hi>Paris,</hi> which observed all his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and had designed one day to seize his person at his Castle of St. <hi>Germaine</hi> in <hi>Laye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, his people answered as they<note place="margin">The people contribute willingly, and the Leaguers serve him well.</note> ought, to his Paternal affection, not denying him any thing that he demanded to hasten the fiege; and all the Leaguers desiring to testifie to him their resentments for all his goodnesses, served him so faithfully and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously in this occasion, whilst others wavered, and kept their stations, that he was obliged to say, that he acknowledged that the greatest part of that people hated not his person, but only the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>The siege was long difficult and doubtful; and if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would have imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his power, the King could never have succeeded in it: but he was become very Melancholy; he desired onely repose, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more for Conquests; so that he gave not any of those assistances which the Arch-Duke<note place="margin">The Arch-Duke comes to relieve <hi>Amiens.</hi>
                  </note> demanded. The Arch-Duke ceased not however to use the greatest endeavour he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:29592:105"/>
could to raise the siege. He presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before the Quarter of <hi>Long-Pre</hi> with very great forces, on a day when he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;<note place="margin">His arrival &amp; assaults put the Kings Army in disorder.</note> which put the French into so great a fear and disorder, that had he known how to serve himself of the occasion, and had not lost time in consultation, he had put those three thousand men into the City, which he had destined for it.</p>
               <p>The King returning from Hunting, whither he was gone, found a general fear through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Army, and likewise some of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Chiefs quite daunted. In so great a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, neither his heart nor his head failed him; he dissembled his fear, gave orders without passion, and shewed himself every where with a cheerful countenance, and with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses<note place="margin">The King re-assures them.</note> as resolute as after a victory. He made his forces nimbly draw into the field of battail, which he had chosen three daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, eight hundred paces from the lines. From this place having considered the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, the little assurance of his, and the weakness of his Posts, where he had not had leasure to fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he was a little moved, and doubted of the success of the day. When leaning on the Pummel of his Saddle, with his hat in his hand, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he uttered these words with a loud voice: <hi>Oh! Lord, if it be to day thou wilt punish me as my sins</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Words worthy a good and Christian King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>deserve, I offer my head to thy Justice; spare not the Culpable: but Lord, for thy holy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:29592:106"/>
                  <hi>sake, take pity of the poor Kingdom; and smite not the flock for the offence of the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be expressed of what efficacy these words were: they were in a moment carried through the whole Army, and it seemed as if some vertue from heaven had given courage to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arch-Duke therefore finding them<note place="margin">The Arch-Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </note> resolved, and in good Countenance, durst not pass farther. Some other attempts he afterwards made, which did not succeed; and he retired by night into the Country of <hi>Artois,</hi> where he dismissed his Army.

                  </note> led his Army to the very Gates of <hi>Arras</hi> to visit the Arch-Duke; he remained three days in battalia, and saluted the City with some Volleys of Cannon. Afterward seeing that nothing appeared, he retired towards <hi>France</hi> ill satisfied, said he gallantly, with the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance so much as one pace to receive him, but had with an ill grace refused the honour he did them.</p>
               <p>The Marshal of <hi>Byron</hi> served him extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily at this siege: and the King, when he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:29592:106"/>
was returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that those of the City gave him a reception truly Royal, he told them, shewing them the Marshal; <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, see there the Marshal de Byron, whom I do willingly present both to my friends and to my enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There rested now no appearance of the League in <hi>France,</hi> but onely the Duke of <hi>Merceur,</hi> yet keeping a corner of <hi>Brittany.</hi> The King had often granted him Truces, and offered him great Conditions; but he was so intoxicated with an ambition to make himself<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Merceur</hi> daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his Treaty.</note> Duke of that Country, that he found out dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new fancies to delay the concluding one; imagining that time might afford him some favourable revolution, and flattering himself with I know not what prophecies, which assured him that the King should dye in two years.</p>
               <p>In fine, the King wearied with so many<note place="margin">The King goes into <hi>Brittany,</hi> resolved to chastise him.</note> protractions, turns his head that way, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to chastise his obstinacy as it deserved.

               </p>
               <p>His Deputies could at first obtain nothing else, but that he should immediately depart out of <hi>Brittany,</hi> and deliver those places which he held; which done, his Majesty would grant him oblivion for all past, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into his favour.

This accommodation was made at <hi>Angiers,</hi> the Contract of marriage passed at <hi>Chasteau,</hi> and the affiances celebrated with the same Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, as if he had been a Legitimate son of <hi>France.</hi> He was four years old, and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin six.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:29592:107"/>
any thing of importance to be acted; and he still gave express order, not to defer the advertizing him of such things.</q>
                  <note place="margin">He puts good order in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He took away a great many superfluous Garisons in this Country, suppressed many imposts, which the Tyranny of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons had introduced during the War; disbanded all those pilfering Troops, which laid waste the plain Country; sent forth the Provosts into the Campagne, against the theeves which were in great number; resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Justice to its authority, which License had weakned; and gathered four Millions, of which the Estates of the Country, of their own free will, levyed eight hundred thousand crowns. So he laboured profitably for these two ends, which he ought most to intend, to wit, the ease of his people, and the increase of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. <q>Two things which are incompatible when a Prince is not Just and a good mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or lets his mony be managed by others without taking diligent care of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</q>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29592:109"/>
his Divertisements, he made his most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and most important employs, his principal pleasures.</p>
               <p>In the two first parts of his Life which we<note place="margin">He was a Souldier by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but a Polititian by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> have seen, he was by constraint a Man of War and of the Field; in this last, a Man of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and a great Polititian: but in both, invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and indefatigable.</p>
               <p>The true duty of a Soveraign, consists prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in protecting his Subjects: he must both defend them against Strangers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Factions and Attempts of Rebels.

But that comprehends but a part of his Functions; and we may truely say, that it is neither the most necessary nor the most satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. <q>For besides that he may manage his Wars by his Lieutenants, who doubts him to be the most happy Prince, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affairs in such a manner, that he hath no need of his Sword, but is powerful enough to distribute Justice, punish the wicked, and to honour and reward deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men? to confer graces and recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to keep good order, and conserve the Laws? to maintain his Provinces in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, sustain his Reputation and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by his good Conduct, inform himself often and diligently of all that passes, make himself to be feared by his Enemies, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed by his Allies; and, like a Soveraign,

himself preside in his Councils, receive Ambassadours, and answer them; dispatch great Affairs by Treaties and Negotiations; prevent all ill, and deprive wicked persons and enemies of their power to hurt; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Traffick and the Studies of Sciences and Noble Arts; to make his Kingdome rich, flourishing and abundant; to fetch wealth from all the corners of the earth; but above all, to procure the glory and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, so that his Kingdome may be as a Paradise of Delights, and a Harbour of Felicity. These are, in my opinion, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys worthy a potent King, a Christian and wise King; who, being the Shepherd of his people, (as <hi>Homer</hi> often calls the great King <hi>Agamemnon</hi>) ought not onely know how to drive away the Wolves, I mean, make War; but likewise understand how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his Flock, preserve them from Diseases, fatten and multiply them.</q>

The King answered,<note place="margin">VVhy the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired peace. Excellent words.</note> 
                  <q>That if he had desired peace, it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was weary of the incommodities of War, but to give leave to afflicted <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to breath. That he knew well that from the Conjuncture wherein things were, he might have drawn great advantages; but that God often overturns Princes in their greatest Prosperities; and that a wife man ought never, out of the opinion of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable event, be averse to a good accord, nor trust himself too much on the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his present happiness, which may change by a thousand unexpected Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: it having often happened, that a man thrown down and wounded, hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him who would make him demand his life.</q>

                  </note> the second had more need of the peace then <hi>France;</hi> for his sickness was more then redoubled: he had for twenty six days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually a perpetual flux of blood through all the conduits of his body: and a little before his death, he had four Aposthumes broke in his Groin; from whence there tumbled a continual multitude of Vermin, which all the diligence of his Officers could not drain.</p>
               <p>In this strange sickness, his constancy was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:29592:111"/>
wonderful; nor did he ever abandon the reins of his Estate, until the last gasp of his Life: for he took care before his death to treat of the<note place="margin">Before his death, he takes care to marry his son and daughter.</note> marriage of his Son with <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to the Arch-Duke of <hi>Grats;</hi> and that of his dear Daughter <hi>Isabella,</hi> with the Cardinal-Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> of the same blood with her; and gave him for Dowry the Low-Countries, and County of <hi>Bourgongne,</hi> on Condition of its Reversion if she died without issue.</p>
               <p>He had already signed the Articles of the<note place="margin">His sickness hinders his swearing to the peace.</note> peace: but this mortal sickness permitted him not to give Oath to it with the same solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as the King and Arch-Duke had done. <hi>Philip</hi> the third his Son and Successour acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">His son <hi>Philip</hi> the 2. doth it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</note> himself of this Obligation on the one and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1601. in the City of <hi>Vallidolid,</hi> and presence of the Count of <hi>Rochepot</hi> Ambassodour of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The license of the War having for many years permitted mischiefs with impunity, there were yet found a great number of Vagabonds, who believed it still permitted them to take the Goods of others at pleasure: and others there were, who thought they had right to do themselves justice by their arms, not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any Laws but force. This obliged our wise King to begin the Reformation of the Estate by the Re-establishment of publick Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. To this effect, he forbad all carrying<note place="margin">The King forbids the carrying of arms.</note> of Fire-arms to all persons of what quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon pain of the Confiscation of their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:29592:112"/>
Arms and Horses, and a Fine of two hundred Crowns for the first fault, and of Life without remission for the second: permitting all the world to arrest any who carried them, except his light-horsemen, his <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> and the Guards of his body, which might bear them onely when they were in service.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose, and to ease the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<note place="margin">He dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his Troops.</note> of the multitudes of his Souldiers, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed not onely the greatest part of his new Troops, but likewise reduced the one half of his old. He reduced the Companies of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to a very little number, and took off the Guards of the Governours of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Lieutenants of the King; not willing to suffer any whatsoever besides himself to have that glorious mark of Soveraignty about their persons.</p>
               <p>The Wars had spoiled all Commerce, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Cities into Villages, Villages to small Cots, and Lands to Deserts: nevertheless the Receivers constrained the poor Husband-men to pay Taxes for those Fruits they had never gathered. The Cries of these miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had nothing but their Tongues to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with, touched in such manner the very Entrails of so just and so good a King, that he made an Edict, by which he released them of<note place="margin">He remits the arrears of Taxes.</note> all they owed him for the time past, and gave them hopes to ease them more for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Moreover, having understood that during the Troubles there were made a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29592:112"/>
of false Nobles, who were exempted from the Tax, he commanded that they should be<note place="margin">He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the false No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to be sought out, and taxes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imposed on them.</note> sought forth: nor did he confirm their Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation for a piece of mony, as hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done, to the great prejudice of other taxed people; but he would that the Tax should be re-imposed upon them, to the end that by this means they might assist the poor people to bear a good part of the burthen, as being the richer.</p>
               <p>He desired with much affection to do good to his true Nobility, and repay them those Expences they had been at in his service; but his Coffers were empty: and moreover, all the Gold in <hi>Peru</hi> had not been sufficient to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Appetite and Luxury of so many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For King <hi>Henry</hi> the third had by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that of his Minions, raised expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces so high, that Lords lived like Princes, and Gentlemen like Lords: for which purposes they were forced to alienate the Possessions of their Ancestors, and change those old Castles, the illustrious marks of their Nobility, into Silver-lace, Gilt-coaches, train and horses. Afterwards, when they were indebted beyond their credit, they fell either upon the Kings Coffers, demanding Pensions; or on the backs<note place="margin">He retren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury of the Nobility, and sends them all to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Country.</note> of the people, oppressing them with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Thieveries. The King, willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this disorder, declared very resolvedly to his Nobility, That he would they should accustom themselves to live every man on his Estate; and to this effect he should be well
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29592:113"/>
content that to enjoy themselves of the peace, they should go see their Country houses, and give order for the improvement of their Lands. <q>Thus he eased them of the great expences of the Court; and made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the best treasure they could have, was that of good management.</q> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, knowing that the <hi>French</hi> Nobility would<note place="margin">He shews them by his example the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of his habits.</note> strive to imitate the King in all things, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by his own example, how to abridge their superfluity in Cloathing. For he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily wore gray Cloath, with a Doublet of Sattin or Taffata, without slashing, Lace, or Embroydery. He praised those who were clad in this sort, and chid the others, who carried, said he, their Mills, and their Woods and Forests on their backs.</p>
               <p>About the end of the year, he was seized<note place="margin">He falls dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sick.</note> with a suddain and violent sickness at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaux;</hi> of which it was thought he would die. All <hi>France</hi> was affrighted; and the rumours which ran of it, seemed to re-kindle some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: but in ten or twelve days, he was on foot again; as if God had onely sent him this sickness to discover to him what ill wills there were yet in the Kingdome, and to give him the satisfaction to feel by the sorrows of his people, the pleasures of being loved.</p>
               <p>In the strength of his Disease, he spoke to<note place="margin">Words of a good King.</note> his friends these excellent words: <hi>I do not at all fear death; I have affronted it in the greatest dangers: but I avow that I should unwillingly leave this Life, till I have put this Kingdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:29592:113"/>
                  <hi>that splendour I have proposed to my self; and till I have testified to my people, by governing them well, and easing them of their many Taxes, that I love them as if they were my Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his recovery, continuing in his praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy<note place="margin">He gives the Estates an account of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.</note> designes of putting his Affairs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he came to St. <hi>Germain</hi> in <hi>Laya,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Estates of the expence as well of his House, as for the Guard of Frontiers and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, entertainment of Forces, Artillery, Sea-Affairs, and many other Charges. He had then in his Council (as we may say we have at present) very great men, and most experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in all sorts of Matters; but he still shewed himself more able and more understanding then they. He examined and discussed all the particulars of his expence with a judgement and with a clearness of spirit truely admirable; retrenched and cut off all that was possible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing onely what was necessary. Amongst<note place="margin">Cuts off the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of his Tables.</note> other things, he abridged the superfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the Tables in his house; not so much that he might spare himself, as to oblige his subjects to moderate their liquorish prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and hinder them from ruining their whole houses by keeping too great Kitchins. <q>In sum, by the example of the King, which hath always more force then Laws, or then Correction, Luxury was soon conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Frugality very necessary for the State.</q>
               </p>

               <p>The Chancellour of <hi>Chiverny,</hi> who had been<note place="margin">Chiverny.</note> raised to this charge under the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, was a man cold, dissembled, and considerate: but, as his Enemies said, he was a much better Pleader then Counsellour of State.</p>
               <p>He died the year following; and in his place the King constituted <hi>Pompone de Bellievre,</hi> a<note place="margin">Bellievre.</note> man perfectly accomplished in the knowledge of the Rights and Interests of <hi>France,</hi> and a most expert Negotiator, as he well shewed in the Treaty of <hi>Vervin.</hi> He was old when the King gave him this Charge; and therefore said himself, That he onely entred into it, to go out of it. He counselled the King to make a severe Act against Duels: He established a very good Order in the Council; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That none should be received Master of the Requests, but who had been ten whole years in one of the Soveraign Companies, or sixteen in other of the Subalternate Seats.</p>

It hath been said, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick never beheld any passion either in his Countenance or Discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harlay-Sancy</hi> was a man free, bold and<note place="margin">Sancy.</note> dauntless, who feared no person when he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the service of the King: but he was a little rugged, and spoke to him too freely; witness what he said concerning Madam <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briella,</hi> who knew how to return it to him.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Janin</hi> President of the Parliament of <hi>Bourgongne,</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> chief Secretary of State, they had both taken part with the League; and yet very profitably served both the King and <hi>France,</hi> having in what they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed endeavoured onely for the defence of the Catholick Religion, and not been moved out of a spirit of faction. They had hindred the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from planting themselves in this Realm, and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> from abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely casting himself upon them, as his despair had often perswaded him to do. They agreed both in this point, that they loved the Estate and Royalty with passion, and that they had great judgement: but for the rest of their humours, they were very much different.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Janin</hi> was an old <hi>Gaul,</hi> who would manage<note place="margin">Janin.</note> his Affairs by the ancient forms, according to the Laws and Ordinances; a good Lawyer, firm and resolute, who went directly towards
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29592:115"/>
his end, and who knew no subtile turnings and windings, but entirely loved the publick good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Villeroy</hi> was one of the wisest and most exact<note place="margin">Villeroy.</note> Courtiers that was ever seen: he had a spirit clear and neat, which would unravel with an incredible facility the most embroyled Affairs; explain them so agreeably and intelligibly as nothing more, and who turned them as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pleased. He was wonderfully active with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and most excellent at finding Expedients; taking his business by so sure hold, that it was difficult to escape him.</p>
               <p>The King often conferred with these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours:<note place="margin">The King confers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, &amp; how.</note> for they were now so called, and not Ministers, as they had been for above thirty years before.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Rosny,</hi> and after Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> he had been bred up with the King in the Hugonot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the King had known his capacity and affection in divers affairs of consequence; but above all, that his genius carried him to the good management of Revenues, and that he had all qualities requisite for that purpose. In effect, he was a man of good order, exact, a good husband, a keeper of his word; not prodigal nor proud, nor carried away by vain follies or expences, or play, or women, or any other things not convenient for a man entrusted with such an Employment. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he was vigilant, laborious, expeditious, and one who dedicated almost his whole time to his affairs, and little to his pleasure: and withal, he had the gift of piercing into the very bottome of matters, and unravelling those twistings and knots with which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, when they are not trusty and faithful, endeavour to conceal their deceits.</p>
               <p>We have already said how the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired<note place="margin">After the death of <hi>Francis d' O,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his Revenues to five or six, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ill.</note> above all things to provide for a good Government in his Revenues; and the reasons for which he had been obliged to leave <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis d' O,</hi> in the charge of Superintendant. After this man was dead, he gave that charge to five or six persons, whom he believed both capable and honest men: he was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he should be better served by them, then by one alone, imagining that they would serve as checks and controulers to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29592:116"/>
But the quite contrary happened: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one discharged himself on his Companion, nothing was advanced; and if any would act, the others were not wanting to cross him by their jealousies: so that they only agreed in this point, that every one looked that his Salary was well paid him; which cost the King six times more, then if he had had only one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent, whilst he drew no profit from this multitude.</p>
               <p>Knowing then that so many people did<note place="margin">Seeing that, he makes <hi>Sancy</hi> alone Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent:</note> onely imbroil his Revenues, he returned them again into the hands of one, and this was <hi>Sancy.</hi> But a short time after, finding him more proper for other Employments then that, he gave him <hi>Rosny</hi> for a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">And very little time after, <hi>Rosny,</hi>
                  </note> and after made <hi>Rosny</hi> alone Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent.</p>

                  <hi>Rosny</hi> before he entred into this Charge,<note place="margin">who knows perfectly the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</note> was provided with all necessary knowledges to acquit himself well of it; he knew perfectly all the Revenues of the Kingdom, and all the expences which were necessary. He commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated<note place="margin">Which the King knows also so well, that he could not be cheated.</note> all he knew to the King, who on his part had likewise studied all these things, so that an hundred Crowns could not be laid out, but he would know whether it were well or ill employed. <q>As it is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an unfaithful Steward that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be ignorant, and make no inspection into his affairs: so it is of a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant, that he be well instructed, and that he clearly see them, to the end
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29592:116"/>
he may know how worthily to esteem his Services.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the rest of his humour, it agreed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly<note place="margin">He desires <hi>Rosny</hi> to take no Presents without adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him.</note> well with that of the Kings. When he trusted him with his Revenues, he desired him that he would never take a bottle of wine, or any the least present without advertising him. And when <hi>Rosny</hi> did advertise him of it, he consented presently to it: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was so willing that in serving him well he might find his benefit, that oftentimes he added gifts of his own, to give him courage to serve him still better and better. But <hi>Rosny</hi> never received them till they were duly ratified in the Chamber of Accounts: to the end all the world might know the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of his Prince towards him, and that he might not be reproached that he made use of his favour to load his own Coffers.</p>

               <p>It is convenient, since it may prove necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Expedients to hinder those of the Council to share with the Farmers</note> in all times, to take notice of an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent which amongst others he found to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cousenages of the Tax-gatherers. He knew that there were some persons in the Kings Council, who held part with the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Farmers, and who caused them to be adjudged to the Council at a low price, and often made be given great Diminutions. To hinder therefore these people from eating the Cake amongst them, he stopt the hands of the general Farmers, forbidding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Farmers longer to pay them any thing, but themselves to bring the mony of their under-Farms into the Exchequer. He doubled by this means the Revenues of the King: for the under-Farms and under-Rents were found to surmount almost two thirds the<note place="margin">The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> but he derides them.</note> General Rents and Farms.</p>
               <p>Those of the Council and the Collectors at first exclaimed highly against his Conduct; they laid snares every where for him, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:29592:117"/>
begat him a thousand troubles; but with time he brought them to reason. Likewise all those who had no right to demand any thing of him, and who ceased not to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him, when they could get nothing from him, stormed against his hardness: but he cared not for their fury; he regarded onely legally to pay the debts of the King, and readily to pay what was ordained for good ends: for he knew not how to let that be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times demanded, which was truly due.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We have stayed somewhat the longer on this point of the Revenues, because it is the most important of all; that by which all things are done, and without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done; on which depends either the ease or the oppression of the people, and the good or ill success of all designs or enterprizes.</q>

               <p>Our <hi>Henry</hi> much desired at the same time<note place="margin">The King cannot yet provide for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Clergy.</note> to take care for the Reformation of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which in truth was in great disorder, as well in temporals, its goods having been usurped during the Wars by the <hi>Hugonots</hi> and wicked Catholicks; as in spirituals, the greatest part of both Prelates and Pastors being as ignorant as depraved: but he could not yet apply convenient remedies.

               <p>I have not attempted to excuse this fault; for there can never be any lawful reason given for the prostitution of the goods of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to prophane uses, or employing the treasures of the Cross in other Services then that of the Altar.

               <p>About the end of this year, the general<note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Clergy to the King.</note> Assembly of the Clergy was held at <hi>Paris,</hi> who drew up a Remonstrance to the King; by which the Prelates prayed him to cause the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be published in <hi>France:</hi> Not to charge his conscience with the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Bishops, Abbots, and other Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces having the charge of souls; not to give any persons of the Layty Pensions over Benefices; not to permit Churches and holy places to be profaned as they then were; but to take some order for their reparation, and the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of Divine Service.</p>
               <p>For what concerned the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it is to be understood that it was received in <hi>France,</hi> as to those Articles concerned the Faith; but not generally for those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Policy and Discipline, because it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many, that these last were for the most

For which reasons, whatever endeavours the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous have used, they could never compass its reception, the Parliaments having alwaies strongly opposed it.<note place="margin">The Kings answer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To the Harangue of the Clergy, the King eloquently answered, but in few words: <hi>That he acknowledged what they had said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nomination of Benefices was true; but that he was not the author of that abuse. That being come to the Crown during the flames of a Civil War, he had ran where ever he had beheld the greatest fire to extinguish it. That now he had peace, he would endeavour again to raise up those two Pillars of</hi> France, <hi>to wit, Piety and Justice. That God willing he would restore the Church to as good an Estate as it was in the time of</hi> Lewis <hi>xii. But,</hi> said he, <hi>contribute I pray you on your side; let your good Examples as much incite the people to do good, as they have been heretofore diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: you have exhorted me to my duty, and I exhort you to yours; let us act in this with envy one to another.

               </p>
               <p>All his Prudence and all his Address were not too much to teach him to govern himself so that both the Catholicks and Pope might be content with his Conduct, and the <hi>Hugonots</hi>

have no cause to be alarmed, or cantonize themselves. His Duty and his Conscience carried him to the assistance of the first; but Reason of State, and the great Obligations he had to the last, permitted him not to make them despair. To keep therefore a necessary temperature, he granted them an Edict more ample then the precedent. It was called, The Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> because it was concluded the<note place="margin">Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> granted to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>

               <p>The Parliament strongly opposed it for<note place="margin">The Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</note> more then a year: but in the end, when they were made understand that not to accord that security to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who were both pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and quarrelsome, were to rekindle new War in the Kingdom, they confirmed it.</p>

The King, considering how it would be both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the safety of the young Prince, and to his own interests, to leave him longer there, knew so well how to gain the principal of the party, that they suffered him to be brought to Court; and he gave him for Governour <hi>John,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Pisani,</hi> a Lord of a rare merit, and of a wisdome without reproach, who forgot not to instruct him well in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, and in the truest sentiments of Honour and Vertue. He was yet but seven or eight years old: when he came to nine, the King gave him the Government of <hi>Guyenne;</hi> loving him tenderly, and cherishing him as his presumptive Successour.</p>

                  <hi>Katherine</hi> was forty years of age; more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable then fair, having one Leg a little short.

               </p>
               <p>There was some difficulty about the place and the Ceremony of Celebration of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: the Duke would have it done at the Church, and the Princess by a <hi>Hugonot</hi>-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. The King found a mean: he caused it<note place="margin">The marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age made in the Kings Closet.</note> to be done in his Closet, whither he led his Sister by the hand; and commanded his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Brother, who had for about two years been
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29592:121"/>
Archbishop of <hi>Rouen,</hi> to marry them. This new Archbishop at first made some refusal of it; alledging the Canons: but the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting to him that his Closet was a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated place, and that his presence supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the default of all solemnities, the poor Archbishop had no longer power to resist him.</p>
               <p>This Marriage being made for the good of the Catholick Religion, it seemed that the Pope should have been content. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, not willing to suffer an ill that a good<note place="margin">The Pope troubled at the Duke of <hi>Bar</hi> for this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> might come of it, he declared that the Duke of <hi>Bar</hi> had incurred Excommunication, for having without the dispensation of the Church contracted with an Heretick: nor ever could the Duke, what submission soever he made, obtain Absolution. It was necessary for God to lend his hand. This Princess died three<note place="margin">Death of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess of <hi>Bar.</hi>
                  </note> years after with sadness and melancholy to see her self live in a discontented manner with her Husband, who dayly pressed her to turn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
               <p>Besides the solemnities of these Marriages, many other things entertained the Court. Two notable Changes, one of the Duke of <hi>Joyeuse,</hi> the other of the Marchioness of <hi>Bel' Isle,</hi> caused its astonishment.</p>

the habit. Few days after, there was much astonishment to see him with that habit of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence preach in the Pulpit, whom they had seen the week before dancing of Balls, as one of the most Gallant. It was said, that the holy Exhortations of his Mother, who from time to time put him in remembrance of his Vow, and some ambiguous words which the King had thrown out in converse with him, made him think that he could no longer live in the world either with safety of Conscience, or with Honour.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After this, came News to the Court, that <hi>Phillipin,</hi> Bastard to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was killed in a Duel by the <hi>Seigneur de Crequy:</hi> of whom it might be without flattery said, That he was one of the most gallant and bravest men of his time. The History of this Combat may be found written in so many places, and is yet so firm in the memory of all that wear swords, that it would be superfluous to recount the particularities.</p>
               <p>The Chase was now the Kings ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement. It is recounted, that Hunting in the Forest of <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> accompanied
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29592:122"/>
by many Lords, he heard a great noise of Horns, Hunters and Dogs, which seemed to be a great way distant; but all of an instant approached them. Some of his company who<note place="margin">The Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of the great Hunter to the King hunting at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau.</hi>
                  </note> were twenty paces before him, saw a great black man among the Bushes, who affrighted them in such manner, that they could not tell what became of him: but they heard him cry out to them with a rank and affrightful voice, <hi>M' attendez-vous,</hi> or <hi>m' entendez-vous,</hi> or <hi>amendez-vous:</hi> that is, <hi>Do you hear me;</hi> or, <hi>Do you understand me;</hi> or else, <hi>Amend your selves.</hi> The Wood-men and Country-people thereabouts, said, That it was no extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing: for they had often seen this black man, whom they named the <hi>Great Hunter,</hi> with a pack of Hounds which hunted at full cry; but never did harm to any.</p>
               <p>Infinite account is made in all Countries in the world of like illusions in Hunting. If we may give any credit to them, we may believe<note place="margin">What these fantasms may be.</note> them either to be the tricks of Sorcerers, or of some evil spirits, to whom God gives per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to convince the incredulous, and make them see that there are substances separated, and a being above man.</p>
               <p>Now if Prodigies are signes, as some have said of some great and dire Events, it may be believed that this presaged the strange death of the fair <hi>Gabriella,</hi> which happened some days after. The love which the King had for her, instead of being extinguished by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was come to such a point, that she had
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29592:122"/>
dared to demand of him, that he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<note place="margin">The fair <hi>Gabriella</hi> demands the King to espouse her, and legitimate his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He feeds her with hope.</note> his fault, and legitimate his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a subsequent marriage: nor durst he absolutely refuse her this grace, but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her still with hopes.</p>
               <p>Those who love the glory of this great King, can difficultly believe that he would have done such an action which had without doubt begot a low opinion of him, and again thrown him under his peoples hatred. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was to be feared that the allurements of this woman, who had found his weakness, with the flattery of the Courtiers whom she had almost all gained, either by presents or kindnesses, might engage this poor Prince to a dishonour. And without dissembling, he had his soul too tender towards Ladies. He was Master of all his other passions, but he was a Slave to this: nor can his memory be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this reproach: for though he were admirable in all other parts of his life, he ought not to be imitated in this.<note place="margin">She in the end obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Pope to judge of the divorce of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Gabriella,</hi> flattering her self with a hope to be ere long his Wife, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from those hopes himself had given her, acted so well, that she obliged him to demand of the Pope Commissioners to judge of the Divorce between him and Queen <hi>Margaret.</hi> And the King, that he might finde favour with the holy Father, and render him more facile to his intentions, caused to be said under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that he would marry <hi>Maria de Medices</hi> his Neece, Sister to the Duke of <hi>Florence:</hi> for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29592:123"/>
whom nevertheless it was believed that he had not then any desire.</p>
               <p>And the Pope, were it that he distrusted his intention, or that he saw that Queen <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> lent not her hand to it, protracted the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and returned onely ambiguous Answers. It was likewise said, that being one day much pressed by the Cardinal <hi>d'Ossat</hi> and by <hi>Sillery</hi> to give content to their Master, for want of which, said they, he may pass further, and espouse the Dutchess; he was so astonished at this discourse, that he immediately remitted the conduct of this Affair to the hand of God, commanded a Fast through all the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and went himself to Prayers, to demand of God to inspire him with what should be best for his glory. That at the end of his Prayer he cryed out as if he had been revived from an Extasie, <hi>God hath provided;</hi> and that in few days after, there arrived a Courrier at <hi>Rome,</hi> bringing News of the death of the Dutchess.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the King grew impatient at these delays; and it was to be feared lest a disdain to be neglected should cast him into the same inconveniencies it had formerly done <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>England;</hi> or by the counsel of some flatterers, forcing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his nature, be perswaded to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> in any manner so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.<note place="margin">The King remains at <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau</hi> to do his <hi>Easter</hi>-devotions, and sends the fair <hi>Gabriella</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi>

the King desiring to do his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for that holy time far from all object of scandal, sent her to <hi>Paris,</hi> accompanying her just half way.

The first fury of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passed, she would no longer stay in that house, but caused her self to be carried to that of Madam <hi>de Sourdis</hi> her Aunt, near St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> of the <hi>Auxerrois.</hi> And all the rest of that day, and the morrow, she was perplexed with<note place="margin">She dies in a strange manner.</note> Swoondings and Convulsions, of which she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Saturday</hi>-morning.</p>
               <p>The causes of her death were diversly spoken of: but however, it was a happiness to <hi>France,</hi> since it deprived the King of an object for which he was about to loose both himself and his Estate. His grief was as great as his love had been: yet he, not being of those feeble<note place="margin">The King comforts himself, &amp; conserves an extream tenderness for her Children.</note> souls who please themselves in perpetuating their sorrows, and in bathing themselves in their tears, received not onely those comforts he sought, but still conserved for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and particularly for the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosm,</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:29592:124"/>
that affection he had born the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>All good French-men passionately desired that so good a King might leave legitimate Children. They durst not press him to take a Wife capable to bring him forth such, so long as <hi>Gabriella</hi> lived, for fear lest he should espouse her: and out of the same fear, Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> would not give her consent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve his marriage. But when <hi>Gabriella</hi> was dead, she willingly lent her hand to it; and her self addressed a Request to the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> presents a request to the Pope to dissolve her marriage.</note> to demand the dissolution, founding it principally on two causes of nullity.

The second, the Proximity of Kindred found between them in the third degree: for which she said there had never been any valuable Dispensation.</p>

These Deputations will not seem strange to those who know our ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; where it may be seen, that neither the King nor his Children married but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Barons: and this passed in that time for almost a Fundamental Law of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Henry,</hi> though so great a Prince as he was, had these people near him, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his weakness as to women, in stead of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying him against it, and restraining him like true friends, they spurred him (as it were) forward in his wickedness, and made their fortunes from his faults. It was these, who by commending the Beauties, the Carriage, the Spirit, and the divertizing and pleasant discourse of <hi>Madamoiselle d' Entragues,</hi> made him first have a desire to see and to love her. They could never have done a worse Service for their Master then this. She had certainly many Charms, nor had she less spirit and

cunning. Her refusals and modesty did more and more provoke the Kings Passion. Though<note place="margin">The King gives an hundred thousand crowns to <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle d' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragues.</hi>
                  </note> he was not prodigal, he caused an hundred thousand crowns to be carried her at once. She refused them not, and reciprocally testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied much love and impatience for so great a King: but she cunningly caused her Father and Mother to observe her so near, that she could not give him a full conveniency to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Hereupon she let him understand, that she even dispaired that she could not keep her word with him; that it was necessary to have the consent of her Father and Mother, for which on her part she would labour. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, after many delays and put offs, she told him, that they could not be brought to so delicate a point, except, were it onely to secure their consciences towards God, and their honour towards the world, his Majesty would make her a promise of Marriage: That she had no desire to serve her self of such a<note place="margin">Her cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bring him to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</note> writing; and that if she would do it, she knew well there was no Officer who durst cite a Man who had fifty thousand men of war at his command: but that these good people desired it should be so; and that he need make no difficulty to please their fancy, since he did but give her a little bit of paper in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the most precious thing she had in the world. In fine, she knew so well how<note place="margin">She gets a promise of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from him.</note> to work his spirit, that he gave her a promise under his hand, by which he obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29592:127"/>
to espouse her in a year, so that in that time she brought forth a Male-child.</p>
               <p>All this intrigue may be seen in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sully</hi> tears it, but the King makes another.</note> of <hi>Sully,</hi> where he says, that the King having led him alone into the first Gallery of <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> shewed him this promise written under his hand, and demanded his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: That in stead of formally answering him concerning it, he tore it in two pieces: That the King remained quite astonished, and speaking angerly, <hi>How! now I believe that you are a fool:</hi> and that he answered, <hi>It is true Sir that I am a fool, and could wish I were more so, so that I alone in</hi> France <hi>were one.</hi> That at his departing from the Gallery, the King entred into his Closet, and demanded a pen and inke, and that he believed it was to write another. However it were, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise caused much trouble afterward: for the Lady would have made it valid, as we shall speak.</p>
               <p>At the same time that the King pusued the<note place="margin">He pursues at <hi>Rome</hi> the decision of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate of <hi>Saluces.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To understand this well, it must be known<note place="margin">How that Marquisate appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him.</note> that this Marquisate was a <hi>Fief</hi> dependant of the <hi>Daulphinate,</hi> of which King <hi>Francis</hi> the first had seized himself by right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, for default of heirs Males in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29592:127"/>
Succession of the Lords that held it. Now in 1588. during the Estates of <hi>Blois,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having advice that the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very strong in <hi>France,</hi> and that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently<note place="margin">How the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> seized it.</note> that Monarchy would dismember, snatched this Marquisate, without having any subject of quarrel: he cloaked only this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just usurpation with this fair pretext, that he seized it out of fear lest <hi>Lesdiguieres</hi> should possess himself of it, and by this means esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <hi>Hugonotism</hi> in the midst of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
               <p>Seven years after, to wit, in the year 1595. the King being gone to <hi>Lyons,</hi> after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of <hi>Fountain-franzoise,</hi> the Duke, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw<note place="margin">An accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation spoke of.</note> well he would again have this Marquisate, proposed to him some accommodation for it. The King offered to give it to one of his Sons,<note place="margin">He offers it to be held at faith &amp; homage.</note> to hold it at faith and homage, with some other conditions; but the Duke demanded it without any dependance, and so this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was broken.</p>
               <p>Our Ambassadors treating the general<note place="margin">By the Treaty of <hi>Vervin</hi> the business is remitted to the Popes Arbitration</note> peace at <hi>Vervin,</hi> were not wanting instantly to demand the restitution of that <hi>Fief.</hi> Those of the Duke who assisted, alledged in favour of their Master, that piece appertained to him as being a <hi>Fief</hi> dependant of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that he had more essential titles to prove that dependancy, which it was necessary to see, to decide the difference with knowledge of the cause. Now it would have taken up too much time to cause them to come from <hi>Savoy:</hi> And
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29592:128"/>
the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> pressed the peace, for fear lest during these delays some accident might happen to break it quite: so that not to retard it, it was judged convenient to refer to the Pope the decision of this affair, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he should terminate it in a year.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> during that time sollicited strongly at <hi>Rome</hi> to have it decided. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> defended it onely at extremity, and that for fear to lose their cause by default. Both the one and the other produced their Titles: Those of the <hi>French</hi> were the best, and moreover, they had had a peaceable pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of more then sixty years, which was more then sufficient to gain prescription. The year being expired, the Pope demands of the King the prolongation of two months, to give in his sentence of Arbitration, and that in the mean time the Marquisate should be seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in his hands. The King willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents:<note place="margin">The Pope refuses far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, &amp; why.</note> but the Duke enters into a mistrust that the Pope would have it for one of his Nephews: so that his Ambassador having testified this mistrust, the Pope refuses to meddle any farther, either with the Gage or with the Arbitration.</p>
               <p>The Duke imagined that his best way was<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> strives to gain time.</note> to use delays, since it might happen that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>French</hi> King would grow weary of following of this business, or that some other more important affair might divert his thoughts otherwhere. Moreover, knowing that there were many melancholy spirits,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29592:128"/>
who could not be recovered out of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the King was still in his heart a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and with them many concealed and dangerous enemies, so that no year passed but with many conspiracies against his person, he hoped that in the end some of them might succeed. In effect, that year there had been three discovered, of which that which made most noise was of a woman, who offered to the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> to poison him; but the Count discovered it, and she was buried alive in the <hi>Greve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the end therefore to gain time, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired<note place="margin">He would come to <hi>France</hi> to confer with the King.</note> to come himself into <hi>France,</hi> having so good an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> opinion of his own cunning and slights, that he assured himself he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King the gift of this Marquisate; or at least he pretended to make such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and to employ so many artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that there should pass more then a year before he should untangle them. He said that his Ambassador had sent him word, that he had heard the King say, that if they were together, they would decide this difference like friends; and that it was this good word had set him on his voyage. But many suspected, and that with some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that he had a design to gain some people in the Kings Council, to sound the affections, and observe and watch the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; to cast abroad seeds of corruption and division, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> renew that intelligence might be useful to him at Court. Others
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:29592:129"/>
imagined that he was discontented with <hi>Spain,</hi> because <hi>Philip</hi> the second having given the<note place="margin">What might be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of his voyage.</note> Low-Countries in Dower to his youngest Daughter, he had left to the eldest, wife of this Duke, only a Crucifix and an Image of our Lady. Moreover, he had indeed received some displeasures from the Ministers of <hi>Spain;</hi> and he spread a report abroad, were it true or not, that he had undertaken this voyage without communicating any thing to <hi>Philip</hi> the third his Brother-in-law. In fine, every one judged according to his fancy; and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly none divined the secrets of his thoughts, there being never any Prince more close or less penetrable then he. And some said his Heart was covered with mountains, as well as his Country; that is, because that he was Hulch-back't, as <hi>Savoy</hi> was mountainous.</p>
               <p>He brought with him a Train which well<note place="margin">His Train.</note> set forth his degree: for he had with him twelve hundred horse: but all his Officers were clad in mourning, by reason of the death of his Wife; which many took as an ill presage.<note place="margin">The King causes him to be well received every where.

                  </note> The King desiring to receive him according to his dignity, commanded all the Cities and the Governours to render him the same honour as if he were there in person.</p>
               <p>He came to <hi>Lyons</hi> by the River of <hi>Roan,</hi> and was received by <hi>la Guiche</hi> Governour of that City. But the <hi>Chapiter</hi> of <hi>St. John</hi> would not give him the place of Canon and Count of that Church, because he no longer posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the County of <hi>Villars,</hi> by virtue of which

the Counts of <hi>Savoy</hi> had been at other times received. Adding to this, that he had not his Titles, nor would give time to make proof of his Nobility; of which the Chapiter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences not with any whatsoever beside our Kings.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Lyons</hi> he came to <hi>Roanna,</hi> descended<note place="margin">Arrives at <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau</hi> where the King is</note> by water to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and after came post to <hi>Fontain-bleau,</hi> where the King was.

               <p>The beginning of this year beheld the King<note place="margin">Great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friendship between the King and Duke.</note> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> live with so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, and so many proofs of friendship, that it was believed that they had both but the same heart. The <hi>French</hi> Courtesie and Civility obliged the King to give the Duke all sorts of good Treatments; and the desire which the Duke had to obtain from him the Marquisate, moved him to a great Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to seek all means to render himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to so great a King. The Court of <hi>France</hi> avowed it had never seen a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Courtier; the Ladies, a more pleasing Gallant; and the Officers of the King and the great ones, a Prince more liberal. He knew how to govern himself in such manner with the<note place="margin">How the Duke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Kings Court.</note> King, that he neither acted his Companion nor his Servant: and if he would appear infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him in Grandeur, he endeavoured to be superiour to him in Generosity and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29592:130"/>
he gave with full hands, especially to the principal men of the Court. The King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to accept his presents, and on his side gave very great ones to the Duke: he treated him, and made the Chiefs of the Court treat him; every day shewing him some new subject of divertisement. Among other things, he desired that he should see his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">The King shews him his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which our Kings have usually shewn to strange Princes, as a <hi>Compendium</hi> of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the place where their Majesty sits with the greatest splendour.

               <p>There was no Civility or Courtesie which the King shewed not to the Duke: but after all, he released not to him the Marquisate.<note place="margin">Yet the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leases not to him the Marquisate</note> The Duke tryed the business all ways possible: sometimes he offered to hold it in homage from the Crown; sometimes he proposed to the King his great Designes on the <hi>Milanois,</hi> and on the Empire; sometimes he laid before him the platform of a puissant League to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> But the King was too wise <note n="*" place="margin">The French hath it, <hi>Prendre le Change,</hi> which is taken for flying out at a wrong Deer like hounds of Riot.</note> to be gulled by gilded shadows: he
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29592:131"/>
answered, That he had no ambition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Estate of another, but onely to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own: That he would not speak of this Affair to the Duke, but that they ought refer that to their Council. In effect, they named some persons, who conferred together: but those of the King insisting dayly on its restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Duke endeavouring to free it to himself, nothing was concluded.</p>
               <p>Yet though all hopes were wanting to the Duke of obtaining any thing, he lost not at all his Courage, but trusted to the secret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences he had renewed with some great ones of the Court, and particularly with the Duke of <hi>Byron.</hi> Many believe that he began now<note place="margin">The Duke not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, it is believed he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to debauch <hi>Byron</hi> by the means of <hi>Laffin.</hi>

The King knew him well; and often seeing him very familiar with <hi>Byron,</hi> he had the goodness to tell the Marshall more then once, <hi>Let not that man approach you; he is a plague; be will ruine you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke knew that <hi>Byron</hi> loved the King, because he had raised him to the greatest Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his Realm; and that the Prince like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise honoured him with his Good-will. It was therefore necessary to make him loose this affection, to render him capable of any evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:29592:131"/>
                  <hi>Byron</hi> was without doubt brave and valiant to the utmost; but so puft up with his Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">The vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Byron</hi> become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable</note> that he could not suffer any person to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual him.

He believed that he ought him his Crown, that he could refuse him nothing, and that he should govern him absolutely.

               <p>
                  <q>It is certainly a noble Ambition, and not<note place="margin">A good and important Reflection.</note> onely well placed, but absolutely necessary for a King, to believe none of his Subjects more worthy then himself. When he hath not this good opinion of himself, he lets himself be governed by him whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a more able man then himself; and by this means soon falls into Captivity: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he may be deceived, he ought still to esteem himself the most capable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to govern in his whole Realm. I may say rather, that he cannot deceive himself in this, because there is no person more proper then himself, however ignorant he be to rule his Estate, God having destined this

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Great had therefore taken some disgust against the Marshal of <hi>Byron</hi> by reason of his vanity; so that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> praising one day the Noble Actions and great Services of <hi>Byron,</hi> both Father and Son, the King answered, <q>That it was true, they had served him well, but that he had taken great pains to moderate the drunkenness of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the violent passions of the Son.</q> The Duke remembred these words, and caused<note place="margin">The Duke causes to be carried to <hi>Byron</hi> some disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious words of the Kings.</note> them to be carried by <hi>Laffin</hi> to <hi>Byron,</hi> who, touched in his most sensible part, was transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a thousand extravagancies; and having lost all respect, lost likewise that affection he had left for the King. It hath been suspected that he at present abandoned himself to all manner of wicked designes, and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to enter into a League which the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyard</hi> was to make with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> on condition that he gave him his Daughter in marriage, and assisted him to make himself Duke of <hi>Bourgongne.</hi>

King, who would not give him subject to say that he had treated him with the utmost ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, gave him to understand, that if the<note place="margin">The King proposes to the Duke the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate for <hi>la Bresse.</hi>
                  </note> Marquisate was so commodious to him, and that he could not restore it without a notable inconveniency, he would be content to take <hi>la Bresse</hi> in exchange. This Condition seemed no less hard to the Duke then that of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Marquisate: however, that he might have some pretext to retire with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he seemed not averse to it; and there<note place="margin">The Duke seems not a verse, but takes three moneths to consider.</note> were some Articles drawn up, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed were not disagreeable to him: But he demanded time to consider of the Alternative of the Restitution or Change, and to take advice of the Grandees of his Estate on so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a thing.

               <p>After that the Duke had by divers Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces drawn out the Negotiation almost two moneths longer, the King, wearied with these delays, prepared himself to bind this <hi>Proteus,</hi> who changed himself into all sorts of forms; and to force him to give a certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

He advanced to <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither he had before sent his Council.

This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference furiously incensed such a high spirit, who believed nothing either could or ought to be done without him. Afterwards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusals of the King to give him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City of <hi>Bourg,</hi> put him quite out of his senses.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> believed his Fortresses of <hi>Montmelian</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and of <hi>Bourg</hi> in <hi>Bresse</hi> impregnable, reposing the security of his Country upon them. He was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized

However, when they saw the Citadel of <hi>Bourg</hi> reduced to extremity, they instantly sollicited the Legat to renew the first earnests of the Treaty. But he would do nothing till they had given it him in writing, that they besought it for

the good of their Masters affairs.</p>
               <p>When the Articles were drawn up and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,<note place="margin">1610.</note> they were signed on the one part and<note place="margin">The peace agreed, signed and published at <hi>Lyons.</hi>

The King for a Marquisate of little extent, distant from all his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and encompassed by those of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and which he could not keep but by great Garisons, which would consume twice more then the Revenue it yeilded; gained a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of more then twenty five Leagues extent, which was bounding upon his, which enlarged his Frontier, in which he had eight hundred Gentlemen, and which was very fertil and abundant, principally in pastures to nourish
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:29592:137"/>
Cattel. The Duke appropriating to himself the Marquisate, took a troublesome Thorn out of his foot, or rather a Sword which pierced through his body; and put himself in security. For whilst the <hi>French</hi> held it, he durst not go out of <hi>Turin</hi> but with three or four hundred horse for his Convoy; and he was forced to maintain great Garisons in the midle of his Country.</p>

               <p>Moreover, he had a care not to grow sleepy whilst it was fair weather, which is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful: for besides that a good King ought to labour within his Estate during peace, as well as without during war; he knew that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>Savoyard</hi> still grumbled, and contrived in their hearts some enterprize against him.

But the King judged not so little advantage to countervail the giving subject to the enemies to break the peace, and to re-enter into a War; which might have proved very dangerous, they being so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully Armed. Moreover, he feared lest there were still in his Estate some fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed under the embers; which on the noise of a War, might more facilely make their attempts upon his person. For to tell the truth, he had more reason to fear their Knives and Daggers then their Swords.

                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:29592:139"/>There were made many discourses and writings concerning the rights and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<note place="margin">Discourse of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> of Ambassadors. It is true, said they, that an Ambassador hath alone right of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Justice in his Palace; but the people of his train are subject to the Justice of the estate in which they are, for those faults they commit out of his Palace; and so if they be taken out of it, their Process may be made: and though it be known that this rigour is not generally observed, and that the respect born to the Ambassadors person, extends to all those that follow him; yet however this is a courtesie, and not a right. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it is not permitted to go seek the Criminal in the Palace of the Ambassador, which is a sacred place, and a certain Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his people; yet ought it not however to be abused, or made a retreat for wicked persons, nor give Sanctuary to the Subjects of a Prince against the Laws and Justice of his Realm: for in such cases, on complaint to his Master, he is obliged to do reason.<note place="margin">The King being offended, recals his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note>

               <p>Now the King being offended, as he ought to be, at the injury done to <hi>France</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Ambassador, and not judging the satisfaction the Magistrate had given him suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; commands him immediately to return; which he did, without taking leave of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He forbade likewise at the same time, all Commerce with <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and foreseeing that in these beginnings of the rupture, they might enterprize somewhat on

               <p>The people, who began to taste the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of repose, and to Till their lands with patience, trembled for fear lest a new War should expose them once more to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense of the Souldiers.

The King who never let himself be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Courtesie no more then by Arms,<note place="margin">The King returns the civility to the Arch-Duke.</note> sent the Duke of <hi>Aiguillon,</hi> eldest Son of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> to assure him that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to maintain the peace; that he was not advanced on the Frontiers but to dissipate some designs which were contriving, and that he hoped in the equity of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he doubted not would do him reason.</p>

               <p>This Queen endeavoured by all means possible, to make known to the <hi>French</hi> her greatness and power. One day holding<note place="margin">To whom she shews the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> head</note>

               <p>VVe must not forget, how that before the King made his voyage to <hi>Calais,</hi> he had led the Queen with him to enjoy the <hi>Jubilee</hi> in<note place="margin">The King &amp; Queen enjoy the <hi>Jubilee</hi> at <hi>Orleans.</hi>

               <p>All <hi>France</hi> during this holy <hi>Jubilee,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly demanded of Heaven that it would be pleased to give them a <hi>Daulphine,</hi> to deliver them from those misfortunes wherein they should be plunged, if the King should die<note place="margin">The Queen brought to bed of a <hi>Daulphine,</hi> who is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Lewis,</hi> after sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>The Just.</hi>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:29592:141"/>
His Birth was preceded by a great Earthquake, which happened some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The Birth was very hard, and the infant laboured till he was all of a purple-colour; which possibly ruined within the principal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Health and good Constitution. The King invoking on him the Benediction of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">The King gives him his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and puts his sword in his hand.</note> gave him likewise his, and put his Sword in his hand, praying to God, <hi>That he would give him the grace to use it onely for his glory, and for the defence of the people.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Blood which were with him in the Chamber of the Queen, all of them saluted the <hi>Daulphine</hi> one after another. I omit how express Curriers carried this News in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Provinces, the publick rejoycings throughout the whole Kingdome, particularly in the great City of <hi>Paris,</hi> who as much loved <hi>Henry</hi> the great, as they had hated his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor; the Complements the King received on his part from all the Potentates of <hi>Europe;</hi> and the accustomed Present of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in like occasions, to wit, the blessed swathling bands, which he sent by <hi>Seigneur Barbarino,</hi> who was afterwards Cardinal and Pope, named <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>viii.</hi>

Those amongst the <hi>French</hi> who penetrated
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:29592:141"/>
farthest into things to come, took likewise part in this joy, but for another reason, which was, that this Princess being of the same age with the <hi>Daulphine,</hi> it seemed that Heaven had made the one be born for the other, and that she ought one day be his Spouse; as in effect <hi>Lewis xiii.</hi> had this happiness, and <hi>France</hi> still possesses it; admiring in all occasions the rare Wisdom, the exemplary Piety, and heroick Constancy of this great Princess.</p>
               <p>In acknowledgement of the grace which<note place="margin">The King makes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Orders for the good of the Estate.</note> God had done to the King in giving him a <hi>Daulphine,</hi> which was the sum of his wishes, he redoubled his care and diligence to acquit himself well of what he ought to his Estate, to better, as he said, the succession of his Son. We will here recount some Establishments and Orders he made to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Need of monies having obliged him during<note place="margin">He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the Triennial Officers for Revenues.</note> the Siege of <hi>Amiens</hi> to create Triennial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his Revenues; when it was passed, he knew that there was no need of so many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rifle his purse; and that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible but some little should every day remain in the hands of every one of these: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he suppressed these new Officers, and commanded that the ancient and Alternative ones should re-imburse the Triennial. From this suppression were excepted the Treasurers of the Exchequer, and those of casual Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Fines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosny</hi> had so well bridled both the Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the Farmers, that they could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

devour those great Morsels they did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But this was not yet enough: they were in such manner gorged before he was Superintendent, that the King with infinite<note place="margin">He esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth a Chamber of Justice to call Treasurers and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> justice ordained a Tribunal, composed of a certain number of Judges chosen out of the Soveraign Courts, and called it, <hi>The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Royal;</hi> whom he charged to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act search of the misdemeanours of those who had managed the Kings monies. This Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber made a great many disembogue: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a great part found the means to escape them; some out of a Consideration of their Alliances, others by force of money, gaining those who were near the King, principally his Mistr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We need not then wonder if those people filled their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as full as they could, since the fuller they heaped them, the more facile was their justification.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have already said it, and I say it again, (for it cannot be too often nor too much observed) that there is no remedy to hinder this disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">The onely remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their thefts.</note> which is the greatest of all disorders in the Estate, and the cause of all others, save onely the vigilance and exactness of the King. <q>He must himself hold the strings of his purse, have his eye still upon his Coffers, know punctually what is in them, what comes out of them; what ways his monies accrue, to

what uses they are employed, who are they that manage them: and above all, he must make them give a good account, as our <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> did, that if they be honest men, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be corrupted; and if they are knaves, not have the means to act their knavery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was made to know, that there were two other disorders in his Realm which extreamly impoverished it, and drew from it all the Gold and Silver. The one was the transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it to strange Countries, into <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where the little Potentates melted it, and made money of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aser Alloy. The other, was the Luxury which consumed likewise a great quantity in Embroyderies, Silver and Gold Lace on Cloaths, and no less in the gilding of Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scots and Chimnies, and divers Moveables.</p>
               <p>He made two severe Edicts, which prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">The King prohibites the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of gold or silver out of his Kingdome,</note> these two abuses. For the first, he renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ancient Orders concerning the transport of Gold and Silver; adding the punishment of the Halter to the Transgressors; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Governours to watch diligently the Observation of these his Prohibitions, and not to give any Pass-ports to the contrary; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he declared them partakers in such Transports.</p>
               <p>By the second, he prohibited under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty<note place="margin">and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gold and silver lace, or gildings.</note> of great Fines for the first time, and of imprisonment for the second, the wearing of Gold and Silver upon Cloaths, or employing it in Gildings. This Edict was rigorously obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:29592:143"/>
because it excepted no person; the King himself submitting to the Law he made, and having looked with an ill Countenance on a Prince of the Blood who obeyed not this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>There was likewise expended a prodigious quantity of money in Silks; by the buying of which, all our money was gotten into strangers hands.

                  </note> that the use of these Stuffs was very good and commodious, thought it best to introduce the Manufacture into <hi>France;</hi> to the end the <hi>French</hi> might gain what was now gained by the strangers. To this purpose he gave order for the planting of a great number of white Mulberry-trees in those Countries where they would best thrive, and particularly in <hi>Touraine,</hi> to nourish Silk-worms; and that people should be provided who understood how to prepare the Webs, and put to work the labour of these pretio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ter his death to maintain this Order, and to extend it to other Provinces, it might have spared <hi>France</hi> more then five Millions, which it every year sends out to provide silk Stuffs: besides, a Million of persons, useless for other labours, as are old people, Maids and Children, might have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a living by it, and the Employers more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have afforded to pay the Imposts and Taxes out of the profit they had made of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>
               <p>There was yet a much greater mischief,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:29592:143"/>
which, as we may say, dryed up the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the Kingdom; this was the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive<note place="margin">The usury excessive in <hi>France,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</note> Usury. The ill Husbands, that is to say, the greatest part of the Nobility, borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money at ten or twelve in the hundred. In which there was two great inconveniences. The first, That the Interests undermining by little and little in seven or eight years, dug up<note place="margin">the ruine of the best fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</note> the foundations of the richest and most ancient Houses, which are, as we may say, the Props and Pillars that uphold the State. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That the Merchants finding this conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency<note place="margin">and the Merchants to abandon all traffick.</note> of laying out their money to so great profit, and without any hazard, absolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all Commerce; <q>the streams of which once dryed up, there must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a famine of Gold and Silver in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for <hi>France</hi> hath no other Mines then its Traffick, and the distribution of its Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These Considerations obliged the King not<note place="margin">The King reduces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests to six in the hundred.</note> onely to prohibit all Usuries, but lay a penalty of the Confiscation of the sum lent, and great Fines beside. Afterwards the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted some Counsellours in all Provinces to make inquisition after Usurers, and to reduce all Interests or Hypothecated Rents to six and a half in the hundred. They were before at ten or twelve, as we have said. The reason of which was, because when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, money was much more scarce: now since it was extreamly multiplyed, since the discovery of the Indies, it was just to abate its
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:29592:144"/>
interests: And it was for this reason that it was afterwards put at six, and may possibly one day be reduced lower.</p>
               <p>Out of the same designe to enrich his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">His great care to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich his Kingdom.</note> and to bring abundance and plenty into his Kingdome, the King continually received all Proposals which might serve to enlarge Commerce, to bring Commodity to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to till and make fruitful the most ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile places. He endeavoured as much as was possible to make Rivers Navigable. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be repaired all Bridges and Caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and the great Roads to be paved; knowing that whilst they are not well kept, Carriages find but a difficult passage, and Commerce is by that means interrupted. From whence happen the same disorders in the oeconomy of an Estate, as doth in that of a mans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> body, when it findes Obstructions, and when the passage of the blood and spirits are not free.</p>
               <p>When he passed through the Countries, he curiously regarded all things, took notice of the necessities and disorders, and immediately remedied all with a great diligence. Under his favour and protection were established in<note place="margin">He favours the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. After his example, all labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their benefit.</note> many places of the Kingdom Manufactures of Linen and Woollen Cloths, Laces, Iron-ware, and many other things.</p>
               <p>After his example, the Burgesses repaired their houses which the War had ruined. The Gentlemen having laid by their Arms with onely a switch in their hand, dedicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:29592:144"/>
to manage their Estates, and augment their Revenues. All the people were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their work: and it was a wonder to see this Kingdom, which five or six years before had been, as we may say, a Den of Serpents and venemous Beasts, being filled with Thieves, Robbers, Vagrants, Rake-hells and Beggers, changed by the diligence of the King into a Hive of innocent Bees; who strove, as it were, with envy to each other, to give proofs of their industry, and to gather Wax and Honey. Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was a shame, and a kinde of Crime; and indeed it is, as the Proverb says, the Mother of all Vices. <q>That spirit which takes no care to employ it self seriously in something, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to it self, and pernitious to the publick.</q> And for these Reasons did the Provosts in that<note place="margin">Idleness punished.</note> time make diligent search after Loyterers, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, and idle persons, and sent them to serve the King in his Gallies, to oblige them perforce to work.</p>
               <p>There is no happiness so stable and assured,<note place="margin">1602.</note> but it may be easily troubled: there arrived<note place="margin">The King remedies two things capable to overthrow <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> this year two things which might have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned all <hi>France,</hi> had not the King in a good hour subverted them.</p>
               <p>The Assembly of the Notables or Chiefs at <hi>Rouen,</hi> which was held in the year 1596. to raise money for the King to continue the War and pay his debts, had granted him, as we have said, the imposition of a <hi>Sol pour livre</hi> on all Merchandizes carried into walled Cities. <q>The Estate (says <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the greatest Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:29592:145"/>
among Historians) cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Forces, nor the Forces without Payment, nor they paid without Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: by consequence therefore they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; and it is just that every one should contribute to the expences of an Estate of which he makes a part, as well as partake of those Conveniences and that protection it enjoys. But these impositions ought to be moderate, proportionate to the power of every one; and every one ought to bear his part. Moreover, it should be easie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the expence of raising them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not the principal; that they be not laid so, as to appear odious, as on Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes which nourish the poor: and that, in fine, they be blood drawn gently from the veins, and not marrow forced from the bones.</q> Now the imposition of a <hi>Sol pour livre</hi> was of this nature. It was very oppressive:<note place="margin">The tax of a <hi>Sol pour livre</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome.</note> for in every City they searched the Merchants Goods, opened their Bales, and saw what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one brought: so that liberty was quite lost in the Kingdom. Moreover, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive: for any Merchandize being ten or twelve times sold, it was found that it paid as much Impost as it was worth. Moreover, there was great expence in the sale of it: for men were forced to employ as many Factors as would have composed an Army; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring all to make themselves rich as well as their Masters, were so vexatious to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that they became desperate. And that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:29592:145"/>
was most strange, was, that there were in the Kings Council Pensioners to these Farmers, who supported them in their violences, and upheld them against all Complaints made of their misdemeanours.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By these sweet Remonstrances, he calmed<note place="margin">He calms the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and revokes the <hi>Sol pour livre.</hi>

But this was onely for the honour of the Royal Authority: for soon after, this Prince, the most just and best that ever was, knowing the extream Vexations it caused, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and utterly abolished it.</p>
               <p>The second thing which gave him yet more trouble, and which was capable to overthrow his Kingdome if it were not remedied, was, The Conspiracy of Marshal <hi>Byron.</hi> It is to be<note place="margin">Conspiracy of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal <hi>Byron.</hi>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:29592:146"/>
But seeing that there was no assurance in the words of the <hi>Savoyard,</hi> and that <hi>Byron</hi> began to shake, he resolved to discover the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Laffin</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it to the King.</note> whole plot to the King; were it that he feared lest if he should too long delay it, it might be discovered other ways; or that he hoped by this service to gain a great recompence, and restore himself to the Kings favour, with whom he stood on very ill terms.</p>
               <p>Having laid this designe, he employed the <note n="*" place="margin">

He had preserved se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters committed to his keeping; but they said not enough, nor spoke so clearly as to make a Conviction. But to pass an absolute one, see what he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Byron</hi> had some Notes written with his own<note place="margin">How he got the Notes written with <hi>Byron</hi>'s own hand.</note> hand, wherein the Conspiracy was laid down in Articles. <hi>Laffin</hi> remonstrated to him, that it was an imprudence to keep them, and to communicate them, because his writing was too well known: that it would be more secure to make a Copy, and burn the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. <hi>Byron</hi> approving his counsel, gives them him to transcribe. He indeed transcribes them whilst <hi>Byron</hi> lay on his Bed: afterwards giving him the Copy, and ruffling up the Original, he makes shew of casting it into the fire; but by a premeditated cunning, he casts in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers, and keeps them. A thing of this
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:29592:147"/>
importance deserved well the care of <hi>Byron</hi> himself in its burning: but he not taking it, because God so permitted, that negligence cost him his life, as we shall see.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Laffin</hi> continuing still his devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to endeavour yet to gather some more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular secrets, he went disguised to <hi>Milan,</hi> and conferred with the Count <hi>Fuentes:</hi> but this close and able <hi>Spaniard,</hi> finding well that he would betray them, shewed himself more reserved. It hath been reported, that <hi>Laffin</hi> having knowledge of this distrust, was fearful lest he should make him away, and therefore returned by the unusual and unfrequented ways: of which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> keeps <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naze Laffins</hi> Secretary.</note> by <hi>Fuentes,</hi> kept prisoner the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of <hi>Laffin</hi> named <hi>Renaze,</hi> for fear lest he should go serve as a witness against <hi>Byron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their Conferences they had proposed to dismember the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> That the<note place="margin">Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Byron,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Count <hi>Fuentes.</hi>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29592:147"/>
people, already much incensed by the <hi>Pancarte,</hi> or Tax of a <hi>Sol pour livre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these propositions, say some, were made<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Byron</hi> had demanded pardon of the King, but after fell again.</note> in the time of the war against <hi>Savoy;</hi> and the Marshal of <hi>Byron</hi> grown outragious, at the Kings refusal to give him the Citadel of <hi>Bourg,</hi> had not only lent his eare, but had engaged himself very far in these damnable designs. However, he seemed to have repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: for he had confessed them to the King walking with him in the Cloister of the <hi>Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> at <hi>Lions,</hi> and had demanded pardon of him; but he had neglected to take an aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or script of indempnity, contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Duke <hi>d' Espernon,</hi> who was more wise and considerate then he.</p>
               <p>But a little after, repenting himself for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repented, he was returned to his first fault, and yet entertained correspondence with strangers. Moreover, he spoke of the<note place="margin">He speaks ill of the King, and boasts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively of himself.</note> King with little respect, abasing the splendor of his worthy actions, glorifying his own, and boasting that he had put the Crown on his head, and preserved <hi>France.</hi> In fine, all his discourses were onely Bravadoes, Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montadoes, and Threats.</p>
               <p>All this was reported to the King: It was told him that he undervalued his great acts, extolled the power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> praysed the wisdome of that Princes Council, his liberality in recompencing all good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and his zeal to defend the true Religion. The King answered plainly and prudently to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29592:148"/>
those that made him these reports: <hi>That he knew the heart of</hi> Byron, <hi>that it was faithful and affectionate: that in truth his tongue was intemperate; but that in favour of those good actions he had done, he could pardon his ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now two things compleated his loss, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged<note place="margin">Two things compleat his loss.</note> the King to search into the very bottom of his wicked designs. The first was the too great number of his friends, and the affection of the Souldiery, which he made boast of, as if they had been absolute dependants on his Command, and capable to do whatever he would. The second, the most particular friendship he had with the <hi>Count d' Auvergne,</hi> brother by the Mothers side to <hi>Madamoiselle d' Entragues,</hi> who was called the Marchioness of <hi>Verneuil.</hi> For by the one he begat a jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in the King, and made himself be feared; and by the other he rendred himself odious to the Queen, who imagined, and possibly not without cause, that he would make a party in the Kingdom to maintain that Rival and her Children, to her prejudice.</p>
               <p>Now the King desiring to search the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Laffin</hi> comes to Court, and reveals all to the King.</note> he could into this affair, sends for <hi>Laffin,</hi> who comes to <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> more then a month before the King departed towards <hi>Poictou.</hi> He had at first some very secret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments with him, afterwards very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ones; and gave him great quantities of Papers; amongst other, those <hi>Memoires</hi> or Notes written by <hi>Byrons</hi> own hand, of which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29592:148"/>
we have before spoken. That which <hi>Laffin</hi> revealed to the King, begat great inquietudes in his spirit; so that in all the voyage of <hi>Poictiers</hi> he was observed extremely pensive; and the Court after his example was plunged in a sad astonishment; though none could divine the cause of it.</p>
               <p>At his return from <hi>Poictiers</hi> to <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King sends for <hi>Byron</hi> to Court, who at first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> he sent for the Duke of <hi>Byron</hi> to come to him. The Duke at first doubted to go, and excused himself with many weak reasons. He presses him, and sends to him some of his Esquires; afterwards the President <hi>Janin</hi> brought him word that he should receive no harme; which was, provided he put himself into an estate to receive grace, and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not his crime, by his pride and by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Byron</hi> knew that <hi>Laffin</hi> had made a voyage to Court; but he was more assured of that man then of himself. Moreover the Baron of <hi>Lux</hi> his confident, who was then there, had told him that <hi>Laffin</hi> had without doubt kept his Counsel, and not revealed any thing which might hurt him. <hi>De Lux</hi> believed so, because the King after having entertained <hi>Laffin,</hi> had told him with a merry countenance, <hi>I am glad I have seen this man; he hath eased me of many distrusts and suspitions of spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the friends of <hi>Byron</hi> writ to him, that he should not be such a fool as to bring his head to the Court; that it would be more secure for him to justifie himself by
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:29592:149"/>
Attorny then in person. But notwithstanding this advice, and against biting of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, after having some time deliberated, he took post and came to <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In the end <hi>Byron</hi> comes.</note> now when the King no longer expected him, but prepared to go seek him.</p>

               <p>The insolence and blindness of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man cannot be sufficiently admired at, nor on the contrary the goodness and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the King be enough praised, who endeavoured to overcome his obstinacy. <q>Confession of a fault is the first mark of repentance.</q> The King taking him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,<note place="margin">The King conjures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:29592:149"/>
demand justice, which otherwise he would do himself. Though this too haughty answer aggravated much his offence, the King ceased not sweetly to tell him, that he should think farther of it, and that he hoped he would take better counsel.<note place="margin">The King prayes the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> to exhort him to confess his crime. But he is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The same day after supper, the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> exhorted him likewise, on the part of the King, to confess the truth; concluding his Remonstrance with that sentence of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>Sir, know that the anger of the King is as the Messenger of Death.</hi> But he answered him with more fierceness then he had done the King.</p>
               <p>On the morrow morning the King walking<note place="margin">The King speaks to him the second time, but in vain.</note> in his Gardens, conjured him the second time to confess the Conspiracy: but he could draw nothing from him, but protestations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and threatnings of his accusers.</p>
               <p>Upon this the King felt himself agitated even at the bottom of his soul with divers thoughts, not knowing what he ought to do. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he had born him and his great services, withheld his just anger: on the other side,<note place="margin">He is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled what to resolve on.</note> the blackness of his crime, his pride and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy gave reins to his justice, and obliged him to punish the criminal. Besides that the danger with which both his Estate and Person were threatned, seemed impossible to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but by cutting off the head of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, whose bottom was scarce visible.</p>
               <p>In this trouble of spirit he retired into his Closet, and falling on his knees, prayed to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:29592:150"/>
God with all his heart to inspire him with a good resolution. He was accustomed to do thus in all his great affairs; <q>esteeming God as his surest Counsellour, and most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful assistance.</q> At his coming from prayers, as he said afterwards, he found himself deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the trouble wherein he was, and resolved to cast <hi>Byron</hi> into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,<note place="margin">He resolves to leave him to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> if his Council found that the proofs they had by writing were so strong, that there need no doubt be made of his Condemnation. He chose for this purpose four persons of those which composed it; to wit, <hi>Bellievre, Villeroy, Rosny</hi> and <hi>Sillery,</hi> and shewed them the proofs. They all told him with one voice, that they were more then sufficient.</p>
               <p>Yet after this he would make a third trial<note place="margin">Yet tries the third time to draw truth from him.</note> on this proud heart. He employed this last time Remonstrances, Prayers, Conjurations, and assurances of pardon, to oblige him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his crime: but he answered still in the same manner; adding, that if he knew his accusers, he would break their heads.</p>
               <p>In fine, the King wearied with his Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montadoes<note place="margin">He finds it in vain, &amp; leaves him.</note> and obstinacy, left him, giving him these for his last words; <hi>Well then, we must learn the truth in another place.

               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:29592:150"/>At his coming forth of the Queens Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he played at <hi>Primero, Vitry</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>

His kindred which were found at the Court, went to cast themselves on their knees before the King, not to demand Justice of him, but to implore his mercy. The Lord <hi>de la Force,</hi> afterward Marshal of <hi>France,</hi> spoke for them all. If <hi>Byron</hi> had at first spoke with so much humility and submission as they did, he had without doubt obtained his grace: but it was now too late; there was now no more room for Clemency, it had given place to Justice.<note place="margin">The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament make his Process.</note>
               </p>

               <p>The proofs were very strong, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note place="margin">He defends himself weakly.</note> of <hi>Byron</hi> very weak. He made it plainly appear in a business wherein he acted for his

Life, that he had less brains then heart. For he presently acknowledged his writing; which he might have denied, and have gained some time to have made it be proved. This piece had been written in the time of the War of <hi>Savoy.</hi> He pretended that the King being at <hi>Lyons,</hi> had pardoned him all his rebellious Motions. But the King sent Letters under his<note place="margin">Letters of the King revoking the pardon granted him at <hi>Lyons.</hi>

And no great consideration was had upon it: for first, that grace he had granted him, was but verbal; and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, the Parliament held it for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, That there are Crimes the King cannot pardon; as those of <hi>Laesae Majestatis,</hi> Divine and Humane; and those which are of a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible scandal, and great prejudice to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. When they came to the re-examination and confronting of Witnesses, and presented <hi>Laffin</hi> to <hi>Byron,</hi> in stead of reproaching him, as a man whom an hundred reproaches might have rendred incapable of bearing witness, he acknowledged him for an honest Man, and a<note place="margin">He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth not <hi>Laffin.</hi>

He had not the two last with him, but onely the first, which he drew out of his pocket, and gave.</p>
               <p>It will be needless to recount all his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, his Reproaches, his Passions, his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Exclamations, and a hundred other Extravagancies, (for so we may call them) with which he was transported.</p>

off. It was observed that it bounded three times, forced by the impetuosity of his spirits, which were transported; and that there issued more blood out of it, then out of the trunk of his body. He was carried to the Church of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> where he was buried without any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, but with a great concourse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had all tears in their eyes, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that brave Courage which a detestable Ambition, and a too boundless Pride, had brought to so unhappy an end.</p>
               <p>It is convenient to understand, that this<note place="margin">He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant, but a great lover of predictions.</note> Marshal was very ignorant, but extreamly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Predictions of Astrologers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, Necromancers, and other Deceivers. It was held likewise, that <hi>Laffin</hi> had gained his favour by making him believe that he talked with the Devil, and that he had assured him that he should be a Soveraign. It was said likewise, that being young, he went one day disguised to see a Teller of Good-fortune, who foretold that he should be a very great Lord, but that he should have his head cut off: at which being troubled, he outragiously beat him. That another Diviner told him he should be King, if a blow of a sword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde hindred it not. And another, that he should die by the hand of a <hi>Burgonian;</hi> and it was found, that the Executioner who cut off his head, was a Native of <hi>Bourgongne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers others were reported: but to speak the truth, the most of these Predictions are
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:29592:153"/>
ordinarily known after the Events; and though they do effectually precede the event, it must be believed by chance, and not by knowledge; the Prognosticators telling so many stories, that it is impossible but some should happen. <q>It is therefore a great wisdome to disabuse our<note place="margin">A reflection very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for great men.</note> spirits of these sorts of curiosities: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that they have no foundation in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, we offend God by believing them, and give money to let our selves be fool'd and led by the Noses: nor do ever wise men give any faith to them, though sometimes they serve to deceive the simple.</q>

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:29592:154"/>
In pursuance of which, he came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres,</hi> presented himself to the Chamber, and took an Act of his appearance. The King was not at all pleased with this Answer; blamed the Judges of <hi>Castres</hi> for having given him that Act, and sent to tell him that there was yet no question of leaving him over to Justice, and that therefore he should the rather come.</p>
               <p>Being advertized by those friends he had at<note place="margin">After, he retires to <hi>Geneva,</hi> &amp; thence to <hi>Heidelberg</hi> to the Prince <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> his Kinsman.</note> Court of the Kings resolution, who had sent to him the President <hi>Commartin</hi> to let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his will, he departed from <hi>Castres,</hi> went to <hi>Orange,</hi> passed by <hi>Geneva,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Heidelberg</hi> to the Prince <hi>Palatine:</hi> saying like a sage Politician, as he was, <hi>That he ought neither to Capitulate with his King, nor yet go near him whilst his anger lasted.</hi> This business lay a breeding some years; we shall see in its place how it terminated.</p>
               <p>It must here be acknowledged, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour<note place="margin">The favour of <hi>Rosny</hi> a pretext to the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the great ones.</note> of <hi>Rosny</hi> served in this time for a pretext to almost all the discontents and all the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of the great ones. The King had truely raised him by four or five great Charges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he believed he could not sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence those services he had rendred him. And in that this Prince merits onely praise: for a good Master cannot do too much for a good and faithful servant. But though the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and discontented Spirits might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain<note place="margin">Yet the King gave him not too much power;</note> that the King gave him too many Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Employments; yet they could not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his giving him too much power, or that

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>Rosny</hi> had not the liberty to do the least grace of his own accord. He was forced in all things to address himself directly to the King; who would himself distribute his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours<note place="margin">but keeps it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> and recompences to those he knew wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that they might acknowledge the whole Obligation and dependence from him. This great Prince knew well, <q>That he who gives<note place="margin">An impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth.</note> all, may do all; and that he who gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is nothing, but what it shall please him who gives all.</q> He had too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and too much Glory, to suffer that another should act in the most noble Function of his Royal Authority. Whatever favour or whatever familiarity any had with him, if they were wanting to conserve it with a profound respect, or should speak or act with him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then with their Master and with their King, they would doubtless as soon fall into disgrace: and this was, as we have observed, one of the causes of <hi>Byron</hi>'s loss. Judge then, if he who would not that any should in any thing in the world act the Companion with him, would have endured that they should act the Soveraign. Judge, if he would have been contented that his Ministers should simply have taken his consent in a business, or that they should speak to him of things in manner of discharge, after having themselves resolved them. No, without doubt: He would that all Resolutions should come from his own Head, and from his own Motion: that the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:29592:155"/>
choice should be his: that he alone should have the power to raise and throw down; and that none but himself should be Arbitrator in the Fortunes of his Subjects. Not but that he considered, as it was just, the Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the great ones of his Estate, and of his Ministers, in the conferring of his Favours, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Charges; but it was still in such a manner, that he made them to whom he gave them know, that they ought onely to hold them from him: which the following Example well demonstrates.</p>
               <p>The Bishoprick of <hi>Poictiers</hi> becoming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,<note place="margin">A memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example, that a King ought not to yeild too much to his Ministers.</note> 
                  <hi>Rosny</hi> very instantly besought him to consider in this occasion one named <hi>Frenou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illet,</hi> reputed a knowing man, and a great Preacher. The King notwithstanding this Recommendation, gives it to the Abbot of <hi>Rochepozay;</hi> who, besides his own particular good Qualities, was Son to a Father who had served him well with his Sword in his Wars, and with his knowledge and spirit in Embassies. Some time after, the Bishoprick of <hi>Montpellier</hi> became vacant: the King out of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion sent to seek <hi>Frenouillet,</hi> and told him, that he would give it him; but on this condition, that he should acknowledge no Obligation but to himself. By which it may be seen, how he in some sort considered the Recommendation of <hi>Rosny:</hi> but it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be perceived, that the power of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, who caused so much jealousie in the world, was bounded. I call him Favourite,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:29592:155"/>
by reason that he had the most splendent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; though to speak truth he had no pre-eminence over others of the Council: for <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Janin</hi> were more considered then he in Negotiations and Forraign Affairs; <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievre</hi> and <hi>Sillery</hi> for Justice and Policy within the Kingdome: and it is not to be imagined that those people did in any manner depend on him.

               <p>About the end of this year, the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> thinking to revenge himself, and repair the loss of his County of <hi>Bresse</hi> on the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> attempted to take it by storm. The Enterprize was formed by the Counsels of the Lord of <hi>Albigny;</hi> and the Duke having passed the Mountains, believed it infallible. <hi>D' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny</hi> conducted two thousand men for this purpose within half a League of the City; yet was not so rash as to engage himself, but left the conduct to others. More then two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men mounted the Ladders, gained the Ramparts, and ran through all the City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceived. In the mean time, the Burgesses were awakened by the cries of some that fled from a Guard, which had discovered the Enterprizers, and as soon beheld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves charged by them. The Gunner, who was to have broken a Gate within, to cause those without to enter, was unhappily slain: after which, they were weakned on all sides.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:29592:156"/>
The greatest part endeavoured to re-gain their Ladders: but the Cannons on the Flankers having broken them in pieces, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all slain, or broke their necks by leaping into the Ditch. There was thirteen taken alive, almost all Gentlemen: amongst the others, <hi>Attignac,</hi> who had served as second to <hi>Don Phillipin</hi> bastard of <hi>Savoy.</hi> They yeilded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on assurance given them, that they should be treated as prisoners of War: But the furious cries of the common people, who represented the danger wherein their City was of Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, Violation, universal Destruction, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Slavery, forced the Council of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Republick to condemn them to the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous death of the Gibbet, like to Thieves.<note place="margin">Thirteen of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have for a long time pretended that this City appertained to their
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:29592:156"/>
Soveraignty; and that the Bishops who bore the title of Earls, and were for some time Lords of it, held it from them: which is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a thing that the Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; always maintaining, that they depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded immediately on the Empire. The City on their part sustained that it was a free City, and not subject in temporal things, neither to their Bishops, whom they quite drave out in the year 1533. when they unhappily renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion; nor to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but onely to the Empire: for which reason they always bore the Eagle plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Gates.

                  </note> but for the present the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> enjoyed full liberty, and had for above sixty years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become an Allie of the Cantons of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland.</hi> Now the <hi>Suisses</hi> were comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Treaty of <hi>Vervin</hi> as Allies of <hi>France,</hi> and by consequence so was the City of <hi>Geneva;</hi> and the King had sufficiently declared it to the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> notwithstanding which, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to attempt this Enterprize; hoping that if it succeeded, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Pope would sustain him in it, and that the King for so small a thing would not break the peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genevans</hi> furiously incensed against<note place="margin">The <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> make War on <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </note> him, began to make War couragiously; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his Country, and took some little Towns. They hoped that the King and the <hi>Suisses</hi> would second these motions of their resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:29592:157"/>
would likewise come to their assistance. But the King desired to keep the peace; and was too wise to kindle a War in which he could not make Religion and Policy agree; or unite the Honour and Interests of <hi>France,</hi> obliged to protect its Allies, with the good favour of the Pope moved by his duty to the ruine of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> He therefore sent <hi>de Vic</hi> to assure them of his protection: but with order to let them know, that Peace was necessary for them,<note place="margin">But the King obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them to peace.</note> and War ruinous; and that they ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the one, and shun the other. And they having little power for so much anger, and not being able to do any thing without his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, were constrained to consent, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Treaty with the <hi>Savoyard:</hi> by which it was said, that they were comprized in the Treaty of <hi>Vervin,</hi> and that the Duke could not build any Fortress within four Leagues of their City.</p>
               <p>It happened almost in the same time, that<note place="margin">The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Mets</hi> rise against <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole</hi> their Governour.</note> the City of <hi>Mets</hi> rose against the Governour of that Citadel.

He had a Brother who seconded him in the Charge of this Government.</p>
               <p>During the last War against <hi>Spain,</hi> these two Brothers had accused the principal inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Mets</hi> for having conspired to deliver
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:29592:157"/>
the City to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There were many imprisoned, some put to the rack; but none found culpable: so that all the Burgesses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with reason that this was a Calumny, conceived a hatred against these <hi>Soboles,</hi> and drew up several Petitions of complaint against them, accusing them of a great number of Exactions and Cruelties. The Duke <hi>d' Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi> who without doubt sustained these Burgesses at the Court, was sent by the King to accommodate this difference. The <hi>Soboles</hi> who had offended him, no longer trusted him; they would not permit him to enter into the strongest Citadel, nor let the Garison go out to meet him: so that being justly incensed,<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>d' Espernon</hi> kindles the fire more.</note> he envenomed the plague instead of healing it, and animated the inhabitants in such a manner, that they Barricadoed themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. The King who knew that the least sparkles were capable to kindle a great fire, was not content to send <hi>La Varenne,</hi> but went<note place="margin">The King goes in person.</note> himself; being moreover willing to visit that Frontier. <hi>Sobole</hi> gave the place into his hands; and he gave it to <hi>Arquien,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel of the Regiment of Guards, with the Quality of Lieutenant of the King, to command in the absence of the Duke <hi>d' Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> Governour, who had no great power<note place="margin">The <hi>Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> present their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to the King, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> so long as the King lived.</p>
               <p>The King passed the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> at <hi>Mets.</hi> Whilst he was there, he hearkned to the request which the <hi>Jesuites</hi> made for their re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He referred the doing them Justice
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:29592:158"/>
till he should come to <hi>Paris;</hi> and gave leave to Father <hi>Ignatius Armand,</hi> and Father <hi>Coton,</hi> to come to sollicite their cause. They were not wanting to do it; and Father <hi>Coton,</hi> being of a sharp and witty discourse, and a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preacher, gained so soon the favour of all the Court, and pleased the King so well, that he obtained from his Majesty the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of the Society into the Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the opinion and advice of some of his Council. He then re-established them by an<note place="margin">He re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.</note> Act, which he caused to be confirmed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and caused to be thrown down that <hi>Pyramide,</hi> which had been erected before the Palace, in the place of the house of <hi>John Castel,</hi> where there were many writings in Verse and Prose very bloody against these Fathers. Thus was their banishment glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously repaired; and after all, the King kept with him Father <hi>Coton</hi> as his Chaplain in Ordinary, and Confessor and Director of his Conscience. This was not accomplished till the year 1604.</p>
               <p>In these two years of 1602, and 1603. we<note place="margin">1602, &amp; 1603.</note> have yet three or four important things to observe. The first, that the King at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Mets</hi> went to <hi>Nancy</hi> to visit his<note place="margin">He visits his sister at <hi>Nancy.</hi> Renews his alliance with the <hi>Suisses</hi> and <hi>Grisons.</hi>
                  </note> Sister, the Dutchess of <hi>Bar;</hi> who died the year following without Children. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that he renewed the Alliance with the <hi>Suisses,</hi> and some months after with the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> notwithstanding those Obstacles by which the Count of <hi>Fuentes</hi> endeavoured to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:29592:158"/>
oppose it. The third was, that in returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> he received news of the Death of<note place="margin">Hears of the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> one of the most Illustrious and most Heroick Princesses that ever Reigned; and who Governed her Estate with more Prudence and Power, then any of her Predecessors had ever done.</p>
               <p>She was Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and to that <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> for whose love he had left <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Aunt to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour, his first wife. There was nothing wanting to the happiness of her Kingdom save the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, which she banished out of <hi>England.</hi> And we might give her the name of good as well as great, if she had not dealt so inhumanely as<note place="margin">She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </note> she did with her Cousin-German <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland;</hi> whom she kept eighteen years prisoner, and after beheaded; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to it by some conspiracies which the Servants and Friends of that poor Princess had made against her person.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 6. King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Kindom of <hi>England. He was</hi> James <hi>the first of that name among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kings of</hi> England.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Son of that <hi>Mary</hi> named <hi>James</hi> the sixth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being the nearest of the blood-Royal of <hi>England,</hi> as Grandchild to <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, and Sister to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, married to <hi>James</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> succeeded <hi>Elizbeth,</hi> who had put his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to death. He caused himself to be called King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to unite under the same title the two Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> which indeed are but one Island,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:29592:159"/>
formerly called by the Romans <hi>Magna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Alliance of so powerful a King might make the balance incline to which side soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it were turned, either of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain:</hi> For which reason both the one and<note place="margin">Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors go from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to desire his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> the other immediately sent Magnificent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to salute him, each endeavouring to draw him to his side. It was <hi>Rosny</hi> who went on the part of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great: he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the favourable Audience he desired, and the confirmation of the ancient Treaties between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> The Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador of <hi>Spain</hi> found not such facility in his Negotiation; the <hi>English</hi> appeared resolute. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were forced to yeild, that the place of the Treaty should be appointed in <hi>England,</hi> and to grant the <hi>English</hi> free Taffick in all their Territories, even in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and<note place="margin">Piety yeilds to Interest.</note> give them liberty of Conscience in <hi>Spain;</hi> so that they should not be subject to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, nor obliged to salute the holy Sacrament in the streets, but onely turn from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> was in a profound peace, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out by the renewing of the Alliances with the <hi>Suisses</hi> and with <hi>England</hi> as within, by the discovery of the Conspiracies which were quite dissipated; the King enjoyed a repose worthy his labours, and his past travail made his pleasure more sweet. However, he was<note place="margin">The King labours to conserve peace.</note> not idle, but was seen daily employed: for he endeavoured with as much diligence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:29592:159"/>
peace, that divine daughter of heaven, as he had used courage and valour in making War.</p>
               <p>He was often heard say, <q>That though<note place="margin">Excellent speeches of a good King.</note> he could make the house of <hi>France</hi> as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in <hi>Europe,</hi> as that of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> was in <hi>Asia,</hi> and conquer in a moment all the Estates of his neighbours; yet he would not do so great a dishonour to his word, by which he was obliged to the keeping of the Peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His most ordinary divertisements during<note place="margin">His diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements.</note> this time, were Hunting and Building. He at the same time maintained workmen at the Church of the holy Cross at <hi>Orleans,</hi> at St. <hi>Germain</hi> in <hi>Laye,</hi> at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and at the Place Royal.</p>
               <p>The Nobility of <hi>France</hi> during this peace,<note place="margin">Employs of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> could not live out of action: some passed their time in Hunting, others with Ladies; some in Studies of Learning and the Mathematicks, others in travelling into Forraign Countries; and others continued the Exercise of War under Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> But the greatest part, whose hands as it were itched, and who sought to signalize their valour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from their Countries, became punctilious, and for the least word, or for a wry look, put their hands to their swords. Thus that madness of Duels entred into the<note place="margin">Duels too frequent.</note> hearts of the Gentlemen; and these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats were so frequent, that the Nobility shed as much blood in the Meadows with their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:29592:160"/>
own hands, as their enemies had made them lose in Battails.</p>
               <p>The King therefore made a second and a<note place="margin">The King makes an Edict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this madness.</note> most severe Edict, which prohibited Duels, confiscating the bodies and goods of those who went thus into the field. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, this prohibition made the ardor of the most violent a little relent: but because he often pardoned this crime, not being able to refuse it to those who had faithfully served him in his need; it happened that in a little time this mischief regained its course, almost as strong as before.</p>
               <p>His receiving from all persons all advices<note place="margin">He makes Acts for working the Gold, Silver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Copper Mines.</note> that might accommodate and in rich his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, made him understand that there were in divers places of <hi>France</hi> very good Mines both of Gold and Silver, Copper and Lead; and that if they were wrought, there would be no need to buy of strangers: That like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise though there should accrue no great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in digging them, yet by them many idle persons might be employed; and likewise those criminals who deserved not death, might be condemned for so many years to work in them. He made therefore an Act which renewed the ancient orders concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Officers, Directors, and Workers of Mines. And they began to work in the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> where it is most certain that formerly there hath been Gold, and that there still is. In such manner, that had they continued this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they might in all appearance have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29592:160"/>
notable advantages; but either through the negligence of the Overseers, or through the little intelligence, or rather impatience of the <hi>French,</hi> who cast by any thing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently seconds not their desires, this work was discontinued.<note place="margin">An enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to joyn the <hi>Seine</hi> and <hi>Loire.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Another very great conveniency for <hi>Paris</hi> was enterprized, which was the joyning of the River <hi>Loire</hi> to the <hi>Seine,</hi> by the Chanel of <hi>Briare. Rosny</hi> laboured in this with much expence, employing in it near three hundred thousand crowns: but the work was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, I know not wherefore. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and brought to perfection.</p>
               <p>There was proposed likewise another,<note place="margin">Another design to joyn the two Seas.</note> which was to make a conjunction of the two Seas, the Ocean and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> by uniting together the <hi>Garonne</hi> which runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ocean, and the <hi>Aude</hi> which fals into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea below <hi>Narbonne,</hi> by Channels which were to be drawn along little Rivers, which run between these great ones. The Country of <hi>Languedoc</hi> offered to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; but there were difficulties found which hindred this enterprize.</p>
               <p>Navigation was established by the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the King had taken to keep his Coasts in security, and to punish Pirates se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely when they catcht them. Our ships were not content to Traffick to the ordinary places, but enterprized likewise to go to the new world; which they had almost forgot
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:29592:161"/>
since the time of Admiral <hi>Coligny.</hi> A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Xaintonge</hi> named <hi>du Gas,</hi> began with the Kings Commission the voyage of<note place="margin">Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Canada,</hi> where afterwards was established the Commerce of Castors or Beavers, which are the skins of a certain amphibious creature, much like the Otters of this Country.</p>
               <p>Among all these establishments, we must<note place="margin">Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religious Orders at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> not forget a great quantity of new Religious Companies, which were made in <hi>Paris.</hi> There was first seen the Recollects, which were a branch of the Order of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of a new Reformation: <hi>Capuchins</hi> and <hi>Feuillantines; Carmelites,</hi> who were brought from <hi>Spain;</hi> Barefooted <hi>Carmes,</hi> who came likewise from that Country: of the Brothers of Charity, vulgarly called the ignorant brothers, who came out of <hi>Italy;</hi> and all had soon built them Convents out of the Almes and Charity of Devout persons.</p>
               <p>In the midst of this fair Calme, at which the King rejoyced, and during all these fair occupations which were worthy of him, he was not left without troubles and vexations, which perplexed his Spirit. He had none more piercing, nor more continual, then those which came on the part of his Wife and his Mistresses.</p>
               <p>We have already said how <hi>Madamoiselle</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King gives <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuil</hi> to <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle d' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragues.</hi>

                  <hi>d' Entragues</hi> had engaged him. He had given her the land of <hi>Verneuil</hi> near <hi>Senlis,</hi> and for the love of her had made it a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate. After that he was married, he ceased
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29592:161"/>
not to have the same passion for her, and to carry her with him in his Progresses, and lodge her at <hi>Fontain-bleau.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">She despises and offends the Queen.</note>
               </p>
               <p>These scandalous disorders extremely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Queen; and the Pride of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness more furiously incensed her: for she spoke alwaies of her in terms either injurious or disdainful; sometimes not forbearing to say, that if she had Justice she should hold the place of that fat <note n="*" place="margin">Alluding I suppose to the Dukes of <hi>Florence,</hi> who are all Merchants.</note> Banker.</p>
               <p>The Queen likewise on her side was with<note place="margin">The Queen on her part trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the King.</note> reason transported against her, and made her complaints to all the world. But this was not the way to gain the spirit of the King: she had done better, had she wisely dissembled her displeasure, and by her kindnesses made her self master of that heart, which of right belonged to her. The King loved to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; he loved sweet and compliant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and was to be gained by tenderness and affection. The band of love is love it self: this was that she ought to employ with him, and not grumblings, disdains, and ill counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which serve onely more and more to disgust a husband, and make him find more pleasure in the allurements of a Mistress who takes care to be alwaies agreeable and alwaies complacent. But in stead of holding this way, she was alwaies in contention with the King; she exasperated him continually by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and by her reproaches: and when he thought to find with her some sweetness to ease the great labours of his spirit, he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29592:162"/>
encountred nothing but Gall and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>She had belonging to her Chamber a <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> woman Daughter of her Nurse, named <hi>Leonora Galigay,</hi> a creature extreme ugly, but very spiritual, and who knew so perfectly how to insinuate into her heart, that she had in such manner seised on it, that she absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded her. It hath been said, that this woman fearing that the Queen her Mistress would love her less, if she perfectly loved the King her husband, kept her from it as much as she could, that she might possess her with more ease. Afterwards, to the end she might have a second in her designs, she Married and Espoused her self to a <hi>Florentine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leonora &amp; Conchini</hi> her husband, foster the Queen in ill humors.</note> a domestick of the Queens, named <hi>Conchini,</hi> of a little better Extraction then her self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grand-child to <hi>Baptista Conchini,</hi> who had been Secretary to <hi>Cosmo</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Common opinion was that these two persons conjoyntly laboured so long as the King lived, to conserve a spleen in the spirit of the Queen, and to make her always trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and humoursome towards him; in such manner, that for seven or eight years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if he had one day of peace and quiet with her, he had ten of discontent and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this truly the Kings fault was the greatest, because he gave the occasion of these troubles; and the husband being, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the head of the wife, ought to give her example, and keep a more strict union with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:29592:162"/>We have observed this once for all. But we cannot too often make this Reflexion,<note place="margin">1604.</note> 
                  <q>That sin is the cause of all disorder; and that for a little pleasure it causes a thousand troubles and a thousand mischiefs, even in this world it self.</q> The King being now<note place="margin">The Kings debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cause the Gout.</note> but just fifty years of age, began this year to have some small feelings of the Gout; which possibly were the doleful effects of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive voluptuousness, as well as of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>To return to the Marchioness; it happened<note place="margin">The Queen threatens the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness.</note> one day that the Queen being very much offended at her discourse, threatned her that she should know how to bridle her wicked tongue. The Marchioness upon this seemed sad and grieved; shunn'd the King, and let him understand that she desired that he<note place="margin">Who prays the King to see her no more.</note> would no more demand any thing of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she feared that the continuation of his favours would be too prejudicial both to her and her children. Her design was to inflame more his passion, by shewing her self more difficult. But when she saw that her cunning had not all the effect she hoped, and that the Queens anger was encreased to such a point, that indeed there was some danger for her and hers; she advised her self of another thing. <hi>D' Entragues</hi> her Father demanded permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">And her Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands leave to retire with her out of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> of the King to carry her out of the Kingdom, to avoid the vengeance of the Queen. The King granted her demand easier then she thought he would; wherewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:29592:163"/>
excessively enraged, her Father and the Count <hi>d' Auvergne</hi> her Brother by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side, began to Treat secretly with the<note place="margin">They treat with the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> Ambassador of <hi>Spain,</hi> to have some retreat in the Territories of his King, casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves absolutely they and their children into his Arms.</p>
               <p>The Ambassador believed that this business would be very advantagious to his Master, and that in time and place he might serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of that promise of marriage which the King had given to the Marchioness: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore easily granted them all that they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and added all the fair promises with which weak and feeble spirits might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated.</p>
               <p>The King had granted them permission to retire themselves out of <hi>France,</hi> but yet without the Children, out of a belief he had that they would go into <hi>England</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Aubigny</hi> of the house of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> who were their near kinsmen; but when he understood that they consulted<note place="margin">The King resolves to hinder them.

He sends therefore for the Count <hi>d' Auvergne,</hi> who was then at <hi>Clermont,</hi> so much beloved in the Province, that he believed he might se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely stay there. He refused to come before he had his Pardon Sealed in good form, for all that he might have done. This was a kind of new crime, to capitulate with his King: however he sends it him, but with this Clause,

                  <hi>That he should make his immediate appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His distrust permitted him not to obey on this condition: he stayed still in the Province, where he kept himself on his Guard, with all precautions imaginable. Nevertheless he was not so cunning, but the King could entrap him, and by an Artifice very gross. He being Colonel of the <hi>French</hi> Cavalry, was desired to go see a Muster made of a Company of the Duke of <hi>Vendosmes.</hi> He went well mounted, keeping himself at a good distance, that he might not be encompassed: Nevertheless, <hi>d' E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The Queen spared no sollicitations for the giving of this sentence; believing that the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution would satisfie her resentment: but the goodness of the King surpassed her passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The love which he had for the Marchioness was not so far extinct, that he could resolve to Sacrifice what he had adored: he would not permit them to pronounce the Sentence; and two months and a half afterward, to wit, on the fifteenth of <hi>April,</hi> he by Letters under his Great Seal changed the penalty of Death on the Count of <hi>Auvergne</hi> and the<note place="margin">The King pardons them, and justifies the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Lord <hi>d' Entragues,</hi> into perpetual Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> newly come to the Court, sustained that this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Donation could not be valuable, because the contract of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Katherine de Medicis</hi> her Mother, to whom that County appertained, allowing Substitution of her goods, and that Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, said she, extending to Daughters in default of Males, that County was to come to her after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, nor could he give it to her prejudice.</p>

               <p>The Count of <hi>Auvergne</hi> thus despoiled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the <hi>Bastille</hi> untill the year one thousand six hundred and sixteen; when
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29592:165"/>
Queen <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> having need of him during the troubles, delivered him from thence, and caused him to be justified. She caused likewise the Registers of Parliament and of the Notaries to be taken off the File, with all informations which might conserve the memory of his Crime. <q>By this see an example how time causes a mutability in all things, and how it changeth the greatest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds into the greatest affections; and on the contrary, transmutes the strongest affections into mortal hatreds.</q>

It is most certain, that this Prince had conferred<note place="margin">The King had done him many favours, and he had as well ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King:</note> on him very considerable Favours, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the Staff of <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and procured him the marriage of the Heiress of <hi>Sedan:</hi> and this Lord had likewise very well served him in his greatest necessities. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he saw him converted to the Catholick Faith, he diminished much of his affection; and moved partly by Zeal for his false Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and partly by Ambition, he conceived vast designes of making himself Chief and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party; and under that pretext, make himself Master of the Provinces beneath the <hi>Loire.</hi> It was believed that for this effect he had much assisted to exasperate
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29592:165"/>
the spirit of the Marshal of <hi>Byron;</hi> and that he had made a Treaty with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was to furnish him with what money he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but not with forces, for fear of rendring himself odious to the Protestants.</p>
               <p>It was but too visible, that after the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">But after the Kings conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the <hi>Hugonots</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and would make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self chief of their party.</note> of the King, he had instantly laboured to beget distrusts and discontents in the spirits of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and to unite and Rally them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they might make a body: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading himself, that that body must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have a head, and that they could chuse no other but himself. And for these Reasons, so many Assemblies were made, and so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and general Synods of those of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion held, wherein nothing was heard but complaints and murmurs against the King, whom they continually wearied with new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests and Demands.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it was found that this Duke had<note place="margin">His Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to form a party in <hi>Guyenne.</hi>

               <p>The King judging that he ought to dig up<note place="margin">The King goes to prevent them.</note> the root of this mischief before it extended far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not knowing indeed to what it might extend, resolved himself to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it. He departed from <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> in the month of <hi>December,</hi> having sent before <hi>Jean-Jacques de Mesmes,</hi> Lord of <hi>Rossy,</hi> to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29592:166"/>
make process against those that were culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Immediately all this conspiracy flew into<note place="margin">All the Conspiracy dissipated.</note> smoak: The best advised came to the King to cast themselves at his feet. The chief Agent of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being advertized that there was order given to arrest him, brought his head to the King, and told him both all he knew before, and all that he did not know. The others either fled out of the Kingdom, or else hid themselves. Five or six unfortunate persons being taken, were beheaded at <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and their heads planted on the tops of the Gates, their bodies burnt, and the ashes thrown into the Air. Three or four others suffered the same punishment at <hi>Perigord.</hi> There were ten or twelve condemned for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, and their Effigies hanged up; amongst others, <hi>Chappelle-Byron,</hi> and <hi>Giversac</hi> of the house of <hi>Cugnac.</hi> But in all these procedures, there were found no proofs by writing, nor yet by any formal deposition against the Duke of <hi>Bouillon;</hi> so cautiously and subtilly had he carried his business.</p>
               <p>Before these executions, the King having<note place="margin">The King returns to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> made his entrance into <hi>Limoges,</hi> returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> He passionately wished, that after this the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> would acknowledge and<note place="margin">He in vain endeavours to make the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> humble himself.</note> humble himself. For if he remained impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he was obliged to prosecute him to the utmost; and if he did prosecute him, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended all that great body of Protestants, which were his faithful Allies. He employed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29592:166"/>
therefore underhand all means which he could devise, to induce him to have recourse to his Clemency, rather then to the intercession of strangers; which a Soveraign could not agree to in the case of his Officer and Subject. The Duke desired as much as he to draw himself out of this trouble: but he believed he could not finde security at Court, because <hi>Rosny,</hi> who was not his friend, and who had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some jealousie to see him more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed then himself in the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, had so great credit with the King.

The King confided much in him; and by honouring him, desired to testifie to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> that if he assaulted the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> it was not against their Religion, but the Rebellion he made War. For this purpose he erected the<note place="margin">The King makes him Duke of <hi>Sully.</hi>

                  </note> the length of that Enterprize might possibly revive divers factions in the other corners of the Kingdom, give time to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Frontiers of <hi>Picaray,</hi> to the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

               <p>These were the publick Conditions: but by the secret Articles the King promised the Duke to stay but five days in <hi>Sedan,</hi> nor to put but fifty men in the Castle, which should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately depart upon humble supplication made by the Duke. All these things were faithfully executed, and without the least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust either on the one side or the other. The Duke came to meet the King at <hi>Donchery,</hi> where<note place="margin">The Duke demands pardon of of the King, who enters <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and thence goes to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> he besought his pardon. The King received him as if he had never been faulty; and five or six days after, entred into <hi>Sedan;</hi> where he stayed onely three days, and then returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Duke accompanied him as far as <hi>Mouson,</hi> passing then no further: but some days after, when he understood that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had confirmed his pardon, in which were likewise comprehended his friends that had been condemned for the default of <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:29592:167"/>
he came to Court, where he received more Houours and Kindnesses then ever. This was the custome of that great King: <q>He had<note place="margin">A great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of generosity in our Prince.</note> a heart like a Lyon against the Proud, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Rebels; but he was pleased to relieve with an unparallell'd goodness those he had overcome, when by their submissions they rendred themselves worthy to receive his grace.</q> And the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who perfectly knew his Nature, (for they had lived and made War a long time together) was not wanting in this Conjuncture to comport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with all that Prudence and Compliancy which an understanding man, as he was, could be capable of.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this great generosity and<note place="margin">Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, there are many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies.</note> goodness of the King, his Kingdome was no less turmoiled with incredible infidelities and conspiracies: such were the treason of <hi>l' Oste,</hi> the attempt on the City of <hi>Marseilles</hi> by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rargues,</hi> and another on <hi>Narbonne</hi> and <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> by the <hi>Luquisses.</hi>

                  </note> the employment he had under him, was to copy out the dispatches. This unfortunate man revealed all the secrets of the Kings Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to some of the Council of <hi>Spain;</hi> who had corrupted him with twelve hundred Crowns of Pension, which they promised him whilst he was in that Country with the Ambassadour <hi>Rochepot.</hi> His treachery being discovered, he fled; and as he was pursued by the Provosts of the Marshal, he drowned himself in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29592:168"/>
of <hi>Marne,</hi> near the Ferry of <hi>Fay.</hi> It may easily be judged, that <hi>Villeroy,</hi> whose fidelity by this means remained exposed to the Kings just suspitions, and to the calumnies of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was sensibly troubled. He had had without doubt some difficulty to clear himself of this business, if the King, who saw him in an extraordinary affliction, had not had the goodness to go visit him himself; and by that honour brought him the comfort of justifying him against all calumnies the Envious might sow against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merargues</hi> was a Provincial Gentleman, of<note place="margin">1605.</note> a very good House; who having assurance that<note place="margin">Treason of <hi>Merargues.</hi>
                  </note> he should the following year be <hi>Viguier</hi> or Sheriff of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> had promised to deliver that City to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> during his Sheriffal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He was so imprudent and so foolish as to discover his designe to a Slave of the Gallies of <hi>Marseilles;</hi> who gave advice of it to the Court, to the end possibly that he might gain his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Upon this advice, <hi>Merargues,</hi> who was<note place="margin">He is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized talking with the Spanish Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</note> then at <hi>Paris,</hi> was watched so diligently, that they found him conferring with the Secretary of the Ambassadour of <hi>Spain;</hi> and speaking so loud, that almost all they said was heard. They searched him, and found in the fold of his Garter a Note containing the model of his Enterprize. He was arrested, and had his<note place="margin">His pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note> head cut off by sentence of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> on the nineteenth of <hi>December.</hi> His body was quartered, and his Quarters fixed
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:29592:168"/>
before the City-gates: his head carried to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> to be planted on a Pole on a Tower of one of the principal Gates. The Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours Secretary arrested.</note> of the Ambassadour was arrested as well as he; and had been in great danger, if the King had been as furious as those counselled him, who desired a rupture with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Rencounter gave subject to the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians<note place="margin">Several discourses concerning Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> to discourse diversly concerning the Rights of Ambassadours and their people: but <hi>Henry</hi> the Great decided himself the Question in this manner: <q>The Ambassadours <hi>(said he)</hi> are sacred by the right of Nations: now they first break them, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive any treason against the State, or against the Prince to whom their Master sent them; and therefore by consequence this right ought not secure them from being sought out and punished. Moreover, it is not to be presumed that they are either Ambassadours, or that they represent the Soveraign who sends them, when they commit those treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and infidelities which their Masters would neither act nor avow. However, there is more generosity in not using in this point the utmost rigour, but reserving the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to chastise them without doing it. And to this purpose, being well read in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, he alleadged that example of the Roman Senate, who having discovered that the Ambassadors of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Conspiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themselves with commanding them
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:29592:169"/>
to depart the City.</q> This was his Opinion: and as he always followed the most generous<note place="margin">The King forbids any process a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Secretary.</note> Maximes, he forbad that any process should be made against the Secretary, to whom the Judges were about to give the Question.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Ambassadour think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour makes a great noise, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens his Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment.</note> to cloak this perfidy by his Exclamations, came to complain to him that the rights of Nations were violated, and in them the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Ambassadours; and that the King his Master would have that resentment of it, which became a great Prince when offended. The King answering him with a wise coldness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented unto him what his Secretary had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with <hi>Mirargues.</hi> The Ambassadour not willing either to own the Man, or approve his Action, turned the business another way, and complained that the King had made the first breach of the peace of <hi>Vervin,</hi> by assisting the <hi>Hollanders</hi> both with men and money. The King replyed, that for the men, they went not by his Orders; and that there were French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the service of the Arch-Duke, as well as in the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> but for his money, that it was in his power to do with it what he pleased, and to lend it or give it without offending any. The Ambassadour was very hot, and there past some high words both on one part and the other. In fine, the King returned him his Secretary, as he had resolved to do before he spake.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Luquisses,</hi> they were two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">Treason of the <hi>Luquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>

               <p>It seemed that not onely the malice of men, but even folly it self conspired now against <hi>France:</hi> for the same day that <hi>Merargues</hi> was<note place="margin">A fool makes an attempt on the Kings person.</note> executed, an unhappy Fool made an attempt on the sacred person of the King; throwing himself upon him with a Dagger in his hand, as he passed on horse-back over the <hi>Pont-Neuf,</hi> returning from hunting.

He believed himself-King of all the world, and said that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth having usurped and taken <hi>France</hi> from him, he would chastise him for his temerity. Upon which, the King judging that he was sufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by his folly, commanded that he should onely be kept in prison; where he died not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> long after.</p>

if he have ever said, <hi>I will have it so,</hi> in any affair of importance; if he see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self always followed and accompanied by Grandees; if those who have business, who seek employments, and who have need of his favour, are in his Anti-chamber: in fine, that none in his Realm hath more respect and more assiduity; and then he shall clearly know who it is that reigns. But it is not enough for him to know who it is; he must, after the example of <hi>Philip</hi> the third, of whom we were now speaking, endeavour to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in possession of his Authority. It is in<note place="margin">In what the courage of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally consists.</note> that the Courage of a Prince principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists: for in what can he better make known his Resolution and Valour, then in taking upon him that degree and power which God hath given him? Is there a truer point of honour for a King, then in maintaining in his person the rights of his Royalty? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dissembling, it is more weakness and shame for a Soveraign to submit himself to him who ought to be submitted to his will, then to flee in the day of battel before his enemies: for the bravest are sometimes put to the worst; and the courage of a King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists much less in fighting with his hands, then governing with his head. What would it be for him to overcome his enemies, if he sees himself beneath his own subject, who under pretext to serve him, reduces him and his Estate into fetters; and who dares invest himself with all the glory and all the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29592:171"/>
advantage of command, making him believe that it is to ease him of the burthen?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Henry</hi> was not of this temper: his<note place="margin">The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great.</note> goodness was extream, but it was neither weak nor timid: his knowledge and understanding were not useless, but always laborious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: nothing was above him, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; nothing on any side of him, but Justice and Clemency, his two faithful Counsellours. The most hardy of his Ministers trembled when he but bent his brow: all familiarities immediately ceased, and none durst be other then silent, when he was pleased to take the tone of Master.</p>
               <p>Now this great King conserving still the splendour of his Majesty, we cannot wonder if he were esteemed above <hi>Philip</hi> the third; who for the present suffered himself to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely governed. And therefore because they knew he understood his fault, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he would be more easily perswaded to make War against him. Indeed he was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently resolute; and after so many injuries as he had received from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no great need of a spur. However, before he would engage himself in so great an Enterprize, he would manage all his Affairs so exactly, gather together so much Money, Artillery and Ammunitions, fortifie so well his Frontiers, take such good order within his<note place="margin">But the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens not the War.</note> Kingdom, assure himself of so many Friends and Allies, raise such powerful Armies; and in fine, make his Party so strong, that the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

should not at all be doubtful; and that assaulting that ambitious power, he might be assured to overthrow it: and therefore he judged it not to the purpose too much to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, he neglected not other means to acquire reputation; not thinking it less glorious to blazon forth his name by the repute of his wisdom in Counsels, then by the power of his Arms. By the last, he had been victorious over the Rebels and the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>

The King would not that they should take pains in the choice of another; and declared, That <hi>France</hi> took no other interest then that an honest man should be chosen.

               </p>
               <p>In the first years of his <hi>Papacy,</hi> there was re-kindled a great difference which was begun under his Predecessours, which had set on fire
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29592:172"/>
all the corners of <hi>Italy,</hi> and possibly all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,</hi> if our <hi>Henry</hi> had not taken care to extinguish it. I am about to tell the subject of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Signory</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> had formerly made<note place="margin">The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> had made a law to bound the Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> an Ordinance or Decree, which prohibited the Monks from purchasing Lands in their Dominions above the value of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Duckats; and enjoyning every one that had purchased above that value, to remit it to the <hi>Signory,</hi> who would re-imburse them the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase and the improvements they had made on it. And following the foot-steps of this anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Decree, they made another, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the founding or building of new Churches, Convents and Monasteries, without express permission of the <hi>Signory,</hi> upon pain of banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confiscation of such Foundations and Buildings.</p>
               <p>It was indeed part of the function and charge of Bishops to hinder this multiplication of Convents; but either through negligence, or too much facility, they gave to all as much permission as they demanded: insomuch that the Commonwealth seeing the default of the Prelates, found themselves constrained to take notice of it: otherwise it would soon have happened that all their Cities would have been nothing else but Convents and Churches; and all their Revenues, which ought to bear the charge of their Estate, and serve for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of married people, who furnish it with Souldiers, Merchants and Labourers,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29592:173"/>
would have been expended onely in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Nuns and Fryers.</p>
               <p>The Senate therefore made another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,<note place="margin">They make other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> which prohibited Ecclesiasticks from purchasing any immoveable Goods, except by the permission of the Senate. And at the same time it happened that an Abbot and a Cannon, accused of very horrid Crimes committed in the Territories of the <hi>Signory,</hi> were imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Authority of the Secular Justice; which passed for a strange attempt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the Mountains, where the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks are not at all subject to Secular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth coming to the Pontificial<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paul</hi> 5. offended at these Decrees.</note> Chair, not able to pass by, said he, all these at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Secular Estate on the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks, dispatched at the same time two Briefs to his <hi>Nuntio</hi> of <hi>Venice:</hi> One containing the<note place="margin">He sends Briefs to revoke them.</note> revocation of the Decrees made by the <hi>Signory</hi> touching the purchasing of temporal Estates; and the other commanding the sending back the Abbot and the Canon to the Court of the Church. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> signified these Briefs to the <hi>Signory;</hi> who answered boldly, That their Authority was born with them; That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but they had to do with it; and, That they should know how to maintain it against any would enterprize to oppose it. Both the one and the other employed the best Pens of the time to defend their Rights, and confute the Defences of their Adversaries. There were spread abroad every where great quantities of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:29592:173"/>
Manifesto's and Treaties, full of reasons of Right, passages of holy Scripture, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Fathers and Councils, and Examples drawn from History.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Pope extremely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">He Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the Senate.</note> at this answer, thunders out an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against the Duke and the Senate, if within four and twenty days they revoked not their Decrees, and consigned the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into the hands of the Nuntio. The<note place="margin">They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication null and abusive.</note> 
                  <hi>Signory</hi> was not at all moved at it, but boldly declared the sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication Null and abusive; nor was there any Ecclesiastick in their whole Territories who would attempt the publishing it, or durst observe the Interdict, or make Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice cease.

               <p>Things being thus embroyled to the utmost<note place="margin">1607.</note> between these two powers, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> look't out with a sharp eye, to make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of these divisions; and underhand cast oyl into the fire, though openly they made shew of extinguishing it. For on the one side they encouraged the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and heartned them up to maintain their rights; and on the other, they commanded their Governours of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> to serve the holy Father
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29592:174"/>
with all their powers. <hi>Henry</hi> the Great more sincere and more dis-interested, embraced this<note place="margin">

He assured the Pope, that as the true Eldest Son of the Church, he would always sustain its Interests; and that in case of rupture, he would go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in person with an Army of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men: but he intreated him that before it came to that, he would grant that he should try all means possible for an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He answered likewise to the Ambassador of <hi>Venice,</hi> who demanded his assistance, that he ought it to the holy Father in prejudice of all others: And therefore he exhorted the <hi>Signory</hi> to give him content; which that they might do without wounding their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or rights, he desired to be Mediator.</p>

The Treaty contained four Principal Articles. 1. That the <hi>Signory</hi> should consign the two prisoners into the hands of the Ambassador of <hi>France,</hi> to remit them to his Holiness. 2. That they should revoke the Manifesto and Declaration they had made against the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Censures. 3. That they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish all Ecclesiasticks in their goods. 4. That the Pope should give them absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

and that in requital, they should send to thank him by a Noble Embassy, and assure him of their fili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In fine, the Pope perswaded by the Eloquence of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> thought it better to release this point, then hazard the putting <hi>Christendom</hi> in a flame; so that they remained banished out of the lands of the <hi>Signory.</hi> The present Pope, <hi>Alexander</hi> the seventh, hath by his intercession re-established them.</p>

               <p>The United Provinces, vulgarly called <hi>Holland,</hi> from the name of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Seven Provinces which compose this body, had some reason to complain, that the King had made the Treaty at <hi>Vervins</hi> without their consent; and that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himself not to assist them, neither direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor indirectly.

So that it was not without apparent reason that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cried out, that he visibly infringed the Treaty at <hi>Vervins:</hi> but these reproaches were not just; for they had broke it first by an hundred attempts, of which we have before mentioned some.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the King who was a<note place="margin">

did greatly wish them in an Estate that they might not put him to so much charge. There was onely one way to effect it, which was procuring their peace from the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi> He resolved then to labour in it; and chose the President <hi>Janin,</hi> a man of great knowledge, to manage this Negotiation.<note place="margin">They come presently to an eight months truce.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The two parties presently consented to a Treaty of eight months; during which the Estates, to the end they might Treat with more reputation and security, prayed the<note place="margin">The King makes an offensive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive League with the <hi>Hollander.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:29592:176"/>At this first Audience <hi>Don Pedro</hi> brought his Beads in his hand.

               <p>Another time the King shewing him his Buildings at <hi>Fontain-bleau,</hi> and demanding of him what he thought of them? he replyed, that in his opinion he had lodged God very narrowly. There was then but two Chappels, which were in the Court, made in oval, and which were truly very little. The King could not endure to have his piety accused; and therefore answered him very sharply: <hi>You</hi> Spaniards <hi>know not how to give God other then Material Temples; we</hi> French-<hi>men lodge God not onely in stones, we lodge him in our hearts: but though he should be lodged in yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I fear it would be in stone still.</hi>

               <p>From <hi>Fontain-bleau</hi> they came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King one day shewing him his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and demanding his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; <hi>The Escurial is much another thing,</hi> said <hi>Don Pedro.

               </p>
               <p>One day <hi>Don Pedro</hi> seeing at the <hi>Louvre</hi> the Kings Sword in the hands of one of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, advanced to it, and putting one knee on<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>During the truce of eight months, of which we have spoken, the President <hi>Janin</hi> inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly laboured for a Treaty. There were
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:29592:177"/>
two great difficulties; one, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would not treat with the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,<note place="margin">Two obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Treaty of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted by the King.</note> but as with Subjects; and they would have him acknowledge them to be free and independent: the other, that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whose power and authority would be extremely weakned by the Peace, opposed it by a thousand Artifices, being sustained in it by the Province of <hi>Zealand,</hi> who ever desired War, and by some Cities of its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>These two obstacles were in the end sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> yeilded to the first, and acknowledged that he owned the States for Free States, Provinces, and Countries: and about the second, the King spoke so high to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that he durst not stop the course of the Treaty. It ended no longer<note place="margin">The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ends in a twelve years Truce.</note> however in a Peace, but onely in a Truce of twelve years, which was free and assured Commerce on one part and on the other.</p>
               <p>The renown of this accommodation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Kings glory throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> told our Ambassador in<note place="margin">Great praise given by the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> to our <hi>Henry.</hi>

               <p>The Friendship and Protection of this great<note place="margin">All desire his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and protection.</note> King was sought on all sides; all was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Arbitration, and all implored his assistance. And as he was equally powerful as wise, feared as loved; there was none who durst contradict his judgement, or assault those whom he protected. But he was so just, that he would not enterprize any thing upon<note place="margin">He will not protect Subjects against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</note> the Rights of another, nor maintain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions of Subjects against their Soveraign: A certain proof of which he gave to the <hi>Maurisques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is known how heretofore the <hi>Moores</hi> or <hi>Sarazins</hi> invaded all <hi>Spain,</hi> towards the year 725. The <hi>Christians</hi> with the aid of the <hi>French,</hi> had regained it from them by little and little; so that there remained no more then the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> which was little in Extent, but very rich, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely populous, because all the remnants<note place="margin">What the <hi>Maurisques</hi> were.</note> of that infidel Nation were retired into that little space. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> finished the Conquest of that Kingdom, in the year 1492. and so put an end to the Government of the <hi>Moores,</hi> and to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion in <hi>Spain;</hi> constraining the Infidels to take Baptism, or to retire into <hi>Affrica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as those who had thus professed the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion had done it perforce,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:29592:178"/>
they for the most part remained <hi>Mahumetans</hi> in their hearts, or <hi>Jews</hi> (for there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Jews</hi> amongst them) and secretly brought up their children in their incredulity. To which likewise the <hi>Spanish</hi> Rigor did much contribute, putting great distinction between the new Christians and the old: For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the new ones either to Charges or<note place="margin">The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> treat them ill.</note> Sacred Orders; they allied not themselves with them, and, which is worse, made a thousand <note n="*" place="margin">An avanie is, when by a false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation money is forced from any person.</note>

                  </gap>mposts. So that these unfortunate people seeing themselves thus trampled on, and being too weak of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to loosen themselves from their Yoak, they resolved to address themselves to some strange power, but which should be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; because that of the King of <hi>Morrocco,</hi> or the other Princes of <hi>Affrica,</hi> would have<note place="margin">They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great.</note> appeared too odious. To this effect they had secret recourse by Deputies to our <hi>Henry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when he was then but King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the year 1595. when they saw that he had overcome the League, and had got the upper hand in his affairs, they again implored his Protection. He hearkned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to their propositions; sent disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Agents into <hi>Spain,</hi> to see the Estate of their affairs; and made them hope that he would assist them. And truly he might have done it, since then he was in War with the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and it is lawful to make use of all sorts of Arms, to defend our selves against
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:29592:179"/>
our enemies. But now being returned this year 1608. to sollicite him instantly to accept their propositions and offers, and to hear the answer from his own mouth; he plainly let them know, that the quality of <hi>thrice-Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> King which he bore, permitted him not<note place="margin">He refuses it.</note> to undertake their defence, so long as the peace of <hi>Vervin</hi> lasted; but that if the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> should first openly infringe it, he should have just cause to receive them into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>Their Deputies having lost all hopes on this side, addressed themselves to the King of <hi>England,</hi> whom they found yet less disposed then he, to lend them assistance. In the mean time their plots having taken wind in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> caused both fear and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: for they were near a million of souls, and were possessed of almost all the Traffick, particularly that of Oiles, which is very great in that Country.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> the third found no other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spain</hi> banisheth them all.</note> way to hinder the dangerous effects of their conspiracies, but banishing them quite out of his Territories; which he did by an Edict of the tenth of <hi>January,</hi> in the year 1610. which was executed with much cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,<note place="margin">They are horribly ill Treated by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
                  </note> Inhumanity and Treachery.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29592:179"/>
Companions, fled towards <hi>France:</hi> one part by land to St. <hi>John de Lus,</hi> to the number of one hundred and fifty thousand; others in <hi>French</hi> Vessels, who brought them into divers ports of the Kingdom. But to speak truth, those who came by land were not much better treated by the <hi>French,</hi> then the others had<note place="margin">and by the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </note> been by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> for in crossing the Countries, they were almost all robbed and stript, and their Wives and Daughters ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: so that finding so little safety in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wherein they believed they might find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, they embarqued by the Kings permission in the Ports of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and crossed over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Affrica,</hi> where they are become implacable<note place="margin">They are carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Affrica,</hi> but some stay in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> and most cruel enemies to all Christians. There remained some families in the Maritime Cities of the Kingdom, as in <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Rouen;</hi> where it is suspected there is yet some of their Children, who privately follow the obstinacy of their Fathers.</p>
               <p>Much contrary to the taking the protection<note place="margin">The great designe of <hi>Henry</hi> 4. for the extent of the Christian Religion in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
                  </note> of these Infidels, the King was about very great designes for the glory and extent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion towards the <hi>Levant.</hi> But he would not declare himself, till he had so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Affairs of <hi>Christendome,</hi> that there should be no fear of any trouble or division, and that it might make use of all its forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so powerful an enemy as the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi> Out of these thoughts, he had sent three<note place="margin">He sends some to spy the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> or four Gentlemen into the <hi>Levant,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of travelling and visiting the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:29592:180"/>
holy places, might take notice of the Country, the disposition of the people, the estate of their Forces, the Garisons and Government of the Turks. Which having well considered, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised himself, that after having composed the interests, and procured the union of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, he might in three or four years at most ruine this power esteemed so terrible; and that with an Army of five and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foot-men, and twelve thousand horse one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great not having had more Forces to destroy the Empire of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which without doubt was greater and more powerful then that of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall declare what his great designe for the re-union of <hi>Christendome</hi> was, when I shall in brief have observed some important things which passed in the three or four last years of his Life.</p>
               <p>As he laboured diligently to heap up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">He seeks means to raise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without burthening his people.</note> the Nerves of War, so he hearkned to all Propositions made for the gaining it; so much the more willingly, because his designe was to abolish all Taxes and Impositions. The first could not be done without much diminishing his Revenue; so it was necessary to find some<note place="margin">He would disengage his demain,</note> other foundation in its place. Now this stock or foundation was the Demains of the Crown, which he would entirely disengage &amp; encrease by a great quantity of new rights, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by that of the <note n="*" place="margin">The Greffes is a due to the King of 63 <hi>

                  </gap>rther then it was before.</p>
               <p>It is certainly worth our wishing, that this sacred Patrimony of the Crown might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained; and that care were taken to re-gather this Mass, which the Law of the Realm, and the diligences of so many wise Heads, have made and composed for the space of so many Ages, to maintain our Kings with splendour and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, without being a charge to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, except in great and urgent necessities.</p>
               <p>As for the Impost, our <hi>Henry</hi> had a desire<note place="margin">and take off the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post by buying the Salt-Marishes.</note> to buy from the particular Owners all the Salt-Marishes of <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Britanny;</hi> and then when he had them in his hand, sell the Salt upon the place at what price he pleased to the Merchant, who should again retail it through the whole Kingdom, as they do Corn, without any constraint or imposition. In this manner there had been no need of so many Officers, Overseers, Controulers, Factors, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other people, which without fallacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to near twenty thousand, all fed and paid at the expence of the King and Publick, and against whom he had often very great complaints. Thus the poor Country-people would not be burthened by them with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Salt; constraining them, will they, nill they, to take yearly a certain quantity: and it is certain the people would have had it four times better cheap then they have, and the King have raised much more money then he doth, without expence, without pains, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29592:181"/>
without the vexation of his subjects.</p>
               <p>Now the King seeking means to fill his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and to finde some other way then Taxes, it must be acknowledged that he made some Imposts, and likewise some creation of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but that he removed many things which gave cause of complaint to many persons. And moreover, to pay his ancient Debts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit<note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to acquit himself of old scores, to make some new imposts &amp; creations.</note> himself of the recompences and pensions due to those which had served him in his Wars against the League, he was constrained to pass for their profit the advice of several things which they proposed: so that he loaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with that envy and those reproaches, which ought more justly have fallen upon those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then on himself. But those who knew his intentions, blamed him not as did the others: for they called that good husbandry and wise oeconomy, which some termed avarice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable covetousness.</p>
               <p>Moreover, though the will of this Prince was very good for the ease of his people, and for the grandeur of his Estate; nevertheless it cannot<note place="margin">He makes not always use of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent means.</note> be denied but he was sometimes deceived in the choice of the means; and that all those whereby he furnished himself, were not always as innocent as his intentions. He had two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, of which the one made some noise,<note place="margin">Inquisition of the rents of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-house cause di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.</note> but never succeeded; and the other was of very dangerous consequence.</p>
               <p>The first, was an inquisition of the Rents of the <note n="*" place="margin">Hostel de Ville is the same at <hi>Paris,</hi> as Guild-hall at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hostel de Ville,</hi> by which he pretended to make those loose them, who had ill gained
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29592:181"/>
them; and this in it self was very just: but most part of the Rents having changed Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or been parted, he must of force trouble an infinite number of Families: so that all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was moved at it, and the Landlords had recourse to their Provost of the Merchants. This was <hi>Miron,</hi> who was likewise <hi>Civil Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant;</hi> a man very zealous for the service of the King, as he had demonstrated in several occasions: but withal, a very honest Man, and one whom no interest in the world could bribe against the peoples, whose Magistrate he was. In sum, he sustained it stoutly, he spoke in the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Miron,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost of the Merchants, sustains the interest of the people.</note> Assemblies of the <hi>Hostel de Ville,</hi> acted with the Superintendent with like vigour, and made Remonstrances to the King. But in these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances, too much heat transported him to make some odious Comparisons, not of the Kings person, but of some people of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Louvre</hi> stormed; the people of the<note place="margin">Some would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> Court cryed out, that he had blasphemed those whom he had taken notice of in his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And those who were interested in this inquisition after Rents, used all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to incense the King, and to perswade him to punish rigorously this boldness. On the other side, the people having understood<note place="margin">The people rise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him.</note> that their Magistrate was threatned, took fire sooner then it was believed: the Burgesses came in troops about his house to defend it. <hi>Miron</hi> instantly entreated them to retire, and not to make him Criminal. He remonstrated
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29592:182"/>
to them, that he feared nothing; that they had to do with a King as sweet and just as he was great and wise, and who would not let himself be carried away by the perswasions of ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors.</p>
               <p>Upon this, those who wished him ill, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed<note place="margin">The King counselled to take him by force.</note> all their endeavours to engage the King to take him by force, and to make valid his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority: but he wisely answered these people, That Authority doth not always<note place="margin">The Kings wise answer worthy a great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian.</note> consist in prosecuting things to the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: That the time, the persons, and the cause, ought to be regarded: That having been ten years extinguishing the fire of civil War, he feared even the least sparkles: That <hi>Paris</hi> had cost him too much, to hazard the least danger of loosing it; which seemed to him insallible, if he followed their counsel, because he should be obliged to make terrible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which would in few days deprive him of the glory of his Clemency, and the love of his people, which he prized as much as, nay above, his Crown: That he had in an hundred other occasions made proof the fidelity and honesty of <hi>Miron,</hi> who had no ill intention; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he believed himself obliged by the duty of his Charge, to do what he did: That if some inconsiderate words had escaped him, he might well pardon them for his past servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: That after all, if this man affected to be the Martyr of the people, he would not give him that glory, nor attract to himself the name of Persecutor or Tyrant: And that in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29592:182"/>
fine, he would not prosecute a man whom he would resolve to loose, in so advantagious oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>Thus this wise King knew how prudently to<note place="margin">He will not pursue this business of the Rents.</note> dissemble a little fault: nor would he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what passed, for fear of being obliged to some blow of Authority, which might possibly have had dangerous Consequences. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived therefore very favourably the excuses and humble submissions of <hi>Miron,</hi> and after prohibited the farther pursuing the inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rents, which had caused so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The second means of which he served him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Paulete.</hi>
                  </note> to raise money, and which was of very dangerous consequence, was the <hi>Paulete,</hi> or Annual Right. To understand this business well, we must make some recital of things far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
               <p>The Offices of Judicature, of Policy and of<note place="margin">Justice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred in <hi>France</hi> by Gentlemen.</note> the Revenues, had formerly been exercised in <hi>France</hi> under the first and second Race of our Kings, by Gentlemen: for the Nobility was obliged to study and understand the Laws of the Kingdom. They were chosen for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of their Age and Judgement: they were changed from time to time, from one seat to another: nor took they any Fees from Parties, but onely a Salary very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which the Publick paid them rather for honour then recompence. Afterwards in the end of the second Race, and the beginning of the third, the Nobility becoming ignorant and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29592:183"/>
weak together, the Plebeians and Burgesses ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learnt the knowledge of the Laws, raised<note place="margin">How it fell into the hands, of the Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who made profit of it.</note> themselves by little and little to these Charges, and began to make them better worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they drew all their Honour and all their Dignity thence, not having any other by their birth, as the Gentlemen had. Yet they had not over-much employment; for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men possessed almost all the Jurisdiction, and had their Officers which administred Justice.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Parliament, which<note place="margin">The Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>France</hi> meddle with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and is made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> before was as the Council of Estate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and an Epitomy of the general Estates, taking upon them to trouble themselves with the knowledge of differences between particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, whereas before they onely treated of great Affairs of Policy; <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, or according to some others, <hi>Lewis Hutin</hi> his son, made it sedentary at <hi>Paris.</hi> Now this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Judges being most illustrious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King often took seat amongst them, the Dukes, Peers and Prelates of the Realm made a part of them, and that the most able people for Law were chosen to fill places there; they made depend upon them all the<note place="margin">They make all other Judges subalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to them.</note> power of other Judges-Royal; to wit, the Bayliffs and Seneschals, who though before Soveraign Judges, became now Subalternate to them.</p>
               <p>Long time after, our other Kings created likewise at divers times many other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but out of a sole intention the better to distribute Justice without any pecuniary

interest: for by it they charged their Coffers with new Wages, to be paid these new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>At this time the number of the Officers of<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Officers of Parliament small.</note> Justice was very small; and the order which was observed to fill the vacancies in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perfectly good. The custome was, to keep a Register of all the able Advocates and Lawyers; and when any Office came to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, they chose three, whose Names they carried to the King, who preferred him he pleased. But the Favourites and the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers soon corrupted this Order: they perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Kings not to confine themselves to those presented, but to name one of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion: which those people did, to draw some present from him who should be named by their recommendation. And the abuse was so great, that oftentimes the Charges were filled with ignorant People and Porters; by reason of which, people of merit held the condition of an Advocate much more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then that of a Counsellour.</p>
               <p>The mischief dayly encreasing, and the rich people becoming extreamly liquorish of these Charges for lucre, and their Wives out of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, those who governed began to make a Merchandize of them, and to draw money from them. Thus under <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>xii.</hi> his Coffers being exhausted by the long Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Offices of the Revenue began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<note place="margin">How Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces became vendible under <hi>Francis</hi> 1.</note> vendible. However, that good King having soon foreseen the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

resolved to re-imburse those who had bought them: but dying in that good designe, <hi>Francis</hi> the first, of whom he had well predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that he would <note n="*" place="margin">He had often said, that fat Boy would spoile all.</note> spoile all, sold likewise those of Judicature: afterwards new ones were at several times created, onely of purpose to raise money.</p>

And moreover, they sold Offices when they were vacant, either by death or forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the ill was great, but not incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: a part of these Offices need onely have been suppressed, when they became vacant; and the rest when so, filled with persons of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and merit. Thus in twenty years, this Ants-nest of Officers might have been reduced to a very little number, and those as honest people.</p>
               <p>But the business was not in this manner<note place="margin">How this might be remedied.</note> made known to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great: they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it to him in another sense. They let him understand, that since he drew no profit from vacant Offices, being almost always obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give them, he would do well to finde the means to discharge that way his Coffers of a part of the Wages he paid his Officers; which he might do, by granting them their Offices for their Heirs; reserving a moderate sum of

This was none of the least difficulties of his life: for he had a high and obstinate spirit to bend; however, he employed only ways of sweetness and perswasion; acting in this business, only as a Father who loved his Son, and not as a King who would be obeyed.</p>
               <p>Now will I speak of his ordinary divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">What were the Kings divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Hunting, Building, Feasts, Play, and Walking.

Some carped that so great a Prince should abase himself to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29592:185"/>
such follies, and that a Grey-beard should please to act the young man. It may be said for his excuse, that the great toiles of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had need of these divertisements. But<note place="margin">He loved Play too much.</note> I know not what to answer to those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with too great a love to playing at Cards and Dice, little befitting a great King; and that withal he was no fair Gamester, but greedy of Coin, fearful at great Stakes, and humorous upon a loss. To this I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it was a fault in this great King, who was no more exempt from Blots, then the Sun from Beams.</p>
               <p>It might be wished for the honour of his memory, that he had been only guilty of this;<note place="margin">He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely given to women.</note> but that continual weakness he had for fair Ladies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes he had desires which were passant, and only fixt for a night: but when he met with beauties which struck him to the heart, he loved even to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and in these transports appeared nothing less then <hi>Henry</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>The Fable saies that <hi>Hercules</hi> took the Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and Spun, for the love of the fair <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phale.

He once disguised himself like a Country-man, with a Wallet of straw on his back, to come to the fair <hi>Gabriella.</hi> And it hath been reported, that the Marchioness

               <p>The high esteem and affection which the <hi>French</hi> had for him, hindred them from being<note place="margin">This causes often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions with his wife.</note> offended at so scandalous a liberty: but the Queen his wife was extremely perplexed at it; which hourly caused controversies between them, and carried her to disdains and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som humours.

So that he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually a reconciliation to make. And these contentions were so ordinary, that the Court which at first were astonished at them, in the end took no more notice.</p>
               <p>Conjugal duty without doubt obliged the King not to violate his faith to his Legitimate Spouse, at least not to keep his Mistresses in her sight: but if he in this point ought to have been a good husband, so he ought to be likewise in that of Authority, and in accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wife to obey him with more submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not perplex him as she did with hourly complaints, reproaches, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times threats.</p>

be raised and assured a stock of money and men, to which every Dominion should<note place="margin">and to assist the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to Infidels.</note> contribute according to the Assessment of the great Council, for the assistance of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions bordering upon Infidels from their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, to wit, <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those of the Turks; and <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> against the <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi>

The sum in<note place="margin">What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; what train.</note> gross which they should furnish out, should amount to two hundred sixty five thousand foot-men, fifty thousand horse, a train of two hundred and seventeen pieces of Cannon, with Waggons, Officers, and Ammunition propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and one hundred and seventeen great Ships, without counting Vessels of less force, Fire-ships, or Ships of burden.</p>
               <p>This establishment would have been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious<note place="margin">None but the house of <hi>Austria</hi> had suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to all the Princes and Estates of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> There was onely the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> which would suffer any loss, and which was to be despoiled to accommodate others.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:29592:190"/>
But the project was laid to make them either willingly or by force consent, in this manner.

                  <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> were well informed of the Kings designes, and that they ought to assist with all their forces; especially the <hi>Savoyard,</hi> who was moreover extreamly animated, because the King gave his Daughter in marriage to his<note place="margin">In <hi>Germany</hi> many Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; and had chosen the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> Emperour.</note> son <hi>Victor Amadeo:</hi> In <hi>Germany</hi> four Electors; to wit, the <hi>Palatine, Brandebourg, Colen,</hi> and <hi>Ments</hi> were likewise to know it, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it: and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had their word, and that of the King, to raise him to the Empire: and many Imperial Cities had already addressed themselves to the King, to beseech him to honour them with his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to maintain them in their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which had been abolished by the house<note place="margin">In <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> the Lords and Nobility.</note> of <hi>Austria:</hi> In <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria</hi> there was intelligence held with the Lords and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and that the people, desperate with the weight of that yoak, were ready to shake it off, and to relieve themselves on the first prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered occasion.</p>
               <p>All these dispositions being so favourable to<note place="margin">The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Cleves</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to give a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the great designe.</note> him, the business of <hi>Cleves</hi> happened, of which we at present shall speak, which furnished him with a fair occasion to begin the execution of his projects: which he was to do in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Having raised an Army of forty thousand men, as he did, he was in his march to dispatch
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29592:190"/>
towards all the Princes of <hi>Christendome,</hi> to give them the knowledge of his just and holy intentions. After, under the pretext of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Cleves,</hi> he was to seize all the passages of <hi>la Mense,</hi> and all at once assault <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Mastrich,</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> which were but ill fortified. At the same time the Cities of the Low-Countries had cryed out for liberty, and the Lords put themselves in the Field for the same purpose, and had blazoned the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique</hi>

               <p>In all probable appearance, at the approach of so great an Army, by reason of the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of the principal Lords, by the insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the great Cities, and of the love which these people have still had for liberty, <hi>Flanders</hi> would all have risen: especially when they had<note place="margin">The King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

safety of the people, not reserving any thing of all his Conquests, but the glory and the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">The King would have reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</note> of having restored those Provinces to themselves, without keeping so much as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle or Village to himself.</p>
               <p>At the same time that he had put <hi>Flanders</hi> into a free state, and accommodated the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the succession of <hi>Cleves,</hi> all the Princes interested in this business, the Electors we have named, and the Deputies of many great Cities, were to come and thank him, and intreat him that he would joyn his Prayers and his Authority to the supplications they<note place="margin">He had with other Princes prayed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restore the Cities of the Empire to liberty.</note> had to make to the Emperour, to dispose him to restore the Estates and Cities of the Empire to their ancient Rights and Immunities; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, in the free Election of a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> without using any practices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints, promises and threats: And that for this effect it should be from that moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that they should elect one of another house then that of <hi>Austria.</hi> They had agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, that it should be the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The Pope had joyned with them in this request; which had been made with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that it had been difficult for the <hi>Emperor,</hi> being unarmed as he was, to have refused it.</p>
               <p>The like request had been made to the<note place="margin">

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29592:191"/>
Government they should think best, by the advice of their friends and allies. To which the King condescending, had used all sorts of fair means, prayers and supplications, even below his dignity; that it might be seen he intended not so much to serve himself of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as of equity and reason.</p>
               <p>After this the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by the same<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Dower of his wife from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                  </note> way had demanded of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with all sorts of civility, and in the name of his children, that he would be pleased to give them a Dower for their Mother, as good and advantagious as he had to their Aunt <hi>Isabella;</hi> and in case of refusal, the King was to permit <hi>Lesdiguieres</hi> to assist him with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand Footmen, and two thousand Horse, for the Conquest of <hi>Milan,</hi> or the Country of <hi>Lombardy:</hi> in which he would have been favoured by the greatest part of the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, he with his Associates were to<note place="margin">The Pope and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of the difference of <hi>Navarre, Naples, Savoy,</hi> &amp;c.</note> beseech the Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> to become Arbitrators between him and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to terminate friendly these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which were ready to break forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, by reason of <hi>Naples, Sicily, Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Roussillon.</hi> And then to shew that he had no thought to aggrandize himself, nor other ambition then to settle the repose of <hi>Christendom;</hi> he had shewed himself ready<note place="margin">And the King had yeilded his right.</note> to yeild to the <hi>Spaniard Navarre</hi> and <hi>Rous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillon,</hi> so that he restored <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> not for himself, for he would have no other Estate
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:29592:192"/>
then <hi>France;</hi> but for the Pope, and for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to whom he yeilded his right over those Countries.</p>
               <p>In fine, by a Legat Apostolick, and by the Remonstrances of all his Associates, he had let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> understand his design, together with the Princes of his house, and had conjured them by the blood of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to consent to it; as being Holy, Pious, Charitable, Glorious, and Profitable to all <hi>Christendom.</hi> They had withal laid before him<note place="margin">They had perswaded the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or else forced him.</note> the advantages which would have come to himself; and endeavoured to make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that he would be more rich, less disturbed, and more peaceable: That in twenty years <hi>Spain,</hi> which was almost desert, would be repeopled, and become the most flourishing Estate of <hi>Europe.</hi> I believe it would have been difficult to perswade him to it: for unlimited and ill designing ambition embraces rather Chimera's then solid things, and chooses rather to possess vast and desert Countries, then a reasonable extent well cultivated and well peopled: but possibly Arms might have convinced him, had reason failed.</p>
               <p>For the rest, the King had resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce<note place="margin">The great Prudence and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the King in the pursuit of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</note> all pretention; not to keep any thing of what he Conquered; not to enterprize any thing, which should not be approved by his Allies, and which he saw not them disposed to contribute to; not to begin in many distant places at a time, but to pursue his expeditions
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:29592:192"/>
by degrees, still attending the success of the first, before he engaged in others: To shew himself to be without Ambition, without Covetousness or Pride in the distribution of Quarters, Victuals, Spoils and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests: To favour weak and necessitated Estates: To send alwaies some honourable and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement to Captains or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who had done some fair Exploit: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to enter into those partialities often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived between friends and Allies, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear alwaies an equal, just, and common friend: To treat honourably the men of War, with praises or reproofs when they deserved it, and to maintain exactly disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, prohibiting Spoils, Violation and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; that he might be received as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer of Nations, and he who brought Peace and Liberty, and not Rnine and Desolation.</p>
               <p>He had laid his designs, made his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">The prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations he made.</note> and fitted all his Engines to come to this end, with all diligence imaginable, for the space of eight or nine years: he had made Friends and Allies on all sides, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained intelligences every where, had gained the Colledge of Cardinals by great pensions, had drawn to his service all the good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and had likewise gained all the good Pens in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom:</hi> for indeed he would have chosen rather to perswade then force people, and instruct them so well in his intentions, that they should have regarded his Arms onely as Tutelar Succours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:29592:193"/>See here the platform of his design; which without dissembling was so great, that it may be said, it was conceived by an intelligence more then humane. But how high soever it was, it was not above his power: <q>To which if Princes proportionate not their Enterprizes, it happens that they ruine their Estates, just as a man who undertakes a suit at Law, or makes greater bargains then his purse is able to bear out, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained in the end to sell his stock, and drown himself in a Sea of debts and troubles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Besides his forces, which were great in<note place="margin">The forces he had.</note> number, but ten times greater in valour, being all chosen men, and having amongst them four thousand Gentlemen, daring all things in the sight of their King; the Prince<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Army.</note> of <hi>Orange</hi> was to put himself in the field with fifteen thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse: The Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>

                  </note> would each have declared with a considerable Army, at the first signal given.

As for his stock of moneys, all his Troops were paid for three months; his Garisons well furnished, all his
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:29592:193"/>
Storehouses on the Frontiers full; his Captains honored with great presents which he had made them: he had fourteen Millions of Livres in the <hi>Bastille,</hi> seven Millions in the hands of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of the Exchequer, of the Revenue of the preceding year; two Millions in other hands: Moreover, the accrewing Revenue, which was more then twenty seven Millions: and besides all this, <hi>Sully</hi> his chief Treasurer assured him of forty Millions extraordinary for three years; so that he might maintain a four years War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out burthening his subjects with new charges. But he would do it so hotly, that it should last but a short time: for he held it for a Maxime, <q>That a wise Prince when he is obliged to it,<note place="margin">He would make the War pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, that it might be short.</note> ought to make it powerful and short, and at first astonish the world with formidable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, because by this means it returns to good husbandry; and the Conquests made through fear of his Arms, reach farther then those made by his Arms themselves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have told you what was his design: none<note place="margin">Great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it might have succeeded, having no Princes to oppose it but the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi>
                  </note> but God knows what would have been the success. We may say however, judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appearances, that it could not but be happy; for there appeared no Prince nor Estate in <hi>Christendom,</hi> who would not have favoured it, or who would have taken the part of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> except the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> But the King might have made them both consent: The first, by assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting against him the heirs of that Duke <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>

who had formerly been despoiled of the Electorate by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. The second, by stirring up <hi>Pisa, Sienna</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> to cry for liberty, and shake off their yoak under the <hi>Medicis.</hi>

The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> descended from an Elder Daughter of Duke <hi>John</hi> Grand-father of Duke <hi>William,</hi> said likewise that it preferably appertained to him, because it was concluded in the contract of the marriage of that Lady, that in case an issue Male were wanting to the house of <hi>Juliers,</hi> the Succession should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29592:194"/>
to him and his descendants: Now that arriving, it necessarily followed that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession was open to him. The Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> pretended likewise to the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> as he alone carrying the Name and Arms of <hi>Cleves:</hi> and the Count of <hi>Maulevrier</hi> for the same reason demanded the County <hi>de la Mark,</hi> for he was the Eldest <hi>de la Mark;</hi> and in this quality he pretended likewise to the Dutchy of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and the Signory of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> which were held by the Viscount of <hi>Turenne</hi> Marshal <hi>de Bouillon.</hi> The Emperour said that all the pretensions of those concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour said it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> were ill founded, for that those Lands being Fiefs Masculine, could not fall to Daughters; but in default of Males, were devolved to the Empire, and therefore he to have the disposal of them. And upon this right<note place="margin">He invests <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi>
                  </note> he secretly gave the investiture to <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> Bishop of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and sent his forces to seize those lands under pretext of Right, and in the mean time assigned the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to appear before his Imperial Majesty, to give in their reasons.</p>
               <p>The pursuits of the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> and the Count of <hi>Maulevrier</hi> were not very hot, because they were made understand that the Fiefs they demanded were united, and could not be dismembred. The Right of the Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and that of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> being most apparent, the greatest contestation was between them. The <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> their common friend, became

Mediator for them, and made them pass a transaction to decide their difference friendly, without imploying their forces, except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Usurpers; the administration of the Succession remaining equal and common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst<note place="margin">who whilst <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> and <hi>Newbourg</hi> dispute, seizes <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, he would establish a little Council<note place="margin">He establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes little Councils in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, who refer to the great one.</note> of five persons in every one of the twelve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>France;</hi> to wit, one person for the Clergy, one for the Nobility, one for Justice, one for the Revenues, and one for the Body of the Cities: and these twelve little Councils should have correspondence with, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the great one; which should have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken its resolutions from the plurality of voices, the Queen having onely hers. Nor could it indeed take any, but according to the general Instructions formed by the King, or without his Majesties being informed of it, if it were a thing which his Instructions did not clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough explain. Thus, though absent, he kept the Reins of his Government, and tied up the hands of the Queen, for fear lest she should take too much Authority, or have been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to abuse her Command.</p>

to authorize her Regency, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled and crowned before the departure of the King. For the same Reasons that she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, the King found it not agreeable to him; besides that this Ceremony could not be made without a great deal of expence, and without loosing much time, which would keep him at <hi>Paris,</hi> and retard his designes. He had an extream impatience to depart from that City; I know not what secret instinct pressed him to be gone as soon as possible: but for this reason the Instalment troubled him; yet<note place="margin">He, though unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.</note> he could not refuse this mark of his affection to the Queen, who passionately desired it.</p>

                  <hi>Sully</hi> recounts that he heard him say more then once, <hi>My Friend, this Instalment presages me some misfortune: they will kill me. I shall never depart from this City.

               </p>
               <p>They counselled him, to shun these ill Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, to depart on the morrow, and leave the Instalment to be done without him: but the Queen was extreamly offended; and he good and obliging, remained onely to content her.

               <p>Already had the forces of the King met at their Rendezvouz on the Frontiers of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</hi> Already had the Nobility, who were come from all parts, sent their Equipages: The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was gone to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the six thousand <hi>Swisses;</hi> and there were gone fifty piece of Cannon out of the Arsenal. Already had the King sent to demand of the <hi>Arch-duke</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> in what manner they would that he should pass their Country, either as a Friend, or an Enemy. Every hour of delay seemed to him a year, as if he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged some misfortune to himself: and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both Heaven and Earth had given but too many Prognosticks of what arrived.

               <p>His Enemies were at present in a profound silence: which possibly was not caused onely by their Consternation, and by the fear of the success of his Arms, but out of the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had to see succeed some great blow, in which lay all their hopes. It must needs be that there were many conspiracies against the Life of this good King; since from twenty pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

Himself, who was<note place="margin">He seems to believe them, and fear.</note> not over-credulous, gave some faith to these Prognosticks, and seemed as one condemned to death: So sad and cast down he was, though naturally he was neither melancholy nor fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

               <p>He began the first motions of his life in the Camp, at the Sound of Trumpets; his Mother brought him into the world with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courage; his Grand-father inspired strength into him the first day he saw him; and he was brought up to labor from his tenderest infancy.</p>
               <p>The first knowledge that age gave him, was to resent the death of his Father killed at the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29592:202"/>
siege of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and to see himself encompassed with dangers on all sides, distant from Court, his friends dis-favoured, his servants persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his ruine conjured by his enemies.</p>
               <p>His Mother, a generous and able woman, gave him excellent instructions for Morality and Policy; but very ill ones for Religion; so that he was a <hi>Hugonot</hi> by Engagement, and not by Election. And he often professed that he was not prepossessed, that he should be ready to clear and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay himself open, and that if they could make him see a better way then that he followed, he willingly and faithfully would walk in it; but that till then he was to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, and not persecuted.</p>
               <p>At the age of fifteen years he became chief of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, and gave such sensible advices, that the greatest Captains had cause to admire him, and to repent that they had not followed him. He passed the first flowers of his youth, part in Arms, and a part in his Lands of <hi>Gascoin,</hi> where he remained till the age of nineteen years. He was then enticed to come to Court, by a Marriage as illegitimate as cruel: for we may say, that the present Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptial was the suddain death of his Mother; the Feast, the general Massacre of his friends; and the Morrow of his Marriage, his Captivity, which endured almost four years, at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his most cruel enemies, and in a Court the most wicked and most corrupted that ever was known. His courage was not at all weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this servitude, nor could his soul be
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29592:202"/>
infected among so many corruptions: But the Charms of the Ladies which Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> made use of to retain him, begat in him that weakness and vice which indured all his life, not to refuse any of those desires their beauty inspired.</p>
               <p>To withdraw himself from the servitude of the Court, he cast himself into the snare of his ancient party, and of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Religion. He received all those troubles, and all those perplexities which the Chiefs of a Civil War make proof of; his dignity of General not dispensing with the pains and dangers of a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Souldier. Thrice did he oblige the Court to grant him Peace and Priviledges to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but thrice they violated them; and he seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times beheld seven or eight Royal Armies make head against him.</p>
               <p>His valour, which had already appeared in many occasions, signalized it self with great Renowne at the Battail of <hi>Coutras.</hi> This was the first important blow that he struck on the head of the League. A little after it, having assembled the Estates at <hi>Blois,</hi> to Arm the whole Kingdom against him, and exclude him from the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> the <hi>Guises,</hi> who were believed the Authors of this Tragedy, were themselves made the terrible <hi>Catastrophe;</hi> but which filled all with flame, blood and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> Armed himself to Revenge the Death of his Brothers; and the King almost quite abandoned and shut up in <hi>Tours,</hi> was enforced to call him to his aid.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:29592:203"/>
Our <hi>Hero</hi> passed by all distrusts and all fears some would have infused into him, to take the part of his Soveraign.</p>
               <p>They marched to <hi>Paris</hi> and besieged it: but upon the point to enter, <hi>Henry</hi> the third is As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinated by a Monk. The right of Succession calling our <hi>Henry</hi> to the Throne, he found the way crossed with a thousand terrible difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the League in head against him, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the defunct King little affected to him, the Grandees every one for his particular ends. The whole Catholick Religion Leagued against him; without, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyard,</hi> the <hi>Lorrainer;</hi> within, on one side the people and the great Cities, on the other the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who tormented him with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual distrusts. He could not advance one pace without finding some obstacle; so many days, so many battails. His subjects endeavoured to overthrow him as a publick enemy, and he endeavoured to regain them like a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In his Closet, and in his Council, there were only displeasures and bitternesses, caused by an infinity of discontents, treasons and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious designs, which were from moment to moment discovered against his Person and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Estate. Every day a double Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, a double Victory; the one against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the other against his followers: using Prudence and Cunning, where Generosity would not serve.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Arques</hi> he made it appear he could not be overcome; and at <hi>Yvry,</hi> that he knew how
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29592:203"/>
to vanquish. Every where, where he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all yeilded to his Arms: The League dayly lost places and Provinces: It was beaten by his Lieutenants in other places, as by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the heart of his Kingdom. He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Paris,</hi> if he could have resolved to loose it; but by sparing it, he absolutely gained not onely its walls, but its hearts.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> stopt a little the progress of his successes; but he could not change their course. Vertne and Fortune, or rather Divine Providence, seemed linked together to crown him with Glory. God visibly assisted him in all his designes, and preserved him from an infinite number of treasons and horrid attempts which were dayly formed against his Life. In fine, he overthrew the intentions of the Thirdlings, and prevented the resolutions of the Estates of the League, by causing himself to be instructed in the Catholick Religion, and re-entring into the bosome of the holy Church.</p>
               <p>When that pretext of Religion was wanting to his enemies, all the party of the League moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred away; <hi>Paris,</hi> and all the great Cities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him; the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> though very late, was constrained to become his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and return to his duty; and all the Chiefs of the League treated separately. This shew'd a great deal of prudence and cunning in the King, to receive them thus disjoyntly: for if they had all together made a treaty of common accord, the party had by this means conserved its bonds together, and not been overthrown, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:29592:204"/>When he had got the upperhand in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and was reconciled to the Pope, and that his subjects were reconciled with him, the ill counsel of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who desired always to see him in trouble, perswaded him to declare a War against <hi>Spain.</hi> It was now that he thought he should fall into a worse Estate then ever. They took from him <hi>Dourlens</hi> after the gain of one battel; <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Ardres</hi> by storm, and <hi>Amiens</hi> by surprize. The rest of the League which lay hid under the cinders, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle; the discontents of the great ones, to be discovered; Conspiracies were formed on all sides; his servants were amazed, his enemies emboldened. But his Vertue, which seemed to sleep in prosperity, rouzed it self in adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he encouraged his friends, re-took <hi>Amiens,</hi> and forced the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to make peace by the treaty of <hi>Vervin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> thinking to deceive him in the restitution of the Marquisate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> and to raise factions in his Realm which should hinder the King from demanding reason of him, found that he had to do with a Prince who knew as well how to over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reach him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, as to conquer his forces: for he forced him among those rocks where he boasted he had nothing to fear but the thunder-bolts of Heaven, and made him shamefully restore what he had unjustly usurped.</p>
               <p>At the same time the King had thoughts, as well for the security and tranquillity of <hi>France,</hi> as for his own, to generate Children of a lawful
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:29592:204"/>
marriage. Heaven gave him six, and with them a peace of ten years, which was onely lightly troubled by the conspiracy of <hi>Byron,</hi> by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and by some popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar risings against the <hi>Pancarte,</hi> or <hi>Sol pour livre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During all this, he laboured principally for two things: the one, his great designe, of which we have spoken; for which he made friends and allies on all sides, cleared his revenues, paid his debts with as good credit as if he had been a Merchant, gathered monies, and pacified all differences which were between those Princes with whom he would associate. The other was to repair the damages and ruines of <hi>France,</hi> which a forty years civil War had caused; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move those causes which imbittered and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded spirits; reform those disorders which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured the face of the Estate; make it flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rich, to the end his subjects might live happily under the wings of his protection and his justice.</p>
               <p>In the mean time himself was not free from troubles, perplexities and disgusts: his Mistresses caused him a thousand vexations in the midst of his pleasures: he found thorns even in his Nuptial-bed, and in the ill humour of his wife; and <hi>Conchini</hi> was causer of griefs to him: just as a little but vexatious Mouse may furiously trouble and turmoile the noble Lyon.</p>
               <p>As he was ready to mount on horse-back to begin his great designe by the assistance of his Allies, he lost his Life by the most detestable Parricide was ever known. Thus he whom so
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:29592:205"/>
many Pikes, so many Musquets and Cannons, so many Squadrons and Battalions of men, could not hurt in the trenches and in the field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, was killed with a Knife by a wicked and trayterous Rogue, in the midst of his capital City, in a Coach, and on a day of publick Joy. Unhappy blow, which put an end to all the joys of <hi>France,</hi> and which opened a wound which to this day hath left its scar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> was of a middle stature, disposed and active, hardened to labour and travel. His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was well formed, his temperament able and strong, and his health perfect; onely about the age of fifty years, he had some light assaults of the Gout, but which soon passed away, and left behinde them no weakness. He had his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head high, his eyes lively and assured, his nose Aquiline, his complexion ruddy, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance sweet and noble; and yet withal, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence Warlike and Martial, his hair brown, and very thin. He wore his beard large, and his hair very short. He began to grow gray at the age of thirty five years: upon which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to say to those who wonder'd at it, <hi>It is the wind of my adversities hath blown me this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Indeed to consider well all his life from his very birth, few Princes will be found who have suffered so much as he; and it will be difficult to tell if he had more crosses or more<note place="margin">Parallel of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> prosperities. He was born the Son of a King, but of a King despoiled of his Estates. He had a Mother generous, and of a great courage; but a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and an enemy of the Court.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:29592:205"/>
He gained the battel of <hi>Coutras;</hi> but he lost a little after the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his Cousin, and his right hand. The League stirred up his vertue, and made him know it; but it thought to overthrow him. It was the cause that the King having called him to his assistance, he found himself at the gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> as if God had led him by the hand: but <hi>Paris</hi> arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self against him, and all his hopes were almost dissipated by the scattering of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which besieged that City. It was without doubt a great happiness that the Crown of <hi>France</hi> fell to him, there having never been a succession more distant in any hereditary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: for there were ten or eleven degrees between <hi>Henry</hi> the third and him; and when he was born, there was nine Princes of the blood before him: to wit, King <hi>Henry</hi> 2. and his five sons; King <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> his father, and two sons of that <hi>Anthony,</hi> eldest brothers of our <hi>Henry.</hi> All these Princes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make room for his succession: But he found it so embroyled, that we may say he suffered an infinity of labours, pains and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, before he could gather the fair flowers of this Crown. Young he espoused the sister of King <hi>Charles,</hi> which seemed a match very advantagious for him: but this marriage was a snare to entrap both him and his friends. Afterwards, that Lady, in stead of being his Consort, became his trouble; and in stead of being his honour, became his shame. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife brought him forth fair children,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:29592:206"/>
to his no little joy: but her grumblings and disdains were the causers of a thousand dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. He triumphed over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and became Arbitrator of <hi>Christendom:</hi> but the more powerful he made himself, the more was their hatred envenomed, and the more means used they to destroy him; so that after having plotted an infinite number of conspiracies against his life, they found in the end a <hi>Ravaillac,</hi> who executed in the end what so many <note n="*" place="margin">There are more then fifty conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his person.</note> others had failed in.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now it must be acknowledged that all these adversities which he suffered, ought to whet his spirit and his courage; and that in fine he should be the greatest of Kings, because he came to the Crown through so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,<note place="margin">His adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities whet his spirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Why Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who come young to the Crown, seldome learn to govern well.</note> and in an age very mature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And certainly it is difficult and very rare for those who are born to a Crown, and bred up to a near hope to mount into a Throne after the death of their father, or who finde themselves too soon raised to it, ever to learn well the Art of raigning; be it their not being so happy as to be educated under the care of a Mother so vertuous and so affectionate as that great Queen, who hath so diligently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be instructed King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14 her son in all good Rules, and in all Maximes of Christian Policy; or so happy as to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a Minister so wise and so interested for their good, as that young Monarch hath found in the person of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The reasons of this are, that ordinarily
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29592:206"/>
those persons into whose hands they fall in their infancy, desiring to conserve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Authority and the Government, in stead of obliging or indeed constraining them to apply their spirits to things solid and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, act so cunningly, that they employ them onely in trifles unworthy of them, and amuse them with so much subtilty, that it is impossible that a young Prince can know it. In stead of laying incessantly before their eyes the true Grandeur of Kings, which consists in the exercise of their Authority, they feed them onely with appearances and images of that greatness, as are exteriour pomps and magnificences, wherein there is onely pride and vanity. In fine, in stead of instructing them diligently in what they ought to know, and in what they ought to do, (for all the knowledge of Kings ought to be reduced into practice) they keep them in a profound ignorance of all their Affairs, that they may always be Masters, and that they may never be able to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. From whence it happens that a Prince, though he be great, knowing his own weakness, judges himself incapable to govern; and from that moment wherein he is possessed with this opinion, he must needs renounce the conduct of his Estate, if that he have not indeed extraordinary natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral qualities, and a heart truly Royal. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, these persons would seize themselves of all Avenues, and hinder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onest men from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching those tender ears: or if they cannot
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:29592:207"/>
hinder their approaches, they are not wanting to render them suspected, or to deprive them of all belief in the spirit of these young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, making them pass with them either for their enemies, or people ill affected, or else for ridiculous or impertinent. Moreover, they have some Emissaries who infatuate them with flatteries, with excessive praises and adorations; who never let them know any thing but what shall be to their ends; who improve their defaults by continual complacences; who make them believe they have a perfect intelligence of all things, when they know nothing; who make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Royalty is onely a Soveraign Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that travel befits not a King, and that the functions of Royalty being laborious, are by consequence base and servile. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they soon disgust them with their own Command: they accustom them to have Masters, because they have yet neither so much knowledge nor so much courage as to be Masters. And thus these poor Princes, being not at all contradicted, but always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored; nor having any experience of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or ever suffered pain or necessity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come often presumptuous and absolute in their fancies, and believing their puissance to have Peerage with that of Gods: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to consider nothing but their passion, their pleasure and humour, as if Mankinde were created for them, whilst they were created wisely to order and govern Mankind;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29592:207"/>
who let profusion and waste be made of the life and goods of their subjects; and who with an unparallel'd insensibility, hearken no more to their Laments and Groans, then to the Lowings of a slaughtered Ox.</q>
               </p>

                  <q>If the reasons why they are so be sought,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it.</note> they are because they have been in a Post or place, where they have often heard truth: where they have understood what ignominy it is for a Prince not to enjoy his own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power, but to leave it to another: where though they have had some flatterers, they have likewise had open enemies, who by censuring their faults have induced a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: where they have heard blamed the faults of that Government under which they were, and have blamed them themselves; so that they are obliged to do better, and not
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29592:208"/>
to follow what they have condemned: where they have studied to govern themselves wisely, because they were dependants, and fearful of punishment: where they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard the complaints of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and seen the miseries of the people: in fine, where they have understood by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what evil is; and to have pity of those who suffer injustice, because they themselves have proved the rigour of a too high and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Government.

designe of which we have spoken, should be the branches. Then his war like valour, his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity, his constancy, his credit, his wisdome, his prudence, his activity, his vigilance, his oeconomy, his justice, and a hundred other virtues, should be the precious stones. Amongst which, that Paternal and Cordial love he had for his people, would cast a fire more lively and bright then the Carbuncle: The firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his courage, alwaies invincible in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, would bear the Price and Beauty of a Diamond: And his unparallel'd Clemency, which raised up those enemies he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, would appear like an Emerald, which sends forth enlivenings and joy into the eyes of all that behold it. To continue the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis;</hi> I will yet say, that so many wise Laws which he made for Justice, for Policy, and for his Revenues; so many good and useful Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments of all sorts of Manufactures, which produced to <hi>France</hi> the yearly profit of many Millions; so many proud buildings, as the Galleries of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the <hi>Pont-neuf,</hi> the <hi>Place Royal,</hi> the <hi>Colledge Royal,</hi> the Keys for Merchants of the River <hi>Seine, Fontain-bleau, Monceaux,</hi> St. <hi>Germain;</hi> so many publick works, Bridges, Causwaies, Highwaies repaired; so many Churches rebuilded in many places of the Realm, should be as the Ingravements and Imbellishments.</p>
               <p>Let us Crown then with a thousand prayses the immortal memory of that great King, the love of the <hi>French,</hi> and the terror of the

                  <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the Honour of his age, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Posterity: Let us make him live in our hearts and in our affections, in despite of the rage of those wicked persons deprived him of life: Let us shout forth as many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to his glory, as he hath done bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to <hi>France.</hi> He was a <hi>Hereules,</hi> who cut off the Head of the <hi>Hydra,</hi> by overturning the League. He was greater then <hi>Alexander,</hi> and greater then <hi>Pompey,</hi> because he was as Valiant; but he was more Just: he gained as many victories, but he gained more hearts. He conquered the <hi>Gaules,</hi> as well as <hi>Julius Caesar;</hi> but he conquered them to give them liberty, and <hi>Caesar</hi> subjugated them to enslave them. Let his Name then be raised above that of the <hi>Hercules,</hi> the <hi>Alexanders,</hi> the <hi>Pompeys,</hi> and the <hi>Gaesars:</hi> Let his Reign be the Model of good Kings, and his Examples the clear Lights to illuminate the eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes: Let his Posterity be Eternally Crowned with the Flowers <hi>de Lis:</hi> Let them be alwaies happy, alwaies Triumphant. And to compleat our wishes, let <hi>Lewis</hi> the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious his Grand-child, Resemble, or if it be possible, Surpass him.</p>
