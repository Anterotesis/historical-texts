            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Thomas Dangerfield's ANSVVER To a Certain SCANDALOUS PAPER, ENTITULED, <hi>The KINGS EVIDENCE Vindicated, as to the Imputation of PERJURY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIS now come to that paſs, that if a Man have a deſign either to play the Fool or the Knave, the way is ready chalk'd out for him; It is but pretending he has a Friend in the Countrey, which has a corn or ſcruple in his Conſcience that very much pains him, and then the buſie Caſuiſt betakes himſelf to his Pen, pretends an Anſwer to his pretended Friend, and ſo takes an occaſion to follow the ſteps of the worſt of men; who, but lately, hath under the ſame Notion ſcarce left a perſon, from his King to the meaneſt Subject, on whom he had not made ſome reflection or other. And theſe are the uſual ways which ſome men take to expoſe their Quack-ſalving Receits upon the Stage of the World.</p>
            <p>Some ſuch kind of <hi>Charletan</hi> is that nimble Critick, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>Vindicate the Kings Evidence, as to the Imputation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, in a Letter to a Friend.</hi> Such a Letter, which it may be eaſily believed, never ſaw the Poſt-houſe, or ever Lodg'd in Carriers Pouch: Such a Letter, that he who occaſion'd it, was an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> and he that Anſwer'd it, was a man of too mutable Genius, to make his Argument hold up to a <hi>Vindication;</hi> A piece of ſuch double-diligience, and of a tincture ſo agreeable to that of the <hi>Meal-Tub,</hi> as if Madam <hi>Cellier</hi> had ſham'd an <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> or two for the delay of her Tryal, only in expectation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s. Evidence more plauſibly redicul'd, for her ſecond delivery. How exorbitantly, and without fear or wit, the Evidence for the King has been hitherto openly attacked in baſe Scurrilous
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41540:2"/>
Pamphlets, and accus'd of Perjuries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the leaſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground, is well enough known; but becauſe all thoſe ſilly Aggreſſors fail'd, up ſtarts one of the Holy Catholick ſtamp, and at a—random-diſtance in his <hi>Party-per-pale</hi> habit, with a Py-bald Conſcience, thinks to ſtab their credit in that friendly diſguize of <hi>a Letter to a Friend.</hi> I am ſure, as to the Subject, no true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant could have pitch'd upon it, but for miſchiefs-ſake, and to ſome bad end (a thing which ſuch a perſon I hope would not be guilty of): And as for the perſon, he ſcorns your Vindication, but ſtrangely admires your confidence in pointing at him ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with your baſe Perjuries, as if your <hi>Hobgoblin-Title</hi> had only undertaken to Bugbear him alone from his Aſſertions of too near approaching Truth, becauſe ſo formidable to the Infernal Crew of your Catholick-party.</p>
            <p>But to deſcend from the Title to the purulent <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf, you ſhall find this ſame Quack-ſalving Operator provoking the ſick and weak conſcience of his tender friend and patient, to diſgorge the undigeſted uncleanlineſs of his ſurmiz'd ſcruples; that ſo, under the covert of diſſembl'd Proteſtantiſm, he might be the better enabled to revive the old wonted method of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Evaſions, Equivocations, Mental Reſervations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and envenom wounds of his own making, otherwiſe what can be the meaning of thoſe Repetitions of his pretended Friends words. <hi>You mention his Felonies and Perjuries; ſay you, if ſuch a Villain ſhould be credited,</hi> &amp;c. What are theſe but knavſh Inſinuations, to call the Kings Evidence Perjur'd, and Villains, under the pretence of a Vindication; but rather to beget a disbelief of his Teſtimony in the hearts of the people, to create jealouſies and fears, to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and amuſe the more ſage perſons; and in fine, it could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for no other end than diſ-unity and confuſion; by which officious kindneſs of his, he has endeavour'd to tax me with far greater Crimes, than ever Madam <hi>Cellier</hi> in the hight of all her ſpleen could invent: But it ſeems, that what that bold <hi>Virago,</hi> my open Enemy left undone, this ſame Tinker of Conſciences has undertaken, in the habit of a Friend to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>And that you may the better ſee how he goes on, undermining that Reputation which he pretends to Vindicate, he lays the ſoundation of his diſcourſe in theſe words; <hi>I ſay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that notwithſtanding all the Felonies and Perjuries you ſuggeſt that Mr.</hi> D. <hi>may have been guilty of; I aſſert, that his Evidence is as good as that of any Papiſt, that is a Traytor to a Proteſtant King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you ſee, while he ſeems to lick up the Vomit of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41540:2"/>
Friend, and ſwallow the filthineſs of his disburthened Conſcience, he ſtill reſerves the Venom under his Tongue; in fine, 'tis a meer Paper-Plot, to nip the buds of good opinion in the ſpring of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and blaſt the fruit which the ſafety of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> are expecting to gather from it; For do but conſider it, and you ſhall find the whole <hi>Conſcience Bolus,</hi> which this Empyrick of a Caſuiſt has preſcribed to his Patient in the Countrey, to be nothing elſe but a half-peny Queſtion confidently beg'd, falſe grounds, and fictitious ſurmizes, to make the world believe a thing that never was; a piece of ſmooth <hi>Leſtrangiſm,</hi> and Maſqueraded Knavery, to debauch the Juries of the Nation in point of my Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe why ſhould he ſuggeſt me to be guilty of <hi>Perjury,</hi> a Crime that among all my miſcarriages, was never yet laid to my charge? Certain it is, that even when I was a Papiſt and Conſpirator, it is well known, how tender I was of an Oath, before the Right Honourable, one of His Majeſties Secretaries of State, before whom I refuſed to Swear for the good of the Catholick Cauſe, what I knew to be falſe, though the whole ſtreſs of the Sham-Plot depended upon it; for which I was well aſſured of abſolution, and had the fair proſpect of a conſiderable Popiſh Fortune; upon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal I loſt my Warrant; and as the <hi>Great All-ſeeing God</hi> would have it, broke the neck of that hopeful (but Helliſh) deſign, which was laid againſt ſo many Innocents, by a timely diſcovery, to the Grand detriment of the whole Popiſh Cauſe.</p>
            <p>A man of integrity and honeſt principles, would have been ſure of ſome unqueſtionable inſtance, before he ſurmiz'd or ſuggeſted ſuch a Chimerical Scandal, and of ſuch conſequence againſt any perſon under worſe Circumſtances than Mr. <hi>D.</hi> And therefore they that look upon that perſon (whoever he be) to be a Friend and Vindicator of my ſelf, or any other of the Kings Evidence that have yet appeared, are moſt egregiouſly miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But for all this, <hi>I aſſert,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that his Evidence is as good as that of any Papiſts, that is a Traytor to a Proteſtant King.</hi> Now look ye Mr. <hi>Aſſertor,</hi> 'tis not a ſtraw matter what you <hi>Aſſert,</hi> ſince it is ſo little to the purpoſe; neither have you any thanks for that <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> until you can appear, and make it out more plain, than your villifying-pen has yet done; till which time, on the other ſide, they <hi>aſſert,</hi> That you are a diſſembler, a buſie-body, a man of loſt labour, and that which is worſe, my equivocating, flattering Friend. But, Sir, know you are quite beſides the Cuſhion, for it is now paſt the queſtion, Whether or no my Evidence be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41540:3"/>
but <hi>as good as that of any Papiſts,</hi> whoſe principles, as you ſay, and every body knows, are Equivocations, Mental Reſervations, Treaſons, Depoſing of Kings and Princes, together with all the moſt Enormous Crimes imaginable; but yet that which is ſtill worſe than all thoſe put together, <hi>Perjuries;</hi> a Sin, which even the greateſt Criminals (a Papiſt excepted) abhors; and will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe an ignominious death, than to live by a falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, to let you know how much my Evidence is beyond <hi>that of any Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Rebel-Traytor.</hi> Obſerve that I am <hi>Rectus in Curia, Legalis homo;</hi> ſo that unleſs you can prove me to have committed what you ſuggeſt (which is certain you never can), I boldly tell you, I think my ſelf a better Witneſs than either your ſelf, your friend, or e're a <hi>Papiſt</hi> breathing: For what have we to do with a ſort of people, whoſe principle it is, not to keep any Faith with Hereticks? or who would be in love with that Religion (if I may call it ſo) whoſe bond is Perjury, whoſe badg is Rebellion? therefore come out from amongſt them, be no longer a partaker in their moſt notorious Villanies, leſt you receive alſo of the Plagues which (undoubtedly) <hi>God</hi> has prepared for them.</p>
            <p>What a noiſe have we had with an officious Caſuiſt, who gives himſelf the trouble of raiſing a Queſtion, where there is no queſtion to be made; which does but create in us a real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that all his Reaſons thereupon urg'd, trite and common Stories, were only the pretence that gave him liberty to ſcribble. But his main deſign and drift was quite of another ſtrain; that is to ſay, to Invallidate my Teſtimony, by comparing it with that of <hi>Popiſh Traytors and Rebels;</hi> and by ſtarting a remote queſtion, and drawing falſe concluſions from bare ſurmizes, to give a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible opportunity to call one of the <hi>Kings</hi> Evidence <hi>Perjur'd Villain,</hi> as a Preparative for the great Tryals ſhortly at hand.</p>
            <p>Sir, you will do well to find ſome better employment for your uneaſie Conſcience, which is to apply your ſelf to the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of Kings and Kingdoms, for your ſpeedy Converſion. After which I could readily embrace you with that ſort of tenderneſs, as is becoming a reformed perſon and a good Chriſtian.</p>
