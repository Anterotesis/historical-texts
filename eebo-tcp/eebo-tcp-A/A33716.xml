            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore for your further ſatisfaction, that although we are farre aſunder, yet we may be thankfull, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, together for all the good that God hath done for his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I wrote to you heretofore at large, but the laſt week I writ onely to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Joh.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43938:3"/>
bid one of his men take it from his body, and perceiving a great head of haire, newly come from under the Barbers hands, bid his man to cut it off; which his man taking ayme, laid his ſword once or twice on his neck, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Mackmaghan</hi> ſuddenly roſe up, and deſired quarter: and that if they would ſpare his life, he would releaſe my Lord <hi>Blanys</hi> wife and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which he told them were his priſoners: ſo I hear now (but I beleeve it not) that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Blany</hi> and her children are come up to our Camp, and are to be in Town with our Armie this night. This <hi>Mackmagham</hi> titles himſelf Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Manahan;</hi> as Sir <hi>Pyealam O Neale</hi> doth title himſelf Earl of <hi>Tyrone.</hi> We underſtand that upon the getting in of the laſt ſhipping to <hi>Tredath,</hi> with proviſion for relieving of the Town, that the Rebels were ſo much diſcouraged at it, that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Relys</hi> Souldiers lying on this ſide of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath,</hi> ran moſt of them from him into the North, which Sir <hi>Henry Tichborne</hi> (Governour of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath</hi>) hearing of; went the bolder on Sir <hi>Phealum O Neale,</hi> and <hi>Mackmaghan</hi> on the other ſide, ſo that when he had put them away, the countrey people preſently brought him in ſtore of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all ſorts; The 11. preſent, the Earl of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> our Lieutenant Generall, went from <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi>

Towne, where all the Foot Company lay (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the bad weather they had) with 700 horſe unto <hi>Tredath,</hi> where my Lord <hi>Moore</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> made him and all his Company very welcome. Whiles my Lord was there, came in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen of the Countrey, and ſubmitted unto him, Maſter <hi>Barnwell</hi> of <hi>Kilbene,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervill,</hi> ſon and heire to my Lord Viſcount <hi>Newter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, Edward Dowdall</hi> of the Mountyne, that was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſter of the Chancery, who had changd his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and his alleageance upon a ſudden &amp; became Captaine of a Troope of Rebells; there came in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and ſubmitted at <hi>Tredath,</hi> and to my Lord in the Countrey, Maſter <hi>Garret Elmor</hi> and his two ſons, Maſter <hi>Talbut</hi> of <hi>Roberts</hi> Towne, and divers others, and are many of them brought and impriſoned in the Caſtle, every of them ſubmitting themſelves. The Earle of <hi>Fingully</hi> wrote a ſubmiſſive Letter to my Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and promiſed to come to my Lord and 100 more Gentlemen with him, but my Lord went to meet them, but they kept not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Whereupon our Souldiers our Horſemen rid thither to <hi>Killeene</hi> the Earle of <hi>Fingully</hi> and burnt it and all other places belonging to him whereſoever they came. And from <hi>Garretts</hi>-Towne our Armie removed to <hi>Baleoddry,</hi> and when they came thence they burnt it: and from thence they ſent out to my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43938:4"/>
Lord of <hi>Germenſtowne,</hi> but I heare not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Lord of <hi>Germenſtowne,</hi> nor my Lord <hi>Newtervill,</hi> but I heare their Horſes were left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any either men and much goods. I heare that they have onely ſpoyled the waſte houſes about thoſe Caſtles, but the Caſtles they have preſerved. And from <hi>Ballroddry</hi> they came yeſterday morning, purpoſing to come home neere the Sea ſide, &amp; they intended laſt night to lie about <hi>Sword,</hi> which is ſix miles from this place; and in their way to burne Colonell <hi>Luke Newtervils</hi> houſe; and comming by <hi>Malehide,</hi> Maſter <hi>Talbut</hi> of <hi>Malehide</hi> did ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. You may pleaſe to take notice, that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt place that our Footmen went was to <hi>Garretts</hi> Towne, Which is but thirteene miles from hence, and there they lay ſome dayes, becauſe of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the weather; but our Horſe did ſcowt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad further; and did much miſchiefe to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, by firing their Townes and houſes. But in all this time they have not had ſo much as the ſight of the enemy. In ſo much that I heare that my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> was reſolved once to follow them into the North as farre as the <hi>Newry,</hi> where their great Magazine, or ſtore lyes. I am perſwaded they have much money there. And I am afraid that the Army expected out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> will fall upon it and get all the booty. I heare that our Lord Iuſtices did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43938:4"/>
our Armie going thither, fearing the Enemy ſhould lie ſomewhere hereabout ſtronger then we are. Wee heare that Colonell <hi>Birne</hi> and Colonell <hi>More</hi> have left the Caſtle of <hi>Leaſtip,</hi> for moſt of their men fled from them upon the report that was amongſt them of the comming of our Armie thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have told their Souldiers, that they have three ſhippes loaden with Ammunition come in for them to <hi>Wexford,</hi> and they are gone to leavie more money on the Countrey to raiſe 1000. l or ſend for more Armes. I beleeve it is to put money in their Purſes, to get them out of the Kingdome, God grant that our ſhipping may meet with them. The paſſage betweene this and <hi>Tredath</hi> by Land is almoſt free for a ſingle man Arm'd to paſſe. Our Army have ſent three hundred of their men to <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath,</hi> and one battering Piece of Ordnance. Vpon our Armies return that is abroad under Command of the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Colonell <hi>Harcot,</hi> Lord <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Grinfield,</hi> thoſe which are here are to goe forth under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Command of Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> and Colonell <hi>Crayford;</hi> and it is thought they ſhall goe towards <hi>Leaſtip,</hi> and to <hi>Kilkock,</hi> and ſo downe to the Queenes Countrey. I thinke they may goe through the Kingdome without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for they have wounded their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and God their hearts, and they will never
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43938:5"/>
adventure the reſt of their bodies; for now they ſee their eſtates gone, they have not any thing elſe to preſerve. Wee heare that my Lord Preſident of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> hath joyned his Forces with Sir <hi>Charles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aviſer,</hi> and is gone out againſt my Lord <hi>Mountgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rett</hi> and his Armie; and that my Lord <hi>Muzgrave</hi> is not at all in Rebellion. Wee heare alſo that <hi>Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and the Fort there is ſafe on our ſide, and the Lord our God being alſo on our ſide, I truſt will ſend us peace, although the Enemy be yet very ſtrong. Some report that the Towne of <hi>Gallaway</hi> is not revolted. I truſt that God will ſo proſper us, that I ſhall by the next Poſt write you better newes. Wee heare that in the North our friends hold what is their owne, and in every Battle put the Rebells to flight. I truſt that the <hi>Scotts</hi> Armie will not now come over, if they be not alreadie come; for it will grieve our Souldiers to looſe their expected Bootie, for all the toyle they have had this Winter; yet we are beholding to them for their forwardneſſe to come over. Thus for preſent I humbly take leave, reſting ever.</p>
