            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THe humble requeſt of certain Chriſtians reproachfully called Anabaptiſts, who onely deſire to owne, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, profeſſe and maintain the pure truths of God in the hatred of all errours, as namely univerſall redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, free-will and falling away, with all other things contrary to wholſome doctrine, who are accuſed as factious movers of ſedition and rebellion, and the cauſe of theſe unnaturall warres, and of the difference betwixt His Majeſty and the Parliament, that ſeeing ſuch a common defamation is raiſed upon them, by reaſon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome profeſsing and owning ſome truths of God in outward profeſsion which they hold, being hypocrites, do walk very ſcandalouſly in the broaching and practiſing of damnable errours and hereſies, even denying the Lord that viſibly ſeemed to have bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift damnation, and many follow their pernicious wayes, by reaſon of whom the wayes of truth are evill ſpoken of, 2 Pet. 2. 1. 2. and indeed now this Scripture is fulfilled, whereby we, according to that which our Saviour Lord and Maſter ſaid, do undergo the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, revilings, and all manner of evill ſpeakings of many, which although it be a ſigne to us of our bleſſedneſſe, Matth. 5. 11. inaſmuch as they ſpeak it of us falſly for his name ſake, yet conſidering he ſaith, that they that kill us will think they do God ſervice, although indeed he ſaith withall, it is becauſe they have not known the Father nor himſelfe, John. 16. 2. 3. and ſeeing he hath a time to reveale himſelfe to his own, and hath promiſed that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God ſhall cover the earth as the waters cover the ſea, Eſa. 11. 9. and that all ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt, Jer. 31. 34. mark, it ſeems knowledge ſhall begin at the leaſt. And whereas we now ſee God ſtirring up the Magiſtrates to take part with his poore deſpiſed Saints againſt their antichriſtian great oppoſers, wherein he hath made them his ſword to lop off the heads of them already, which we acknowledge with all thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, firſt to God, and ſecondly to them, and are further incouraged to intreat them as they are juſt and godly, for Gods ſake to heare our cauſe, and do us juſtice, that if God be God, we may follow him altogether, then will wrath and ſtripes flee away, and peace, plenty and proſperity with true joy and gladneſſe will come in the roome thereof: for when our wayes pleaſe the Lord, he will make our enemies at peace with us, Prov. 16. 7. we therfore deſire all that feare God, that they that are the moſt affectionate Chriſtians would get the hands of all in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh that feare God, who may be many more then they expect, for there were ſeven thouſand that had not bowed to Baal, 1 King. 19. 18. when Eliah thought he had beene left alone: therefore go to all in your Pariſhes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their hands to ſo reaſonable a requeſt as this, namely, that inaſmuch as there are ſuch accuſations againſt us as aforeſaid, that the Parliament would be favourably pleaſed for the glory of God and the clearing of his truths, and the farther ſhining forth of Jeſus Chriſt in his glorious Goſpell to his people, to call us before them, and alſo of the Doctors of the Synod as many as they pleaſe, and proclaime that all the accuſers of what we hold contrary to the truth of God, may here accuſe us; and if thoſe Doctors can prove their Miniſtery, Baptiſme or Sabboth to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, or owned by Chriſt, or any thing we hold to be contrary to godlineſſe, then we will thankfully be reduced to the truth, and repent and revoke our errour, and ſuffer for our preſumption, but if it ſhall be made evident, that neither their Miniſtery, Baptiſme nor Sabboth be commanded of God, although it be a light but very new ſprung forth to bring us out of ignorance, whereout when it pleaſed not God to give us the means to ſee and come forth, the time of that ignorance God regarded not, but now will command all his people every where to repent, and walk after the light, and give them repentance for his glory, and their eternall comfort. Even ſo come Lord Jeſus. Thus intreating all that feare God, as they pitty poore ſoules, that deſire to be reduced from all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to all truths, and be confirmed and ſetled therein, to get in their ſeverall Pariſhes as man y hands as they can to a Petition to the Parliament for this ſo reaſonable a deſire, the which Petition you ſhall have at M. Barbers in Thredneedle-Street at the horſe-ſhoe, from Thomas Nutt, one for every Pariſh.</p>
