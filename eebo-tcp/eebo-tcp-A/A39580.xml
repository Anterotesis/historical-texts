         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>All theſe poſtures and motions both of
Musketteers and Pikemen in a body or
Battalia great or ſmall, may be performed
without words, by ſignes of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the beating of the Drumme, the
Drummer obſerving every motion from
the Commander.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the motions of Facing,
Doubling, Countermarching, Wheeling,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101681:12"/>
and ſuch like, in a groſe body or Battalia.</p>
               <p>Note and remember well that there are
ſeveral ſorts of diſtances to bee obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

for ſeverall uſes, upon variety of occaſions:
for Marching, for Exerciſing, for Skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for battaile, in front, in flanke, in rear,
which every Commander doth, or ought to

               <p>Now to begin wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Open order ſixe foot ſquare: that is,
ſix foot, file from file, and ſix foot, ranke
from ranke, which is the firſt diſtance that
a Company is framed unto, eſpecially for
exerciſe. Next there is order, three foot
ſquare both in file and ranke, for exerciſe,
or for battaile. Thirdly, there is cloſeſt, or
cloſe order, which is one foot and an halfe,
file from file, and is only uſed for the
Pikes when they come to the puſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There
is likewiſe a double diſtance, twelve foot
ſquare, either in file or ranke, and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
double diſtance, twenty foure foot,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101681:13"/>
which two laſt are practiſed, ſometimes
upon extraordinary occaſions. There is
likewiſe a marching order, three foot file
from file, and ſixe foot ranke from ranke, or
to oppoſe an enemy onely in front, and an
open order, ſixe foot file from file: twelve
foot ranke from ranke, which I leave to the
diſcretion of the Commander.</p>
               <p>Now to make ſome uſe of part of theſe,
I will onely at this time ſet down the plain
and true words of command, with ſome
few remembrances joyned to them wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Officers which yet faile in the right
delivering of the words of command, to
obſerve and follow theſe directions: for if
a Commander ſpeake them not right, as the
Proverbe is, ſetting the cart before the
horſe, the ſouldiers although skilfull, doth
act them many times wrong.</p>
               <p>The company being come to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
place, neither yet in file nor ranke,
the Commander gives the word as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Leaders, leade forth your Files, joyne
them into a body, or frame a body.</p>
               <p>Note that a file is a number or ſequence
of men ſtanding one behinde another at a
certaine diſtance, as you may reade after
more at large, being tenne deepe, as moſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101681:13"/>
nations have in uſe: yet they may be eight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or ſixe, or fewer, or more, as the occaſion
offereth. But before wee frame our body or
battalia,</p>
               <p>Let all Souldiers obſerve, but eſpecially
all Officers, how a body or battalia is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
or named in each ſeverall part as
followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there are files and ranks, theſe
files &amp; rankes annexed or united together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
make a body or Battalia.</p>
               <p>A file is a ſequence of men ſtanding one
behinde another, at a certaine diſtance,
whoſe faces are directly placed one way,
the backe of the former, to the face of the
follower: ſubſiſting commonly of tenne in
depth, according to the moderne uſe of the
Netherlands, but may be brought to more
or fewer as I have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>This file is diſtinguiſhed into a Leader,
a bringer up, and two middle men, with
ſixe other betweene. The firſt man of the
file is called the Leader, the laſt man a
bringer up; the two that are in the middle
of the file, are called by the name of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
men, which are the leaders of the halfe
files, when they are to double on the other,
and for other uſes.</p>

               <p>The left flanke, are the halfe Rankes on

               <p>The right and left wings are the deviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Now followeth the giving fire in

               <p>There are three ſeverarall wayes to give
fire in Flanke, the body marching: the firſt
is:</p>
               <p>The body, or Batalia marching by a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſide, or Moras, or Wood, or in plaine
Champaine ground, either aſſaulted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with horſemen, or with foot, if it be
on both the Flanks at once. Then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
File on each hand, that is on both the
Flanks make readie; the Commander gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the word, To the right, and left pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
then the outmoſt File on each hand
turnes at 3. motions to the hand command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and preſents, giving fire, ſtands faſt,
onely turning their faces as they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Front, untill ſuch time as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
File, who marched along with the
Body, hath given fire, in the ſame forme as
the firſt did. Then the firſt File marcheth
up even with the ſecond, both ſtanding faſt,
till the third File hath given fire, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
all the reſt one after another. A
Serjeant muſt ſtand at the head of thoſe
files that have given fire: or if the diviſion
be great, a ſuperior Officer takes that
place, gathering up again that whole wing
joyning them in equal front with the pikes</p>

and thirteen other, written by skilfull
and painfull Gentlemen Souldiers, as I
have ſet downe in my Preface.</p>
               <p>If I had appointed me any command,
with the horſe-troops as I have with the
foot-companies, I ſhould likewiſe ſet
downe ſome obſervations concerning the
exerciſing and imbattailing of them. But
for this, and ſome other reaſons at this time
I omit. Only remembring the Officers of

to be, to obſerve the forme and manner of
the exerciſing of the Foot-Companies
which will in ſome meaſure teach them
their duties. For in the exerciſing of Horſe
and Foot, there is not much difference.</p>
               <p>Before I paſſe any further, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

concerning his place and duty, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Enſigne or Colours, is the honour
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101681:34"/>
and reputation of the Captaine and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
therefore the Enſigne-bearer ought
not onely to be a good ſoldier, bould and
valiant, but likewiſe diſcreet and wiſe in
counſel, and in the abſence of the Captaine
and Livetenant, have the ſame authority
the Captaine hath.</p>
               <p>Where the company is appointed to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together, he ought to be one of the
firſt, and to be carefull of his Colours: and
at all times ſee that they be well guarded,
and be ready to do any thing to further the
ſervice.</p>
               <p>Within theſe few yeares, a Supreame
Commander in ſetting downe the duty of
each Officer in his place, ſpeaketh of the
Enſigne theſe words following.</p>
               <p>The Enſigne ſhall never turne his face
out of his order, ſtart from any danger, nor
forſake his Enſigne, upon paine of death.</p>
               <p>In a march, he may beare his Colours
flying, reſted upon his ſhoulder, before the
head of the Pikes. And being in a batalia, his
Colours ſomtimes advanced and breaſted,
flying, in the midſt of the Pikes, between
the halfe Files.</p>
               <p>In a troope, the Colours furld, or rold
up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:101681:34"/>
In preſence of the Generall, or ſupreme
Commander, hee muſt beare his Colours
flying, and paſſing by him, vaile them, the
point even with his knee, once and no
more for that time, without any other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
               <p>But if he paſſe by the King or Prince, he
ſhall likewiſe withall, bow ſomewhat one
of his knees.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers ought not to forſake or
leave their Colours, before they be lodged,
and then with leave of the Captaine, may
depart.</p>
