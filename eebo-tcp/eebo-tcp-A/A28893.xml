         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ANSWER
TO
Doctor Good
(So called) &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Tho. Good,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FRiend, Thou haſt dialogued againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them odious to the VVorld; but our Innocency
who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> will clear us of the Reproach
thou caſteſt upon us, who wouldſt inſinuate, that to become a
<hi>Quaker</hi> is the ready VVay to become a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> ſayſt
thou in the Beginning of thy Dialogue againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> with
<hi>Firmianus,</hi> ſay'ſt thou, <hi>You have informed me in
our laſt Diſcourſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 90. of thy Book.</note> 
               <hi>that being ſometime a</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<hi>you had a ready Way open to become a</hi> Papiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What Ground or Reaſon gives <hi>Firmianus</hi> to ſay ſo?
We find no Reaſon <hi>Firmianus</hi> gives for ſo ſaying; a poor and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Buſineſs may we ſay it is, to ſay, <hi>To be a</hi> Quaker <hi>is a ready
Way to become a</hi> Papiſt, and to ſhew no better Reaſon for thy ſo
ſaying, then thou haſt done in thy Dialogue; ſurely the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
and thee are very wide in your Opinions herein; ſurely, we
believe, if it ſhould come to the Tryal between thee and us, it
will be found that thou art more one with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in thy Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
then the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and therefore it will appear, that the
Way thou art in is a more ready Way to become a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> then
to be in the Way thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> are in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44713:3"/>
Further, in thy <hi>Dubitantius,</hi> where thou anſwereſt thy <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus,</hi>
thou haſt many ſcornful and diſdainful Expreſſions, not
becoming a grave Man, or a Man of Gravity, which ſome have
taken thee to be; and ſo ſheweſt thy ſelf to be ſitting in the Seat
of the Scorner; <hi>But bleſſed is the Man that walketh not in the
Counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, nor ſtandeth in the Way of Sinners, nor
ſitteth in the Seat of the Scornful, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And if thou wouldſt be bleſſed, thou muſt come forth out of the
Seat of the Scorner, and fear the Lord God, and not be as ſuch
who open their Mouthes in Blaſphemy againſt Heaven, and them
that dwell therein; I judge I need not mention thy ſcornful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
nor ſay more in Anſwer to them in this Place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know, that People who fear God, and are acquainted
with our Principles, and know our Converſations, will judge
that thou haſt Dialogued thus againſt us without a juſt Cauſe, for
which I ſay, the Lord rebuke thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further, ſayes</hi> Firmianus, How could you be deceived by ſuch
painted Sepulchres? What could you ſee more in them, then what
was conſpicuous in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old? Take it for
and Infallible Rule, that whoſoever hold or practiſe any Thing which
is contrary to the Law of Nature, good Manners, expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages of all ſober and civil People in the World, are ſo
far from being True <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they are not worthy the Name
of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is a high Charge againſt us, which if <hi>Firmia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
or <hi>Tho. Good</hi> could prove, according to what he hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon us, then ſhould we be much to blame: But what if
his Charge in every Particular be falſe herein? ſurely, then it
will follow, that <hi>Tho. Good</hi> doth much deſerve to be blamed for
uſing his Pen thus againſt the Innocent; and indeed I muſt tell
<hi>Tho. Good,</hi> that he hath falſly accuſed us herein, for comparing
us with ſuch whom Chriſt compared unto painted Sepulchres,
he cannot make good his Charge againſt us therein, but ought
to take it home to himſelf, he being more like theſe, and more
one with them then we, whom Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the
World, cryed Wo againſt; for whereas he chargeth us for
holding and practiſing Things contrary to the Law of Nature,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44713:3"/>
good Manners, expreſs Scripture, the Uſages of all ſober and
civil People in the World, I ſay, theſe are falſe Accuſations,
and he himſelf by the Scriptures may be prov'd guilty of all thoſe
Accuſations he falſly chargeth upon us; and therefore let <hi>T. G.</hi>
in Time to come have a Care, and be wiſer, then to go about
ſuch a bad Work as this is, wherein he hath groſly ſlandered,
and falſly accuſed the Innocent, and be humbled before the
Lord, and repent of the Evil he hath committed herein; and
for the Satisfaction of ſuch as are ſober-minded, let them read
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and ſee who it is that is contrary to Chriſt Jeſus, and
Breakers of the Law of God, our Accuſer or us, and who is
contrary to the Scriptures, and read <hi>John</hi> 5. 41, 42, 43, 44. &amp;c.
And let the Witneſs of God in People, unto which we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our ſelves, judge between our Accuſer and us, for that
will judge righteouſly, and not according to that which is right
in Appearance, but is indeed contrary to what it doth appear to
be: And whereas thou ſpeakeſt of peruſing Prieſt <hi>Danſon</hi>'s
Book, <hi>Danſon</hi>'s Book is anſwered, and all his Lyes thrown back
upon his Head, as thou may'ſt ſee in the Anſwer, and thy <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue</hi>
is rather a Forgery, which thou and it are ſtuft with Lyes,
which come from the Father of them, and not from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſay'ſt,</hi> That they affirm that there are not three Perſons
in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deſire thee to ſhew us Chapter and Verſe for theſe
Words, and let us ſee whether thou walkeſt according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in theſe Words, and in theſe Terms; and ſee whether thou
haſt not preſumed above what was written.</p>
            <p>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, and
the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, theſe three are one; <hi>and this we
own in Scripture-Language, according to</hi> John'<hi>s Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſay'ſt that we ſay,</hi> That Chriſt did not make Satisfaction
for the Sins of Men.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>This is another lying Forgery; for by one Offering
he hath perfected forever them that are ſanctified; and</hi> we are
not redeemed with corruptible Things, but with the Blood of Jeſus
Chriſt, as of a Lamb without Spot; and we have an Advocate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44713:4"/>
with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
for our Sins, and not for our Sins only, but for the Sins
of the whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thou ſay'ſt that we ſay,</hi> That Juſtification is not by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Righteouſneſs, and good Works are the Cauſe of our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are more Lyes again, and thou abuſeſt Peoples
Minds, and the Preſs with them; for Chriſt Jeſus is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and Sanctification, and Redemption; God hath
made him ſo, and we are juſtified freely by his Grace, through
the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore <hi>By the
Works of the Law there is no Fleſh juſtified,</hi> Rom. 3. 23. We
are juſtified by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, which the Work of Faith,
which works by Love, is not denyed by the Apoſtle nor us, if
thou denyeſt that, thy Faith is dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further, thou ſay'ſt that we ſay,</hi> That a State of Perfection
and Freedom from Sin is attainable in this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do we err in holding that a State of Perfection and
Freedom from Sin is attainable in this Life? Did not God ſay to
<hi>Abraham, I am Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</hi>
Gen. 17. 1. And did not Chriſt ſay in his Sermon in the
Mount, <hi>Be you therefore Perfect as your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is perfect?</hi> And art thou of that Faith and Belief, that God
and Chriſt doth command us to do that which we cannot by his
Help and Aſſiſtance do? 'Tis true, we cannot keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Chriſt of our ſelves, but by his Aſſiſtance we are able
to do the ſame, elſe why did the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>I can do all Things
through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me?</hi> And did not the Saints
know a Freedom from Sin in this Life? Friend, I tell thee, if
thou ſay'ſt, a Freedom from Sin is not attainable in this Life,
thou muſt deny the Scriptures of Truth, and give the Apoſtle
the Lye; for doth not the Apoſtle ſay to the <hi>Romans, But now
being made free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ye have
your Fruit unto Holineſs, and the End Everlaſting Life,</hi> Rom.
6. 22. And doth not the Apoſtle ſay concerning himſelf, <hi>For
the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free
from the Law of Sin and Death?</hi> Therefore ſtop thy Mouth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44713:4"/>
for Shame from ſpeaking of thoſe Things which thou ought'ſt
not, and thy Pen from ſo writing concerning us; certainly, God
will judge thee for thy Lyes and Slanders againſt us: Thou
ſay'ſt, <hi>That our Poſitions are contrary to the ſacred Scriptures;</hi>
but by this thy Evil Work it appeareth, that thou art contrary
to the Scriptures, and not we, who haſt manifeſted thy Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of what the Scriptures ſay, and haſt appeared contrary
to what thy ſelf haſt learned in thy young Dayes, and ſince (for
ought that I know to the contrary) haſt cauſed others to learn, <hi>viz.
That when thou cameſt to Age, thou wouldſt, according to what
was promiſed and vowed in thy ſtead by thy God-fathers and God-mothers
in thy Baptiſm</hi> (ſo called) <hi>forſake the Devil and all his
Works:</hi> And if thou haſt not learned thus, not cauſed any thus
to learn, I am ſure that I, and many more, were cauſed thus to
learn in our youthful Dayes: I believe however, thou own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thy ſelf a Member of that Church that teacheth thus to ſay,
though not to do; and ſo thou may'ſt be a Sayer of the Word,
but not a Doer of it; but now thou art neither Sayer nor Doer,
and ſo in that Eſtate can'ſt not be juſtified of God; for as thou
haſt doubtleſs read in the Scriptures, <hi>It is not the Sayers of the
Word that are juſtified, but the Doers of it:</hi> Now he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
the Devil and all his Works, he muſt ceaſe from all Sin, and
abſtain from every Appearance of Evil; for all Sin is of the
Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again we ſay, ſay'ſt thou,</hi> That there is a Light in every Man
ſufficient to guide him to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Is it an Errorth us to hold, ſeeing</hi> John <hi>ſaith (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt)</hi> That is the true Light which lighteth every Man
that cometh into the World? And hath not God given his Son,
Chriſt Jeſus for a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he might be his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
unto the Ends of the Earth? <hi>And doth not the Apoſtle

26. &amp; 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Conſider of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and then tell us whether it be any Error to hold that there

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44713:5"/>
or to hold the contrary, and ſo whether it is not thou that errſt
from Scripture, and the true and right Way of the Lord, and

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again ſay'ſt thou,</hi> We hold that the Scripture is not the Word
of God, or a ſtanding Rule of Faith and Manners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We own the Scriptures to be what they ſpeak of

the Goſpel, &amp;c. But the Word is God, if <hi>John</hi> wrote the
Truth, which we believe he did, as thou may'ſt ſee, <hi>John.</hi> 1. 1.
And I hope thou wilt not preſume to ſay to the contrary; but
we own the Scriptures, that which Holy Men ſpake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to be the Words of God, and that
which was the Saints Rule we own to be our Rule, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
teſtifie thereof; ſee <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. &amp;c. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12.
But thou manifeſts thy ſelf to be contrary to the Rule both of
Scripture and Spirit, that does by thy Neighbours and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as thou would'ſt not be done by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again thou ſay'ſt,</hi> That we hold that there is no Reſurrection
of the Dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do own the Reſurrection of the Dead according

30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. &amp;c. So I ſay, we own
the Reſurrection of the Dead, according to the Scriptures;
and if thou hold'ſt it otherwiſe, it is thou that erreſt therein,
and not we.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again thou ſay'ſt,</hi> We hold there is no need of Ordinances, as
Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We own that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> that's according to the Scriptures,
but not that which is contrary to them, which is according to the
Traditions and Inventions of Men; and the Supper of the Lord
we own, according to the Scriptures, though not ſuch a Supper
which ſome take before Dinner, and call it the Lord's Supper:
So be humbled before the Lord, and repent of the Wrong thou

               <hi>Again, we hold, ſay'ſt thou,</hi> That 'tis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful to take an Oath

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is it an Error in us to keep the Commandment of

12. Friend, was it not commanded by Chriſt and his Apoſtle,
that we ſhould not ſwear at all, no, not by any Oath? And
what muſt we err for doing according to Chriſt's Commands
herein? Oh ſad! that one who taketh upon him to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

Friend, repent of thoſe Things, and do ſo no more, that theſe

            <p>
               <hi>And whereas thou ſay'ſt in thy</hi> Dubitantius, I know theſe and
many more to be the Poſitions of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and that they are
directly contrary to the ſacred Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>Thou knoweſt theſe P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and many more of ours, are directly contrary to the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
I ſay, thou haſt belyed us herein; for the Scriptures make
for us in theſe Poſitions which we own to be ours, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee before; and wherein thou haſt ſaid we hold that we do not
hold, thy Lyes are thrown back upon thy ſelf, and I doubt not
but God will rebuke thy lying Tongue, for thy ſlandering of
us, and turn the Miſchief thou would'ſt bring upon us thereby
upon thy own Pate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas thou ſay'ſt in thy</hi> Firmianus, Theſe Things are
ſo clearly confuted by the Word of God <hi>(by which I ſuppoſe thou
meaneſt the Scriptures)</hi> and Tradition of the Catholick
Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt ſaid ſo, but thou haſt not brought one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to confute us in thoſe Poſitions we own to be ours, and ſo
haſt accuſed us without a Proof, which will not ſerve thy Turn,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44713:6"/>
for the carrying on of thy envious Work againſt us, with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Underſtanding, but the rather thy Folly, and Ignorance
and Madneſs is the more made manifeſt to ſuch as are honeſtly
minded, and are willing to try, and to prove all Things, and to
hold faſt that which is good: And therefore ceaſe from thy
Work in this, and in Things of this Nature; for by thy Strength
thou muſt not, nor ſhalt not be able to prevail againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Truth is for us, which is ſtronger, and of more Might
then any Thing beſide it, and takes our Parts againſt thee herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas thou ſay'ſt,</hi> Our Practices are extreamly oppoſite
to all good Manners, and the Civilities of all Nations, which are
not groſly barbarous, as well as the Holy Scriptures; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you have obſerved their Carriages to be very demure, auſtere,
and that they are of a ſad Countenance; 'tis no more then our
Bleſſed Saviour reproved in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> long

            </p>
            <p>

let us know if thou art able to do it, wherein our Practices are
contrary to the bleſſed Truth; and if our Practices are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Truth, but agreeable therewith, as ſurely
I may ſafely ſay they are; then wherein can they be ſaid to be
oppoſite to all good Manners, and the Civilities of all Nations?
Friend, I can ſay, and the Witneſs of God in my Conſcience
juſtifies me herein, thou art one of thoſe that calls Good Evil,
and Evil Good, and ſo art not led by that good Spirit that the
Holy Apoſtle and Servant of Chriſt was led by, who ſaid, <hi>As
Obedient Children, not faſhioning your ſelves according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Luſts in your Ignorance,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 14. So thou who ar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ignorant of the Light of Chriſt, and of the right Way of the
Lord, may'ſt call that good Manners and Civility, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Faſhions <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f this World, which paſs away; but
that which the good Spirit of God doth lead into, is contrary
to that which thou may'ſt account good Manners and Civility;
But thou and ſuch as thee art, are nearer in Nature to the groſly
barbarous then we are, as this thy Work manifeſteth; for I am
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44713:6"/>
of the Mind, thou art not of ſo meek a Spirit as to bear with
any Man or Woman that cannot put off their Hats and bow to
thee for Conſcience ſake, though what they do herein doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and agree with the Scriptures; and ſo we are not contrary
to the Scriptures, but according to them; for <hi>Mordecai</hi> who
was a good Man, could not bow to <hi>Haman,</hi> as thou may'ſt ſee
<hi>Eſter</hi> 3. 1, 2. For which Cauſe <hi>Haman</hi> was full of Wrath, as
ſee <hi>Eſter</hi> 3. 3, 5. So thou who art angry with any that cannot
for Conſcience ſake put off their Hats, and bow to thee (I ſpeak
not of ſuch as thus do in Contempt to any Man's Perſon, but for
Conſcience-ſake towards God) art like <hi>Haman</hi> herein, and not
like <hi>Mordecai,</hi> whom God was with, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further ſay'ſt thou of us,</hi> That we are very demure, auſtere,
and of a ſad Countenance; whereas a ſad ſour Face, a hanging
down Look too much reſemble <hi>Cain</hi>'s Mark, and is a very probable
Sign of a diſquieted, diſcontented, guilty, troubled, if not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious
Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou judgeſt of us according to thy own Thoughts:
But Friend, tho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhould'ſt not judge of us according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Appearance in thy prejudiced Mind; but judge Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
of us, and if thou wouldſt ſo judge, then thou muſt judge
nothing before the Time: 'Tis probable that thou may'ſt
judge us to be of a malitious Mind, becauſe we cannot appear
as one with People in their Folly, in being jolly and merry with
them, out of the Fear of the Lord, which is becauſe we know
ſuch Things are contrary to Godlineſs, and that whereby his good
Spirit is grieved, and by which he is provoaked to Anger daily;
the Conſideration of thoſe Things makes us ſad many Times, and
we cannot avoid it well many Times) but muſt by our Words
and Carriages ſhew our Diſl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke thereof, becauſe we well know
that People by ſuch Things do provoak the Holy God againſt
their own Souls, who hath long born with their Evil Manners
herein, and ſtriven with them by his good Spirit, to reclaim
them therefrom; but his long Suffering will ſoon come to an
End with ſuch, and his good Spirit will ceaſe to ſtrive with them;
therefore let ſuch repent and amend their VVaves and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
before it be too late; but thou ſheweſt thy ſelf to be one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44713:7"/>
with them, which thought it ſtrange of the Saints formerly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they could not run with them into the ſame Exceſs of Riot
which they run into, as ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. And though thou ſay'ſt
of us, that in this or in ſuch Things before-mentioned of us, it
too much reſembles <hi>Cain</hi>'s Mark; I ſay, <hi>Cain</hi>'s Mark may eaſier
be ſeen in thee, who haſt wrote ſo malitiouſly againſt us, as thou
haſt; let the VVitneſs of God in thy Conſcience teſtifie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou haſt not wrote thus againſt us out of Malice, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou haſt not done it out of the Enmity in thee unto that
which is good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again ſayes</hi> Firmianus, This Practice of theirs is againſt the
very Light of Nature, as well as plain Scripture, a meer levelling
Device of their Seducers (the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits)</hi> to make
a Confuſion amongſt us, to deſtroy all Government, to take away
all Honour and Reſpect which is due to our Superiours; for what
Honour or Reverence has that Man in his Heart towards them,
who will expreſs none in his Words or Geſtures, according to the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> VVhat is that Practice of ours that is againſt the very
Light of Nature, as well as plain Scripture, which thou calleſt
a meer levelling Device of our Seducers (the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> and
<hi>Jeſuits?)</hi> &amp;c. Is it in not reſpecting Per<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons in that Way
which the VVorld doth, with Cap and Knee? Is this the Reſpect
thou lookeſt for from us? Haſt thou learned Chriſt no better
then ſo? Did not Chriſt reprove ſuch as lov'd Greetings in the
Markets, and to be called of Men <hi>Rabby, Rabby?</hi> And did
not Chriſt ſay to the <hi>Jews, I receive not Honour from Men;</hi> and
<hi>how can ye believe which receive Honour one of another, and
ſeek not the Honour which cometh from God only?</hi> See Mat. 23.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. and <hi>John</hi> 5. 41. &amp; 44. Is this contrary
to the very Light of Nature? then may'ſt thou ſay, Chriſt's
Doings were contrary to the very Light of Nature; thou may'ſt
with Shame enough give over thus abuſing the Scriptures and
us, who doſt not know that which thou calleſt the very Light of
Nature, nor the Scriptures to guide thee, nor to ſay as thou
doſt herein, but the contrary: So it is thee that art contrary
to the very Light of Nature and the Scriptures, and not we:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44713:7"/>
Therefore thou falſe Accuſer, Repent of thy falſe Accuſations
againſt us herein. And as for the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi>
whom thou falſly ſay'ſt, have ſeduced us herein; I ſay, thou
belyeſt them in theſe Things, who are one with thee in thoſe
Things thou practiſeſt, more then one with us in what we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe;
and ſo 'tis more probable that thee, and ſuch as thou art
are ſeduced by them, becauſe your Practices do better acccord
and agree with the Practice of the <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
then ours do, and ſo both denyed by us. And what is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thou would'ſt be honoured withall, <hi>viz.</hi> with putting off
the Hat, and bowing the Knee to thee? Can Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
be ſhewn no other VVay, but by this VVay? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
one Man may have a good Eſteem of another in his Heart,
and yet not ſhew it by ſuch Geſtures as theſe, elſe why doth the
Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Honour all Men in the Lord?</hi> So People may
have a good Eſteem of each other in their Hearts, without
ſhewing it by ſuch Geſtures, as thou would'ſt have them to ſhew
it by: 'Tis poſſible one Man may bow to another, and ſay to
him, <hi>Your humble Servant Sir,</hi> as if he were ready and willing
to do him Good, and yet for all that would, if he had an Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
for it, do him an Injury; what, are theſe the laudable
Cuſtoms thou would'ſt have us do and practiſe? Friend, what
by the Light of the Lord we are led unto in theſe Things, we
can do; but that which is contrary to his Holy Light we may
not do, leſt we make our ſelves Tranſgreſſors againſt him
thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, Thou ſayeſt in thy</hi> Dubitantius, Truly I have often
admired at the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivil Behaviour of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in ſaying
[THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> and THEE] to their Betters, in not Bowing, the

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> moſt proper to ſpeak to One

when I ſpeak but to One, I ſpeak Contrary to the Truth, ſeeing
<hi>You</hi> ſignifies more then One, or Many, is it not according to the
Scriptures to ſay <hi>Thou</hi> to One, when one ſpeaks but to One?
Was it not the Language of Almighty God to <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44713:8"/>
And did not <hi>Adam</hi> ſay <hi>Thou</hi> to God again? ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
9. 12. And frequently in the Scriptures <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> we

bluſh for Shame, for ſo ſaying: And now tell us, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Sccriptures, Thee or Us? ſpeak the Truth herein.
And wherein may one Man be ſaid to be Better then another,
except it be in his being more Honeſt and Juſt then another,
and ſo in being more in the Truth then another is? 'Tis not
becauſe <hi>one man is better by Blood then another,</hi> ſeeing <hi>God made

committeſt Sin; who art contrary to Chriſt, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

but now thou art of a Prejudiced Spirit, and Evil-minded againſt

that none of us now are in a Neceſſatous Condition: If God
Almighty hath added to our Outward Subſtance, ſo that many
of us, who before we owned that Holy and Bleſſed Truth,
poſſeſſed by thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which thee and many more
do not, though you profeſs the ſame Truth, have more of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſubſtance then before, why ſhouldſt thou be troubled at
that, ſo as to judge, <hi>it is obtained by us by Extream Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
The <hi>Proverb</hi> is, <hi>Ill-will will not ſpeak well:</hi> So thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill-minded towards us, takeſt things the wrong way, and
wouldſt inſinuate thy <hi>evil ſuggeſtions</hi> into others, that they might
be like-minded with thee therein. And if Care be taken by us,
<hi>that none that are truly of us, are in a Neceſſatous Condition,</hi>
doſt thou judge amiſs of us therefore? If thy <hi>Religion</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
otherwiſe, <hi>I deſire not to be of it,</hi> becauſe it cannot be a
good Religion; ſo not according to the Apoſtle's Religion, who
ſaid, <hi>Do Good unto all, but eſpecially unto the Houſhould of Faith:</hi>
And whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>Being maintained, as it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
being maintained by their new Maſters, the</hi> Jeſuites, &amp;c.
I ſay, if there be ſuch a Society, they may tell thee, as well as
we, thou hadſt not juſt Cauſe to ſay that that was every probable,
they being unknown to us, and we to them: And art not thee
a Poſſeſſor of their Tythes and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Pence? Doth not that

            <p>
               <hi>Again, Whereas thou ſay'ſt,</hi> As for their Humility and Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
'tis evident they ſhew no ſuch Virtues in their Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their betters; their Contempt of Gold Rings, Silver Lace

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What are thoſe Carriages of ours towards any that

one towards another in many things, have a better Opinion of

knows, that it is otherwiſe with us then thou judgeſt of us;
who will plead our Cauſe with thee, who ſmiteſt at us without

               <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, Friend, conſider what Spirit thou

art of, who ſmiteſt at us for doing according to the Apoſtle's
Exhortation herein: And who walketh moſt according to the
Truth, We, <hi>who are Conformable to God herein,</hi> or Thou, <hi>who
ſeekeſt Occaſion againſt us therefore?</hi> What any People may
do as to things which are good in themſelves, and ought to be
done, they doing them in Imitation only, that they may be
reckoned Humble and Lowly-minded, and not in Obedience to
God is one thing; but what is done for the Lord's ſake, in true
Obedience to him, is another thing: ſo there ought to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
made between ſuch, in things which the Bleſſed and
Holy Truth leadeth them to do, where it is kept to; and ſuch
as do like things, yet not ſo led thereunto: And though
things may be done by ſome by Imitation only, which are
good in themſelves, yet ought and may the ſame things be done
by others by the Leadings of the Spirit of Truth; and where
it is ſo, ſuch things are rightly accounted the Fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and ſuch are reckoned by Chriſt as the <hi>Good Tree, which
brings forth Good Fruit:</hi> ſo, by what the Tree brings forth, it
may be known, whether the Tree be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil:</hi> ſo, who do
things by the Leadings of God's Spirit, thoſe things are the
Fruits of that Good Spirit, and are ſo owned by this Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
though not owned by it where the like things are done In
Imitation only, that they may ſeem to men that which in the
Sight of the Holy God they are not. Therefore, Friend,
have a care of Smiting againſt ſuch as are Conſcientious to God
in what they do, leſt thou condemneſt the Righteous with the
Wicked and Hypocrites, which certainly is an <hi>Abomination to
the Lord.</hi> So, to ſay that <hi>Diogenes may be as proud in his Tub,
as</hi> Alexander <hi>in his Pallace; and may trample upon</hi> Plato'<hi>s Pride
with Greater Pride,</hi> will not hold parallel in this Caſe, no more
then what ſome do by Imitation only, that they may ſeem to
be that which they are not, will hold parallel with what ſome do
in Reality, and only for Conſcience ſake: And though <hi>as
Haughty a Spirit may be hid under a Plain Country Ruſſet, as
under the Richeſt Sables;</hi> ſuch a Compariſon will not nor cannot
hold in the Caſe before mentioned. And why art thou Angry

               <hi>Again ſayes</hi> Firmianus, I confeſs that many of them were in

them, doth ſuggeſt unto them, 'tis lawful to take up Arms, to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

but when there is no Probability to proſper by ſuch villanous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
then the Light within them perſwades them to be quiet as

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many of thoſe called Miniſters, that were as Leaders
of the People, in their Preaching did uſe what Arguments they
could, to ſtir up and encourage their Followers in the Beginning
of the late Wars, to engage them therein; and doubtleſs there
were many that did hold themſelves oblieged to obſerve what
thoſe Men did ſo earneſtly preſs upon them, and were thereby
animated to take up Arms accordingly.</p>
            <p>And I further anſwer, That I do acknowledge that ſeveral of
the People now called <hi>Quakers,</hi> before that Name was caſt upon

unto (which is the Light of Chriſt, which lighteth every Man

Arms, ſome in the King's Party, and ſome in the Parliament
Party, according as thoſe called Miniſters before-mentioned,
did animate and encourage; but ſince being turned to that
Light, and believing in it, we have denyed all ſuch Miniſters,
and their Doctrine alſo, which led ſo contrary to the Doctrine
of Chriſt, who came not deſtroy Men's Lives, but to ſave them:
And the <hi>Parliament</hi> Army being not disbanded before this Light
broke forth ſo fully amongſt us; and ſome of us being then
Members of the Army, as we were turned to that Light, and
our Hearts given up to follow its Leadings, we caſt off our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Weapons of War, with a Reſolution never to return to them
again, but many of them we brake in Pieces, and converted
them to better Uſes, giving up our ſelves to be Followers of
him, who ſaid, <hi>Love your Enemies, and do Good to them that
hate you, &amp;c.</hi> And our peaceable Deportment in our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
to this Time, have given a Faithful Teſtimony to the
Reality of ſuch our Reſolution, and as Occaſion hath required,
have teſtified againſt ſuch who hath profeſt to be of us, and yet
through Provocation, or otherwiſe, have acted contrary to this
our peaceable Principle: And ſo ſtill both in our Doctrine

of that Holy Light, which we have believed in,
which is by thee and thy Generation thus vilified and reproach'd,
which ſhall daſh you to Pieces, be you never ſo proud and loſty,
if ye repent not: And touching our owning Magiſtracy, and
the King as Supream (as the Lord hath ſet him) we have ſeveral
Times by Writing, Declaration and Converſation, teſtified our
Innocency and Fidelity herein, alwayes being ready paſſively
to ſuffer, where we cannot for Conſcience ſake actually obey:
And if we may judge of Perſons and Principles by Practice, then
let ſuch whoſe Underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not blinded with Malice and
Envy, judge who are fartheſt from Plunder and Murder, the
Prieſts or we, let the Fruits of either teſtifie, and that God who
ſearcheth the Heart, and tryes the Reins, to whom we commit

that thoſe Things which thou haſt thus wickedly ſuggeſted and

            <p>And now by the Blaſphemy, wicked Inſinuations, horrible

haſt learned of the Father of Lyes, and not of God, nor of

And as for <hi>our Flattering of our ſelves, that we are in a State of
Perfection;</hi> that is falſe: For we do not Flatter our ſelves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
thou doſt us great Wrong herein, and thy ſelf greater;
for, in the End the Harm will be to thy ſelf, when thou muſt
bear thy own Burden for the Wrong thou haſt done us herein;
yet the Doctrine of Perfection we own, and muſt not deny it;
for it was the Doctrine of Almighty God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Chriſt's Doctrine in his Sermon in the Mount, as I ſaid before;
and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which thou takeſt on thee to be a

teaches <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> (ſo called) to promiſe for

ſhall forſake the Devil, and all his Works:</hi> But who art thou,
that (doubtleſs) doſt ſometimes preach againſt Sin, and yet
cryeſt againſt ſuch as own the Doctrine of Perfection, which,
as I ſaid before, was the Doctrine of Almighty God, and of
Chriſt? Conſider with thy ſelf, whoſe Servant thou art, and
whom thou followeſt herein.</p>
            <p>Again, Thou haſt belyed us in ſaying, we ſay, we cannot ſin;
for which of us didſt thou ever hear ſay ſo? Yet I ſay as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, ſpeaking of Chriſt, he that abideth in him, ſinneth not.
Further, whereas thou ſayeſt of us, <hi>We caſt off all Fear, and,
reſtrain Prayer;</hi> that is falſe alſo; for we are of the ſame
Mind with the Holy Apoſtle, which ſaid, <hi>Let us therefore fear,
leſt a Promiſe being left us, &amp;c. any of you come ſhort, &amp;c.</hi> as
they did, even ſuch who fell ſhort of the Reſt that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>We Reſtrain Prayer:</hi> How canſt thou
make this to appear? Our Practice in Praying often, and in
making Supplication to God often, proves thee to be a Lyar,
and a falſe Accuſer of us herein; and the Scripture thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
againſt us <hi>(Job.</hi> 15. 4,) to prove us ſuch, ſerves not for thy
