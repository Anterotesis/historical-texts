            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

QVESTION
ANSWERED:
<hi>How Laws are to be underſtood, and obedience yeelded?</hi>

Touching the MILITIA.</head>
            <p>
               <label>Queſtion.</label> 
               <hi>NOw in our extreame diſtractions, when forraigne forces threaten, and probably are invited, and a
malignant and Popiſh party at home offended? The Devill hath caſt a bone, and rais'd a conteſtation
between the King and Parliament touching the <hi>Militia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> His Majeſtie claimes the diſpoſing of it to be in
him by right of Law; The Parliament ſaith <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> and <hi>nolenti Rege,</hi> the Ordering of it is in
them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwer.</label>
WHich Queſtion, may receive its ſolution by this diſtinction. That there is in Laws and equitable,
and a litterall ſence. His Majeſty (let it be granted) is intruſted by Law with the <hi>Militia,</hi> but it's
for the good and preſervation of the Republique, againſt Forraigne Invaſions or domeſticke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions.
For it cannot be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would ever by Law intruſt the King with the
<hi>Militia</hi> againſt themſelves, or the Commonwealth, that intruſts them to provide for their weale, not for
their woe. So that when there is certain appearance or grounded ſuſpition, that the Letter of the Law
ſhall be improved againſt the <hi>equity</hi> of it (that is, the publicke good, whether of the body reall or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative)
then the Commander going againſt its <hi>equity,</hi> gives liberty to the Commanded to refuſe <hi>obedience</hi>
to the Letter: for the Law taken abſtract from its originall reaſon and end, is made a ſhell without a ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
a ſhadow without a ſubſtance, and a body without a ſoule. It is the execution of Laws according
to their <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> which (as I may ſay) is the ſpirit that gives life to Authority, the Letter kills.</p>
            <p>Nor need this <hi>equity</hi> be expreſſed in the Law, being ſo naturally implyed and ſuppoſed in all Laws that
are not meerely Imperiall, from that analogie which all bodies Politicke hold with the Naturall; whence
all government and Governours borrow a proportionable reſpect; And therfore when the <hi>Militia</hi> of an
Army is committed to the Generall, it is not with any expreſſe condition, that he ſhall not turn the mouths
of his Cannons againſt his own Souldiers, for that is ſo naturally and neceſſarily implyed, that its needleſſe
to be expreſſed, inſomuch as if he did attempt or command ſuch a thing againſt the nature of his truſt and
place, it did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> eſtate the Army, in a right of diſobedience, except we thinke that obedience binds
Men to cut their owne throats, or at leaſt their companions.</p>
            <p>And indeed if this diſtinction be not allowed, then the legall and mixt <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
for if Laws inveſt the King in an abſolute power, and the letter be not controled by the equity, then
whereas other Kings that are abſolute <hi>Monarcks</hi> and rule by will, and not by Law, are <hi>Tyrants</hi> perforce.
Thoſe that rule by Law and not by will, have hereby a <hi>Tiranny</hi> confer'd upon them legally, and ſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
end of Laws, which is to give bounds and limits to the exorbitant wills of Princes, is by the Lawes
themſelves diſapointed, for they hereby give corrobaration (and much more Iuſtification to an arbitrary
<hi>Tyranny,</hi> by making it legall, not aſſumed; which Laws are ordained to croſſe not countenance: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the letter (where it ſeems abſolute) alwaies to receive quallification from the equity, elſe the foreſaid
abſurdity muſt follow.</p>
