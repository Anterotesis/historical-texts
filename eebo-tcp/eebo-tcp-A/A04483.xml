         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the honourable, and
reuerent loue, that

gratious a Prince, as
GOD in mercy hath
set ouer vs: hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this small worke
to be persented vnto
thee (gentle Reader.) For, it carrieth in it selfe,
and bringeth vnto thee a ripping vp, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foulding
of that seditious BVL of <hi>Pius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius,</hi>
that was set vp and published by FELTON, a
rebellious traitour, in the twelfth yeare of hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
raigne, to withdraw thee from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and loue that thou owest to hir Maiestie, to
hir Lawes and godlie proceedinges, and to this
Realme thy deare Countrie.</p>
            <p>To whiche is also adioined an other Treatise of
the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Wherein is shewed thee the
<hi>authoritie,</hi> and the <hi>profit,</hi> and the <hi>pleasure,</hi> and the
<hi>necessitie</hi> of the <hi>word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these, the reuerend Father in GOD, D. IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEL,
late Bishop of SARVM, deliuered to that
<pb facs="tcp:8216:3"/>
Church and people: in the great care he had to do
his Maisters seruice, &amp; to keepe the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his charge, from incurring such offence
to GOD, or vndutifulnes to hir <hi>Maiestie,</hi> or their
own euerlasting damnation. His meaning herein
was good toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp;, not doubt but they reapt
the comfortable fruit of his godlie trauailes. The
like mayest thou gather to thy selfe, by direction
of the same his speeches thus drawn into short and
compendious forme: if thou wilt reade them with
diligence and iudgement.</p>
            <p>If thou learne to humble thy selfe before GOD,
and to seeke wisdome of hym: if thou searche the
<hi>scriptures</hi> and make them thy guides to leade thee
through the desert and wide sea of this life, as thou
arte aduertised by the <hi>later:</hi> thou shalt soone espie
the daunger of all such practises towardes disloial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
aud rebellion, whereto the BVL driueth thee,
which is disclosed in the <hi>former.</hi> For, it is not only
sayde by the wise man,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The feare of the Lorde is the
beginning of wisedome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 8.</note> but also set down by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
<hi>They haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what
wisedome is in them?</hi> that is, therefore men become
foolish, and do such things as are vnmeete, because
they care not for the word of God: and therefore
<hi>Dauid</hi> in his experience so confesseth,<note place="margin">Psa. 119.</note> that <hi>by the
commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God he was made wiser than his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and had more vnderstanding than al his teachers:
because the testimonies of the Lord were euer with him,
and he did meditate them.</hi> If thou settle thy heart to
like and do those things which please God, if thou
haue the loue of his word, hee wil teache thee the
way wherein thou shouldst walke in obedience to
<pb facs="tcp:8216:3"/>
him, and in dutie to hir Maiestie our dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
his seruant.</p>
            <p>I trust thou wilte take good instructions out of
these twoo Treatises to thy <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>zeale</hi> to them
both: and be thankful to God for that learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath lefte a light vnto thee, both in ex-example,
and by these and other his workes. whose
steppes if thou shalt follow, thou shalt liue godly,
and die with comforte, as a good seruaunt of thy
mercifull GOD and <hi>Father.</hi> The benefites of his
great trauailes taken in time of his life, are thine.
And vnto the ende, he ceassed not to continue in
the faith whiche he before professed. For (as I, one
of many yet liuing, can testifie) in the daye and
night before his departure out of this worlde, hee
expounded the <hi>Lordes prayer,</hi> and gaue short notes
vpon the 71. <hi>Psalme,</hi> to such as were by him. He
thought good to say somwhat at that time, of his
Bookes written by him, and set forth in Print; and
also of his Preaching. In both which seruices done
by him to the glory of God, and thy comfort: he
made protestation of his good conscience, whiche
euen then, as he declared, witnessed and shoulde
witnesse with him before God, that he dealt sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and plainely: hauing God only before his eies,
and seeking the defence of the Ghospel of Christ,
and that the truth thereof might bee opened and
maintayned. And farther gaue thankes to God
that made him his seruaunt in so greate a worke;
and then visited him by this messenger of death,
whiles he was doing the message of God, in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Dioecese: that then hee called him to reste
from his labours, when his weake body was spent
<pb facs="tcp:8216:4"/>
and worne out in setting forth the glory of God,
for which he many times prayed, it woulde pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
God to let him be offred in sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Hee was at that time verye feruent in <hi>Prayer:</hi>
which he poured out before the Lord aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in great faith: crying often, <hi>Lorde let thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
now depart in peace. Lord let thy seruant now come
to thee. I haue not so liued, that I am ashamed to liue:
neither am I afrayd to die, for we haue a gratious Lord.
There is laide vppe for mee a crowne of righteousnesse.
Christ is my righteousnesse. Thy will be done ô Lorde,
for mine is frayle.</hi> With many other suche godlye
speehes. In the extremitie of his disease he shewed
great pacience, and when his voice fayled that hee
lay speechelesse, hee lifted vp his handes and eyes,
in witnesse of his consent to those prayers whiche
were made. Thus, being vertuously occupied, and
wholly resting himselfe vpon the mercies of God
through Ies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Christ our sauior, he rendred vp his
soule to God, the 23. of <hi>September.</hi> 1571.</p>
            <p>Be thou thankful to God for giuing his Church
so worthy an instrument of his glorie: and bee
carefull to follow the good doctrine, which he left
behinde him, not only in this that commeth forth
at this present, but in all other his Bookes, whiche
haue beene set forth before, or shall be put foorth
hereafter to thy benefit, and increase of godlinesse.</p>

               <hi>if we lette him thus

and ours is forsaken. The Priests and

among themselues, saying, <hi>What

and charge them that they speake
henceforth to no man in this name.</hi> So
they called them, and commaunded
them, that in no case they should speake

And so doeth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> nowe for the

hys pleasure of vs. They are wicked
(sayeth hée) theyr number daylye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
their doctrine spreadeth farre
and wide: it dothe muche harme, it
hathe preuailed in moste places: they
are a wicked rable, their doctrine is
corrupte, it hathe infected the worlde.
Belike his Holinesse is muche disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

But where are they, and who be they,

what do they wickedly? it is much, to bée

This he speaketh and writeth of you &amp;

that God hathe appointed him ouer all

doe not make our prayers to dead Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
we séeke no helpe at their handes
whiche neyther heare vs, nor can helpe

we rebuke sinne: we séeke reformation

Pope hath shamefully abused the whole

son of perdition shall be destroyed with
the Sworde of the Spirite: that euerys
Plant which our heauenly Father hath

of the meate of malice, eate none of the

               </hi> We heare of the

in body, and holy in spirite: but yet al
are not Uirgins which liue vnmarried,

And againe:<note place="margin">Ibidem:</note> 
               <hi>But why (say you) in giuing

is married admitted? It may bee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his doings are not agreeable to his

to conclude this, we say: our lawes (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8216:26"/>
the counsell of the Apostle, &amp; finding
so many examples in al ages of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which were married, and the notable
inconueniences which grewe by forced
chastitie,) haue giuen libertie, that those
who haue not the gifte of Chastitie, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide

               <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie,</hi>
or <hi>Single life.</hi> This is the thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth
vntruth. And so haue you in these
fewe words, the number whiche I spake
of: euen fiue vntruths in litle more than
fiue words.</p>
            <p>First, that <hi>we haue no Sacrifice.</hi> This
is not true. For we haue the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of
the death and bloud of Christ, a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
which lasteth for euer.</p>
            <p>Againe, that <hi>we haue no Prayers</hi> This
is vntrue. For we call vppon the name
of the Lorde. We glorifie God euen the
Father of our Lore Iesus Christe. God
grant all the Churches in Christendome
may do the like.</p>
            <p>Againe, that <hi>we haue no Fasting.</hi> This
is vntrue. Our doctrine requireth <hi>fasting</hi>
our lawes command it, we commend it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:8216:26"/>Againe, <hi>They make no difference of
Meates.</hi> This is vntrue. For we haue
not putte downe one Fish day: and we
haue appointed 50. more than our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
kept.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Single life is abolished.</hi> This
is vntrue: for, a Minister may liue <hi>single</hi>
if he wil, there is no law to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary.
God graunt our liues may be <hi>single</hi> and
simple, and pleasing him: else we are

            <p>But what is the number of such, who
haue come in vnto vs? Are they thrée or
foure thousand? Thanks be to God this

what other straungers arriued within
these parts not long sithence: These are

            <p>If the Pope may maintaine so many

Whome when he thought good to bring

Woulde the Uicar of Christ giue this

they are our brethren, they liue not

They begge not in our streets, nor craue

he hath bin wonderfully troubled by the
<hi>Moeres</hi> at home, and liueth in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
turmoyle with his subiectes in other

states of <hi>Venice:</hi> they are still disquieted

accurssed <hi>England:</hi> thankes be to God it
was neuer better in worldly peace, in

            <p>The greatest blessing whiche God gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

rule ouer them. The greatest miserie
that can fall vppon a people, is to haue a

What dispensation Pope <hi>Pius</hi> sent to

            <p>Such a dispensation did Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
lately send into <hi>England,</hi> and discharged
the Subiects from their due obedience to
our Prince, and thereby made way for
them, with his fauour and licence to
runne headlong into euerlasting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
With some weake heades hée
hath preuailed. It is likely hée hath
vsed secrete conference with them some
long time, before they would be drawen
to be traitours to their owne country,
and be emboldened to put themselues in
armour, and robbe, and spoyle, &amp; burne,
and kill their countrie men, &amp; friends,
and kinsefolkes, and children, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
against the law of nature, and the
commaundement of God.</p>
            <p>This was done not long sithence. You
can not but remember it, they were in
armes, and had gathered a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8216:56"/>
of Confederats: the banner was displai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in fielde. What thinke you was their
meaning? Or to what ende did they rise?
Among all those that liue within this
realme, whose person sought they? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom bente they their speares?
And against whose body drew they their
swordes? But the Lorde preserued his
anointed: he hath placed hir vppon his
holy hill of <hi>Sion:</hi> no traiterous malice
shall annoy hir.</p>
            <p>Consider nowe whence all this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
grew. There is no treason, without
conference. There, euen there began all
our trouble. The maister of all this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
fitteth at <hi>Rome,</hi> as I tolde you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> coales were kindled here, but the

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, they cared neither for

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8216:57"/>
in their doings, by insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which shoulde haue bene likewise
made in other places of the Realme. In
all this they tooke courage and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Pope <hi>Pius.</hi> He furnished them
with all deuise of counsell, he blessed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in their purpose, he promised them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of their sinnes, for part of their
wages.</p>
            <p>Miserable man which could finde no
better company: and in miserable case,
when he cannot be vpholden by other
meanes than by treason. But most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
are they which through his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
persuasions are content to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and to séeke howe their country
may be brought vnder the subiection of
foreine enemies, into bondage and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.
So doth he lose and set at libertie
the consciences of men, and flattereth
the wicked in their vngodlinesse, as if
his dispensation should be their excuse.</p>
            <p>It is an olde saying, <hi>Caueat emptor,
<hi>let him that buieth take heede.</hi>
               </hi> What
colour soeuer the Pope setteth on his
marchandize, let the buier take héede of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8216:57"/>
them. We haue called God to record vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our soules: our conscience standeth
charged. If we commit periury, God wil
auenge it. If we resist the power, wee
breake the ordinance of God, and then
we receiue to our selues damnation. Let
vs therefore be wise and circumspect. As
for Pope <hi>Pius</hi> word, it is no warrant for
vs against the iudgement of God. In
the day of the Lorde, when we woulde
call him forth for our discharge, we shall
not finde him. He is not able to warrant
himselfe.</p>
            <p>Yet for his better credite, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
the more with vs, he saith well of
him selfe, &amp; magnifieth and aduaunceth
his owne name, when he telleth vs, <hi>I am
a Prince, I am aboue nations and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
I excommunicate Kinges and
Princes: I depriue them, and put them
downe, and roote them vp: I haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer their Subiects, I discharge them
of their othes, I curse them and giue
them vp to the Diuel: I am like to the
highest.</hi> These are blasphemous, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
words, méete words for him
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8216:58"/>
that sent them: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is giuen a mouth
to speake great things, and blasphemies.
And thus he imagineth all the worlde
should fall downe before him with a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi>
He imagineth he holdeth the Sunne
and Moone in his handes, and can rule
them as it pleaseth him: &amp; thus he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into a pleasant phrensie: he dreameth
of great matters, and with his owne

as he thinketh, to haue such place giuen

Their children were no more

The Lord wente before them by daye in

giue them lighte. When they called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

as it was written in the Prophetes and

they tooke credite to theyr saying,
and auctoritie to their message, oute of
the worde of God. This Worde the
Prophetes vouched and alleadged to the

although a Seraphin came vnto one of
them and touched his mouth with a hote

presence, the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t stoode al couered with
fire, the earth shooke, the heauens thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the people stood a farre off, and fled
for feare, and said vnto <hi>Moses</hi> talke thou
with vs, &amp; we wil heare: but let not God
talk with vs, least we die. This was the
first proclayming &amp; publishing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law:
such force and credite God gaue to his
word, &amp; warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted himselfe to be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord.</p>
            <p>Since that time, so manye thousande
yeares are already passed. In the meane
time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of <hi>Israel</hi> were oppressed by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8216:67"/>
Tyrantes, were spoiled and chased out
of their Countrie. Firste by <hi>Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donosor</hi>
into <hi>Babilon:</hi> after that by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi>
into <hi>Syria,</hi> and lastly, were as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabondes
driuen from countrie to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
Thyir Citie <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was sackte,
their houses ouerthrowne, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
razed, and not a stone lefte vppon a
stone: theyr Librarie destroyed: theyr
Bookes burnte: the tabernacle loste, the
couenaunt broken: No vision, no reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
no comforte for the people left,
nor prophet, nor priest, nor any to speake
in the name of the Lorde. In all those
times of decayes, of sackings, of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; of miserie, what was done with
the word of God? It was wickedly burnt
by <hi>Ioachim</hi> King of <hi>Iuda:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 36.</note> and <hi>Antiochus
burnt the Bookes of the Lawe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Mac. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and cutte

               </hi> No man durste be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to haue them, and auouche the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
So thought they vtterly to deface
the glorie of God, and abolish al remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of his Lawes.</p>
            <p>Then came the <hi>Phariseis,</hi> they drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the worde of God with their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8216:67"/>
they tooke away the key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and entred not in them selues, but
forbade them that came in. After them
came Heretiques, they denyed some one
parte, and some an other parte of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
They razed, blotted, corrupted,
and altered the word of God, of the word
of God, they made it their own word, or
which is worse, they made it the word of
the Diuel.</p>
            <p>By the space of so many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yers,
the word of God passed by so many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Tyrants, of Phariseis, of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
of fire, and of sworde: and yet
continueth and standeth vntill this day,
without altering, or chaunging one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This was a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful work of God,
that hauing so many, so greate enimes,
and passing thorough so many, so greate
daungers, it yet continueth stil without
adding or altering of any one sentence,
or worde, or letter. No creature was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe this, it was Gods worke. He
preserued it, that no Tyrant should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it, no Tradition choake it, no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike
malitiously should corrupt it. For
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8216:68"/>
For his names sake, and for the elects
sake, he would not suffer it to perish. For
in it God hathe ordained a blessing for
his people, and by it he maketh couenant
with them for life euerlasting. Tirants,
and Phariseis, and Heretiques, and the
enimies of the Crosse of Christe haue an
end, but the worde of God hath no ende.

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued they by the space of some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares, without controllment, or

of <hi>Antiquitie, Vniuersality,</hi> and <hi>Consent.</hi>
Antiquitie of all times, Uniuersalitie

            <p>But when the fulnesse of time came,
God sente forth his worde, and al was

God. The Kings and Priestes, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8216:69"/>
people were changed: the Temples, and
Sacrifices, and Praiers were chaunged:
mens eyes, and heartes were chaunged.
They forsooke their Gods, their Kings,
their Priests: they forsooke their antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
customes, consent, their Fathers, and
themselues. What power was able to
work these things? What Emperour by

            <p>Now let vs stand a farre of, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

that we may be partakers of his glorie.
But where shal we finde enterance into
this matter? And howe shall we bée able
to come a land? For this is the Sea, and
the depth of all the workes, of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and mercies, &amp; of the kingdome
of God. This is a Sea that hath no shore,
a pit that hath no botome. The holy
Scriptures are the mercie seate, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistry
of the mysteries of God, our Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
for the life to come, the holy place in
which God sheweth him selfe to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

            <p>For consideration of this mater of the
fruite &amp; comfort which God worketh by
the worde: what may we better call to
minde,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> than that is réecorded by <hi>S. Paul:
Whatsoeuer thinges are written aforetime,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8216:70"/>
are written for our learning, that

writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the word of God, is not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for Angels, or Archangels, or heauenly
Spirites, but for the sonnes of men, for
vs and for our instruction: that by them
we may receiue strength, and comfort in
all aduersities, and haue hope of the life
to come. It is the word of God, God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his mouth and speaketh to vs, to
guide vs into all truth, to make vs full
and readie in all good workes, that we

            <p>The profite which the worde of God
bringeth, shal best apeare, if we first take
a viewe of our estate, what we are, in

God which created man &amp; breathed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8216:71"/>
into him the breath of life,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.</note> saith: <hi>The
imagination of mans heart is euill from

of God: and his iudgement faileth
not. What errour, what idol, what wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
euer hath bene heard, which hath
not bene forged and wrought in the
heart of man? wée can neither doe, nor
speake, nor thinke the thing that is good:
our vnderstanding is heauie, our will
froward, our eyes blinde, and our heart
vncleane. We go astray through this
worlde as lost shéepe, euery man after
his owne way. Euen as a leafe is cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vp and downe with a blast of winde,
so are we easily driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into errour: in our
selues we finde no stay, no succour, nor
helpe. Such are we, and so weake of our
selues.</p>
            <p>But where are we? in the world. And
what is the world? Some thinke it to be
a place full of all delights and pleasures,
a goodly strong and gorgious palace, and
a paradise of ioy. Let no man deceiue vs,
nay rather let vs not deceiue our selues:
the world is a shoppe of vanities, it is a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8216:71"/>
dungeon of darkenesse, a potte full of
poyson, a shippe full of leakes, a way full
of snares. It blindeth our eyes, beguileth
our senses, and helpeth vs forwarde into
all daungers. We are blinde our selues,
and the place wherein we are is nothing
els but darkenesse.</p>
            <p>Wherunto may I resemble our case?
<hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet was cast into a du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
There he sate without light, and
without comfort. His case was misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the place lothsome, yet he knew
where he was: he knew what he lacked:
he cryed vnto the Lord and was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into the den of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there to bee torne in péeces and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured.
But he sawe his misery, and the
daunger in which he stoode: he sawe the
Lions, the pawes which shoulde gripe
him, and the téeth which shoulde teare
him. His case was miserable: yet is ours
more miserable. We are in the déepe
dungeon of hel, and think we are in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
we are in the middest of darkenesse,
and thinke it to be light: we are compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Scorpions, yet think not of our miserie.</p>
            <p>Who hath not heard the story of <hi>Ionas?
Ionas</hi> was in a Whales belly: The place
was very darke: the waues beat on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side: he was drowned, yet touched no
water: he was swallowed vp, yet not
consumed: he liued without any sense
of life: the fish was his death, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sea was
death, &amp; the tempest was death: yet he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, but liued in the mids of death: he
could not sée, he could not heare, he knew
not to whom he might call for helpe: hée
was taken &amp; carried away, he knew not
whether. Let vs marke well this storie,
it is a true pattern of our estate, &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what our life is in this worlde. We

            <p>The Philosopher telleth vs, trueth &amp;
falsehode are nigh neighbors, and dwell

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8216:72"/>
little to the shew saue that oft times the
dore of falshod is faire, painted, grauen,
and beautifully adorned: but the dore or
fore front of trueth, is plaine and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Therby it hapneth that men be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
they mistake the dore, and goe into
errors house, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they séeke truth. They
call euill good, falsehoode truth, &amp; darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
light. They forsake that is good, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the truth, and loue not the light. This
moued S. <hi>Paul</hi> to say of his brethren the
<hi>Iewes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I beare them recorde that they
haue the zeale of God, but not according

feare of God: they are zelous in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
they haue deuotion: they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

and that they please God.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
               <hi>When they
professed themselues to be wise, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

did: for if they had knowlege, they wold

But they knowe not the trueth of God:
they know not God: they are caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vanity of their own hart. Their
prayers are no prayers: The truth they

holde is falshoode: their faith is no faith:
they are shéepe without a shephearde.
Thus we haue heard, what we are, and
in what place.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs sée what enemies bende
their force against vs. We fight against
the gates of hell, with the Diuell, the
prince of darkenesse, the father of lies:
with the Diuel, which hath power ouer
the children of disobedience, by whose
malice death came into the world Euen
that Diuel bendeth his force against vs,
which deceiued <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise:
which hath deceiued the learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers:
and beguiled the Princes, and
wiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the worthies of the world:
Which doth abuse, and entice our hands,
our eyes, our learning, our wit, and our
owne heart to deceiue vs. He rampeth as
a Lion, and raungeth ouer the worlde,
séeking whom he may deuour. This is
his delite and studie. Hée hath bene a
murtherer from the beginning. If this
were euer true at any time, our times
haue founde it most true. We are they
vpon whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ends of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world are come.</p>

               <hi>Nowe is this Scripture fulfilled in

Christ warned his disciples so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>

They shal say, Loe here is Christ, and

And except those dayes should bee

but for the elects sake those dayes shal be

neither liuing, nor wife, nor children,

deare vnto me in respect of the trueth. I
knowe if I shoulde deny him to saue my

life for his sake, I shall finde it. That
which your auctoritie shal lay vpon me,
is not done without his will. All the

you obedience, I will not resiste your

fight against God, against the moste ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
against him, which can commaunde
your life to goe out of your body: it is a

            <p>It maye please God to giue vnto you

The Lorde hath spoken vnto me: I haue
heard his voice: my hart hath felt it: my
conscience knoweth it: I can not denye
it. No sworde can cutte me from it: no
water can drowne it: no fire can burne
the loue I beare vnto it: there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in heauen or earth, that can carrie
me from that blessed hope I haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by his word.</p>
            <p>So constant is he that hathe learned
the worde of God, &amp; hath set his delighte
vppon it, and is through it assured of the
wil of God. Heauen shal shake, the earth
shall tremble, but the man of God shall
stande vpright. His foote shall not faile:
his heart shall not faint: he shall not bée
moued. Such a ground, such a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
suche a rocke is the worde of God.
Blessed is the man whose hope is in the

His strength is within, the gates of hel

be Interpretors of the worde of God.
They were learned men, and learned

in the Churche of God. Yet
may they not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with the word
of God. We may not build vpon them:
we may not make them the foundation

Scriptures, how profitable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
they be in all cases and parts of
our life? in aduersitie, in prosperitie, in
life and in death, they are our especiall
comfort. If we must fight, they are a
sworde: if we hunger, they are meate: if
we thirst, they are drinke: if we haue no
dwelling place, they are a house: if we
be naked, they are a garment: if we be
in darknesse, they be light vnto our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>They are comfortable to kings, to
subiects, to old men, to yong men, to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and to wife, to father &amp; to childe, to mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and seruant, to captaine and souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
to preacher and people, to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to the vnlearned, to the wise, and to
the simple.</p>
            <p>They are comfortable in peace, in
warre, in heauinesse, in ioy, in health &amp;
sicknesse, in aboundance, in pouertie,
in the day time, in the night season, in
the towne, in the wildernesse, in
companie and when thou art alone. For
they teach faith, hope, patience, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
sobrietie, humilitie, righteousnesse,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8216:92"/>
and all godlinesse. They teach vs to
liue, and they teach vs to die.</p>
            <p>Therefore hath <hi>Paule</hi> said well, <hi>The
whole Scripture is profitable:</hi> It is full
of great comforte: It maketh the man
of God absolute, and perfect vnto al good
workes. Perfect in faith, perfect in hope,
perfect in the loue of God, &amp; of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
perfect in his life, and perfect in his

I neuer hadde béene any body. He

the like words of the Scripture? and say,
vnlesse it were for the worde of God, our
