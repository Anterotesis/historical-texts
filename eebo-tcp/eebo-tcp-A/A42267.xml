            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN it ſeem'd good to the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to remove our Late King (of happy Memory) from the Cares of an Earthly Crown, to the Joyes and Reſt of his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom, he left the World entirely beloved, and generally lamented by all his Loyal Subjects; and the deep Senſe of having ſo wiſe, ſo juſt, ſo good a Prince almoſt unexpectedly ſnatch'd away from us, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to drown the whole Nation in perpetual Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tears. But to ſupport us under that ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Loſs, our Moſt Gracious Sovereign, that now is, has (by the Aſſiſtance of the ſame Almighty Goodneſs) been peaceably eſtabliſhed on the Throne of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93828:3"/>
in ſpight of all the deſperate Attempts, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Endeavours of a few turbulent Spirits, to deprive him of his moſt undoubted Right of Inheritance. A Prince of mature Age, and great Experience; and ſo admirably qualified for Government, that, if it had not been his by unqueſtionable Succeſſion, his own perſonal Worth might have been thought enough to have preferred him to a Crown: And to quiet the Minds of his People, and ſilence all the imaginable jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies any of them might have been poſſibly ſeduced into, by the falſe and malicious Suggeſtions of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men; the Firſt thing he did after his coming to the Crown, was to confirm the <hi>hearty Profeſſions</hi> he had often made before, To <hi>preſerve this Government both in Church and State, as it is now by Law eſtabliſhed.</hi> For this he has already received publick Thanks in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Addreſſes that have been preſented unto him; and though it be not expreſly ſet down in ſome, yet we may reaſonably ſuppoſe it is implyed in all; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whatever Proteſtations they may make, it will not be believed that they can have any true Zeal for God, or Reſpect for their King, that think ſo gracious a Promiſe, ſo frequently repeated, does not really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their moſt grateful and ſolemn Acknowledgments. But this, and the reſt of His Majeſty's Expreſſions of a very great Care and Tenderneſs for His People, had that good Influence, that the Suſpicions of the moſt timorous did immediately vaniſh: His Advancement to the Throne gave preſent Eaſe and Satisfaction, and was attended with the moſt univerſal Acclamations of Joy from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Nation. And certainly now it muſt be confeſſed to be the Duty and Intereſt too, of every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93828:3"/>
               <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> indeed, to do whatever lies in his power, for the Continuance of our preſent Happineſs. And becauſe the Welfare of the publick may very much depend on the Iſſue of this firſt Parliament: It will highly concern all thoſe whom the Law has intruſted with the priviledge of Electing, to make Choice of perſons of approved Prudence and Integrity, that may be able to aſſert the known Liberties of the People, without intrenching upon the Dignity of the Crown. For we muſt needs be involved in endleſs Miſeries and Confuſion, unleſs the Prerogative of the King be as carefully preſerved as the Property of the Subject. Theſe two muſt mutually ſupport the one the other, or elſe they will be both in danger of a Fall. But we may chance to meet this Argument again before we have done.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it is like enough to be objected, That to undertake to give Advice in theſe Caſes, is a very improper Work for a profeſſed Divine. I know indeed, that of late Years, if we did but preach Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Magiſtrates, or reflect, though but gently, upon the moſt horrid and unnatural Sin of Rebellion, we were preſently condemned for going beyond the Bounds of our Calling, and being too forward to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with Matters of State. And at Elections of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to ſerve in Parliament, we could not appear in ſome places, without undergoing ſome publick Affront. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made to raiſe a general prejudice againſt us, and all thoſe that had any Reſpect and Kindneſs for us. It was ſometimes eſteemed Exception enough againſt Gentlemen of very great Worth, if they ſtood
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93828:4"/>
but fair in the Opinion of the Clergy. But it was then eaſily perceived, and ſince plainly diſcovered, which way the Stream was running, and by what ſort of Men, and upon what Occaſion all that Noiſe and Clamour was raiſed. The Clergy were generally firm to the eſtabliſhed Government, and profeſſed Enemies to the deſigns that were then ſetting on Foot. And it was but neceſſary for thoſe that were indeavouring to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Government, both in Church, and State, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of reforming abuſes, to make the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude jealous of them, and blacken them as much as poſſibly they could in the eyes of the People: And they wanted neither cunning, nor malice to do it.</p>
            <p>But to return ſome anſwer to what has been object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If the things I have mentioned may be called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddling with matters of State, they are no more than what may be very well juſtified. When we were made Miniſters, we did not ceaſe to be men; and the Church being, as it were incorporated with the State, He that has an Intereſt in the one, muſt not be wholly unconcerned for the other. The Laws allow us a Vote in Elections; and without immodeſty we think our ſelves as capable of Judging, who may be fitly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be made our Repreſentatives, as other Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Free-holders are: And it would be very unjuſt in thoſe, that talk ſo loud of Liberty and Property, to blame us for deſireing the concurrence of our Friends, much more to Abridge us of the Freedom of our Voices in the choice of a Knight of the Shire: Beſides it is the indiſpenſable Duty of every Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 17.</note> to exhort the People to <hi>Fear God, and Honour the</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93828:4"/>
               <hi>King;</hi> to Preach <hi>Subjection to the Higher Powers, not only for wrath, but Conſcience ſake.</hi> And this they are <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. 5. Tit. 3. 1.</note> obliged to, by an expreſs Divine Command, by the Canons of the Church, by the common Laws of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the reſpect they ought to bear to true Piety and Holineſs of Life: That they may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute what they can to the preventing the Miſeries of Civil, as well as Foreign Wars; and the great increaſe of profaneneſs and irreligion, which unavoidably follows all popular Tumults, and Inſurrections; when the Commands of Almighty God, concerning Obedience eſpecially, are quite forgotten, or diſtinguiſhed into nothing; the Laws of the Land inſolently trampled under Foot; and all reverence to Authority wholly laid aſide: And becauſe it is well known what a Powerful influence a Parliament may have upon the Settlement, or ruin of the Nation, no leſs in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, than Civil concerns; this conſideration alone may be ſufficient to excuſe a Clergy-man, if he ſhall undertake to Adviſe the Choice of ſuch Worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as to him ſeem the moſt likely to promote the real Intereſt of Church and State, in this very Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal juncture of Affairs.</p>
            <p>But this had never prevailed with me to adventure theſe Papers into publick view, if there had not been a ſtrange Rumor ſpread over the Nation, that we of the Clergy were Enemies, and deſpiſers of all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This Groundleſs calumny was ſo induſtriouſly propagated through the whole Kingdom, not without a mixture of many other Falſe and uncharitable reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that many of the People firmly believed it; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93828:5"/>
it was ſo deeply rooted in the minds of ſome, that wherever we appeared, they were eaſily perſwaded to take the contrary ſide at all Elections in divers places. It is not now hard to conceive for what purpoſes this malicious report was invented; what effect it had we all know. But to undeceive ſome well meaning men, that may ſtill be miſlead, by ſuch unjuſt and Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Aſperſions; I ſhall acquaint you with the true occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this report; and then ſhew the Honourable opinion we have of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>The true Occaſion then of this report, That we were Enemies of Parliaments, was really and plainly no other than this: We could not expreſs any great good likeing for ſome things, which ſometimes happened to be carryed by a Majority of Votes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we could not always admire all their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, thoſe who ſerved a Deſign by rendring us Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, indeavoured to make the World believe, that we hated the very Conſtitution; which is a moſt falſe and malicious Scandal. I muſt confeſs, I never thought that any Man was obliged to yield a blind and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Aſſent to all the Determinations of any Aſſembly upon Earth: This were a kind of Civil Popery, and more I believe than they themſelves will require of us. And then what fault have we committed, if we honeſtly profeſs our Diſſent; and have not learned the Art of Flattery, to magnify, and applaud, what we do not approve? Where every Man is concerned, every Man may be allowed to ſpeak his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to differ from whom he pleaſes; provided he do it with Modeſty, and due reſpect: And to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93828:5"/>
menaced, and frighted out of this Innocent Freedom, is of all Slaveries the moſt Intolerable. We find even ſome Parliaments cenſured in our Chronicles, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry odd Epithets ſixed upon them; there is one that is called the Wood Parliament; it was the Language of thoſe times, and the Veneration I have for theſe great Aſſemblies, will not permit me to put it into more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But you may ſee by this, that the truth will out at laſt; and I cannot Propheſie what Character ſome of later date may expect in the Hiſtories of after Ages, when the Writer ſhall be ſecured from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Arms, and out of danger of being brought upon his Knees at the Bar of the Houſe. The time will certainly come, when all Men will Speak, and Write their Minds freely of all Debates, and reſolves whatever. And we cannot be therefore juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if we have been ſo open hearted, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome kind of diſlike of ſome Proceedings, which as far as we were able to judge, might be made the Occaſions of very great and publick Inconveniences. Nor ought we for this to be eſteemed Deſpiſers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, any more than we can be ſaid to be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Monarchy, becauſe we will not undertake to juſtify every thing that has been done by every Crowned Head in the World. But to deal frankly and plainly with you, I will give you ſome Paſſages, which we could not be ſo well pleaſed with, in ſome of our late Parliaments: Some of them relate more immediately to the Commoners of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome of them to the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>That which eſpecially regards the Commoners, is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93828:6"/>
puniſhing many of them, ſeverely enough, without any Offence againſt any known Law of the Realm There was a great Noiſe made about Abhorrers, and Betrayers of the Liberties of the Subject: Very ſtrange and frightful words! but what unpardonable Crimes may lurk under them, will be very difficult for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man to Conjecture. I have ſearched the Statute Book, and there I cannot yet diſcover the very names, much leſs any Puniſhment appointed for the Fault. Now if a Man ſhould be puniſhed, when he has not been Guilty of the Violation of any Law; his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment cannot be eſteemed Legal and Juſt, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Arbitrary, and muſt be reſolved into nothing elſe, but the Will, and Pleaſure of him that inflicts it. And yet, very many (and it might have been any Man's Caſe) were forced to leave all their private concerns, and brought up to <hi>London,</hi> from the remoteſt Parts of the Land, at any Seaſon of the Year; ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Infirmities of Body, to the certain Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Eſtates, and hazzard of their Lives; and then put under a very Chargeable Confinement, during Pleaſure, and not diſmiſſed at length without a Cenſure, and the Payment of very Liberal Fees. And all this not for any Offence againſt any Law, that any one could tell of; but only for Words, caſually let fall, that would not bear an Action in any Court in <hi>England.</hi> What a Miſerable Condition is this? Who could tell when he was ſafe, unleſs he hung a Padlock on his Lips? What Patrons of Liberty are theſe? And what <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> is there, that had not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be governed by an Act, deliberately paſſed by the Lords, as well as Commons, authentically confirmed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93828:6"/>
by the Royal Aſſent, and ſufficiently promulged to the notice of all Men, than to lic at the Mercy of every haſty Vote of the lower Houſe? This is what was moſt of all complained of in ſome late tranſactions, wherein all Free-born Subjects are more directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>That which more particularly reſpected the King, was a certain kind of reſolved ſtiffneſs, in turning of many of his Gracious Meſſages; not always expreſſing ſo much Loyal reverence, as was due to Majeſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Protection they injoyed their Lives and Fortunes, and that Freedom of Speech, which they ſometimes made uſe of to the very utmoſt. But to ſay no more of that; among other things of a high Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, His Majeſty was precluded, as far as a Vote could go, from advanceing Money upon any part of his Revenue; and all Men were frighted, as much as was poſſible, from conſidering the emergent Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Kingdom, and lending any thing in the greateſt Exigencies of State. This ſeems extreamly harſh, and puts the King in harder Circumſtances, than the meaneſt of his Subjects. It contradicts the moſt Fundamental and Divine Principle of all Juſtice, and Equity: <hi>Do unto all Men, as ye would they ſhould do unto you.</hi> For ſome of them might have remembred, that without a Power to take up Money on what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates they had, they could not have treated the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Corporations ſo liberally as they did; and then they had not been put in a Capacity of giving their concurrence to that, or any other Vote. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out borrowing, the Reckoning could not always have

been diſcharged; and I'm ſure, if all the Claret, and other good Liquor, that was ſpent at Elections, had never been paid for, it had been one of the greateſt Grievances the Nation ever groaned under ſince the Conqueſt. But this is not the worſt Miſchief that might have followed: Suppoſe the People had been generally overawed by this Vote, and an Invincible <hi>Armado</hi> had appeared on our Coaſts, with a potent Army ready to be put a Shoar: What a Caſe had this poor Nation been in? No Money, no Men, no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition ſufficient to oppoſe the Invader. We had been made an eaſie Prey to a Foreign Enemy: We muſt have tamely yielded our Throats to the Sword of the Conqueror: Every Penny of Money we had, every Foot of Land we poſſeſſed, had been at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal; the whole Kingdom might have been ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd and inſlav'd: And who had been the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Liberties of the Subject then? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the greateſt and ſobereſt part of the Nation was ſomething ſtartled at ſuch Proceedings as theſe, that by Degrees might have made us perfect Vaſſals to our Fellow Subjects, that would have quite diſarmed the King, and Kingdom, and expoſed our Lives, and all that we had, to any growing Power, that had but the Confidence and Ambition to invade us. But to imagine that we are therefore Enemies to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a very great miſtake. And to convince you of this, I ſhall ſhew you the Excellent uſe, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Advantages of Parliaments; What it is that too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hinders the good Effects they might otherwiſe have; and What are the pernicious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that; And then deſire you to accept the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93828:7"/>
moſt Hearty, and Seaſonable Advice, I am able to give, concerning your preſent Elections.</p>
            <p>As to the Excellent Uſe, and many publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Parliaments: I muſt here profeſs, (and I think I ſpeak the Senſe of a great many more) that I really eſteem it my greateſt Temporal Happineſs, that I was born in a Land, where the Government is ſo admirably Tempered, that the King has all the Power that is requiſite to inable him to execute Juſtice, and protect his People, and which may be enough, by the Bleſſing of God, to make him Great, and Victorious: And his Subjects injoy ſo much Liberty under him, as is abundantly ſufficient to make their lives pleaſant, and eaſie: And as the power of our Kings has not been known to degenerate into Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; ſo I wiſh and hope, that the Liberty of the People will never be turned into a froward petulancy, and contempt of the Royal Authority. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way of conſulting for the publick good, has been a very Antient uſage in all theſe parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and ſome Foot-ſteps of it are ſtill remaining in moſt of our Neighbouring Nations: But the Freedom and Dignity of thoſe Noble Aſſemblies has been no where ſo entirely preſerved, as it is in this. And the Benefits we might all receive from it, if not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our own Folly, are exceeding Great; I ſhall name a few that ſeem very apparent.</p>
            <p>And one is, That it tends directly to the increaſe of that Love, and care which ought to be betwixt a King and his People; for it gives them both the faireſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93828:8"/>
of knowing, and underſtanding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is always the Original Ground, and firſt occaſion of all good will, and kind inclination. And this being once produced, by the intercourſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, between the Sovereign, and his Subjects, will be eaſily preſerved in the Breaſt of the King, and may quickly be propagated, by the reſpective Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, through every Town, and County in the whole Kingdom. The ordinary Method of proceeding, in thoſe Honourable Aſſemblies, ſeems purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for the moſt happy procurement of this good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For when all the Nobility, and many of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Gentry meet together, from every quarter, they muſt needs be intimately acquainted with the State and concerns of all and every part of the Nation. And after they have conſidered, and agreed upon Bills for the Publick good and Intereſt; theſe cannot paſs into Acts, till they be ſtrengthened by the Royal aſlent; which being granted, is the moſt generous expreſſion of the King's Grace and Favour to his People, when he gives them Laws to be Governed by, which were propoſed, and adviſed for their particular advantage, by their own Repreſentatives. On the other ſide when the neceſſities of the Government have been intimated to the Parliament, and they freely conſent to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch Summs, as the occaſion requires; what might indeed be eſteemed but a Duty, may be received as a kindneſs. And here is the beſt Foundation imaginable for a mutual indearment: When the King lays the higheſt Obligations upon his People, by conſenting to ſuch Laws, as make for their eaſe and proſperity; and the People return their thanks for theſe Royal Favours,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93828:8"/>
by begging his acceptance of ſuch ſupplyes, as may be ſufficient to maintain the Dignity, and Power of the King. The advantages of ſuch a reciprocal Love and affection are ſo very great, and manifeſt, that it will not be neceſſary to mention more; but there are ſome which Spring from the ſame root, which may be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence of the excellency and wiſdom of our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It gives the greateſt ſecurity that can be had that the Publick Treaſure ſhall not be miſpent: Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miſapplication of what had been raiſed, is the only pretence that can be made uſe of for any back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to a further ſupply; but becauſe it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the generoſity of a great Prince, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh away the beſt expreſſions of his Peoples Gratitude, for the Liberties, and Protection they injoy under him.</p>
            <p>It affords the beſt incouragement to every man's private Induſtry, to make what improvement he can of his Eſtate; when he is aſſured that whatever he gains is his own Property, and that not one Farthing ſhall be demanded of him, without the Conſent of prudent and worthy Perſons, freely choſen and intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Body of the Nation. And Induſtry increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Wealth, and Wealth brings content, and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that injoy it, and preſerves the People in a proſperous, and flouriſhing condition.</p>
            <p>Beſides, our moſt excellent Conſtitution, might, if any thing can, ingage the minds of all men, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrained and chearful Obedience to the Laws:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93828:9"/>
Since our ſubmiſſion is required to nothing elſe, but what has been ſeriouſly weighed, and deliberately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, by Legal Repreſentatives, impowered to do it, by our own choice. And there can be no poſſible excuſe for the man, that will not be bound by his own Act; that refuſes Subjection to what has been, at leaſt implicitly, conſented to by every Free-holder in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now let any Man judge what an admirable Conſtitution it is, where the Prince and the Subject are ſtrongly ingaged to Love one another; where the Publick Treaſure is guarded by Loyalty, and Honour; where Induſtry is incouraged, as much as is poſſible; and where a chearful, and voluntary Obedience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed! Let other Nations call themſelves Free, Let potent Princes aſſume what Titles they pleaſe, there is none can boaſt of more Liberty, than the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man</hi> injoys; there is no Monarch more abſolute, and really Great, than a King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in the Hearts and affections of his People.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly mention'd ſome of the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and plain advantages of Parliaments, I ſhall in the next place ſhew you, What it is that too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinders the good effects they might otherwiſe have. And the general occaſion of this, Is a ſtrange notion, that has been almoſt univerſally ſpread, and will very hardly be rooted out of many mens minds, That the Court and the Country, the King and his Subjects are two quite different Intereſts. This has been ſlyly infinuated by ſome, and eaſily believed by others, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93828:9"/>
eagerly fomented by thoſe, whoſe profit, or Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made them deſirous of a Change. Such are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very forward to Diſcharge their private Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents upon the Government, and hope to advance themſelves, and repair their ſhattered Eſtates, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetling the Foundations of our Peace. But the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on which theſe men are wont to bear up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are manifeſtly vain, and ſupported by nothing, but a moſt palpable miſtake. The true Intereſt of a King, and his People is ſtill the ſame. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Intereſt of the People, that the King ſhould be in a condition to adminiſter Juſtice, and preſerve the Peace at home, and likewiſe to defend them from their Enemies abroad: And it is no leſs the Intereſt of the King, that the People ſhould thrive under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, be free from diſcontents, and in a capacity to contribute Liberally to the Publick neceſſities. What King could Reign happily, where the People were extremly poor and indigent, in danger of being ruined by a ſix months tax, and unable to give what the exigencies of State may require? And what Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could eſteem themſelves ſafe, where the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer were ſo low, and the King ſo ſtraitned, that he could not curb the inſolence of unquiet, and Seditious Spirits among his own Subjects; nor repulſe the force, and aſſaults of a Foreign Power? The thing is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding plain and abvious, that there is no man, but he may preſently perceive, how theſe Lines, which ſeem to be drawn from the moſt oppoſite parts of the Circumference, do meet at laſt, and muſt always cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſame Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93828:10"/>
But this notwithſtanding, there are ſome that would fain perſuade us, that the Diſtance betwixt them is ſo very great, that it is impoſſible they ſhould ever be united. And when they have practiſed upon the credulous Multitude, and made them believe it, their Heads are eaſily filled with a thouſand Jealouſies, and wonderful Chimera's. They are like Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſing Men, that draw Pictures in the Clouds, that can diſcover fiery Dragons, and moſt dreadful Apparitions in the cleareſt Sky. They are mightily troubled, not with any thing they ſee, or feel; but with very ſtrange imaginary Fears, created only by their own Fancies.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall indeavour to diſabuſe thoſe, if there be any ſuch, that do not yet ſee through the Deſign; And to this end I ſhall lay before you the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pretences, upon which theſe Jealouſies have been advanced. They are no other than what you have often heard; and it may be, you have been very much concerned about them; and there was Reaſon enough for it, if they had been true. We have been told therefore, of Grievances of the Subject; that our Liberties, and Properties, were like to be invaded; and that we were in imminent Danger of Arbitrary Power, and Popery. Theſe were the things with which the whole Nation was allarm'd; and the cry was ſometimes ſo ſtrong, and almoſt univerſal, that it might have ſomething diſcompoſed a very ſober, and ſteddy-minded Man: But when the fright was a little over, and he had time to recollect himſelf, he would quickly find, that he had no juſt ground to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93828:10"/>
much diſturbed with theſe terrible Apprehenſions: And that they were but like a fit of the Night-Mare, in which the Party affected Dreams he is ſo horribly oppreſſed, with ſome mighty Weight lying on him, that he can ſcarce fetch his Breath; when all the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is occaſioned, only by feculent Humors in his own Body, and groſs Blood too much thickened with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. But whatever they be, or from what cauſe ſoever they may ariſe, I ſhall briefly examine the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pretences that have been wont to be made.</p>
            <p>The moſt common and general is that of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; a Word of a looſe and uncertain Signification, and in Vulgar Acception implyes any thing, that any Man is diſpleaſed at, and can declaim againſt with ſome ſhew of a popular Zeal for the good of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And the Invective is always the eaſieſt part of Eloquence, at leaſt it makes the deepeſt Impreſſions on the Minds of thoſe, that are readily diſpoſed to entertain an ill Opinion of their Governours. But you know what ſort of Men they are, who if a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Boy do but tie a Straw about their Finger, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine preſently they are in Chains, and moſt heavily loaded with Bolts, and Irons. Complaints have run high, and the talk has been loud, but it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what Grievances we have ſuffered, ſince the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reſtitution of the Royal Line; unleſs it be, that our Trade has been incouraged, our Shipping and Navigation exceedingly increaſed, and that we have lived in plenty, and eaſe, and injoyed our own quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and been almoſt miraculouſly preſerved in Peace, by the great Wiſdom, and continual Care of a moſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93828:11"/>
Excellent Prince; when moſt of our Neighbours were haraſſed, and miſerably waſted with Fire and Sword, and felt the Extremities of a moſt Bloody and Cruel War. I cannot tell of any other Grievances but theſe; yet I will not deny but that there may poſſibly be ſome Inconveniences not formerly foreſeen, which may be provided againſt by future Acts. But if any ſuch ſhall be really found, and Bills prepared for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of them; no Man can have any Reaſon to doubt, but that His Majeſty will be ſo far from rejecting them, that he will be glad of that, and all other Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of Expreſſing the Paſſion he has for the Eaſe, and Satisfaction of his People. In the mean time, if we ſhall murmur and be diſcontented ſtill, and complain of Grievances, when we feel none, but what every Man's private Misfortune, or Negligence, or Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity has brought upon him; inſtead of the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as we are, if we could but be made ſenſible of it, we may be juſtly eſteemed the moſt fooliſh, repining, querulous, ungrateful People in the World.</p>
            <p>Another Pretence has been, that our Liberties and Properties were like to be invaded. Liberty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty are Words that chime well enough, and have been a great while yoaked together, and men have been taught to tune them over, in a moſt Lamentable note, as if all they had were ready to be ſeized on, and they hurried to Goal, and made abſolute Slaves and Beggers immediately. For this, if the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he may have been in will give him leave to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, let every man conſult but his own Experience. Has he ever been illegally impriſoned? Has any part
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93828:11"/>
of his Goods been violently wreſted from him? Has his Houſe been rifled? Have his Barns been Robbed? Have his Cattle been driven off his Ground? Has he Suffered any thing, under colour of Authority, that could not be juſtified by the known Laws? If he do not find himſelf to have been thus injured; or if he do, if the Courts be open, and ready to vindicate him, in a fair, and equal Tryal; he may then reaſonably conclude that neither his Perſon, nor Eſtate were in that hazard, which the Noiſe that was made, might incline him to imagine. For certainly our Liberties, and Properties are as well ſecured, as any thing on Earth can be; they have all the defence that Human Prudence could poſſibly give them: they are eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, and have been confirmed, and ratified, by the conſtant Practice, and many Gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of a long Succeſſion of excellent Princes. And we can have no greater Aſſurances than theſe, on this ſide Heaven. But if we have not too highly provoked Almighty God, by our great unthankfulneſs, for the many Bleſſings beſtowed upon us; but can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to truſt him with the Event, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Wiſdom for the Iſſues of the future; the Divine Providence might then be ingaged for our temporal Good, and the preſervation of thoſe many Earthly Felicities we now injoy. But our Fears, and Jealouſies are the moſt effectual way to defeat our Hopes, and put all in Diſorder; they provoke God, <hi>Who knows we have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. v. 25. 26, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>need of theſe things,</hi> and has forbidden us to diſturb our minds, with diſtracting Cares for what is to come; they highly diſoblige our Sovereign, by manifeſting an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and profeſſed Diſtruſt of his Royal Goodneſs, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93828:12"/>
Favour; and they certainly bereave us of the fruit of that happineſs we had in poſſeſſion, by racking our thoughts with vain ſurmizes of unknown evils, we conceit may poſſibly befall us hereafter. This weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and folly of our Nation, has not eſcaped the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Strangers. There is a little Book written ſome years ſince, and got into publick, I know not how, wherein the Author chalks out the way to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Empire. And among other remarks, he tells us, that, <hi>If the King be obliged to maintain ſtrong Garriſons,</hi> though for their neceſſary defence, <hi>this will make the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Traitté dela Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique de France. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>People of</hi> England <hi>believe, that he is forming great deſigns againſt their pretended Liberty:</hi> So he is pleaſed to call it. And this he obſerves, not without Reaſon, is one thing, that will contribute very much to the haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ruine. And if ſo, then thoſe that ſeemed ſo very full of Apprehenſions, that they would have had his late Majeſty's ordinary Guards diſbanded, did but purſue the Methods laid down in the <hi>French Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> and if there were any <hi>Penſioners,</hi> it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gueſſed, who they were; unleſs the Gentlemen had ſo great a Zeal for the Service, that they would do the work freely, without expecting any Wages for their pains. But they might pretend what they pleaſed for the ripening the Projects, they were then framing: Our Liberties we ſaw were not attempted, and God be praiſed, they remain unviolated ſtill; and are not in any Viſible Danger, unleſs we betray them our ſelves, by our own Groundleſs and Extravagant Fears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93828:12"/>
The next Pretence is not much unlike unto this; And it is, as we have been told, that we were in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of Arbitrary Power; that all things ſhould be managed by the preſent Will, and uncertain Humour of thoſe that Governed, and that our Lives and Fortunes ſtood continually expoſed to their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; juſt as we remember it was in the time of the late unhappy Confuſions. For anſwer to this we need but to examine again, and conſider, whether every thing has not been adminiſtred in the due Form and Courſe of Law; and then why ſhould we entertain theſe fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uncharitable ſuſpitions? Princes do well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that <hi>the Throne is eſtabliſhed by Rightiouſneſs;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 12.</note> and that it is their moſt unalterable Intereſt, to take care that Juſtice be duely, and impartially executed. They whom the Laws have ſettled in the higheſt place of Eminency, and Power, will always have a tender regard to thoſe Laws by which they Reign, and do ſupport their Royal Dignity, and Prerogatives. But all that invade the ſupream Authority by Uſurpation, muſt needs be Arbitrary. They ſeat themſelves by force at the Helm, they come in with a ſtorm; and the Violence of the tempeſt unavoidably daſhes the Veſſel upon this Rock. What they have gotten ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally cannot be managed according to Law. What was the purchaſe of the Sword, muſt of neceſſity be maintained by the Sword. Intruding Powers will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the moſt Arbitrary, and Tyrannical. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Princes have a kind Sympathy for their Subjects; and are ſenſibly affected with any Miſeries, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences they ſuffer; as the pain of every Member, is immediately felt by the Head. But an Uſurper is not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93828:13"/>
ſuch a Sympathizing, but a Rider, as it were, of the Body Politick; he leaps into the Saddle, and puts on Furiouſly, and Whips, and Spurrs without any Mercy to the poor Creature he has got under him. He comes at firſt with his fair Promiſes, and ſmooth Pretences, and, it may be, inveighs moſt vehemently againſt Arbitrary Power, and Invaſion of the Rights of the People. But it is time to look to your Money, when the Pick-pockets bid you, have a care of your Purſes. There was never any great Cry made about this Arbitrary Power, and the like, but that they who opened the loudeſt againſt it, had a deſign to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it themſelves. It is beyond all queſtion; we have ſeen the thing effectually experimented, more than once. We have reaſon therefore to be always Jealous of theſe ſeeming Zealots for the Publick good; but there can never be any juſt occaſion of ſuſpecting our Prince; eſpecially ſince his Majeſty has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſure us: <hi>That he cannot wiſh to be a Greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, then the Laws of</hi> England <hi>are ſufficient to make Him.</hi> Which moſt Gracious expreſſion, if we had no other Arguments for our Confidence, were alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly enough to quiet all Men's fears, as to this Particular.</p>
            <p>But yet we have been farther told, that there is great danger of our being ſuddenly over-run with Popery. This indeed is a thing, if it were true, that might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill the minds of all ſober men with very ſad appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. But you know that it was this very pretence, that was made uſe of to bring on and ſtrengthen the late Rebellion. The People were then generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93828:13"/>
to believe, that the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> was, at leaſt, Popiſhly affected; but when they had deſtroyed, or Eclipſed it, by theſe malicious ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeconded by the force of Arms; how very few were there of that Communion who did then revolt to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they lay under the ſtrongeſt temptations! Nay did they not even then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the preſſures, and difficulties they were in, moſt ſtoutly oppoſe all Popiſh Innovations, and write moſt learnedly, and convincingly againſt them? And if the Prieſts, or others of that Church ſhould nouriſh a vain hope, and imagin they had gotten ſome preſent advantage; and ſhould be thereby incouraged to try their Arts of Inſinuation, and begin to practiſe upon the weakneſs, and credulity of the Vulgar; I do not doubt, but they would quickly find very great Numbers, who, by the Grace of God, would be ready, and able to incounter them with Succeſs, and expoſe their Fallacies, and evidence to the World, that the Additions that have been made to the Creed, are inconſiſtent to Scripture, Reaſon and Antiquity, and that it is our Church, as it is now by Law Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that does conſtantly maintain the true, and Antient Catholick Faith. So that there cannot be that appearance of Danger here, which ſome have very uncharitably ſuſpected. Beſides we have the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Security of the Laws, all on the ſide of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and at once to baniſh the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fears, and moſt unreaſonable Jealoufies, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty has been pleaſed to give us his moſt Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will <hi>always take care to defend and ſupport it.</hi> And who can entertain the leaſt doubt of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93828:14"/>
of his Royal Word? Flattery, and Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are baſe, and plebeian Vices, that can never gain Admittance in a Noble and Generous Mind. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him that ſpeaks, gives a proportionable Value, and Credit to what he ſays; and the word of a King ought to be eſteemed as ſacred, and inviolable as his Perſon. And when we have the Word of a King, and ſuch a King as was never known to fail of his Word, it is the vileſt Ingratitude, and the higheſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and Diſhonour we can do him, not to reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſatisfied, but to expreſs a diſtruſt, where he has given us the greateſt Aſſurances Imaginable. For to conceive that a Prince of the moſt unſpotted Honour, and unqueſtionable Generoſity, ſhould ſo often, and ſo ſolemnly declare, what he did not really intend, and firmly reſolve to perform, is little leſs then a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: I am ſure it is far beyond the ordinary rate of a Moral impoſſibility. And they that will not be convinced by this, ſtand in need of dayly Miracles to create a Belief. But God be praiſed we have great Reaſon to be full of Hopes; for the danger of the prevailing of Popery, for ought we can ſee, is chiefly ſeated in our own cowardly, and miſtruſtful Fancies: unleſs it ſhould pleaſe God to puniſh us, for pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too great a ſollicitude for the future; which is a degree of Infidelity towards him, and in this Caſe, the moſt unpardonable indignity, and diſreſpect to our Soveraign.</p>
            <p>I have touched upon all the moſt common Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have been made uſe of to ingender Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the King, and his People; and they all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93828:14"/>
appear to be great miſtakes, or vain ſurmizes. The truth is, they have been uſually promoted, for the carrying on of ſome Deſign. Some that have raiſed the loudeſt Clamours, had been diſcontented on ſome Occaſion, or other, and did it only to be revenged on the Government: Some intended to Signalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by bold Speeches, and hoped to be ſilenced by Places at Court: And ſome, it is to be feared, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by this means to put all things in Confuſion, and then expected to enrich themſelves, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Shares of plundered Goods, and Malignant Lands. But however it were, if a prevailing Party could but be poſſeſſed with theſe Jealouſies, they might be able, to be ſure, to intangle Matters of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance, and obſtruct the moſt weighty Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And I now come to mind you of the Pernicious Conſequences of this. For as the Conſtitution of this Kingdom is the moſt happy, that Human Prudence can Invent, when there is a bleſſed Harmony, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, between the Head, and the Members: ſo it is the moſt unfortunate, and deplorable of all, when ſuch miſ-underſtandings ariſe, as cannot be ſpeedily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. Theſe will beget a perpetual ſtruggling, and very dangerous Convulſions in the State. Jealouſies will be increaſed, and theſe will give a check to the moſt material Debates, that they will hardly be brought to any good Iſſue. When a chearful concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King's moſt Reaſonable Demands, ſhall be obſtinately refuſed, out of I know not what Fear; he cannot be well pleaſed with the Diſappointment.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93828:15"/>
And when Parliaments return Home full of Diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, whether they be Juſt, or no, the ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, inſtead of making a kind Conſtruction of their Princes Actings, as they ſhould in Duty do, will be too apt many times to ſow their own private Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents all the Country over; and the Multitude will be eaſily impreſſed with ſuſpitious Thoughts, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there are ſome very ſtrange Deſigns upon them. This will breed ſecret Animoſities, which will ſoon diſcover themſelves in Words, or Actions; and then the King cannot be ſecure of their Obedience, but will be forc'd to have a watchful Eye upon all their Motions. And there needs no more, but this mutual Diſtruſt, to make this Nation Miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>But I will further evince this in the Grand Inſtance of Pecuniary Supplies. Theſe every Man knows are frequently Neceſſary for the ſupport of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Defence of the Kingdom; and if they be with-held in ſome Junctures, muſt undoubtedly prove of very Fatal and Ruinous Conſequence to both. For the Laws have given the King the Sole Power of Peace, and War; on the other ſide, no extraordinary Levies are to be made, without the Advice and Conſent of Parliament: So that the one hath the whole Power of the Sword, and the Purſe is born by the other; and it may be very well, ſo long as a good accord can be maintained betwixt them. But if a Difference ſhould be ſtarted, which cannot be adjuſted in time; this would lead directly to the Subverſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and might be made the ſad Occaſion of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93828:15"/>
bringing the whole Nation into Slavery. The thing is Plain and Viſible to every Eye: For when the Sword is put into the Prince's Hand, if the People ſhould wantonly bind the Arm, or cut the Sinews, by which it ſhould be managed; he muſt either let it drop to the Ground, or it might be wreſted from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſiſtance. Suppoſe the King ingaged in a War, and the neceſſary Supplies for the carrying it on, ſhould be ſtiffly denyed; what muſt be the Event of ſuch an obſtinate Refuſal? The Enemy would be hereby mightily heartned, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Courage extreamly damped; many favourable Opportunities of Action muſt be loſt; many Dammages ſuffered that might have been prevented; none but a very faint Oppoſition could be made; we might poſſibly linger out a while, like a man in a deep Conſumption, and be forced at length to yield to the pleaſure of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Conqueror, or to ſtrike up a Peace on ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable Terms, as could be procured; which if the ſame Retentive Humor ſhould ſtill continue, he would be tempted to break upon any trifling pretence; and then the ſame Inconveniences, and Dangers, would return again. Or if we could be ſecured from theſe, yet the Poverty of a Prince might Incourage daring and Seditious Spirits, among his own Subjects, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a Rebellion, and to deſtroy all by Civil and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Broyls. I ſpeak not this out of any preſent Apprehenſions I have, that ſuch Miſeries are like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us now: For, God be praiſed, we have a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign fo excellently adorn'd, with all Accompliſhments befitting that high Station, that are ſufficient to make all both at Home, and Abroad, very careful how they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93828:16"/>
become his Enemies; and I hope we ſhall have a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of that Wiſdom and Sobriety, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute what ſhall be needful to make His Power to be feared, and His Allyance valued, and to contain His Subjects within the Bounds of their Allegiance: But what I was ſaying was only to intimate what a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Condition we might be brought into, in Caſe the Money neceſſary for our Defence, ſhould be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately denyed. It might be the Occaſion of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Ruin; by infeebling the Nation, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it weak and naked to Foreign Invaſion, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Inſurrections. And either way, it tends ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to the total Diſſolution of the Government: which muſt involve all in endleſs and inextricable Calamities. This ſeems very evident of it ſelf, but I ſhall illuſtrate it a little by two very pregnant Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>The one ſhall be fetched out of the Hiſtory of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Age, and Countrey: And it is what is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this purpoſe, from the ſacking of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the Great, and Cruel <hi>Mahomet.</hi> When the Tyrant had advanced his Forces to the Walls of that Mighty City, and began to preſs it very hard; the diſtreſſed Emperor within was forced to go about himſelf, from Houſe to Houſe, begging and intreating the Wealthy Citizens, with Tears in his Eyes, that they would conſider the Danger, that was then at their very Doors, and lend their Aſſiſtance for the neceſſary Defence of the Place, in that great Extremity. But all in vain, nothing could move them; they make Excuſes, plead Poverty, and murmur at that little they had already
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93828:16"/>
expended for the publick ſafety. Upon this the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is taken by general Aſſault; the unfortunate Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror trodden to Death in the Crowd; their Houſes are ranſacked, and an incredible Maſs of Treaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in them, which fell all into the Enemies Hands, who ſcorn'd and derided their preverſe Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in hoarding up the Whole for them, when thry could not afford their Natural Prince a ſmall Part, in his and their own moſt deplorable Neceſſity: They are ſlaughtered by heaps in the fury of the Storm; the Perſons of the beſt Quality that eſcaped then, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be Butchered in cold Blood, after they had ſeen their deareſt Relations ſuffer the greateſt Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before their Eyes; and the poor remainder of thoſe that were left alive, are made pitiful Slaves to the Savage, and Inhuman <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Thus that proud and ſtately City, which had been the Seat of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Empire above a thouſand Years, became a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Greatneſs, and remains a ſtanding Monument to the eternal Shame and Infamy of the beſotted <hi>Greeks,</hi> who rather than part with a very ſmall Proportion of their Eſtates, loſt all, ſaw their Country laid Defolate, their Friends Slain, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Innocent Poſterity wilfully betrayed into the moſt Miſerable Thraldom. This is the Effect of ſo much good Huſbandry, when the welfare of the Publick lies at Stake.</p>
            <p>I will take the other Example from home, and from what has happened within the Memory of many now living. That bleſſed Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> at his coming to the Crown found himſelf ingaged in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93828:17"/>
a War, which for want of ſuch ſupplies as were largely promiſed, met with a very unhappy Concluſion. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſ-adventures there were, proceeding chiefly from the ſame Cauſe, which did very much impair the reputation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, and Conduct. This made us but meanly eſteemed by our Neighbours, and ſome of them hereupon began to diſpute the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Seas; nay the <hi>Algerines,</hi> nothing ſo ſtrong then, as they are now, had yet the boldneſs to ride in the very Channel, and ſometimes to come on Shoar, and take whole Families out of their Beds, and carry them away into the moſt wretched Captivity; and if an inconſiderable Neſt of Pyrates were ſo far incouraged by them, what might have been expected, if a more potent Enemy had taken the Advantage of the Neceſſities we were then in? But theſe Miſchiefs being pretty well provided againſt, by the Care and Vigilancy of the King; at length came the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Forty One; who being animated unto it by the King's wants, and moſt ingratefully abuſing the greateſt Conceſſions that were ever made to any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, brought on the late Unnatural War; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the moſt Execrable Murder of that Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince; and after all the glorious Cryes about Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the like, we found our ſelves wheadled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an abſolute Bondage, to a ſtanding Veteran Army, and a pack of the moſt Notorious Villains, that could be picked out of the whole Nation. The thing is true, and the Words cannot ſeem harſh unto any, but ſuch as approve the Fact, and would be glad to ſee the ſame Tragedy acted over again. But he that ſhall well conſider this, will not ſtand in need of any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93828:17"/>
other Arguments to convince him, of what lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſequence it may be, when Parliaments will not be induced to comply with the Juſt and neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Soveraign; it lays us open to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Strangers, and the Deſigns of wicked Men among our ſelves; it leads to the ruin of the Government, and expoſes us to the inexpreſſible miſeries of Slavery, and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Now that I have ſhewn you what it is that ſometimes hinders the good effects that Parliaments might have; and what the deſtructive and pernicious Conſequences of that are; you may eaſily gueſs what kind of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers I ſhould adviſe you to chooſe. And every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being ſo well ſtored with great variety of Loyal and Worthy Gentlemen, you would be now wholly inexcuſable if you ſhould fail in your Elections; and inſtead of diſcreet and judicious Perſons who would be able to create a good underſtanding between the King, and his People, you ſhould ſend up Men open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſaffected, who would make it their buſineſs to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Jealouſies, and turn your Brains, and make them Swim with idle ſuſpitions. This would be the way to defeat our hopes, and obſtruct that happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of all our Fears, which we expect from the meeting of this Parliament, which is now at Hand.</p>
            <p>For prevention of this you ſhould be perſwaded to make choice of men of Good, at leaſt competent, and ſound Eſtates. For the neceſſitous are the moſt lyable to the temptation of being corrupted, and byaſſed any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93828:18"/>
way with the hopes of a little gain. If you are indeed affraid of <hi>Piſtoles,</hi> there are none ſo like to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by that kind of Arms, as men of mean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Fortunes. But ſetting that conſideration aſide; it is in it ſelf an unbecoming thing, that they ſhould have any power of laying Taxes upon other men, who cannot, or will not pay their own Debts; that any ſhould be ſuffered to get into the Houſe, only to be protected from their Creditors; and take Sanctuary at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to eſcape the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi> But I ſuppoſe ſuch as theſe will not be forward to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, or if they ſhould, you that know them will eaſily put them by.</p>
            <p>In the next place therefore you ſhould be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious that you do not favour any, whom you can ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have the leaſt taint of the Bill of Excluſion: A Bill of a moſt daring, and dangerous Nature; and ſuch a one in many reſpects, as was never brought into Parliament before; you can ſcarce imagin what a heap of miſeries you eſcaped, when it was bravely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely rejected in the Houſe of Lords. You are now God be praiſed, in perfect Peace; you poſſeſs your own quietly, and converſe together with a Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kindneſs, and Familiarity. But if that deſperate Bill had taken place, you had at this moment been ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Swords in one anothers Bowels; you had ſeen your Houſes in a Flame, the Country ſmoaking round about you, your Cities and Towns laid in Aſhes; and been ſubject to all the Calamities that the moſt Bloody Civil War could bring upon you. For Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to be Voted out of their unqueſtionable
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93828:18"/>
Rights, nor debarred of their inheritance by a Scrowl of Parchment. A Title to the Crown was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> Thoſe Diſputes cannot be ended, but in the Field; and of all the Nations in the World, <hi>England</hi> has the greateſt reaſon to dread the ſtarting of ſuch a Controverſie. The Competition betwixt the Houſes of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> coſt us dear. Look into your Chronicles, and ſee what Lamentable devaſtations were every where made! How many cruel Battles were fought! How many thouſands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> lives were ſpent in the Quarrel! How many Ages almoſt the wound was kept bleeding, and never fully cloſed, till the happy Succeſs, and happier Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh!</hi> What can you expect from thoſe that had the confidence to attempt the Interruption of the Royal Line, and to dig up the ſureſt Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Legal Settlement? They that were for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding our Gracious Sovereign, might quickly ſtretch their deſtractive Principles a little farther, and be eaſily induced to aſſault him now, that, by the Bleſſing of God, he is peaceably Seated on the Throne of his Anceſtors. But I truſt that the ſame Providence which placed him there, will continue to defend him, from the Subtilty and violence of all His, and our Enemies. And I cannot but believe that you will be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how you give thoſe a freſh opportunity of doing miſchief, that would have ſuddenly plunged you into the moſt miſerable Confuſions.</p>
            <p>But after you have delivered your ſelves from the Fear of theſe; be ſure you put none in their room, but men of approved Wiſdom, and Integrity. None
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93828:19"/>
elſe can be ſafely intruſted with any concern; but theſe, you may ſecurely venture your Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in their hands. Theſe will be able to foreſee a Danger, and willing, and ready to prevent it; they will conſider all circumſtances, and weigh every thing impartially, and carry themſelves evenly between the King and the Subject. They will preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any inconveniencies the People may lye under, and prepare ſuitable Bills for the remedying of them. When the King's occaſions require their aid, they will grant it freely, without pinching any thing from him. They are not impoſed on by that great miſtake, which ſeems too common, as if they were always to drive a kind of Bargain with their Prince: So much ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for ſo much Prerogative. This is unkind, and diſobliging, and a very unequal way of Dealing. For money that is given, may be gotten again; <hi>Bulloin</hi> may be imported, and the Circulation of Trade will bring it in: But the Prerogative once diminiſhed can hardly be repaired; there is no trucking for ſuch Goods; our Merchants cannot furniſh us with this ſort of Commodity from the Coaſts of <hi>Gninea,</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> At this rate the greateſt Prerogative might be ſoon exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; and a King ſome years, if he could be ſuppoſed to be ſo eaſie, might ſell away the whole Regal Power. But Sovereigns have as much reaſon to be careful of the Prerogative, as the People can have to be Jealous of any Right or Property whatſoever. Nay the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves, if they would but underſtend it, are equally concerned in the preſervation of it. For it is the main foundation of their Security; and they that ſhould Fooliſhly go about to undermine it, would find
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93828:19"/>
it fall heavy upon their own Heads. Without a full Power of Calling and Diſſolving Parliaments, of Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Rejecting Bills; of Raiſing, and Diſbanding Forces; of Pardoning Offenders, and Executing Juſtice, nothing could be rightly managed. A Prince that ſhould be deveſted of ſuch an Authority, would be no more but a Royal Statue; he muſt be render'd weak, and contemptible to all, and utterly unable to defend his People. Of this Wiſe and Honeſt men will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible; and no other will be choſen by thoſe, that have any value for their own private, as well as the Publick ſafety.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place you ſhould be very careful to chooſe men of known affection to the eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>England.</hi> A Church againſt which there cannot lye the leaſt juſt exception; that has purged it ſelf from the errors, and abuſes which a long tract of time had by degrees brought in, and mixed with the Primitive Practice, and Belief; that has been always highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by all the Reformed beyond the Sea's; and thoſe at home that have profeſſed a Diſſent from it, have generally approved the Doctrine of it; and the controverſie, how high ſoever it may have been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has been only about matters of external Diſcipline, and the refuſing Obedience to a few Indifferent Rites. And that which, it may be, is a Glory Peculiar to this <hi>Church,</hi> no Member of it has been ever known to be inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in any Rebellion againſt their Prince. His Majeſty is very ſenſible of this, and has publickly ſignified, how ſatisfyed and aſſured he is of our Loyalty, and has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſupport us; and you cannot then better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93828:20"/>
your hearty thanks, for the Gracious Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he has made you, then by the ſhewing your Zeal for that Church, which he has taken into his Royal Protection. There are none of any other Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt us, who have not either openly abetted ſome Factious Deſign; or given too great occaſion of ſuſpecting their Fidelity to the Crown. And if any of you ſhould be prevailed with, upon any pretence, to make choice of any ſuch Perſons; you muſt not think it ſtrange, if it ſhould be looked upon as a manifeſt Teſtimony of your Diſaffection to the King. For if ſuch as theſe ſhould creep into the Houſe through your careleſneſs, or credulity, it is like enough that they would ſoon fall to their old Practice, of amuſing men's minds with the moſt horrible Fears, and Jealouſies, they could poſſibly invent; and theſe are a kind of Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, very eaſily kindled, but exceeding hard to be put out: And how then would you be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your ſelves from the Guilt of the infinite miſchiefs that might follow, if by theſe means any miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhould ariſe, which might blaſt the hopes we have conceived, and prevent that univerſal ſatisfaction which is expected from the Prudence, and Loyalty of the Inſuing Parliament? But I need not uſe any further Arguments here, your own ſafety will beſt Admoniſh you what to do. Many of you in your Addreſſes, both formerly, and of late, have Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed to Elect none but Loyal men; and if you ſhould do otherwiſe, thoſe very Addreſſeſs would remain as the moſt diſhonourable Records of your fickelneſs, and inconſtancy. The King will never violate his Word he has given to you; and you are bound to be as good
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93828:20"/>
as yours, you have paſſed to Him, if you have any regard to you Credit, Intereſt, or Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I have now taken the Freedom to Communicate ſome of my moſt ſerious Thoughts unto you, with Reference eſpecially to the preſent Conjuncture. It is not any forwardneſs to buſie my ſelf with Matters of this Nature, that has occaſioned the Publication of theſe haſty Conceptions, but that I might remove a falſe Imputation. I have therefore ſhewn you what an Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Eſteem we have for Parliaments; what great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we might reap from them; what are the moſt common hinderances of the good Effect they might have; and what are the Miſchievous Conſequences that follow from thence: And upon this Occaſion I could not forbear to offer ſome Friendly Advice for the preventing thoſe Evils which ſuch Miſcarriages might bring upon us. I have not troubled you with things of a nice Conſideration, but ſuch as are eaſie and obvious to every Man's Notice; and no more, I believe, than what you your ſelves have thought, and often diſcourſed with one another; and if theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhould chance to come to your Hands, after ſome of your Elections may be paſt, I hope you will have followed the ſame Counſel, before you had it from me; and that inſtead of Advice what to do, this may be but a juſt Commendation for what you have done. You may perceive all along, that my chief Aim has been to root out thoſe Cauſeleſs Jealouſies, which may often endanger the publick Peace. Theſe are always to be carefully avoided: They are the very Bane, and Peſt of all Societies: They are like the Fits of the Cholick;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93828:21"/>
they afflict us with the moſt ſharp, and intollerable pains, and tear our very Bowels, and yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from nothing but a light, and flatulent Humor. They are the moſt dangerous Rock, againſt which our faireſt Hopes have been many times moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſplit. And if any of theſe ſhould be caſt in, and cheriſhed in this Parliament, they might breed that Allienation of Affections, which the wiſeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of many Years might hardly retrieve. The firſt tincture that is given, is ſcarce ever wholly to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out. But God forbid that any ſuch thing as this ſhould happen unto us. The Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are upon you, expecting the Event of this next Seſſion. If it ſhould have that agreeable Concluſion we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves, it might by the Bleſſing of God, not only ſecure our own ſelves, but tend to the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Neighbouring Countreys round about us: But if it ſhould be ended in any Diſcontent, who can foreſee the many ſad Conſequences of that? This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, our Friends would be exceedingly diſcouraged, and our Enemies grow unſufferably inſolent, and ſcorn and deride us for it, while they made their greateſt Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Folly. It is in your Power to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the prevention of this, by the Elections you are making. You have a Prince of the moſt approved Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Reſolution; that is the Bleſſing of this and the Envy of other Nations; that is able to ſtrike a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into his Enemies; that has often hazarded his Life for your ſakes; and ſtill to expreſs what a tenderneſs he has for you, he has lately, and the very firſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, endeavoured to give all poſſible Eaſe and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to your Minds by his moſt Gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93828:21"/>
Shew how ſenſible you are of the higheſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that can be laid upon Subjects. Send him up Men that will aſſiſt him in the Brave and Generous Deſigns he has entertained for the publick Good; and not Cavil away their time in impertinent Scruples, and never bring any thing to an Iſſue. His Majeſty has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had the Felicity of <hi>David,</hi> that in all Acts of Government, <hi>Whatſoever the King has done, has pleaſed all the People:</hi> I wiſh that by your prudent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 36.</note> Behaviour the Propoſition may be happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>That all that the People ſhall do, may pleaſe the King:</hi> That ſo both King and People may live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mutual Love, and Confidence one of another; that the Government may be preſerved, our Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion maintained, the Glory, Strength, and Riches of the Nation dayly increaſed; and that theſe Bleſſings may be always continued to the preſent, and all ſucceeding Generations: And to this there is no true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but will hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
