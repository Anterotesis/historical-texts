         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The meruaile of <hi>Cos, Hippocrates</hi> hath taught vs, that the moſt perfect bodyes are thoſe, which haue leſſe heate then moiſture. Whereupon, the great ſonne of kings, Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> three times together reprooued <hi>Galen,</hi> who held, that heate is cheefeſt in the building of all things, as maintaining, that moyſture is onely fomented and ſeaſoned by the heate.

Like matter could neuer men ſet downe of themſelues, albeit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were Authours of the legends: for theyr martirologe containes ſo few of them (making compariſon with that of women) as the very wiſeſt tearme theyrs but a meere vanity, diſpearſed among the veritie of the Saintes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. The Church it ſelfe is reſembled to a woman without ſpot or blemiſh,
<pb facs="tcp:6042:27"/>
ſuch as <hi>Salomon</hi> deſcribes the Princeſſe of Aegypt, a figure of the Church. In the new Teſtament yee may note the three <hi>Maries,</hi> and the Chananean, who were ſo conſtant in their holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the bleſſed ſpirit (being ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the ſacred hiſtory) hath left them a ſpectacle to all poſterities. The mother of the ſeauen Martires, wherof deſcription is made in the <hi>Machabees,</hi> deliuered ſuch witneſſe of her truely tearmd celeſtiall confidence, as that onely acte might beautifie the hiſtory of vertuous women, more then men can gleane glory, from the conſtant reſolution of <hi>Abraham, Moyſes</hi> or <hi>Iob</hi>: all which deſerue not the tytle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, becauſe a little detection did in ſome ſort touch them.</p>
            <p>As firſt to begin with <hi>Abraham</hi> for a leaſing, who ſaid that his wife was his Siſter, only for a little feare of death, much more ſuſpected, then any way prepared. Next for diſtruſt, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſaid to the Lord: <hi>Howe may it

be, that I ſhould preſent my ſelfe before</hi> Pharoah, <hi>ſeeing J can hardly abſtaine from ſtammering? Js it poſſible that I ſhould deliuer this meſſage?</hi> Then for murmuring, as <hi>Job,</hi> who ſtood expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating with the eternall. Which minde neuer came neere the Virgin of Virgins, for ſhe ſaid: <hi>I am the ſeruant of the Lord, be it vnto mee according to his word. Abraham, Moiſes</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> were but weake in reſolution, if one ſhould compare them with that vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, mother to theſe 7. Martires who ſuffered as many paines, as ſhe ſaw di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of torments applied, to ruinate and ouerthrow the conſtancy of her Sons: yea, ſhe did ſollace her ſelfe in ſuch ſort among the rigours of theyr martirdome, with ſuch behauiour and ſpeeches in contempt of death, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of better condition in the life ſucceeding; as they all were euen ſorry they could dye but once. In ſooth I muſt needs ſay, that the very greateſt matter among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither is or can be,
<pb facs="tcp:6042:28"/>
but the remainder &amp; ouerplus of this one womans glory, who practiſed the ſame in her ſelf, which ſhe had taught to her Sons: for ſhe dyed ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> (the very abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kings) became enraged (as it were) to ſee a ſimple woman mocke him and all his angry threatnings, no way able to enforce her from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, after which ſhe ſighed &amp; longed, euen to the lateſt office of her vitall powers. The daughter of <hi>Jeptah</hi> ſhal giue end to this diſcourſe, becauſe ſhe concluded the raſh vow of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch reſolution, as the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of her own life: for which, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ye to read the hiſtory in the Iudges, for better ſight of her death, then drowne my paper in iuſt teares, which freſh reuiued pitty of ſo ancient a maruel, would forcibly compel to fal from mine eies, ſo to conceale by wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, what I could not ſet downe in writing, Thus much reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy, which makes me ſtand

in doubt, whether I ſhould erect the ſame on any other collom or no, then their own greatnes &amp; deſerts, as more needing imitation, then any witnes, &amp; therfore more requiring to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then can be by words witneſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually: For me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (malitiouſly iealous of womens honor) haue buried (as much as in them lay) the moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeds of ſuch, to whom themſelues were no otherwiſe then Apes, nay worſe imitators, if worſe may bee.

who but <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> among Phiſitions, <hi>Hippocrates</hi>: amongſt the auncient diuines, <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>: in our latter times, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>: of Aſtronomers, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>: of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, <hi>Archimedes</hi>: of Ciuillians, <hi>Papinian</hi>: all which had (euen then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing) two, nay three or foure women in their owne Artes, to whome I will ſend them ſeuerally to ſchoole, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the chiefeſt principles in their ſciences. <hi>Homere</hi> was taught by <hi>Clorinda</hi> the Samian, in the Citty of Argos, and to her hath bin attributed that ſo famous worke of the Illiads: &amp; would ye but compare his Odiſſeaes therwith, you ſhould finde ſuch a large difference in one ſtile, ſo much rebated in the diſcourſe of <hi>Vliſſes</hi>: as you wold be conſtrained to confeſſe, that eyther the firſt is none of his, or els hee made neither the one nor other.

            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, hee is not to be extolled beyond the Sibilles, all which propheſied of the true Meſſias the Son of God ſo euidently, as there is not a text in the olde Teſtament, more expreſſe then their propheticall writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were.

               <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was as ignorant in the reaſon of the Seas ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> vntill he had ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction therein, by <hi>Dyoris</hi> the wyfe of one <hi>Barquerot</hi> of Pyrea: ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the originall of the Iſles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girting neere to the firme land, where

the borrowing waues ſeemed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their waye by ſome violent meanes.</p>
            <p>He learned the cauſes of coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great Planets, and their times, of a woman Gardiner of <hi>Smir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> by whome likewiſe hee came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the deepeſt ſecrets of the Meteores. <hi>Archimedes</hi> was moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by <hi>Tyanea</hi> the Syracuſaine, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing rudely ſaid, that all bodyes were ſuperficiall: which ſhe ſhewed to bee falſe, by the Atomies and coullers in the ayre. <hi>Lachis</hi> of Athens, daughter to <hi>Megeſteus,</hi> ordained lawes to the people of Attica, which were ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and commodious: as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines receiued them naturally for their own limitting them vnto twelue tables, wherein there was contayned more iuſtice and pietie, then in all the volumes of <hi>Papinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was too blaine (in this ſerious purpoſe) to forget Oratours, ſuch as were <hi>Demoſthenes, Aeſchines, Jſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:6042:32"/>
and manye other amonge the Grecians; <hi>Cicero, Hortenſius, Marke Anthonie, &amp;c.</hi> of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</p>
            <p>Moſt true is it, that this my forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes had been infinitely aduantageable for men, who likewiſe heerein are not exempt from theyr naturall imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beeing ouer much weake in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to women.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> of whome it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that if the Goddes would ſpeake Greeke in Orations, they could no waye amend the ſweete elocution of this Oratour: yet was hee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, hearing <hi>Lais</hi> diſcourſe of men and womens perticuler affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as hee cryed out; that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians did but ſtammer in theyr Schooles, and women at Corinthe ſpake Oratours-like in theyr familiar conferences.</p>
            <p>To confirme this, Nature teacheth vs, that women are or may be moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent, conſidering the organes and
<pb facs="tcp:6042:33"/>
inſtruments of theyr voyce is more mylde and gentle, then thoſe in men, whoſe pronunciation is very rough, ſharpe and coorſely ſhapte, by reaſon of the aboundance of choller, which (with their woords) driues foorth ſo much vehemencie of ſpirit, as they are well neere choakt therewith, or breake their winde in vttering of their ſpeeche: yet wee muſt confeſſe, that melancholly men are ſofter in words, then the ſwarthie and ſanguine, ſuch ſeuerall qualities remaine in men.</p>
            <p>The nature of a woman being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſadneſſe, diſcouers wiſedom, makes her prudent and apprehenſiue: whereas men are commonly raſhe and vnrulye, becauſe diuers appetites tranſport them, to many friuolous and fleeting conſiderations, which migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie faulte you ſhall finde fewe women, or none at all infected with. In lyke manner, your high and ſoueraigne Courtes, are nothing elſe but filled with mens continuall tumults, whence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6042:33"/>
enſue iniurious offences to theyr bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and that in matters of ſo meane reckoning, as womens modeſtie are aſhamed thereof, and theyr height of ſpirit holdes it in moſt deepe diſdaine.</p>
            <p>Oh moſt happye ſexe, if it were lawfull for me to ſpeake, as <hi>Plato</hi> did, who thanked the Gods for making him a man, and not a beaſt: ſo could I haue wiſhed, that I had beene created a woman, hauing attayned to ſuch knowledge of feminine perfections, which is in euery reſpect accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, beyond all that can be tearmed perfect in humaine defects.</p>
            <p>But returne wee to our Oratours, leauing the Aſſe, eares and all, to them that perſwade themſelues to be more eloquent then women: from whome the ſweete Nightingale firſt learned her notes, as Pyes, Crowes and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens tooke theyrs from men, into which ſhapes they haue likewiſe been tranſformed, as the onely beſt forme the Greeke and Latine Poets could

giue them. You ſhall many times read, that the Gods haue made complaint to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> eyther of men, or their bad conditions, and could neuer gaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of theyr deſires; ſo groſſe and abſurde were they in theyr Orations, in regarde of the Goddeſſes, who were neuer ſent backe but fully ſatiſfied, euen in thoſe things which humaine iuſtice made a conſcience of graunting; ſo much well-ſpeaking women haue preuayled, aboue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauorie barking of rude men.

Many diſeaſes haue beene cured, by the very behoulding of Women that came to viſite the

parties. When the ayre and Sunne is obſcured from the Tartares, as it is a caſe that often befalles them: they teare foorth the eyes of ſome woman ſlaue, thereby to ouercome the firſt charme of darkeneſſe, &amp; ſo to haue the Sunne ſeene againe in theyr Horizon. It is very true, that they neuer vſe this but on great neceſſities, as when they ſeeke after gaine, or when they haue loſt ſome battaile: and thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde is that ſlaue made free, and maintained at the charges of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon purſſe.</p>
            <p>The Perſians ſo mightily feared the graces hid in theyr womens eyes, as when any Lady or other ſhould come before their Iudges; they would turne their backes, and not looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Philocus</hi> was reproched by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> for his ouermuch follie in loouing <hi>Latmia</hi>; he anſwered him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thou thy ſelfe hadſt but once behelde her eyes, thou wouldſt chide me, and

For this cauſe, the Italians will neuer ſuffer theyr wiues to go with their faces vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: ſo much they ſtand in feare, leaſt others ſhould loue them better then they themſelues doe. Wherfore, euen as the braine is the ſeate of the ſoule, and the throne of loue is placed in a womans eye: ſo may we call it the bright burning beacon, or rather the perfect load-ſtarre, to direct the way, in the Sea of our inconſtant hearts and cogitations.

            <p>Why then heereby I may conclude, that euen as the Sunne hath more light in his vnitie, then all the ſtarres in number haue together: ſo the very eye of a woman containes more

graces in it, then is to bee found or imagined. (I ſpeake vpon ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) in all mens perfections which (to write vprightly) could neither bee gracious, curteous or ciuill, but onely by the ſociety of women. In this caſe I may likewiſe ſay, that as the Opall repreſents the colour of all precious ſtones: ſo a womans face, is the true liuely figure of all graces celeſtiall and humaine, and that God endued it only with perfections aboue all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The goodly heauens might not compare with the ornament and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a woman, if nature had not made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of longer continuance: but by her death ſhe doth ſo much the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encreaſing their fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in no meane meaſure, and yet to our vnſpeakeable loſſe.

            <p>Bodily beauty is a continued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the partes with their whole in perfect ſubſtance: This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon definition of beauty, which only reſpectes the nature of the thing, and not the accidents. <hi>Plato</hi> holdes, that beauty is an Idea of perfection, which we attrybute to the ſubiect that beſt liketh vs.</p>
            <p>And hereupon, being demaunded what was the verie faireſt thing in the world: he anſwered, Loue. Now it is moſt certaine, that this Loue is a Woman; for as nothing can burne but the fire, or that which is of fiery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo can wee loue nothing but a woman, I meane in this Theater of humaine affaires, except we will build vp againe the walles of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Oh would to God it pleaſed him, that ſome two or three, who make a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of ſuch a horrible ſin, yea, euen to the great ſcandale of Fraunce, had bin

            <p>Moreouer, I haue ſometimes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that when by all theſe meanes they could not attaine their purpoſe: they haue ſought by violence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it, furthering their attempts by hatefull treaſons, or the preſent villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſome ſubtill ſeruant, whome ſuch maiſters are woonte to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence very largely, for ſuch an honeſt and ſeruiceable peice of worke.</p>
            <p>See to what kindes of excellencie, the mindes of men are dayly addicted, and yet they will be Lordes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troullers ouer women, when baſeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie dooth thus commaund ouer themſelues. Truely, the conceipts of

women are farre otherwiſe, and (if it be true that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) that the parties compoſed of moſt noble and delicate fleſh, are of a higher and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirite then the other: then none are ſo ſimple to doubt, but the fleſh of women is much more ſoft and tender, then mens: do wee not likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde by experience, that in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious inuentions, their ſpirits doe exceede the greateſt eminence of mens?</p>
            <p>Looke in the catalogue of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of things, if they haue not beene the inuentreſſes of many excellent and incomparable woorkes: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of good letters, which at this day make men ſeeme ſo rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Why then this ſerues to ſhew yee, that euen as men are borne of them; ſo likewiſe are the ſciences which we call humaine. For proofe heereof, the vertuous Lady <hi>Carmenta</hi> firſt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented them, by meanes whereof it happened, that the skilfull <hi>Leontia,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6042:78"/>
confuted and woone (by reaſon in diſputation) the victorie ouer learned <hi>Theophraſtus. Sappho</hi> inuented the verſes, which (after her name) are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sapphicks</hi>; and had great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with many excellent Poets in her time, confuting all of them in the end, as the lyke (not without ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler praiſe) did faire <hi>Corinna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If wee would ſpeake of our time, where is the Italian Poet ſo hardie, and ſo ſure in his compoſition, as to compare with the Ladye Marqueſſe of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eronica</hi> of <hi>Gambara,</hi> or gentle <hi>Armilla Angoſciole?</hi> In <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi> yee ſhall finde whole Legions, that kept Schooles of all Sciences, eſpeciallye of good lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and pureſt writing, excelling the very skilfulleſt men in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>How many is there in the Courte of Fraunce, whom the learnedſt in the land (I ſay not in diuinitie) but in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſciences, dare not deale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

or contradict? And as for them in Citties, we may remember the ſweete Gentlewoman <hi>Eliſena, Morella, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertet</hi> the Bayli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for recluſe women, moſt certain is it, that neither <hi>Valeria Proba,</hi> nor <hi>Paula,</hi> nor <hi>Euſtochium,</hi> who liued in the time of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> excelled them that now are at this preſent daye. For breuities ſake I am conſtrained to let them paſſe, becauſe their ſingularitie ſhall the more commend them, by ſuch workes as ſhall make them liue perpetually renowmed: yet therein they begge not applauſe as men baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doo, who will not be a little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if men reporte not of them to the vttermoſt.</p>
            <p>I could wade very long in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, &amp; run far to aſſemble by breefe
<pb facs="tcp:6042:79"/>
recitall, diuers noble and ingenious women more: were it not, that euen as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> haue large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written their vertues of elder time: ſo for our moderne dames, Maiſter <hi>Iohn Boccace</hi> and others haue honeſtly diſcharged their conſciences, ſo that no further proofe neede to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this place.</p>
            <p>If yee will vrge me to confirme this caſe, by extraordinarie priuiledges graunted to women: I neede goe no further then the old Teſtament, where God commaunded <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould doo what his good wife <hi>Sara</hi> willed him. Moreouer we finde, that our Sauiour (after his holy reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) did firſt of all appeare to women, <hi>Mereurius Triſmegiſtus,</hi> who (of men) woorthily may be tearmed excellent, knowing the merueilous perfections and vertues of women; left written in his bookes, that the man who had not a wife ought eſpecially to be auoyded, conſidering, that from the woman (as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6042:79"/>
from a moſt aboundant fountayne,) flowed all gifts of bountie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and the houſes where no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were, ought to bee eſteemed as vaſt Deſerts, or vntilled lands.</p>
            <p>Where is true pollicie, if not in a houſholde? where is perfect honeſtie, if not where women are? Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when he would produce the example of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples faithfulneſſe, to bee kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued betweene each other: did hee not alledge that of <hi>Rahab</hi>? But becauſe it is a common matter in the moſt part of men, to obiect againſt women, that they are of weake courage, and ſo conſequently, very niggardly and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous: I would demaund of them, were not women in auncient time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dames, becauſe of their readineſſe and franckneſſe in giuing? I haue not ſo many hayres on my head, as I haue knowne honeſt women, not onely prompt to giue moſt courteous and amiable preſents; but withall, to offer
<pb facs="tcp:6042:80"/>
ſuch a zealous heart and affection, as witneſſed they could neuer bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie requited againe: yet doone without expecting publique glorye and applauſe, as men doo, who are ambitious and couetous of vayne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes.</p>
            <p>Seeing women then haue ſhowne themſelues ſo vertuous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, it may bee thought a matter not without great reaſon, that the vertuous Grecians retayned Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens names among them, and not mens: as well knowing by theyr firſt detracters, that Women were ſinguler freendes to honour and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>I could (to this effect) alleadge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite other reaſons and examples, for confirmation of Womens excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: but becauſe I haue referred yee to Hiſtories, I will giue ende to this well imployed labour. Yet let mee firſt intreate yee, to make reuerend regarde of that you ſhall finde in

approoued good Authours: which if yee doo, the height and dignitie of women will be ſo ingrauen in your mindes, as no malignitie whatſoeuer can preuayle againſt them, and your ſelues will truly confeſſe, that the moſt I can deuiſe to write, can neuer reache to the leaſt part of theyr eſpeciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing vertues, and moſt excellent graces wherewith they are decked and adorned.</p>
            <p>And this I can aſſure yee beſide, that the moſt parte of excellent and vertuous men, haue attributed all tytles of honour to Women, daylye becomming theyr ſeruantes in hart, yea, euen humble in proſtration (as it were) to adore them, as if in ſome ſorte they tooke parte with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diuinitie.</p>
            <p>Then let vs not fayle hencefoorth to looue them hartilye, by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our wiſe and diſcreete el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yeelding our ſelues voluntarily

as ſubiect to them: neuer regarding venemous ſpightfull tongues, that haue not ſpared to ſpeake their vttermoſt againſt them.</p>
