         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AETHIOPIAN HISTORY. The First Book.</head>
            <p>THE break of day had now dispersed the darkness, and the Sun with earliest beams, guilded the summits of the Mountains; when a Troop of Men that had no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but by Robberies, and Rapine, appeared upon the <hi>Promontory</hi> that elevates it self over one of the Mouths of <hi>Nilus,</hi> named the <hi>Heracliotick:</hi> Being assembled, they made a stand to take view of the Sea, that lay like a vast Valley underneath them; but when they saw nothing that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope of Prey (all the Ships they discovered, sayling off to the Main) they cast their Eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58429:8"/>
the neighbour Shoar, and encountered this Object.</p>
            <p>A Ship at Anchor, no men in her, yet heavy laden, as might easily be judged afar o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f, for she was of that burthen, as she drew Water to the third Deck. The Shoar was covered with a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre of men, some dead, others were but half dead, and the parts of their Bodies that yet pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, gave assurance to the beholders, it was no long time since the Fight was ended; nor were these the Marks of a just Quarrel, they were the said Relicks of an unfortunate Feast. There were Tables that stood yet full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urnished, and some that were overturned betwixt the Arms of those that sate at them; others lay like Tomb-stones over the Dead that had (as it is probable) hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under them: Many Bowls and Pots were cast down, and many yet held in their hands that had taken them either to drink, or to cast at their Enemies heads; for the suddenness of the Mutiny, and the necessity, had taught them a new way, and (instead of Darts and other offensive Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons) armed them with the Cups they drank in. They lay, one cloven with an Axe, another his Brains beat out with Shells that lay ready on the Sands, some bruised to pieces with Leavers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny burnt with Coals of Fire, and divers others, diversly Murthered; but the most were Shot to Death with Arrows. In sum, Fortune in a little time had produced strange variations, contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Wine with Blood, changing the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58429:8"/>
of a Feast into the horrors of a Battle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously mixing their Meat with Wounds, and Drinking Healths with Death; preparing such a Stage for the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Thieves to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but from those heights they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Play; for they plainly saw a defeat, but no Masters of the Field; an absolute Victory, but no Spoils taken; a Ship unmann'd, but else untouched; hulling in that dangerous Road, as if in full peace, and in the midst of the greatest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in the world.</p>
            <p>But though ignorant of the Cause, they were greedy of the Prey; and resolved to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Conquerors: So they marched forward to the pillage; and when they were not far from the Ship, and near to the dead Bodies, there was presented to their sense, a sight of greater astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the former.</p>
            <p>It was a young Lady, sitting upon a Rock, of so rare and perfect a Beauty, as one would have taken her for a Goddess, and though her present misery opprest her with extreamest grief, yet in the greatness of her affliction, they might easily perceive the greatness of her Courage: A Laurel crown'd her Head, and a Quiver in a Scarf hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her back; she rested her left Arm upon her Bow, and let her Hand carelesly hang down upon her right Thigh; she leaned on her other Arm, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Cheek upon her hand, and fixing her eyes upon a young Gentleman that lay not far distant from her; he was covered in his wounds, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58429:9"/>
now began to raise himself a little, as if awaking out of a deep sleep, almost of Death it self; yet such a stock of Beauty shined in his Face, and the Blood that rained down so set off the whiteness of his Skin, as made him shew most lovely; the pain he felt, seemed to weigh down his Eye-lids, and the Beauty of the Lady, to attract and open them.</p>
            <p>He had no sooner recollected his Spirits, and scarce breath'd, but with a languishing voice he pronounced these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sweetest, Is it true that I yet behold you Living, or (perishing in the execution) have you encreased the number of the dead? can you not, not even in Death be ravished from me, but will your shadow be yet a loooker on, and sharer in my Fortunes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is from you reply'd the Maid that I expect my Fortune, Life or Death; this you here see (shewing him a Steeletto in her lap) hath yet not done its office, hindered by the happy signs of your recovery.</p>
            <p>This said, she leaped from the Rock, and the Thieves upon the Mountains surprized with fear and astonishment ran to hide themselves behind the Bushes: For she appeared more Divine when she was upon her Feet; her Arrows in her Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver clashing as she stepped, her Robe (that was Cloth of Gold) glittering in the Sun, and her Hair that flowed under her Coronet (like the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esses of <hi>Bacchus</hi>) reaching almost to the ground. One said she was a Goddess, and sure the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess <hi>Diana,</hi> or <hi>Isis</hi> the Patroness of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58429:9"/>
others conceived her to be a Votaress to some God, that inspired with divine fury had made so great a slaughter.</p>
            <p>This while the Maid running to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, cast herself upon his Body, wept, kist him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> wiped his wounds, and imbraced him so closely as if she could hardly be assured she had him in her Arms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>AEgyptians</hi> observing this, presently alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Opinions; What, said th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But they (neither understanding her words nor meaning) left her with the wounded Gentleman, not putting any surer guard upon them then their own weakness; and hasting to the Ship, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laded her, every man carrying out as much Gold, Silver, Precious Stones and Silks, as they were able to bear, neglecting other Commodities (tho' rich and various) and when they had every one as much as satisfied their Avarice, they lay'd it down upon the shoar, making it up into packs, and dividing it, not by reason, or after the just value of the things, but equalling them by weight, reserving for the last, to resolve what to do with the young Gentleman and the Lady.</p>
            <p>Mean while there appears upon the Mountains a second Company, two riding before them as their Captains; these were no sooner perceived by the former, but without preparing for the fight, or daring to take with them any part of of the spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that was possible, for they were but Ten, and those they saw coming were twice that number. Thus the Lady was twice taken, and yet not Prisoner. Now these others, though they had an extream longing to be at the pillage, and had already devoured it in their hopes, yet the Apprehension, that troubled their Spirits, not knowing the cause of these events, retained them for a while; for they imagined the first Thieves had made that horrible Slaughter; and observing the Lady in all the dangers that threatned her, to be no more afraid than if there had been no such thing, careful only of the young man's wounds, that seemed to pain her more, than if they had been her own; they remained mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazed, as well at the generosity of her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and rareness o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er them to help themselves, nor did their Captivity want a Glory, to see the Conqueror humbled to the Conquered, and to be waited on by him that had them in his power: So great is the Appearance of Nobility, and Magick of a Beauty, as to subdue the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Thieves, and to mollifie the hearts of the most Barbarous. When they had now pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed along the Sea Shoar, about half a quarter of a Mile, leaving the left hand-way, they turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and climbing over, doubled their paces, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive by day-light, at a Lake on the other side the Mountain.</p>
            <p>This part of the Country is by the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> named the <hi>Bucolia,</hi> or Pasture, in which there is a Valley that receives the Innundations and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdenings of <hi>Nilus,</hi> growing into a Lake of an infinite deepness in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dst, but near the sides it is but shallow and marish: Here the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Thieves live together with a kind of policy, and observing a certain form of a Republick: Some dwell in Cabbins or Huts, builded upon little spots of Earth, that rise above the water in divers places of the Lake; others live in Boats, that they use both for ferrying over, and habitations for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and wives, who are there brought a-Bed;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58429:11"/>
their Infants first suck the Mothers-milk, and within a while are weaned, and use to eat Fish, got in the Lake, and broyled in the Sun; when a little one desires to go, his Mother tyes a Cord to his Foot, that reacheth no farther than the Boat, committing him to this new guide.</p>
            <p>Thus all that are born within the Lake, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it for their Nurse and Country, and hold it as a strong protection to their Robberies, and to that end such kind of people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Sun now declining to the West, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the rest of his company arrived at this Lake, and dismounting the two Prisoners, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Prey aboard their little Boats; present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all their Fellows that had stayed at home, some from one side of the Fenns, and some from the other, came running to meet their Captain, and received him as their King, doing him all humble reverence; but when they had viewed the riche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I cryed to him to stay, yet he regarded me not, but thinking I had repented me of my Discovery, ran like a mad man to your Chamber; the rest you know: And now you may, if you please, purge your self before your Son, though absent; and revenge your self of her that hath done injury to you both: For I will this Night shew you</hi> Damaeneta, <hi>lying with her Adulterous Friend, in the House of a Stranger in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs.</hi>

               <hi>Thyamis</hi> hearing this, suddenly started up, and demanded where <hi>Chariclea</hi> was, as fearing more for her than for himself, and <hi>Knemon</hi> having shewed her standing at the Door, Go (said <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amis</hi> in his ear) take her with thee into the Cave where we conceal our Treasure, and when thou hast conveyed her down, and covered the mouth of the Cave with the Stone that useth to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, pr'ythee Friend return with all celerity;

mean time we will give order for the Fight: then he commanded his Page to seek him a fat Beast; that having sacrificed to the Gods Protectors of the Place, they might joyn Battel. This while, <hi>Knemon</hi> doing his Commands, led away <hi>Chariclea,</hi> that sighed and lamented, and at every step she went, turned back her eyes towards <hi>Theagenes;</hi> at length they came to the Cave, where <hi>Knemon</hi> immediatly carried her down.</p>
            <p>The Place was not a work of Nature, as we see many both above and under the ground; but it was a Vault wrought out of the Rock by the industry of the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Thieves, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Nature, artificially hollowed, to contain their Spoyls; the Entry was narrow and obscure, and conveyed into a little Cell, the Threshold Stone whereof was a Door that opened and shut easily, and gave another passage for descent into the Cave when necessity required; within it were cut many Trenches and Meanders, that went turning of either side, sometimes alone, sometimes mixing together like the Roots of Trees, till they came to the bottom, and there they end in a large and spacious Plain, whereinto enters a little Light, by certain clefts and cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Earth above: <hi>Knemon,</hi> that by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice knew the turnings, having brought <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> to the bottom, endeavoured to comfort her the best he could, assuring her, he and <hi>Theagenes</hi> would come and see her soon at Night, and that he would not suffer him to fight, nor come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>My Companions in Arms, I do not think it needful to trouble you with many Words; you need no admonition, War is your Trade, and now the Enemy is so near us, he cuts off Discourse, he comes upon us to force our Trenches with his Sword, and we must answer him in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: I have nothing else to say, but that now, you are not only to defend your Wives and Children (which hath been Motive sufficient for others to fight to the last man; though if we be Conquerors, such small things, and many of greater moment will be in our power) but your Lives are now at stake, for the War among Thieves was never ended by Treaty, nor secured by League, but the Survivors must be Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the Conquered must die; therefore let us go to't, and let him that dies his Weapon deepest in our Enemies Blood, be thought the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest Man.</p>

            <p>Yet notwithstanding the loss of many of their Fellows, they more rejoyced to have him alive that slew them, than they sorrowed for their Friends and Kinsmens Deaths; so insatiable are the covetous hearts of Thieves, preferring Gain before their Lives, and having no end in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name of Friendship and Consanguinity, but to get by them; it was the case of these Thieves,

for they were the same that before out of their fear of <hi>Thyamis</hi> and his Men, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the Cause of their taking <hi>Thyamis,</hi> was this, he had at <hi>Memphis</hi> a Brother named <hi>Petosiris,</hi> who having by his plots dispossessed his Brother of the Dignity of Chief Priest, against the Laws and Institutions of the Countrey, (for he was his younger Brother) and hearing that he was the Captain of these Thieves, he feared <hi>Thyamis</hi> would take time to chase him out of his usurped Honour, and discover his perfidiousness: also he desired to take away the ill opinion that many had conceived of him, that he had killed his Brother, because it appeared not where he was; therefore sending Messengers to the Villages of the Thieves, he proposed a great Sum of Money, and so many Castles to any one that would take him alive; so as these Thieves charmed with the hope of such a Profit, even in the heat of Blood and War, did not forget their Promise, but after he was discovered, took him alive, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny died for it: Being thus seized of <hi>Thyamis,</hi> they rowed to Land, putting him in Irons, and appointing half of their Troops to guard him, who vexing at his Fortune, upbraided them of

But after they had passed over all the Island, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving one corner unsearched, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little of the Prize, unless it were some Trifles that they had neglected to put up in the Cave, they set fire upon the Cabbins, and the Evening now approaching, and putting them in a fear to stay longer in the Island, lest they should fall into the Trains of some of those that fled from the Battel, and might now perhaps lie in Ambuscado for them, they returned to their Companies.</p>

Hope failing, they bowed down their Eyes, and again lifting them up, sighed; so easing their sad Hearts: At length <hi>Knemon</hi> stretched himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, <hi>Theagenes</hi> sate down upon a Stone with <hi>Chariclea</hi> on his Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus I conjecture it; Our Parents are the Authors of our Life, and it is by their Means we see and enjoy this Light; therefore I hold it apt to compare our Father and Mother to our Eyes, the sense capable of Light, and whereby we discern things visible; and this is the meaning of your Dream.

            <p>I know not which of us have greatest share in Misfortune; I have a Burden great enough; yet in regard you command me (as the eldest here, and most versed in the World, to give my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, this it is;</p>
            <p>This Island as you see is laid waste and deserted, containing now no living creatures but our selves, within this Cave is great store of Gold, Silver and Silks (for it is hardly to be imagined what quantity of rich Spoyls <hi>Thyamis</hi> hath taken both from us and others, and deposited here) but for Corn and other Ammunition necessary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Life, there is lest no more but the bare Names; if therefore we stay here long, it is to be feared we shall perish either by Famine, or the Enemy, that may return, or by our own Fellows, if they make Head again; for they are not ignorant where the Treasure lieth, and are likely to come hither for supplies of Money, and then we cannot escape their Fury; or if

they should deal mildlier with us, yet we should be obnoxious to their Petulancies, and suffer the Indignities of their barbarous humors; for Thieves are men that naturally keep no Faith, and less now than ever, having lost their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that could by his Authority bridle their Insolencies; therefore we must leave the Island, and get away from it as out of a Net or Prison; but first let us free our selves of <hi>

            <p>Being now near unto the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> ready to take Water for <hi>Chemmis,</hi> he saw an Old Man walking up and down upon the Shoar, as if he had been discoursing with the Stream; his white hair he wore long in fashion of a Prophet, a great long Picked Beard, his Cassock and his other Robes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling a Greek Habit. <hi>Knemon</hi> stood still a while and looked upon him, but the Old Man passing by many times and not perceiving him, being wholly fixt upon his Meditation; <hi>Knemon</hi> stept in before him, and saluted him, bidding the Gods bless him. No said the old Man, Fortune hath otherwise disposed: <hi>Knemon</hi> wondring at his Answer, asked him, Are you a <hi>Grecian,</hi> Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or of whence?

Robes? (said <hi>Knemon</hi>) Calamity (answered the Old Man) hath put me in this glorious Habit, and changed my ordinary Dress; <hi>Knemon</hi> admiring how Misery should make any Man go in richer Cloaths, and desiring him to unfold the Riddle; Oh! said the Old Man, To relate my Fortunes, would bring my self and you into a Labyrinth, whence we should not get out, and but load you with my burden; But, young Man, whither lies your journey? Or whence do you come? Or how is it you speak Greek in <hi>AEgypt</hi>? This is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, said <hi>Knemon,</hi> to enquire of my Affairs, and tell me nothing of your own, and I asked the first question. Well, I am content to bear your Jest, said the Old Man; for it appears you are a <hi>Grecian</hi>: and I believe that in this play of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune you have changed shapes as well as I; but since you seem taken with a curiosity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my Estate, I will satisfie you: for know I am big with grief, and if I had not light of you, perhaps I had expressed my self to these Reeds.

she being now grown Marriageable, many Suitors were ambitious to be her Husband, I matched her to him that in my Judgment best deserved her; but even upon her Marriage-Night in her Husbands Bed and Arms, the Miserable dyed suffocated by Fire; either from Heaven, or scattered from the hand of some too careless Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: so Mourning and Tears took place of her Nuptial Bravery, and of the <hi>Epithalamion</hi> that was yet sung from her Marriage-Chamber, she was carryed to her Tomb; and the same Torches that were lighted at her Wedding, serv'd for her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-Fire: nor did the divine Powers let this Tragedy end here; but added her Mother to the Scene of Death, Heart-broken for her Child. I having not constancy enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>upport these ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of the Gods, would not yet exile my self from Life (obeying the more probable Doctrine of Divines) but resolved to forsake my Country, and no more to see the solitude and sorrow of my House; for it is a great ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to Misery to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the sad Object from our Eyes: And having wandred many Countreys, at length I came into your <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and travelled to the <hi>Catadupes,</hi> to see the Cataracts and falls of <hi>Nilus</hi>: Here you have the reasons of my Journey, but I desire you should know the Head, or rather Crown of the Narration.</p>
            <p>As I was there walking the Streets, and buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Rarities, whereof there was scarcity in <hi>Greece</hi> (for now time having digested my Sorrow,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58429:53"/>
I longed to return into my Country) a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable black Man (with a face full of Gravity, though he were but newly s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>epped out of his Youth) came to me, and saluted me; telling me in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oken Greek, that he desired to have some conference with me; I obeying his desire, he carried me into a Temple hard by; and said, I saw you buying some <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>AEthiopian</hi> Herbs and Roots, but if you will have them sincere and without all Sophistication, buy of me; With all my Heart said I: Pray you shew them; But take heed, said he, you be not too wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Buyer: Look you, said I, you be not too dear a Seller.</p>
            <p>Then drawing out a little Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>binet that he carried under his Arm, he opened it; and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me certain Gems of an inestimable value; there were Pearls of the bigness of a Hasel-Nut, exactly round, and fair without a Flaw; Emeralds, and Jacinths; the one shewing like the green Corn in the Spring time, shining in their Polish as if oyled, the other imitating the colour of the Sea-shore under a high bending Rock, dying all below it in a purple Colour. In fine, of all the Stones together, there was a mixt and various Water infinitely pleasing and delightful to the Eye: When I had well considered them, Friend, said I, you must seek you other kind of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than I am, for all my wealth will not be great enough to purchase me the least of these. If you have not means to buy them, said he,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58429:53"/>
yet I hope you have power to receive them as a gift: That's true, I replyed, I think my power were sufficient to receive them; but I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what should induce you thus to mock me: I mock not, he replyed, but what I do is serious: and I protest unto you by the power that is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of this Temple, I will give you all these provided you will receive with this a richer gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. At this I fell a laughing; and he demanding the cause, I told him it seemed to me a ridiculous thing, that offering me such Riches, he would yet promise a Reward for receiving of them of far richer Value; Believe me, replyed he, but let me take your Oath withal that you will nobly use this gift, and as I shall instruct you. A while I stood in doubt, yet I did swear, won with the hope of such a promise; but when I had taken my Oath in the form he gave it, he took me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, and shewed me a Maid endowed with an incomparable Form and Grace, as he said, but seven Years old; but to me she seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almost marriageable; so much doth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a Face add to the lowness of a Stature. My eyes dazling at this wonder, I stood amazed and speechless (partly because I was ignorant of what he meant to do; bat principally out of an insatiable desire of beholding the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) till he awaked me with these words.</p>

               </gap> whence, and who she was, and carried her from besides the City far into the Country, and gave her to a Shepherd to be brought up, threatning to kill him if he told how he came by her: The things that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with her, I retained, lest the Child should be made away for them; thus at first I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her.</p>
            <p>But as she grew in Years, she grew in Beauty and Perfection; and sure a Beauty (though hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Center of the Earth will be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;) therefore fearing she would be known, and both she and I dye for it, I laboured to be sent Ambassadour to the Lieutenant of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I recommend the Child to you, and to the Gods that have so disposed of her, under the conditions of your Oath, being always to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Liberty, and to match her to a Man as free as you receive her from my Hands; or to speak better, from her sad Mothers, that exposed her; I am confident you will accomplish all your promises confirmed unto me by the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Vow, and the Candor of your Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; which since your being in these parts, I have curiously observed, and know them to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a <hi>Grecian.</hi> This is all I have to say to you for the present, my Legating Affairs now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me away; but to Morrow meet me in the Temple of <hi>Isis,</hi> and there I will more plainly, and particularly inform you of the Secrets that concern the Maid.</p>
            <p>I was punctual in observing his Commands; and taking the Maid, I secretly conveyed her to my lodging, where I imployed the whole day to entertain her the most honourably and respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I could; studying to win her Heart with all sweet ways, and rendring great thanks to the Gods for the Exchange of Children they had pleased to make me; from that hour esteeming and naming her my Daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58429:55"/>Next Morning early I came to the Temple of <hi>Isis,</hi> as I had promised the Stranger; and after I had walked there a long time, he not appearing, I went to the Governors House, and demanded if any one had seen the <hi>AEthiopian</hi> Ambassador? Presently one told me that he departed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was expelled last Evening before Sun-set, the Governour threatning he should lose his Head, if immediatly he did not q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it his Frontiers; inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me also the Cause: That delivering his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage, he commanded the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> to forbear to dig the Emerald Mines, as appertaining to the King of <hi>AEthiopia</hi>; I returned to my Lodging sad and pensive, as one that had hard Fortune, being not able to get any knowledge of the Child, who, or of whence, or of what Parents she was born. It is no marvel, said <hi>Knemon,</hi> interrupting him, for I my self am mightily troubled that I can hear no more; but yet I hope I may. You shall, replied <hi>Calasiris</hi>; but now I will follow the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>Charicles</hi> then made me.</p>
            <p>After, said he, that I was returned to my Lodging, the little Maid came to meet me, using Action for Words, having not yet learned to speak any <hi>Greek,</hi> she saluted me by giving me her hand, and her Eyes spake that she received contentment in my presence. I was amazed; she would leap for Joy, look me in the Face, and observing the Respect and Love I bare her, she paid me with the honour and reverence of a Natural Child, I therefore resolved to stay no longer in the Town
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58429:55"/>
of <hi>Catadupes,</hi> fearing some malevolent Fortune in a strange Countrey, might deprive me of this other Daughter; and taking Boat, we rowed down <hi>Nilus</hi> to the Sea, whence I sailed home; where to this instant I have kept and cherished this Child as tenderly as if Nature, not Accident, had bestowed her on me, giving her my own Name, and my Content depending only upon hers, so prodigal hath Heaven been of Graces to her, that she anticipated my Wishes; for spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily she attained to the Greek Tongue, in such an instant she came to the Spring of her Age, like a fruitful and noble Plant, blooming early, and with wonder; in Beauty she had no Equal; but all mens Eyes, both <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> were fixed on her; for in what place soever she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, either in the Temples, at the Theaters, or any other publick Meetings, as if she had been the Statue of some Goddess newly made, no man could think or look upon any thing else.</p>
            <p>But though she is no less than I have pictured her unto you, yet she cruelly afflicts my Heart, denouncing open War to Marriage, resolving to spend all her Life in the state of Virginity, and as a follower of <hi>Diana,</hi> loves Hunting, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth her Bow and Arrows, whilst my Life grows bitter to me, being frustrated of my Hope to match her to my Sisters Son, a civil and well-bred Gentleman, endowed with many excellent good Qualities; but in vain we court her, she hath so hard an Opinion of Marriage, that neither

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58429:62"/>
upon the way may intervene and make them come later than the appointed hour; yet if they were here, you should not see them, till I had received my whole Reward. Therefore if you hasten to their presence, perform your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and lead the Discourse you have begun, to an end.</p>
            <p>I do both shun (reply'd <hi>Calasiris</hi>) the discourse that may bring my sorrows fresh into my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I also doubt it that my long talking had been tedious to you; but since you are so cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of hearing, let us begin where we left: Having first lighted a Lamp, and made our offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Divinities of the Night, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our usual Ceremonies to them, we may go on with our History, without being troubled with <hi>Phantasms.</hi> Presently a Servant at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, brought in a Lamp burning, and he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a little of the Oyl upon the Earth, made his Libation, invoking all the Gods: beseeching a Night of Happy Dreams, conjuring them with all the Power of Prayers, that his beloved <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> might appear to him in his Sleep.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Knemon,</hi> after the Procession thus passing had gone round about the Sepulcher of <hi>Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus,</hi> and the troop of Horse had thrice wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it, the Women began to fill the Air with funeral Cryes, and the men with a wild Howling: then the Oxen, Sheep, and Goats, (at a Signal given) were immediately Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58429:62"/>
as if one blow had cut all their Throats. Lastly, all these Beasts being laid upon a great Altar, and six hundred Billets under them, they Prayed the Priest of <hi>Apollo</hi> to begin the Sacrifice, and give Fire to the Wood; <hi>Charicles</hi> reply'd, the Sacrifice did only belong to him, but the Firing of the Altar, to the Captain of the Sacred Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, receiving the Torch at the Hands of the Priestess of <hi>Diana,</hi> for so it was established in the Ceremonial. This he said, and began to make the offering, while <hi>Theagenes</hi> took the Torch from the hand of <hi>Chariclea</hi>; sure <hi>Knemon,</hi> that the Soul is a divine thing, and allied to the superior nature, we know by its Operations and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; assoon as these two beheld each other their Souls as if acquainted at first sight, pressed to meet their equals in worth and Beauty, at first they remained amazed and without moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at length, though slowly, <hi>Chariclea</hi> gave, and he received the Torch; so fixing their Eyes on one another as if they had been calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance where they had met before, then they smiled, but so stealingly, as could hardly be perceived, but a little in their Eyes, and as ashamed they hid away the Motions of Joy with Blushes; and again, when Affection (as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) had ingaged their Hearts, they grew pale. To conclude, in a little space, a thousand chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wandred in their Faces, both in their Colour and their Eyes, deciphering Trouble in their Sorrows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:58429:63"/>The Vulgar knew not this, being according to their Imployment, busied and intentive upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters; <hi>Charicles</hi> observed it not, being hindred with making the accustomed Prayers and Invocations; but I (ever after the Oracle was pronounced to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> sacrificing in the Temple) did nothing else but note all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this young Couple, conjecturing by their Names that it was meant of them; <hi>Chariclea</hi> signifying in your Language, Grace and Glory, and <hi>Theagenes</hi> born of a Goddess, yet I did not hitherto exactly understand what the later part of the Oracle intended. But after (though long first, and as it were by force) <hi>Theagenes</hi> was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Chariclea,</hi> he fired the Altar, and so at length the Pomp brake up; the <hi>Thessalians</hi> going to Feast, the rest of the People every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting to their Houses, and <hi>Chariclea</hi> covering her self in her white Mantle, accompanied with some few Ladies, her Familiars, returned to her Lodging, within the Verge of the Temple; for she dwelt not with her supposed Father, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her self from him, lest he should have too much opportunity to perswade her to a Marriage.</p>
            <p>This I had seen, and the rest that I imagined ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me still more inquisitive, I chanc'd to meet with <hi>Charicles</hi>; he asked me, Hast thou seen the Light of mine, and all the eyes of <hi>Delphos, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>?

passing by, but she hath many times Sacrificed together with me; and when at any time she doubted of Divine or Humane things, she hath put Questions to me, and been instructed by me. But how did she shew to day? said <hi>Charicles</hi>: Did she add any ornament to the Ceremony? Would you have me tell you how the Moon excells the Stars? said I: But some commended the Young <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian,</hi> said <hi>Charicles,</hi> and gave him the second place; yes, and the third too, I replyed; but the Crown and Eye of all the Pomp was really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be your Daughter: this pleased <hi>Charicles</hi> at the Heart, and I by speaking the truth, did prepare way to my Aim, being only to make the man confident in me; who smiling, told me, he was then going to her and that if it pleased me I should go along with him to visit her, and know if the great press and tumult of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not troubled her, I was glad of the of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer, yet I seemed to neglect some other business to attend him.</p>
            <p>When we were come to the Lodgings where she had retired her self, we entred her Chamber, and found her languishing upon her Bed, not able to rest, Love bathing in the Moisture of her Eyes, she imbracing her Father as she was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, and he asking her how she did? she said, her Head aked; and that she would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly take a little rest. At this, <hi>Charicles</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, went with me out of the Chamber, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her Attendants to make no Noise; and

You need not wonder, I replyed, if in so great a Multitude of People as attended the Procession, she hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps attracted the Poison of some envious Eye; <hi>Charicles</hi> smiling at these words, as in derision, do you also (said he) believe with the Vulgar, that there is any Fascination or Bewitching by the Eye? I do believe it, I replyed, as an Opinion grounded upon truth; and thus I do conceive it, this Air circumfused on every side about us, penetrating by our Eyes, Nostrils, Mouths and other Passages and Pores of our Body, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with it the Exterior Qualities wherewith it is infected, such as it flowes unto us, such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression it make in us; therefore when any one beholds a rare Creature with Envy, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fills the Circumference of the Air with that infesting quality, and breaths into his Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object a Spirit full of Bitterness, which being thin and subtil, peirceth to the Bones and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and thus hath Envy been to many the cause of a Sickness, whose proper Name is <hi>Fasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>; Moreover, consider <hi>Charicles,</hi> how many have got sore Eyes and caught the infection of the Plague, that never came near the Diseased Persons, never lay in their Beds, nor eat or drank, or had any thing common with them but the Air: amongst other things that might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you, the Original of Love may be a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58429:70"/>
being the first Wound that Love had given him, until the Beauty of <hi>Chariclea</hi> had unsouled and conquered him, and that not in regard of any natural Strength or Weakness; but that he had never till now seen a Woman worthy of his <hi>Love.</hi> At these words he wept, witnessing, that he was overcome not by his own weakness, but by her inevitable Force: I comforted him the best I could, wishing him only to take his wonted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and since he had recourse to me, he should find <hi>Chariclea's</hi> Beauty had not the strength to prevail agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st our Wisdom; for though, said I, she be very refractory, despising <hi>Love,</hi> not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to hear <hi>Venus</hi> named, and not without much difficulty to be drawn to submit to the Laws of Marriage; yet for your sake I will try all ways, and you shall see Art conquer Nature; be you only confident, and fail not to obey my necessary Commands: He promised to follow my Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though I should bid him march upon the Points of Swords.</p>
            <p>As he was thus praying and conjuring, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising me all his Estate for a Reward, one came from <hi>Charicles,</hi> and told me his Master desired to speak with me; he is but over the way (he said) in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where he sings a Hymn to the God to appease him, because he hath I know not how, been troubled in his Sleep to Night: I rose, and sending away <hi>Theagenes,</hi> made haste to the Temple, where I found <hi>Charicles</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Chair exceeding sad, and often sighing;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58429:70"/>
I demanded what Affliction made him so deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late? Alas, he replied, all this last Night I have been troubled with fearful Dreams, and to make my Grief the greater, I hear my Daughter is still sick, and lain waking; and it afflicts me that her Sickness falls in an unhappy time, because to Morrow is the Day prefixed, wherein the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stess of <hi>Diana</hi> ought to give a Torch of Virgin-Wax to the Champions that run Armed, and to render them the Prize of the Victory; so that one of the two Evils must necessarily happen, that assisting at that Ceremony, her Malady will be augmented, or that her Absence will violate the Customs of the sacred Games: therefore if this could not be done before, at least apply some Remedy unto her, and you shall do a most charitable Office; which shall express your Friendship to me, and your Honour to the Gods: I know if you please, you can easily uncharm her; for the Prophets of your Country can perform the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est undertakings. I confessed I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with her, she may have the greater Faith in my Receipts. Be it so, he replied.</p>
            <p>When we were come to <hi>Chariclea</hi> (why should I use many Words?) we found her engaged deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affection, the Roses and Lillies of her Cheeks were faded, and the Water of her fair Eyes had extinguished the Fire that used to sparkle in them; yet assoon as she perceived us, she did her best to compose h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O Child! O Daughter! said he, can you conceal the Evil that torments you from your Father? and being fascinated, do you make it a Secret, as if you had done wrong, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an injury from the Eyes that have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously beheld you? But resume your Spirits; I have entreated the wise <hi>Calasiris</hi> that you see here with me, to undertake your Cure, and he is able to perform it; for he (if ever any) excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in divine Knowledge, as being by descent a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and which is more, our especial Friend; therefore you shall do wisely to commit your sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This done, we retired our selves; <hi>Charicles</hi> renewing his Suit to me, that I would remember my Promise, and bethink me of a way to induce <hi>Chariclea</hi> to a milder Construction of Men and Marriage. Thus I brought him off, and left him joyful, giving him my Word his Desire should shortly be accomplished.</p>

Thus it happened:</p>
            <p>All <hi>Greece</hi> were lookers on, the <hi>Amphyctiones</hi> were the Judges, that is, the Deputies of every Communalty of <hi>Greece.</hi> After all the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were concluded with Magnificence, as Chariot-Races, Wrastling, and Quoiting of the

Sledge, at length the Herald cried, <hi>Let the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men stand forth</hi>; and presently at the further end of the Lists we saw <hi>Chariclea</hi> shining; for she was come, if not willingly, yet to observe the Custom of the Countrey, or rather in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hoping to see <hi>Theagenes</hi>; in her left hand she bare a burning Torch of Virgin-Wax, and in her other held forth a Branch of Palm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> She no sooner appeared, but she turned all the Eyes of the Theater upon her; but I believe not any Eye out-stripp'd that of <hi>Theagenes</hi>; for the Eye of a Lover is swift to spy out her that is desired; and he having before heard of the Ceremony, had all his Spirits set to watch her coming; and when he saw her, he was not able to contain himself, but spake softly in my Ear; for he had placed himself next to me of purpose, <hi>That is she, it is Chariclea</hi>: I bid him hold his peace, and be at quiet.</p>
            <p>At the Cry of the Herald, one presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in light Armor, of goodly Shape, by his Carriage appearing already as a Conqueror, and promising to himself the Prize and Victory, as having many times been Crowned in the same Course; and at that time having none to oppose him, as <hi>Antagonist</hi>; which caused the <hi>Amphycti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones</hi> to return him back, the Law not permitting him to enjoy the Crown that had not endured the Conflict: But he intreated the Herald might demand, if any Man would run: The Judges commanded it should be so; and the Herald
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58429:73"/>
made Proclamation, If any would run, he should come forth into the Lists. <hi>Heark</hi> (said <hi>Theagenes</hi> to me) <hi>That Man calls me.</hi> I asking him what his meaning was: <hi>It shall be so, Father, he said; for never shall any Man in my presence, and I looking on, bare away the Reward of Victory from the hand of Chariclea:</hi> But, said I, you do not apprehend nor weigh the Danger and Ignominy that attends the Conquered: <hi>Why, Father, who is he</hi> (replied <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agenes</hi>) <hi>that will so fervently contend to see and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> Chariclea, <hi>as to outstrip me? or to whom will her Looks give wings, and make him fly in the Ayr like me? Do not you know that Painters draw Love winged, signifying as in a Riddle, the agility of those that he surprizes? and if a man might boast himself, there is this day none that can glory to have over-run me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At these Words he suddenly rose, and stepp'd forth into the Lists, to make his Name be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and the Place of his Birth; and so being engaged for the Course, he put on compleat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and stood to the Barriers, so boyling with desire to run, that his impatience would hardly permit him to attend the Sound of the Trumpet: The Spectale was pleasing and conspicuous; for you would have said it had been <hi>Achilles,</hi> as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> paints him fighting upon the Shore of the River <hi>Scamander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unexpected Champion moved all <hi>Greece,</hi> and they did wish the Victory to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58429:73"/>
passionately as if every one had run in his own Person; for Beauty hath a strong power to work upon the good wills of the Beholders: But above all, <hi>Chariclea</hi> was most troubled; and having set my self to observe her, I perceived she often changed her colour; for after the Herald had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced so loud as all might hear the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants Names, <hi>Ormenus</hi> the <hi>Arcadian,</hi> and <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> the Barriers were opened, and the Course began so swiftly as mens dazled Eyes could hardly overtake them: Every Spectator, to whom the Event was yet in suspence, found himself full of care; but I especially that had resolved with my self to be as careful of him as of my own Son. No marvel, said <hi>Knemon,</hi> if those that were present found themselves troubled; for at this hour I fear for <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you if he had the Victory, to keep me no longer without the knowledge. When now (<hi>Kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) they had finished half their Course, he looking back, and frowning to see <hi>Ormenus</hi> run so near him, lifting up his Buckler and his Head, and fixing his Eyes wholly upon <hi>Chariclea,</hi> he shot to her as an Arrow to the Mark, and so far out-stript the <hi>Arcadian,</hi> as he left him many paces behind. The Space was after measured: so running to <hi>Chariclea</hi> of purpose, fell upon her bosom, as if it had not been in his power to stop himself; and taking the Branch of Palm, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him kiss her hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:58429:74"/>I am glad with all my heart (said <hi>Knemon</hi>) that he hath won the Crown and stoln a Kiss; but I pray you what follows?

               <hi>Theagenes</hi> (<hi>Knemon)</hi> was then crowned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Conqueror, and conducted with the glad Acclamations of the People; but <hi>Chariclea</hi> was then quite vanquished, and her Heart more fettered in Affection than before; having the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time beheld <hi>Theagines</hi>; for the interchanged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>

            </p>
            <p>But to what part of the Earth I understood not; and I saw no other means to come to the knowledge of it, unless I could get the <hi>Fascia</hi> that was exposed with <hi>Chariclea,</hi> wherein <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> had told me he conceived the Discourse of her Fortune to be writ; for out of these Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters I doubted not but to get out her Country, and her Parents, which I began now to suspect, and that the Gods would send her back to them.</p>
            <p>Next Morning, coming to <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I found others of her Friends weeping, but <hi>Charicles</hi> most bitterly: I asked him, what the Matter was? O <hi>Calasiris!</hi> said he, The Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Daughter still more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases, and this Night she hath rested more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietly than before.

            <p>Now being alone with her, I began to play my part, as a Mountebank upon a Stage; I put the Incense in the Fire, and made as if I muttered certain Prayers betwixt my Lips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58429:75"/>
carried the Lawrel up and down from the head to the foot of <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and gaping over her like a sleepy man, at length I made an end of my Pageantry; she often moved her Head, and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to her self, as if she would tell me I was ignorant of the Cause of her Disease: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sitting nearer to her, Daughter, said I, chear your Spirits, for yours is a common Infirmity, and the Cure easie; no doubt but you were fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinated when you assisted at the Procession; but especially when you gave the Palm to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror: I suspect him that hath bewitched you, to be <hi>Theagenes</hi>; for I saw he looked fixedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and his Eyes were sawcy with you. She replied, whether he charmed me so or not, well may he do; but do you know what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman he is, or of what Family; for I saw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny look upon him, admiring him with a kind of an astonishment. Did not the Herald tell you that he was a <hi>Thessalian</hi> (I replied) when he proclaimed his Name? and he himself glories to be descended of <hi>Achilles</hi>; and doubtless he was his Ancestor; for he has the Stature, Form and generous Comportment of <hi>Achilles,</hi> only he is not so proud and arrogant as he; but he allays and tempers the fierceness of his Spirits with a mixture of much sweetness; yet though he be thus excellent, I wish him more pain than he hath made you suffer by the Witchcraft of his envious Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:58429:75"/>I thank you, Father, (she replied) that you have compassion of my Misery: but why do you vainly wish him ill that hath done us no wrong; for I am not fascinated? sure mine is some other Sickness.</p>
            <p>Why therefore do you conceal it (Daughter) said I, and not rather open your Infirmity with confidence, that you may receive help with speed? Am not I your Father in years, more in well-wishing? Am not I your Father's Friend, professing the same Studies, which the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dears me to him? Express your Grief, I will be faithful to you: If you will not believe my Word, you shall have my Oath: Speak boldly, and let not your Pain gather strength by your silence; for every Malady that is presently known, is easily remedied; but old Wounds are almost incurable; for Secresie is a nourishment to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, whilst those that are unconceal'd, may be sure to have some help.</p>
            <p>At these Words she pausing a little, and by her Face assuring me of much Confusion in her Thoughts; Give me time this day, she said, and then you shall know it, if already you do not, since you are a Master in the Art of Prophecy. I rose and left her; willing to give her leisure to moderate her Fears, and to contrive in what manner to express that she was ashamed to tell me. <hi>Charicles</hi> came running to meet me, and asked me, what I thought of his Child? O well, well; I replied: To morrow she will be delivered
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58429:76"/>
of the Burthen that aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I was gone but a little from the House when I perceived <hi>Theagenes</hi> walking in the Cloister of the Temple, and discoursing with himself, as if he were highly contented only to look upon the Lodging of <hi>Chariclea</hi>: I turning a little out of the way, passed by as if I had not seen him; but he called to me; Save you <hi>Calasiris!</hi> a Word with you; I staid for you: Presently I turning back, Lord! said I, is the fair <hi>Theagenes</hi> here, and I not see him? How can he be fair, replied <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> that pleases not <hi>Chariclea</hi>? I making my self to frown, as if I were angry with him, Will you never leave, said I, to disparage me and my Art, by which she is taken and compelled to love you, desiring to have the happiness to see you. What say you Father, he replied, would <hi>Chariclea</hi> see me? why then do you not carry me to her? and therewith he started forward; but I catching him by the Vest, Stay, said I, though you have the Crown for running, this is not a business to fall upon it like a Prey; nor is it easie to be compassed, or exposed to him that will venture for it; but it requires deep Consultation and great Preparatives to secure the doing. Do you not know that the Maids Father is one of the

principal Men of <hi>Delphos</hi>? Do you not fear the Law, that pronounces Death upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this kind?</p>
            <p>'Tis no matter, he replied, Let me die so I may enjoy <hi>Chariclea</hi>; yet, if you please, let us make Suit to her Father that he will bestow her on me for my Wife; my Affinity will be no Disgrace to <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>We shall never obtain it, said I; not that any thing can be reprehended or thought defective in you; but in respect <hi>Charicles</hi> hath destined her to his Sisters Son: He shall repent it whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be (said <hi>Theagenes</hi>) for no other man shall ever make <hi>Chariclea</hi> his Bride, and I alive, having this Hand and Sword.</p>
            <p>Away, away (said I) there shall be no such need; only be ruled by me, and do as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you: for this time depart, and take heed you be not seen often in my Company, but meet me ever alone, and without Noise: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly he went away something sad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charicles</hi> met me the next Morning, and assoon as he perceived me, ran and caught me in his Arms, printing many Kisses on my Head, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, Of such power is Wisdom, of such power is Friendship! the great Work is finished, the impregnable is now taken, and the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible is vanquished; <hi>Chariclea</hi> is in Love.</p>
            <p>Then I began to take state upon me, looking super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> planted no great Engines against her: But <hi>Charicles,</hi> how come you to know she loves?</p>
            <p>Following your Counsel (he replied:) for having sent for our principal and most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Physitians, I brought them in to see her; promising them all my Patrimony for their Fees, if they could cure her: They asked her where her Pain held her most? but she turning from them, pronounced this Verse of <hi>Homer</hi>;
<q>
                  <l>Achilles the most Valiant of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Then the prudent Physitian <hi>Acestinus</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you know the man) caught hold of her Wrist, and felt her Pulse, judging thereby (as I imagine) the motion of her Heart; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had felt the Artery a good while, taking an exact and curious observation of her, <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> (said he) you have sent for us in vain; Physick can do her no good.</p>
            <p>O Gods! I cried, what do you say? must then my Daughter perish? Is there no hope of her Recovery?</p>
            <p>Do not afflict your self, replied he, but hear me; and taking me aside from <hi>Chariclea</hi> and the rest, Our Art (said he) professeth the Cure of a distempered Body, and sometimes of the Soul; but that is only when it suffers and feels the indisposition of the Body, and that being

I intreating him if he understood the Nature of her Disease, to let me know it: There is no Child, said he, but may know it is a Passiion of the Mind, and evidently the Disease that we call Love; do you not see that her Eyes are swelled, her Countenance discomposed, Her Colour pale; yet she complained not of any Pain in her Heart; add that her mind wanders; what falls into her thoughts she speaks, and causeless cares do trouble her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

No, by <hi>Apollo,</hi> replyed he: For how, or whence should I know

that? But I would give my Estate, that it were <hi>Alcamenes</hi> my Sisters Son; whom long since in my mind, I had designed for her Husband.

            <p>Not long after, he came and found me, when the Exchange was full; I have (said he) a thing to Communicate to you, that greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflicts me: I fear my Daughter is out of her Wits, she hath such Strange and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Fancies.

Therefore again, I am become a Suiter to you, that you will not suffer her to perish, nor me to be frustrated of my Expectation; O <hi>Charicles!</hi> (said I) now you have hit it, the Maid is Mad: For she is possessed and agitated by the Spirits that I have put into her, which are not of the meanest sort; but a thing that was necessarily to be

               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:58429:79"/>The Sun who is Author of our Blood, be my Witness; O my Child! It is not for any Spot of Sin that I have exposed you in your Cradle, and concealed you from your Father <hi>Hidaspes:</hi> yet if you shall escape and live, thus far Daughter, let me excuse me to you, and to him that shall find you, if the Gods make any one so happy; Be it also known to all sorts of People, the cause that forced your Mothers Heart to leave you to the Mercy of Fortune; Our Ancestors of the Gods are <hi>Sol,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi>; of the Demi-Gods, <hi>Persius</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> and after them <hi>Memnon</hi>; those that from time to time have builded and enlarged the Palace of the Kings of <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> have enriched it with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Pictures, excellent Pieces taken from the Actions and Battels they have performed, and have put their Statua's in the Galleries and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens with Tabels, presenting to the Life the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous performances both of the Gods and Men; and my own Chamber was hanged about with several Pieces of the Loves of <hi>Andromeda</hi> and <hi>Perseus.</hi> I had been ten Years marry'd to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daspes,</hi> without any fruit of Wedlock, yet it happened, that from a certain hour, I found my self with Child; all the time till my down-lying, there were Publick Feasts, and Sacrifices of Thanksgiving to the Gods; the King ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for a Successor to succeed him in his Throne: But when I brought forth thee a White Child, an unusual Colour to the <hi>Ethiopians</hi>; I my

self knew the cause; the Picture of <hi>Andromeda</hi> naked was before my Eyes (for then <hi>Persius</hi> had newly brought her down from the Rock) Her Face being Apparelled in her sweetest looks, as freed from being devoured by the Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. A Beauty like hers in that Table, it was my hard Fortune to conceive thee; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deliver my Dignity and Person from an Ignominious Death, assuring my self thy colour would convince me of Adultery, and no Man believe me when I should speak the Truth of such an Accident; I resolved from the hour of your Birth, to commit you to the uncertainty of Fortune, which I imagined you your self would rather wish than a certain Death, or the name of Illegitimate.</p>
            <p>And so faining to my Husband you were born Dead, I secretly exposed you, laying with you in your Cradle my best Jewels for a Reward to his Piety, that should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve you, and covering you, with this Mantle, in which I have Printed with my Blood and Tears the Miserable Relation of your Fortune and my own, that have been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a Mother in my first down-lying. But my sweet Child, and that must be mine but for a little time; if you survive, remember your great Birth, be jealous of the Honour of your Chastity, the only best Character of a Ladies Virtue and Spirit; imitate your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and following their Example, make the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58429:80"/>
World know the Glory of your Illustrious Blood; particularly, remember among the Jewels I have laid forth with you, to look for a certain Ring, and keep it to your self; your Father gave it me upon my Wedding Day; his Arms are herein engrav'd, the Stone is named a <hi>Pantarbe,</hi> consecrated in the Collet: I use this way of writing, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise you hereof, since the Gods have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed us any other means to speak together; this may prove dumb and unprofitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; it may also inform you, and do you service; for the events of Fortune are not in the compass of Mans knowledge: finally, these Characters I have stained in this Mantle; O Daughter! Fair in pain; whose Beauty is my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Accuser; if it happen to you, be preserved by these Tokens, you will be known; if not (which Heaven keep from my knowledge) let the water of these Gems present your Mothers Funeral Tears.</p>
            <p>When I had read this to an end, then <hi>Knemon</hi> I knew, not without being ravished with admiration, the Ordinance of the Gods, and my Soul felt a new Motion, that made Tears spring srom my Eyes mixed with joy and sorrow, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely contented to have found what I desired; namely, the resolution of the Oracle, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled that I could have no perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the future; complaining to my self of the miserable condition of Mans Fortune, nothing but instability; whereof <hi>Characlea</hi> appeared

to me a singular example. I wandered in a maze of thoughts, considering who her true Parents were, who her supposed, how far she was distanced from her Country; having lost her own, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing only known by a feign'd Name. To conclude, I stood a great while in a dull fear, having cause to pity and deplore her passed miseries, and not daring to say her fortune should be happy in the future; till at length collecting my reason, I resolved the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign I had undertaken, should go on without delay; and coming to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> I found her alone, wearied with the Fight betwixt the forces of her Spirits, and the powers of Love, that made her fair Body the Field and Seat of War, which her Soul striving to make good, did but the more afflict her, being not able to resist the fnry of the assailant; then I commanded those that were without to wait till they were called, and not to trouble me, as if I had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prayers and Invocations to make for the Maids health. Now <hi>Chariclea</hi> (said I) you have time to perform your yesterdays promise, to discover to me what it is torments you, and no longer to conceal it from your true friend, whom it lyeth not in your power to hinder of the knowledge, though you should live and dye obstinate in your silence.

without confessing it, since, as you say, you know what troubles me; I shall esteem it some benefit to avoid an Ignominy, by concealing that it is a shame to suffer, but more shame to speak; and though my sickness growing upon me, puts me to great pain, it is my greatest, that I did not at first conquer it, but yielded to that passion I had all my life time in such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as only to hear it named, I thought it a stain to the sacred title of a Virgin. Then to encourage and comfort her; Daughter, said I, you do wisely to keep your reasons secret, for two causes; for it were but superfluous to tell me that, which by my Art, is long since known unto me; and you do your modesty right to spare your blushes, in revealing that ought ever to be hidden deepest in a Maids heart; but since you now feel what Love is, and that at first sight you were tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At length she said, Father, since you say, and I believe this to be the pleasure of the Gods, what shall I do? You must make a shew (said I) to entertain the Match with <hi>Alcamenes.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Charicles,</hi> to match you with his Nephew, for be assured he will do nothing in it without my consent and approbation. She promised it, and so I left her weeping. I was hardly out of the Gate but I perceiv'd <hi>Charicles,</hi> hanging down his Head, as oppressed with extreme grief: This is a strange humour, worthy <hi>Charicles,</hi> (said I) to appear in this sort afflicted, when you ought to fill your heart with Joy, and offer Sacrifice and Thanksgiving in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Gods having now granted your long suit, and blessed the secrets of my knowledge and endeavours to her, inclining her mind to a desire of Marriage: Lord, why should you weep, I protest I cannot imagine the reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> How can I chuse, replied he, since my beloved Daughter shall be taken out of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she be subjected to the Laws of Marriage, as you promise, if we may believe Dreams, both at other times and (which with terrour I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber yet) this night methought an Eagle, flying from <hi>Apollo</hi>'s hand, in an instant (alas!) seiz'd my poor Child, and ravished her from my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, carrying her into the farthest Region of the habitable Earth, full of obscure Images and Shadows of black Men; and, which grieved me most, I could not discern what became of her, an infinite space of Earth and Air inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it self betwixt us, so as the cruel Bird did overfly my sight, and vanished. When he had told me this, I presently conceiv'd which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58429:84"/>
way the presage tended; but to divert him from his Melancholly wherein he was drown'd, and to draw him as far as might be, from the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the future; You being a Priest, (said I) and of all his Priests the most conversant in the Mysteries of your Prophetick God, yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you have not the art of interpreting a Dream; your Dream indeed presaging to you the Marriage of your Daughter, and by an <hi>Enigma</hi> showing to you how her Husband shall take her from you like an Eagle, and that with the consent of <hi>Apollo,</hi> as sending him to her from his own hand, yet you are troubled at it, and wrest your Dream to the worst sense; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take heed our misconjectures do not provoke the Gods, resigning our selves wholly to their wills, and employing our best indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to conform your Daughter to your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Then he demanding what were best to be done to win his Daughter; If haply, said I, you have yet any Jewels or rich Embroideries, or some Ring of a great value, let <hi>Alcamenes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them to her, as Marriage-gifts, and this will charm her to be his; then you must make other preparations for the solemnity, and make no delay, but conclude the Marriage, whilst yet the power of my Art is working, and makes impression in her Soul. Doubt not, said <hi>Charicles,</hi> I shall not omit any thing in my power; and he had scarce spoken the words,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58429:84"/>
but he ran with joy to put them in Act, and did as I entreated him, without any procrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as afterwards I understood, carrying to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> as Nuptial gifts from <hi>Alcamenes,</hi> not only rich Vestures, but also the precious Jewels <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I went presently to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and asked him where his <hi>Thessalians</hi> were, that did assist at the ceremony of the Procession: He told me, the Ladies were gone softly before, to make the easier Journeys; and how the young men burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so great a desire to see their Friends at home, as he hardly had power to stay them any longer: Understanding that, I instructed him what he should say to them, and what they should do, commanding him he should observe when I would give the sign, and then take heed not to lose the time and occasion offered; so I left him.</p>
            <p>And going to the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make my Prayer to the God, that he would please, by his Oracle, to direct me what course I would take to convey away the two young Lovers; but the God was swifter than a thought, for the Heavenly powers do favour such as resign their will to theirs, though not implored; often preventing mens Petitions with their bounty; as at this time <hi>Apollo</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated my demand, with his reply, making me know his pleasure and direction; for as I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58429:85"/>
was hasting towards the Prophetess, troubled in my mind how I might execute my design, a voice stayed me as I passed, saying, Do you go so fast, and hear not how these Strangers call you? They were a company of Merchants, that to the sound of Flutes and Hoboys, were doing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and celebrating a Feast in Honour of <hi>Hercules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I stayed when I perceived them, for I should have offended the Sacred Mysteries of Religion, to have passed by them without respect, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Voice having invited me, after I had put Frankincense in a Thurible, and incensed the Altar, offering a little Water, it seem'd they thought me very sumptuous in my oblations, and intreated me to take part of their Banquet; I obeyed them so far, and when I was set down upon a Couch, which the strangers had strew'd with Myrrh and Bays, and had tasted such things as I used to eat: Noble Gentlemen, said I, you have done me the Honour to feast me so, as I cannot desire any greater dainties, I now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long to know your Estate and Fortunes, therefore now it is time, if you please, to tell me who, and of what Country you are, for it would be rude, and an Incivility in me, having sat with you at the Feast of a Sacrifice, and imitated Friendship by you, by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a sacred repast, if we should part without having a more particular knowledge one of the other.

They told me it was: You shall have me your Companion, I reply'd, if you will give me leave, for I must make a Voyage into <hi>Sicily,</hi> about my affairs, and you know those that Sail for <hi>Africa,</hi> must pass by this Island.

            <p>I promised not to fail, first taking their Faith by Oath, they should not loose to Sea before the time appointed; and so I left them Dancing to their Musick, that play'd quick strains like Jiggs, which they footed in the <hi>Assyrian</hi> garb; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with little Skips capering in the Air, sometimes bending their Knees to the Earth, and skrewing their whole Bodies, as if they had been possest with some prophetick Spirit. And coming to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> I found her with the Jewels yet in her lap, that <hi>Charicles</hi> had present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: Then I went to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and having advertis'd them both what they should do; I retir'd to my Lodging, attending with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the issue of my project.</p>
            <p>The next day this happen'd. When Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night drown'd all the Town in Sleep: A Troop of Young Gentlemen Armed, besieg'd the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Chariclea. Theagenes</hi> was Captain of

            <p>I holding on my course to <hi>Charicles,</hi> found his House full of Tears and Tumult: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Servants of <hi>Chariclea</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought him news of the carrying away of his Daughter, and Citizens came in from all parts of the Town, and flocked about despairing <hi>Charicles.</hi> In summ, the ignorance of what was done, and the want of Counsel in what was to be done, confused them all: I therefore thundering amongst them with a loud voice; O miserable Men (said I) how long will you stand like stupid things, mute and dull, as if you were deprived of your Judgment with your Fortune? What will you not Arm and pursue your Enemies? Will you not take and punish them who have done you such an injury? But <hi>Charicles</hi> replied, it were perhaps superfluous and vain to struggle longer with these disasters, for I

Then the God foretold me, for my presumption I should be deprived of that was dearest to my Eyes: yet let not this hinder you to fight (as they say) with the Gods themselves, if we knew whither we should go, and who hath been so cruel to us: It was (said I) even the <hi>Thessalian</hi> whom you so much admired, and would needs make me acquainted with him; it was <hi>Theagenes</hi> and his youthful company; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may find some of them yet in Town, for sure they cannot be all departed; therefore rise and call a Council of the people. It was done so as I appointed, and the Captains sent their Men to proclaim, by sound of Trumpet, that the Townsmen should assemble: immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the people came in, and they held a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, by night, upon the Theatre.</p>

the turning of an Engine: If you will first pay me down a ransom for your Daughter, for you know well the <hi>Persian</hi> and the Merchant only study for their gain: I know it, said <hi>Calasiris,</hi> and you shall have it as it is good reason; but why are you so free, that amongst all your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits you will also anticipate our Suit, and are pleased of your own accord, to propose the restitution of my Daughter. I will only first intreat your leave, to make my Prayers to the Gods: With all my heart, said <hi>Nausicles,</hi> I my self am now going to offer Sacrifice, I shall desire your presence there, and that you will pray the Gods to send me riches, and receive for your self, that which I have in present: Do not you mock me nor be incredulous, said <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siris,</hi> but go before and prepare the Sacrifice; and when all things are ready, I will come.

               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:58429:101"/>The Gods, O <hi>Nausicles,</hi> said <hi>Knemon,</hi> then give to your heart the effect of your desires; since having sent for all sorts of Musick to your Feast, now neglect them for the present, and leave them to such as have more low affections in their Souls, while you are covetous to hear sacred and mystical things, mingled with a kind of a divine pleasure; wherein, I observe, you well know the power and nature of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, placing <hi>Mercury</hi> next to <hi>Bacchus</hi>; and so mixing with the delights of Feasting, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of sweet discourse; and therefore, though I justly admired the splendour and preparation of your Sacrifice; yet I cannot believe it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please <hi>Bacchus</hi> more than at a Feast made in his honour, to bring in the recital of some fine story, Speech being his proper Symbol.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calasiris</hi> obeying their desires, recounted the entire History unto them, as well to gratifie <hi>Knemon,</hi> as to oblige <hi>Nausicles,</hi> for the affairs he was shortly to have with him: He then told them his Fortunes from the beginning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating summarily, and in few words, the chief heads of what he had said before to <hi>Knemon</hi>; and purposely passing over many things that he held not necessary <hi>Nausicles</hi> should understand, but that which was not as yet related, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the premises, he continued in this sort;</p>

            <p>But <hi>Knemon</hi> staid him here, entreating him to pass no further, without telling them the cause (if haply he knew it) why the Sea in that place is continually in such violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, replied <hi>Calasiris,</hi> being there, from a large and spacious Main contracted to a Streight, and pouring it self into the Gulph of <hi>Crisa,</hi> as through a narrow Flood-gate, hasting to mix with the <hi>AEgean</hi> Sea, meets with the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> or neck of Land, in <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> that beats back its waves, hindring their impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, doubtless by the Providence of Heaven, which set that promontory to break the violence of the Streights, lest they should overflow the opposite Shore; and hence, as it is probable, comes the turbulency of this Sea, the waves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more pressed together in this than any other place of the Gulph; forasmuch as the Stream that flows in, and the Waters that flow back, encountring and beating one another, makes the billows boyl, and, by their concussion, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all the Sea with a foam, no less than in a violent Tempest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:58429:102"/>All the company having with praise and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause allowed his reasons, <hi>Calasiris</hi> thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the series of his discourse.</p>
            <p>After we had passed other Streights, and lost sight of those that are named the acute or point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Islands, it seemed to us we saw the Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the <hi>Zacynthians,</hi> like a Cloud in the Air, so far off as our Eyes could hardly discern it. Then the Pylot commanded them to hale in the Sails, and we demanding what his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to slack his course, since the wind was favourable; because (replied he) if we go with full Sail, we shall arrive at the Island about the first watch of the Night; and it is to be feared, lest in the dark we should run upon the Rocks, which lie hid with the Sea in many places thereabouts; therefore it were best to pass this Night upon the Main, where we have Sea-room, and to take no more wind than will serve to bring us to land about the break of day. Thus said the Patron, but yet, <hi>Nausicles,</hi> it was not done, for the Sun was risen before we cast our Anchors; those of the Island that lived about the Port, being not far distant from the City, ran in from all parts to behold us, as to some new and strange Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, wondring (as we conceived) at the service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of our Ship, that was so fair, so tall, and yet so light, admiring therein the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and telling us we had unusual and incredible fortune, to sail safe

in the midst of winter, when the <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iades</hi> were set. All the rest of our Mates, while the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors were loosing of the Tacklings, went aland, and ran into the City to traffick with the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I (having heard the Pylot say we should winter in that Island) went along by the Sea-Coast, to enquire out some poor Lodging for us, not being willing to remain in the Vessel, but avoiding it, for the trouble of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as an inconvenient Lodging; and shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Town, as unsafe, for concealing the flight of the two young Lovers. I had not gone far, but I saw an old Fisherman sitting before his door, mending his Broken Nets; and approaching him, I said; Save you, honest man, I pray you tell me if there be a Lodging to be taken hereabouts? It was about yonder Promontory, replied he, that I cast this Net yesterday, upon a Rock covered with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so tore it as you see; I do not ask you that, said I, but you shall do an office of humanity if you will receive me into your house, or shew me some other place, where I may lodge. It was not I, said the good man, I was not in the Boat, Heaven forbid <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> should mistake so grossly, or that Age had so much infeebled his Brain: It was the fault of my Boys, that, ignorant of the places where the Water covered the Rocks, cast their Nets where they should not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:58429:103"/>At length perceiving he was somewhat deaf, I began to speak more loud. It was Good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to you that I said, and my request was, You would shew me and my company, being Strangers, some house where we may sojourn. The Gods conserve you also, he then replied, if it please you to take such poor entertainment as I am able to give you, you shall be welcome to me, unless you be some of those that look for Houses furnished with fair Beds, or have many followers: After I had told him we were but three, my two Children and my self; It is a good number, replied he, you shall find but one more with us, for I have two Children yet at home, (their elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are married men, and house-keepers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) and the fourth is the Nurse of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for their Mother is lately dead; therefore, Sir, make no delay, and doubt not but we will receive you joyfully and chearfully, I having known as soon as I heard you speak, you were a Gentleman, by your fashion.</p>
            <p>I did so, and immediately coming with <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> the good man <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us with a very good will, and gave us the better and warmer part of his House: And indeed at the beginning we passed the Winter contentedly, remaining all the day long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never parting but at the hour of Bed-time. <hi>Chariclea</hi> did lie with the Nurse, <hi>Theagenes</hi> and I in a room by our selves; and in another little

            <p>But once unhappy, and ever unhappy (as they say.)

By my Trade, replyed he, I am known to them, and use to carry them Fish, because they buy dearest and give me greater rates than any other; and yesterday as I was drawing my Net by the side of yonder Rock, the Captain of the Pirates met me, and demanded if I knew not when the <hi>Pho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not know, replyed I, but why do you enquire so curiously? Because, said he, I am desperately in Love with her, and so ravished with the wonder of her merit, though I have but once beheld her, as I can hardly be my self; neither can I remember I ever fortun'd upon such a Beauty, though I have taken many and fairer Captives; then pulling

him nearer to me that I might the better get out his whole Plot? what need have you, said I, to Fight with these <hi>Phoenicians</hi> since that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loss of Blood, you may easily take her from my House before they imbarque. No, replyed he, there is a conscience among Thieves, and we observe the Laws of courtesie and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity towards our Friends; for your sake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forbear, least it should bring you into trouble, in regard your guests being lost, would be required at your Hands, and with one Labour I mean to gain two things, the Riches of the Ship, and the enjoying of the Maid; one whereof I must necessarily forego, if I exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute my design upon the Land; besides I should run a desperate hazard, the Port being so near the Town, as they would presently get notice of it, and so I might come to be pursued. So after I had admired his Wisdom, and praised the Excellency of his judgment; and now having discovered the Plot, these Villains have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, I earnestly beseech you to employ all your thoughts to provide for the security of your self and Children.</p>
            <p>When I had heard this news, I retired very sad, and agitated in my fancy many ways and means of safety, till accidently meeting the Merchant, and he moving me in his old Suit, I took hold of the occasion, and concealing what I pleased of the Advertisements given me by <hi>Tyrrhenus.</hi> I only told him, I had notice given

I desire, said I, if my command have any power with you, to depart hence about the beginning of the Night; after he had answered it should be done. He left me, and I returned to our Lodging, where I said nothing to <hi>Tyrrhenus,</hi> but advertized my Children, that in the Evening we were to go aboard again: the suddenness of the news amazed them, and demanding the reason of me, I put them off, promising to tell them at another time, but for the present it was necessary it should so be done.

So after we had made a light Supper, and were retired to take a little rest, an Old Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me in my Sleep, his Body as dry as an Anatomy, saving that under his Robe he shewed the proportion of a Thigh, witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the able forces of his Limbs, when he was in the Flower of his Youth, his Head was covered with a Helmet, he wore his Beaver up, and upon his Forehead appeared the marks of a Cautelous and Prudent Man, and he drew one Thigh after him, as if he had received some hurt when he came near me; with a kind of a threatning Smile, he said, O Sir, you make no accompt of us, for of all those that ever past along the Island of the <hi>Cephalenians,</hi> you only disdain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Being Lanched forth upon the Main again; the West Winds of the Spring now sweetly breathing, the Patron Night and Day directed his Course to the Coast of <hi>Africa</hi>: for, he said, We might cross the Sea directly, by a Line, if the Wind changed not.

But as soon as this tranquillity of the Heavens had smoothed the Seas, the Galley was come up to us sooner than I can speak it; for (as I believe) all that were within her put their Hands to the Oars; their Vessel also being light and nimble of it self; when they were very near us, a <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthian</hi> Passenger in our Ship cryed to us, Friends we are all undone, this is a Pirate, I know the Galley of <hi>Trachinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the report of this News, a sudden fear seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our whole Ship, and in a Calm we had a Tempest, ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

running up and down, some running under the Hatches, some standing upon the Decks, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the rest to endure the Fight, and there were some would have got into the Long-boat and fled, till by their two long delay the Fight surprized them within the Ship, forceing them to remain, and to take in their Hands what they could find to defend themselves. <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> full of Courage burned with desire of the Battel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I (after I understood our Enemy was <hi>Trachinus</hi>) prepared some Sleights might afterwards do us good service, which fell out as I expected.</p>
            <p>For the Pirates approaching circled about our Ship, to make tryal if it were possible to take her without Blood; therefore they did attacque us, but still rowing about us, they would neither suffer us to go forward nor backward. Briefly it seemed as if they had Besieged us, and would compel us to render our selves upon composition. O poor unfortunate Men, said they, what Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath seized your Spirits? and why are you so deprived of Judgment, as thus to precipitate your selves into the danger of an evitable Death, by attempting to resist invincible Forces, to which yours are nothing? it is yet in your choice
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58429:110"/>
to be dealt humanly withal, we permit you all that will to take your Long-boat and save your selves. These were their Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but those of our Ship so long as they fought only in words, and saw no Blood, were daring and resolute, and said they would stand to it to the last Man.</p>
            <p>But after one of the bolder Pirates had boarded us, putting all he met to the Sword, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that the Ceremonies of War were Death and Slaughter, the rest of his Company imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately leaping after him; then the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> began to repent their Courage, and falling at his Feet, beseeched him to shew mercy to them, and they were ready to obey all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: and although the Pirates were now flesht, and began to please themselves in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (for the sight of Blood doth irritate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Spirit) nevertheless by the Command of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> beyond all Expectation, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Supplicants, and made a Peace under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch conditions as were more cruel than the War it self; for he ordained they should depart the Ship with no more but the Cloths they had on, making it Death to him that should do otherwise. But it seems there is nothing more precious to a Man than Life, which was the cause these <hi>Phoenician</hi> Merchants having now lost the hope of all the Riches in the Ship, as if they had lost nothing, but rather gain'd, and made an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Voyage, did strive who should first get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58429:110"/>
the Boat, and every one was more desirous than other to survive the loss of his Goods.</p>
            <p>But as we also (obeying the decree) were about to pass into the Boat, <hi>Trachinus</hi> took <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi> by the Hand, and said, Fair one, this War concerns not you, but Was undertaken for your sake, and since the Day you left the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory</hi> of <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> I have still followed you, adventuring thus far upon the Sea, and facing danger for your Love; therefore let not any fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehension seize you, but confirm your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and know with the Empire you already are possessed of in my Soul, you shall be the Lady of all the Wealth you see, thus he said; but <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> full of discretion, and knowing by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions I had given her how to apply her self to the time mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> excellently well, presently cleared her look from all the marks of Sorrow that now incompassed her, and Painting upon her Face an appearance of joy, made this reply; I render thanks to the Gods that have put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your mind to use us favourably, but if you will have me be confident, please to make me this first demonstration of your Love, save this my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my Father, and command them not from the Ship; for if I be once separated from them the World hath nothing can perswade to retain Life. And speaking this she prostrated at his Feet and imbraced them a long while. <hi>Trachinus</hi> pleasing himself therein, and therefore deferring the grant of her demand: at length her

            <p>Now while these things were said and done, the Sun being in his Circuit come full West, that space which is betwixt the Day and Night grew very Dark and Foul, and on a suddain the Sea began to be troubled; it may be the Season caused the present change, or perhaps it was by the Pleasure of some Destiny a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to order the Prow, another as wise as he to guide the Poop and govern the Helm.</p>
            <p>But that which principally cast us into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest danger, was not the violence of the Tempest (for the Waves were not yet at the height of their fury) but it was the ignorance of him that took upon him to be Pylot, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the Storm so long as there was any Day light, but when it grew black Night, gave over his Charge; and when they were now ready to sink, at first some of the Pyrates did endeavour to have recovered their own Galley, but were beat o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f from their design by the Tempest: <hi>Trachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> also staying them and making a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, that if they could save the Ship and Riches in her, they should have Wealth enough to purchase a Thousand such Galleys; and speaking those words, he cut the Cables that held them together, telling them that whilst they kept their own Vessel they drew another Tempest after them, and that in doing so he provided for their security, since wheresoever they should arrive it would draw suspition upon them, and inquiry would be made after the Persons that Sailed in the Empty bottom.</p>
            <p>This he said appeared to them to be reason, and they approved his Council, out of two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, being already sensible of the one; for they were no sooner severed from the <hi>Brigantine,</hi> but they felt the Sea did not toss them so much as before, yet were they not quite out of the

aside, where one could over-hear him; Father, said he, I i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I approved his words, and feigned my self to be overjoyed, rendring great thanks to the Gods that had done me the Divine favour to make my Daughters Master willing to take her for his Wife; then retiring my self a little to study what was to be done, I instantly returned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him what was thus happily begun might be accomplished a little more honourably, appointing the Ship to the Maid for her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Chamber, and forbidding his Men to enter or any way to disturb her, that so she might have leisure to apparel her self like a Bride, with as much Ornament and care as the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58429:113"/>
for it would be said, It is a poor and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming thing, that a Maid descended of a Rich and Noble Family, and which is more that must be the Wife of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> should not at least, upon the Day of the Solemization of her Nuptials, be drest in the Richest Robes and Jewels she then had, since Fortune and the place had deprived us of a more glorious Habit.</p>
            <p>At these words <hi>Trachinus</hi> was transported with joy, and promised he would do it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and immediately commanded that all things whereof they had need, being exported out of the Ship, no person should dare to approach it any more: They obeying the charge he gave them carryed to Land Tables, Cups, Tapestries, Carpets, Works of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> and many other Moveables and Utensils, that might be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable at a Feast. Finally every one took with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure and loaded their Shoulders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order with those Riches, which much labour and many frugal Hands had gathered; and which Fortune had exposed to the profusion of these Pyrates, to make a dissolute Banquet full of prodigious abuses.</p>

brave Spirits with the good News, that our Plot went well in a right Path.</p>
            <p>A while after we sat down to Supper, and when I saw them high flown in Wine, and knew their heated Brains were apt to petulancy, I wispered <hi>Pelorus</hi> in the Ear, (for I sat next him for that purpose) Have you not seen (said I) how my Daughter is Apparelled? he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he had not: but you may now see her conveniently (I told him) if you will go pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to the Ship, and take heed no Eye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you, for you know <hi>Trachi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had scarce spoken these words but without any delay he rose from the Table, as if he had been pressed with some sudden business, and ran secretly to the Ship.</p>
            <p>There he beheld <hi>Chariclea</hi> wearing upon her Head a Crown of Lawrel, Apparelled in a refulgent Robe of Cloth of Gold (for she had put on the Sacred Habit that she brought from <hi>Delphos,</hi> that it might either serve to adorn her Victory or Funeral,) and seeing the Cabbin where she was, accommodated to the form of a Nuptial Chamber, the sight (as it was likely) set him all on fire, Love and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy augmenting his amorous torment so, that when he returned to us, one might read in his Eyes the rage imprinted in his Soul, and it was evident his thoughts laboured with some
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58429:115"/>
furious design, and he was scarcely set down again at the Table, but Choler sparking in his Eyes, he said, Why have not I the reward of my merit for being the first that boarded the Ship? because (said <hi>Trachinus</hi>) you have not demanded it, and that yet we have not divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the spoils. I desire then, replyed <hi>Pelorus</hi> the Captive Maid: and when <hi>Trachinus</hi> added, That, excepting her, he should take what he would. What (said <hi>Pelorus</hi>) will you break the Law of Piracy, that gives his choice of the prey to him that first boards a Ship, and for all his Fellows runs the hazard of his Life? Friend (said <hi>Trachinus</hi>) I violate not that Law, but I ground my self upon the Authority of one more powerful, that commands us to obey the wills of our Captains without contradiction, the Maid has wounded me to the Heart with her bright Eyes, and to heal my wound I am forced to marry her; and, Sir, I hope it is a reason I should be preferred before you, and if you will not obey this Law, I will make you presently repent it with a blow of this Cup I hold in my Hand: Then <hi>Pelorus</hi> looking upon his Companions, You see, said he, what recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence our Labours are to expect; thus you shall one day see your merits frustrated of the reward of your virtue, and be, as I am, Slaves to this tyrannical Law.</p>

At the hearing of these words his strength redoubled, to which <hi>Pelorus</hi> was not able to make resistance longer, as if the voice of his Mistress had infus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new vigour into him, letting him know the reward of his Victory was yet living. For now resuming the heat of his first Spirit, tho broken and weigh'd down with many Wounds, he made a blow at <hi>Pelorus</hi> with his Sword full a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his Head, which he hoped to cleave a sunder, as assuredly he had done, if the Pirate had not declined his Neck; yet he escaped not, for the Sword descending, took away the top of his Shoulder, and falling right upon the Elbow joynt of his Sword-hand, cut it quite off; then <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> fled to save his Life, <hi>Theagenes</hi> following him.</p>
            <p>What the sequel was I cannot tell you, but that I saw not when <hi>Theagenes</hi> returned; for remaining upon the ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of the Hill, I dared not to stirr in a place full of Enemies by Night, when my Friends could not know me; but <hi>Chariclea</hi> was more bold, and it seems more quick sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for with the first dawning of the light, I perceived <hi>Theagenes</hi> lying stretched out upon the Earth like a Dead Man, and saw her sitting and Weeping over him, with evident demonstrations that she intended to kill herself, but that some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope of his revival restrained her as yet, and held her Life in equal suspence with his. But I, unfortunate Man, had not so much as time to speak to them to sweeten their Calamities with my words, or to apply remedy to his wounds, so fast did the evils at Land (without a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings space) succeed to those at Sea.</p>
            <p>For, at the first Spring of the Morning, as I was descending from the Hill where I had pitched for that Night, I saw a Troop of <hi>AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Theives, running from the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that lyeth along that Coast, who presently
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58429:117"/>
seized upon my poor Children, taking them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and all the Riches they could carry out of the Ship. I spake afar off to them, and in vain bad them farewel that could not hear me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring their Fortunes and my own; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being able to defend them, or holding it good to go and mix with them, I reserved my self to hope to succour them some other way. And indeed it was not in my power to do them present service, being left far behind, my Age like a heavy burden not suffering me to march so quick a pace as those <hi>AEgyptians,</hi> that mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and descended by strange Paths, and through Wild places. Now by the Mercy of the Gods, and your favour, worthy <hi>Nausicles,</hi> I have found my Daughter then lost, having contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to her recovery but my abundant Sighs, Tears, and Lamentations.</p>
            <p>Speaking these words he wept, all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were forced to do the like, changing their Feast into a Sorrow, intermixed with joy, (for Wine intenerates the Eyes and makes them apt to Tears) and they were not able to contain their flux of pity, till <hi>Nausicles</hi> spake thus to confort <hi>Calasiris.</hi> Father (said he) chase away these sad conceptions and fill your Heart with Joy, since you have now recovered your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that only one Night remains to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it self betwixt you, and the contentment you shall receive in beholding your Son, for to Morrow Morning we will Ride to <hi>Mitranes,</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:58429:117"/>
and deal with him all possible ways, for the redeeming of your beloved <hi>Theagenes.</hi> O may the Gods be so favourable, replied <hi>Calasiris:</hi> but now it is time to dissolve the Feast, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give thanks to the Gods, and drink at parting; so Wine being brought, taking their leaves they drank to one another, and so did rise from the Table. But <hi>Calasiris</hi> looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout for <hi>Chariclea</hi> and not finding her in the multitude, was greatly perplexed, till at length a certain Woman advertized him, that she saw her enter the Sanctuary of the Temple. He presently ran thither and found her prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Feet of an Image, where by reason of the length of her Prayers, and the weight of Sorrow that lay upon her Heart, she was faln into a Swoon. Then after he had shed some Tears, and humbly conjured the Gods to change the rigour of her destiny into better Fortune, he softly awaked <hi>Chariclea</hi> and returned to his Lodgings with her. Being now in the House she retired to the Chamber of <hi>Nausicles</hi>'s Daughter, lying with her, but not taking any rest, care not permitting her to close her Eyes.</p>

But now let me que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion you, I pray, whither, or upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are you travelling?

            </p>
            <p>This is the occasion of <hi>Mitranes</hi> his absence from home, but for my part I must make hast to <hi>Isias,</hi> who already is looking sharply about for me, thinking my smallest delay a Sin against Love. Oh She is too subtle in accusing me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cause, and inventing Crimes to lay to my Charge! He had no sooner given them this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but they stood silent and stupifi'd, to find themselves so unexpectedly disappointed. <hi>Nausicles</hi> at length brought them again to themselves, admonishing them that they should not be so discourag'd with one disappointment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58429:123"/>
(which was but for a short time) as to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Hope and Care of what they had in hand: That it was now their best way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back again to <hi>Chemmis,</hi> as well to take council about their affairs, as also (having fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished themselves with fresh provisions for a longer Journey) to resume their search of <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> wheresoever they should hear that he was detain'd, whether amongst the Thieves or elsewhere; every where proposing to themselves good hopes of finding him.</p>
            <p>For even this did not seem to happen without the providence of the Gods, that they should so unexpectedly meet with an acquaintance, by whose discourse they were in a manner led by the hand to the place where it was most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to seek for him: wherefore they should go directly to the Thieves Village. When he had thus spoken, he easily perswaded them, partly, as I suppose, because another hope arose from what he had said, and partly because <hi>Knemon</hi> bid <hi>Calasiris</hi> be of good cheer, for that <hi>Thyamis</hi> would preserve <hi>Theagenes.</hi> They therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to return, where they found <hi>Chariclea</hi> in the Porch, looking out to all quarters of the Country. When she did not perceive <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> with them, with great lamentation she cryed out, O Father, are you come back no more in number than you went forth? without doubt then my <hi>Theagenes</hi> is dead.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58429:123"/>
It is humanity to make short the story of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, by which the mind is better fortifi'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the evil. <hi>Knemon</hi> therefore intercepting her sorrow, said, What means this practice <hi>Chariclea</hi>? You are always conjecturing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is plain, O <hi>Knemon</hi> (said <hi>Calasiris</hi>) from what you have spoken, that you never were in Love; otherwise you would know that Lovers fear where there is no danger, and give trust to nothing beside their own eyes, concerning the person that is most dear to them. Absence fills their minds with doubt, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally having resolved never to be from each other, unless some sad accident separates them. Wherefore we must excuse <hi>Chariclea,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under the violence of Love. Let us how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever consult what is to be done in this affair. Having thus spoken, taking <hi>Chariclea</hi> by the hand, with a fatherly observance, he led her into the House. But <hi>Nausicles,</hi> being desirous to divert their care, ordered a more sumptuous Banquet than usual, obliging them with the presence of his Daughter, most splendidly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled. When they were refresh'd with the entertainment, he thus spake to them; The Gods are witnesses (my dear Guests) that your company is most delightful to me, and if you would spend your lives with me, you should
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58429:124"/>
command all that I am master of as freely as my self: Forasmuch as I have not received you as Guests, but intimate Friends, and such as will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have the same esteem for me, I can think no obligation too much. I am likewise no less ready to engage my Friends and Acquaintance in any thing may do you service. Yet you must be sensible that my way of Life is Merchandise; this is the Field which I am obliged to cultivate. Since therefore the Westerly winds now blow favourably to make the Seas Navigable, and call forth the Merchant, my affairs, amongst others, summon me to <hi>Greece.</hi> You will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do well to acquaint me with your design, that I may order my affairs so as to make them serviceable to you.</p>
            <p>When he had thus said, <hi>Calasiris,</hi> after a little Pause, thus reply'd. Success (O <hi>Nausicles</hi>) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your Voyage, may <hi>Mercury</hi> send you Gain, and <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Since you have treated us here with so much courtesie, and now dismiss us at our desire, in all things fulfilling the Laws of Friendship and Hospitality. As for us, though it be a great trouble and grief to depart from you and your House, which we have used as our own; yet it is necessary for us to pursue the search of our dearest Friends. This is both mine and <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s resolution: But for <hi>Knemon,</hi> whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to wander farther with us and continue his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58429:124"/>
assistance, or what other purpose he has, let himself declare. <hi>Knemon</hi> was desirous to reply something to this, and long attempting to speak, but sighs choak'd his speech, and tears drown'd his eyes: At last collecting breath, and uttering a deep groan; O Fortune (he cry'd) how full of change and unstable art thou! of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others I am a sad example. Thou hast deprived me of my Kindred and Fathers House, and sent me an Exile from the Country and City, that are most dear to me: Thou hast driven me as far as <hi>AEgypt</hi> (not to mention my Disasters in the way) and put me in the power of Thieves and Out-laws: At last I had a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of hope, by falling into acquaintance and company with persons, who (though as wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as my self) yet they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall I leave <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea,</hi> before she has found her <hi>Theagenes</hi>? This would be inhumane? Or shall I go with her to seek him: If we were certain at last to find him, it were labour well undertaken, but if the event be doubtful and greater misfortunes befal, Where will our Travels end? What if now I beg leave both of the Guardian Deities, and of you, to speak at last of returning to my Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and native Soil, especially since so fair an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by the providence of the Gods offers

But, O <hi>Chariclea,</hi> (for to you I would chiefly be excus'd) do you give me pardon and grant me this leave: I will attend you as far as <hi>Bessa,</hi> and entreat <hi>Nausicles</hi> to stay a while for me, so that if I deliver you not into the hands of <hi>Theagenes,</hi> yet at least you shall acknowledge me faithful to the trust he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me: and from the good Conscience in what has passed, depend at parting on Success in what is to come. If after all (which the Gods forbid) we fail of that success, yet even so I shall seem to merit pardon, not even then leaving you alone, but in the Guardianship of this good <hi>Calasiris,</hi> your Guide and Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chariclea</hi> conjecturing by many arguments, the Inclination of <hi>Knemon</hi> for the Daughter of <hi>Nausicles</hi> (so quick-sighted is a Lover to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the same passion in any other) and also by what had been spoken, that <hi>Nausicles</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd the alliance, and given <hi>Knemon</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny secret encouragements; upon the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he was no fit Companion, but must be suspicious for the future; she made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58429:125"/>Do what seems good to you (said she) I thank you for the good offices you have already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and for the future there is no necessity for you to be burden'd with our affairs, or run the risque of other peoples fortune. Return to your own Country and domestick concerns; and by no means neglect your friend <hi>Nausicles,</hi> nor the opportunity which he offers. <hi>Calasiris</hi> and my self will engage all dangers that shall befal us till we have finished our course; and though no mortal shall assist us, we rely on the protection of the Gods. May all things (said <hi>Nausicles</hi>) succeed to your desire; may the Gods accompany you till you recover your Friends, which will be a just reward of your Prudence and Constancy. But, <hi>Knemon,</hi> be not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that you bring not <hi>Thisbe</hi> back to <hi>Athens,</hi> since you have me, who was the Author of her departure: For I was that Merchant <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,</hi> her Lover, who carry'd her away. But if you are as well pleas'd with the proposal as I, you shall under my conduct gain great wealth, and recover your Country. And if you are disposed to marry, I will give you my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Nausiclea</hi> with a great Dower, since I know your Family. <hi>Knemon</hi> made no pause, finding what he had secretly desired so fairly offer'd to him: Whereupon <hi>Nausicles</hi> deliver'd his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, commanding his Servants to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Nuptials; himself began the Dance, suddenly converting the Feast into a Wedding.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58429:126"/>
The rest of the Family in other Apartments so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd the Marriage with Songs and Dancing, so that the House shone all night with Nuptial Torches. But <hi>Chariclea,</hi> separating from the rest, went into her own Apartment, and making fast the door, to prevent disturbance, as if seiz'd with Bacchanal fury, tore both her hair and garments: Let us (said she) perform our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as the posture of our affairs require, with the outmost pomp of Sorrow. Let us weep instead of Singing, and beat our Breast instead of Dancing. Let us out with this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom Taper, while Night echoes to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and presides over the Ceremony. What Apartment has it prepar'd for me? What Bride-chamber has it adorn'd? The God that has charge of me, is all my company; depriv'd of him who in name only is my Husband. <hi>Kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> leads up his Nuptial Dance, <hi>Theagenes</hi> is yet wandering, and perhaps a Prisoner in Chains; nor am I certain that it is so well with him, or that he is at all. <hi>Nausiclea</hi> my Bed-fellow, is removed from me into the embraces of her Husband, <hi>Chariclea</hi> is left alone: I envy not her fortune, Gods, wishing her all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but complain of your dealing so hardly with me. You have drawn out my Tragedy beyond all bounds. But why do I charge the Gods with unkindness? let the remainder of pleasure be perform'd. Yet, O <hi>Theagenes,</hi> my dearest care, if thou art dead, which I hope
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58429:126"/>
never to live to hear, I shall make no delay to be with you. For the present I perform these Rites (wherewith she pluck'd off her hair and laid it on the Bed) and pour these Libations from my Eyes, which are dear to thee (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she bedewed the Coverlet with her Tears.) But if thou art alive and safe, O hasten to my Arms, and at least visit me in Dreams! Having thus spoken, she cast her self with her face to the Bed with vehement sighing, till stupify'd with her grief, she fell into a sleep that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till broad day. <hi>Calasiris</hi> therefore won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring that she did not appear according to her custom, enquired for her, and went directly to her Chamber-door, where knocking aloud, and calling her by her name, he awaken'd her.

It is no new passion or concern that put me into this disorder: the absence of <hi>Theagenes</hi> causes this disturbance, and my grief is still the greater, because I cannot know certainly whether he be alive or dead.

               </gap>cted happiness: For coming near to the Town about Sun-set, they perceiv'd a great number of dead men newly slain, some of them were <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> which they knew by their habits; others were Inhabitants of the place. It appeared plainly that there had been a Battel, but with whom they did not know; till they had gone about the dead Bodies, to see if any of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance lay amongst them, (for minds that are extremely sollicitous for the welfare of what is most dear to them are always fearing the worst) they perceiv'd an old Woman fixt over one of the dead, a native of the place, and breaking out into many Lamentations. They therefore resolv'd if they could, to get some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from the Beldame: Therefore going up to her, they endeavoured at first to comfort her, and asswage her vehement grief. When she had admitted their consolation, they began to demand of her, What person it was whom she bewail'd? What War had been fought? <hi>Calasiris</hi> speaking to her in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tongue. She gave them a brief account of all; That she lamented for her Son, who lay speechless; That she came with resolution into the Field that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58429:129"/>
some of the armed men might kill her, in the mean time that she performed just Rites of Grief towards her Son. As for the Fight, she gave this account; That a certain young stranger, of excellent form and stature, was led Captive to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Memphis:</hi> That he was sent, as she supposed, by <hi>Mitran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When therefore by a certain sign they were assur'd of his approach, they placed Ambuscades in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places, by which they overcame the Enemy; part of them setting upon the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Van, and the rest from their secret places, upon their Rear. <hi>Mitranes</hi> was the first that fell, and with him almost all his followers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surrounded, and of ours not a few: In this number, by the severity of fate, was my Son, who receiv'd a wound, as you see, in his Breast by a <hi>Persian</hi> Javelin. This being expir'd, I lament; and am likely soon to do the same for my other, he being gone with the rest of our Souldiers, against the City of <hi>Memphis.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58429:129"/>
               <hi>Calasiris</hi> ask'd her the cause of that expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? She, as she was inform'd by her Son that surviv'd, told them, That the Kings forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, and <hi>Mitranes</hi> their General slain, they were assur'd what they had done would be of no small consequence: That <hi>Oroondates,</hi> who lay at <hi>Memphis</hi> with a great Army, would immediately approach and beset their Town, and revenge the injury, by cutting off the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: They therefore determin'd, since they had brought themselves into so great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to follow one bold attempt with a greater, that being the only means to secure themselves from the Kings fury: Thinking with their sudden approach to carry <hi>Memphis,</hi> and take the King Prisoner; or in his Absence, if he were with his Army gone on expedition into <hi>AEthiopia</hi> (as it was rumour'd) they might with more case compel the City, being destitute of Defence, to surrender: And likewise to perform a considerable service for <hi>Thyamis,</hi> who was by his younger Brother depriv'd of office of High Priest, which they would restore to him. But if they should be frustrated in their design, that yet they would dye with their Swords in their Hands, nor ever come into the power of the <hi>Persians,</hi> to suffer Scorn or Tortures: And now give me leave to ask whither you are going? To the Town, said <hi>Calasiris.</hi> It is unsafe, said she, at present, especially for strangers. But if you will receive us for your Guests (said <hi>Calasiris</hi>) we shall be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58429:130"/>
secure enough. The season will not permit, reply'd she, I being this night oblig'd to perform funeral Ceremonies. But if you can endure it (and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is necessary that you should) to pass the night in some place, remote from the dead Bodies, at break of day I will take you for your security into my custody. All this which she spoke, <hi>Calasiris</hi> interpreted to <hi>Chariclea;</hi> and so took her with him to a private place. When they had passed a little way from the dead, they came to a little Cave, where he laid him down with <hi>Chariclea</hi>'s Bow under his Head. <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> sat down in another corner of the Cell, the Moon then rising, and lightning all without. <hi>Calasiris</hi> fell into a fast sleep, being tir'd at once with Age and the long Journey. <hi>Chariclea</hi> kept awake with care, became Spectator of a most horrid scene, though usual amongst those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For the Woman supposing her self to be alone, and not likely to be interrupted, nor so much as to be seen by any person, fell to her work. In the first place she digg'd a pit in the Earth, then made a fire on each side thereof; placing the body of her Son between the two plains; then taking a Pitcher from off a three-legg'd Stool that stood by, she pour'd Honey into the Pit, Milk out of a second, and so out of a third, as if she had been doing Sacrifice: Then taking a piece of Dough, form'd in the likeness of a Man, crown'd with Lawrel and Bdellium, she cast it into the Pit. After this,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58429:130"/>
snatching a Sword that lay in the Field, with more than Bacchanal fury (addressing herself to the Moon in many strange terms) she launched her Arm, and with a branch of Lawrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with her Blood, she besprinkled the fire: with many other prodigious Ceremonies. Then bowing herself to the Body of her Son, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering in his Ear, she awaked him, and by the force of her charms, made him to stand upright. <hi>Chariclea,</hi> who had hitherto look'd on with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient fear, was now astonisht; wherefore she wak'd <hi>Calasiris</hi> to be likewise Spectator of what was done. They stood unseen themselves, but plainly beheld, by the light of the Moon and Fire, where the business was perform'd, and by reason of the little distance, heard the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the Beldam now bespeaking her Son in a louder voice. The question which she ask'd of him was, If her Son, who was yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, should return safe home? To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd nothing, only nodding his head, gave her doubtful conjecture of his success; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fell flat upon his Face. She turn'd the Body with the Face upward, and again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her question, but with much greater violence, uttering many Incantations, and leaping up and down with the Sword in her hand, turning some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Fire, and then to the Pit; she once more awaken'd him, and setting him upright, urg'd him to answer her in plain words, &amp; not in doubtful signs. In the mean time <hi>Chariclea</hi> desired
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58429:131"/>
               <hi>Calasiris</hi> that they might go nearer, and enquire of the old Woman about <hi>Theagenes;</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, affirming that the spectacle was impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that it was not decent for any person of Priestly Office to be present, much less delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such performances: That Prayers and lawful Sacrific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While he was thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the dead person made answer, with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and dreadful tone: At first I spared you, Mother, (said he) and suffer'd your transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing against humane Nature and the Laws o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having thus said, he again fell prostrate. The Hag being sensible who were the Spectators, arm'd as she was with a Sword, in rage sought them amongst the dead Bodies, where she thought they lay conceal'd, to kill them, as persons that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded her, and crost the operation of her Charms: While she was thus employ'd, she struck her Groin upon the Splinter of a Spear that stuck in the ground, by which she dy'd; immediately fulfilling the Prophecy of her Son.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58429:133"/>
and late Service. The Townsmen, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were terrify'd with expectation of great numbers, when they found their Enemies were few, drew up the Archers and Horse that were left to defend the Town, with the rest of the Citizens, arm'd as the sudden chance could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them, prepar'd forthwith to set upon the Enemy. A Person of Age and Eminency dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded them from their attemyt, saying, That though <hi>Oroondates,</hi> the Deputy, were absent, yet it was meet first to consult with <hi>Arsace,</hi> his Wife; by which means the Souldiers who were left, would more willingly engage. They approved his Council, and accordingly went to the Palace, where Deputies reside in the Kings absence. <hi>Arsace,</hi> beside the Charms of her person and stature, had great management in affairs; such as became her Royal Blood, and the Sister of a King: Yet for Luxury and dissolute Life, deserv'd no little blame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things, she was partly the cause of <hi>Thyamis</hi>'s Banishment from <hi>Memphis.</hi> For when <hi>Calasiris,</hi> for those mischiefs which were fore-told about his Sons, was withdrawn from the City, so long, that he was suppos'd to be dead, <hi>Thyamis,</hi> as his eldest Son, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately invested in his place of High Priest: <hi>Arsace</hi> immediately fixt her Eyes on him in the Temple, where, beside his youth and comely personage, he appear'd more charming with the splendid habit of his Office. She forbore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58429:133"/>
not from immodest glances and signs, which <hi>Thyamis</hi> took little notice of, being of a chaste temper. But his Brother <hi>Petisoris,</hi> who had already envy'd his Dignity, and observ'd the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of <hi>Arsace,</hi> took occasion from thence to form a snare for his Brother. Therefore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately addressing himself to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> did not only tell him the Inclination of <hi>Arsace,</hi> but falsly added, That <hi>Thyamis</hi> was contracted to her. He easily believ'd, being already jealous of <hi>Arsace,</hi> but as yet gave her no disturbance, having no clear proof of his surmize; as also out of respect to the Blood Royal, his suspicion was to be supprest and conceal'd: Yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not to threaten <hi>Thyamis</hi> with Death, till he was expell'd the City, and <hi>Petisoris</hi> made Priest in his stead. These things were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transacted. When now the people were throng'd about the Palace, and told her the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy, which she already knew, and desired her Commands on the Souldiers; she answered, That whereas they knew not as yet the numbers of the Enemy, nor who they were, nor for what cause they arrived, That it were expedient first to go up to the Wall to take a view of the Enemy, and resolve as they saw o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoughts. Her Rage being renew'd with this Remembrance of her former injuries from <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soris,</hi> she consider'd which way to revenge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon him. One while surveying <hi>Thyamis,</hi> and then <hi>Theagenes,</hi> she was divided in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and successively had a passion for each: For the one a former flame, and for the other a more violent, though kindled that moment; insomuch that her concern was perceiv'd by her Servants. But when she came to her self, like one from a swoon; Excellent persons (said she) what madness has possest you, who have not only expos'd all the <hi>Bessians,</hi> but your own beautiful selves, in behalf of Robbers; for you are not able, if we should engage, to sustain our first Onset. The Kings affairs are not yet reduc'd to that distress, though the Deputy be absent, but that you must needs be encompass'd by the remainder of his Souldiers in the City. But I see no reason why the Publick should be concerned in this difference; since therefore the quarrel is private, let the decision be so too; so that the Gods and Right must determine the event. It therefore seems just to me, that the <hi>Memphians</hi> and your Forces should lie still, and not engage in a needless War. This Judgment of <hi>Arsace</hi> was applauded with the shouts of her people. They not only suspected <hi>Petiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> of Injustice, which they desired to see pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; but also every one rejoyc'd to have his own Danger laid on another persons head.

            <p>At this they relented, and not only fell, but threw themselves headlong at his Feet, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Knees, they look'd up to his Face, to assure themselves if it were he, and that they were not deceived by some Spectre.

She therefore continued waking all night, turning from one side to the other, sighing deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sometimes rising up, and then throwing her self down upon her Bed again.

               </gap> them. In fine, this passion had distracted her, but for an old Woman, <hi>Cybele</hi> by name, the keeper of her Cabinet, and former Servant of her Love-intrigues. She guess'd the affair, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58429:138"/>
came into the Chamber, as it were a Torch, adding fire to her flame. Madam, said she, what frenzy is this? What new passion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports you? What Persons Aspect has disturb'd my Charge? Who is so vain and hardy, as not to be taken with that Beauty, and not account such an enjoyment the greatest happiness? tell me, my dear Daughter; for there is none so obstinate, as not to be vanquish'd by my Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems. You have already had good proof thereof. These words, and many more to this purpose uttered she, embracing the Feet of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sace,</hi> and soothing her into Confession. O Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reply'd <hi>Arsace,</hi> after a little pause, I have now receiv'd a deeper wound than ever; I have often found your skill successful in these affairs, but know not now what it can do. The War which was this day almost begun before our Wall, prov'd unbloody to others, but to me the beginning of a more fatal War, wherein I am wounded to the very Soul; in unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewing me the youth that accompany'd <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amis</hi> during the Combat. You know, Mother, whom I speak of; for with the splendour of his Beauty he soon clouded all the rest, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering no mean Birth, nor Aversion to Love. This your Judgment cannot be ignorant of: Wherefore, since you know my grief, 'tis high time to set all your Engines to work; to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all your Art and Industry if you would have your Daughter to survive. For of what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58429:139"/>
use is Life, without enjoyment of the person whom I affect. I know the youth (reply'd the old Woman;) He that is full Breasted, his Neck erect, his Eyes sparkling, and at once display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love and Severity; with fair and well-order'd Hair, his Cheeks just budding with youthful down; to whom a certain Damsel, not disagreeable, but excessive impudent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, and cast her Arms about him: Is not this your Man, Lady? The very same, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And you have well brought into my mind that domestick Creature, who yet is far hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than I, in possession of such a Lover. At this the Old Woman smiling, reply'd, Be of good heart, and lay aside care, Madam; It is but for a day that she is held beautiful by the stranger; but when I bring it about that he shall enjoy your Beauty, that sordid Harlot shall be despis'd. Do so, my dear <hi>Cybele,</hi> and you will at once ease me of a double grief, Love and Jealousie. Leave that to my care (said she) in the mean time it is your part to compose your self with good hopes, and not to despair of my work before I begin. Having thus said, she went away, taking the light with her, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fast the Door. <hi>Arsace</hi> no sooner perceiv'd day-light, but she call'd one of her Eunuchs, together with her Woman, to whom she gave little Cakes, and sent them to do Sacrifice at the Temple. When they came to the Gates, and told the Door-keeper their business, That
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58429:139"/>
they were come to do Sacrifice for <hi>Arsace,</hi> who had that night been troubled in Dreams; the Officer forbad their entrance, acquainting them, That the Temple was at present full of Sorrow: That the High Priest <hi>Calasiris,</hi> the last evening, enlarging his Soul in chearfulness, and after the Banquet made long supplications to the Goddess: Then telling his Sons, That hitherto they had seen their Father; and giving them strict Charge concerning the two <hi>Grecian</hi> strangers, he betook himself to his Bed. After thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, whether his pores were too much dilated through excess of joy, or worn out with Age, or by the fix'd decree of the Gods, about Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow he expired, in presence of his Sons, who watched him. We have now sent Messengers to assemble the Priesthood of the City, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form those Funeral Rites, which, according to our Custom, are due to him. You must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depart; for it is not lawful for any Person to enter the Temple, or do Sacrifice for these seven days but only the Priests. What then must become of the two strangers, said <hi>Cybele,</hi> during this time?</p>
            <p>Our new Prelate <hi>Thyamis,</hi> (said the Officer) has commanded a Lodging to be prepar'd for them without the Temple; and behold where they are now in obedience, going forth out of the Temple. <hi>Cybele</hi> having got this lucky op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, thus again bespeaks the Officer; O Friend, belov'd of the Gods, it is in your power
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58429:140"/>
to do this young Couple a courtesie, but a much greater to <hi>Arsace,</hi> the Kings Sister. You know how she favours <hi>Grecians,</hi> and uses hospitality to strangers: Tell them therefore, that by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Thyamis,</hi> an apartment is provided for them in the Palace. The Officer did as she commanded, being sensible of no harm, but thinking to do the persons a kindness, in assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Reception to the Palace. Coming therefore up to <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> drown'd in Tears; You are to blame, said he, having been commanded to the contrary, thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the death of the High Priest, whereas our Divine Laws enjoin us to rejoyce for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of his happiness. However, you are partly to be excus'd, having lost (as you say) your Father and Patron: Yet ought you not altogether to despond, since his Son <hi>Thyamis,</hi> as you see, succeeds him in the Priesthood, and is no less your friend. He has given charge in the first place concerning you, and order'd you a dwelling, to which persons of the first Rank are proud to be receiv'd, and therefore well may strangers be so, who seem of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fortune.

Why are you (said she) so averse to Love? A Youth so beautiful, in the spring of his Age, belov'd by an equal Beauty, yet esteems not the good fortune: Especially when no danger attends, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being absent, and I (who have bred her,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58429:145"/>
and know all her secrets) having the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affair. On your own part, there can be no impediment, having neither Mistress nor Wife. Though many have despised even these considerations, and thought they did not therein wrong their Domestick concerns; but took the opportunity at once of making their fortune, and enjoying their pleasure. Lastly, she mingled Threats with Arguments; saying, That the most obliging Women conceive the greatest displeasure, when disappointed, and severely revenge the neglect. Think with your self, That this Lady is a <hi>Persian,</hi> and of Princely Blood, as you have acknowledg'd; with what Power she is vested; so that at her pleasure she may reward her Favourites with greatest Honours, and punish those that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige her. For your part, you are a stranger here, deserted, and have none to succour you. Take pity both on your self and her. She is worthy of your Compassion, since you were Author of her pain, and it is for you she languishes. At least, fear a Lovers Rage, and beware of that Revenge which follows Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I have known many of your temper, who have repented too late.</p>
            <p>I have greater Experience in these matters than you: These hairs are grown grey in the Employment; but so obstinate and incorrigible a Youth I never yet met withal. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Chariclea</hi> (of necessity indeed she hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all this discourse) and do you, Daughter, (said she) advise this Brother of yours, though I know not if he deserve that title. This busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will also turn to your advantage; you will be never the less lov'd by him; you shall have all Honours conferr'd on you; be made as rich as you please, and advanc'd to a most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Marriage. These things are to be wish'd for by happy persons, not by the Destitute, and Strangers. But <hi>Chariclea,</hi> looking angrily and earnestly upon her, It were to be wish'd, said she, on all accounts, that <hi>Arsace</hi> suffer'd under no such passion, at least that she could mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate her desires; but since humanity is liable to such frailty, and that she is over-power'd, I would my self counsel <hi>Theagenes</hi> not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, if it may be with safety; lest it come to light, by some Accident, to her undoing, by the Deputies knowledge of it. <hi>Cybele</hi> leapt for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But on this account there is no reason why you should fear, since the Sun himself shall not be privy to it.

Happiness: Which since it is so, it is the part of Prudence to make the best of bad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.

But know that I cannot so much as dissemble, or make a pretence in such an affair; to act or say, in unlawful things, is alike to generous minds. If <hi>Arsace</hi> despair, there will be, at least, this advantage in it, that we shall no more be troubled with her sollicitations. But if I must suffer, both my past fortune, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, have inur'd me to bear what shall be put upon me. <hi>Chariclea</hi> said no more, only desir'd him to take notice into what mischief they must inevitably be brought.</p>

She is desperately in love with a certain Youth; her passion is invincible; and after hopeful expectation, both she and I have found our labour frustrated. From hence proceeded these manifold favours expressed to the Strangers. But since the foolish Youth is intractable, I fear she will not live, and know my own Death to be certain. This is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed

estate of our affairs. If you can give any relief, do it quickly; if not, prepare your Mothers Funeral. But what Reward shall I have, Mother, said he; for it is not seasonable to tell you at large how far I can be serviceable, whilst you are in this disorder, and almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring. You shall have whatever you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, said <hi>Cybele:</hi> You are already made, on my account, her Chief Cup-bearer: If there is any further preferment which you would have, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it: The Riches shall be without measure which you shall have, if you preserve her. I neither ask Preferment nor Wealth, said he; let her only give the Maid, who is call'd the Sister of <hi>Theagenes,</hi> for my Wife, and all things shall succeed to her desire. I am passionately in love with the Virgin: Wherefore our Lady la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with the same passion, will more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gratifie my Desires, especially for so great a Service. Doubt it not, said <hi>Cybele</hi>; besides, I may privately prevail with the Virgin on your behalf. But tell me, What method do you propose? I shall not tell it, said he, till my Lady has promis'd me with Oath; nor do you till then attempt any thing with the Virgin; lest by precipitance you destroy all, she being, as I perceive, of a great Spirit.</p>
            <p>Hereupon she return'd to <hi>Arsace,</hi> and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herself at her Feet, desir'd her to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all things shall do well, only be pleas'd to call my Son <hi>Achemenes</hi> into your Presence.

How mean you, said she? When she had thus ask'd, he told her all that had past; That he had been ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O Madam, said he, we are obliged to the Gods, that since we are born of noble blood, we have yet the comfort in our Misfortunes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your Servants: To you, who exercise such courtesie towards Strangers. But for my Sister, since she was not your Captive, she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made to serve; yet she has resolv'd in all things to obey; do therefore what you shall judge to be right. You shall be plac'd, said <hi>Arsace,</hi> among the Waiters on our Table, and learn the Art of Cup-bearing, to practise the Royal Service before-hand.</p>
            <p>They went forth from her Presence; <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> with a thoughtful Countenance, <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> receiving him with scoffs: Behold, said he insulting, that you, who lately were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, who thought your self the only free man, who disdain'd to bow your Head, and pay reverence, what you are now come to. <hi>Arsace</hi> in the mean time sending the rest away, said to <hi>Cybele</hi> alone, Now <hi>Cybele</hi> tell this proud youth, that if he will submit to our pleasure, he shall have his freedom, and live in wealth and plenty; but if he continues obstinate, I will use him like my Slave, and impose on him the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest

But what is to be done? What contrivance can be found to free me from the detested Embrace of <hi>Arsace,</hi> and you from <hi>Achemenes?</hi> Yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I have a sudden thought, as necessity is fruitful in Invention: Then turning to <hi>Cybele,</hi> Tell your Lady, said he, that I desire to speak with her alone, and in private.</p>
            <p>The Old Lady imagining <hi>Theagenes</hi> to have consented, ran to <hi>Arsace</hi>; and being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring him after Supper, she accordingly did so: Commanding the Attendants to leave their Lady to her Rest, and clear her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, she brought <hi>Theagenes</hi> into her Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

Whereas therefore you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd me many Courtesies, I beg but one instead of all, that you would revoke the Marriage of <hi>Chariclea</hi> and <hi>Achemenes</hi>: For, not to mention other things, it is unfit that she, being of Noble Birth, should be wedded to a Servant.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58429:151"/>
stung with Jealousie to hear that <hi>Chariclea</hi> was not his Sister, but his Spouse: Yet be it as you will, said she, we shall make <hi>Achemenes</hi> amends by some other Match. I shall likewise answer your desires, said <hi>Theagenes,</hi> when you have null'd this Promise. With these words he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to kiss her hand, but she stooping, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the salute upon her Lips: <hi>Theagenes</hi> then took leave of her. As soon as he could, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Chariclea</hi> with what had past, (who heard him not without some Jealousie) how all was compass'd by one means; the Nuptials with <hi>Achemenes</hi> broken, time gain'd to divert the sollicitations of <hi>Arsace</hi>; and what would crown all, that <hi>Achemenes</hi> would put things into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, enrag'd at his disappointment, and to see me preferr'd to him in the favour of <hi>Arsace:</hi> That nothing would be conceal'd from him, his Mother giving him the Intelligence: For I took care, for that reason, to have her present, as also for a witness of our Conversation. It is to be expected (added he) that <hi>Achemenes</hi> will lay snares for <hi>Arsace:</hi> a Slave by Birth (who have a natural inveteracy against their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours) especially being injured, and defrauded of her promise; seeing also others preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and being conscious to her practices, so that there is no need of forg'd Inventions, there being sufficient grounds of truth to work upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58429:151"/>Having thus spoken to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd her to take some hope, he was the next day b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Banquet was done, I have one favour to beg, said <hi>Theagenes,</hi> That you would please, Madam, to order me always to perform my Office in this Robe. <hi>Arsace</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, he resum'd his own dress, and went forth: <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

she would not suffer it. This, says he, I tell you as a Friend, and one whose Sister, by my Ladies promise, is to be my Wife; with many more things to this purpose. But <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> as not hearing him, went forward, with his Eyes fix'd on the ground, till <hi>Cybele</hi> met him, as she was returning to lay her Lady on her Bed in the heat of the Day.

she promised him, Mother? She has, my Son, in my presence and hearing; and will accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly celebrate their Nuptials in few days: but for you she designs another Match. <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> at this sighing deeply, and wringing his hands, said, I shall render the Marriage fatal to them all; only do you assist me, by delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nuptials for a time: and if any enquiry be made after me, say that I remain sick in the Country. The Stranger calls his Sister his Spouse only to break off the Marriage with me: though if he should Embrace, Kiss her, or Sleep with her, I shall never believe but she <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

Thus was the Deputy thrown at once into the Toils of Rage and Love. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without delay, calling <hi>Bagoas,</hi> one of his Eunuchs, to him, (of great authority and trust)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58429:155"/>
with fifty Horse to accompany him, he sent him to <hi>Memphis,</hi> to bring <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> as soon as he could find them.</p>
            <p>He also sent Letters: One to <hi>Arsace,</hi> of these Contents.</p>

                     <hi>THeagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> the two Captive Kindred and Royal Servants, you must send to me, to transmit them to the King; send them willingly, for otherwise they shall by force be taken away, for I give Credit to <hi>Achemenes.</hi>

            <p>To <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the Chief Eunuch at <hi>Memphis,</hi> he wrote thus:
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>OF your Negligence in my affairs at home you shall hereafter give an account; at present deliver the two <hi>Grecian</hi> Strangers to <hi>Bagoas,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arsace</hi> be willing or not.

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Begoas</hi> therefore, according to Command, went with the Letters signed with the Deputies own Seal, that at <hi>Memphis</hi> they might give him the better Credit, and more easily deliver the Strangers to him. <hi>Oroondates</hi> in the mean time set forward against <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Achemenes</hi> to follow him; who knew
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58429:155"/>
(though no mention was made thereof) that he was kept in Custody till the truth of what he had informed were known. These things passed at <hi>Memphis.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Thyamis</hi> (while <hi>Achemenes</hi> was upon his way to <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>) having in full power receiv'd the Office of High-Priesthood, an Office of first Rank in the City, and perform'd all Rites belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Funeral of <hi>Calasiris,</hi> to the outmost terms of the constituted time, he then called to mind <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea</hi>: for now it was permitted to him, by the Pontificial Law, to converse with Strangers. Therefore, upon enquiry, finding that they were carry'd to the Deputies Palace, he forthwith demanded them of <hi>Arsace,</hi> alledging that they belong'd to him upon many accounts; That his Father <hi>Calasiris,</hi> on his Death-bed, committed them to his care: Giving her thanks that she so courteously treated the Strangers, during his Confinement to the Temple: But however, that he was obliged to remand the Pledges left to his Trust. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reply'd <hi>Arsace,</hi> that while you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Humanity, you condemn me at the same time of Inhospitality, in supposing me not able or willing to provide for the Strangers. Not so, said <hi>Thyamis,</hi> I know they may live here in greater plenty than with me, provided they are so contented. But since they are of Noble Race, and have run through changes of Fortune, and still are wanderers, nothing can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58429:156"/>
be so desirable to them as to recover their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Country. In which, that I might be assisting to them, my Father left me his charge, beside many other obligations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship between us.</p>
            <p>You do well, said <hi>Arsace,</hi> to urge your Right, by which you will sooner prevail with me, than by force. Have you then dominion over them, said <hi>Thyamis?</hi> By what means? By right of War, reply'd she, which made them my Captives, and consequently my Slaves. When therefore <hi>Thyamis</hi> understood that she spake of <hi>Mitranes</hi>; O <hi>Arsace,</hi> said he, it is not now War but Peace; as that brings into bondage, this should set at liberty: Besides, War and Peace should be judg'd not by the Name, but Reason and Constitution. How can it be Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable or Profitable to you to detain the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arsace</hi> could no longer contain; but that happen'd to her which is usual for Lovers, while they think their sentiments conceal'd, they have Modesty; but when discover'd, they lose all sence of shame. She therefore suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Thyamis</hi> perceiv'd her passion, made no account of his Priestly Dignity, but casting off the Modesty of her Sex, told him, That what he had done against <hi>Mitranes</hi> should not pass unpunished; for the time should come when <hi>Oroondates</hi> would call his Murderers to account. For the present I will not dismiss my
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58429:156"/>
Vassals, though in little time they shall be sent to the King my Brother. Wherefore leave your idle reasonings of Right or Wrong, with them that have Authority, and depart willingly from our Palace, lest you be compell'd by force. <hi>Thyamis</hi> therefore went forth, calling the Gods to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and affirming that these things could come to no good issue; resolving to acquaint the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herewith, and call in their assistance. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sace</hi> retir'd to her Chamber, calling <hi>Cybele</hi> to her, to take counsel of what was to be done. She had now some suspicion of <hi>Achemenes</hi> his absence; and when she ask'd <hi>Cybele</hi> about it, she fram'd divers excuses, affirming any thing rather than own his departure to <hi>Oroondates.</hi> Yet she did not altogether impose upon her, the length of time creating mistrust. What shall we do, <hi>Cybele,</hi> said she? Or how shall we work our-selves out from the streights that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass us? My desire is not lessen'd but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by denial. The Youth grows more obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and intractable than ever. He has hitherto fram'd delays, but now he flatly denies me. And that which more troubles me, is lest he should likewise apprehend what I suspect of <hi>Achemenes.</hi> For <hi>Achemenes</hi> much disturbs me, being gone to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> to perswade him of what he knows or conjectures; if I could but see <hi>Oroondates,</hi> one tender Word or Tear from me would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. But I am afraid, lest before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>Theagenes,</hi> or can see <hi>Oroondates,</hi> he should
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58429:157"/>
determine concerning me. Wherefore, <hi>Cybele,</hi> turn every Stone, try all your Art with the young man, since you see our affairs are brought to the last exigence: For you must imagine that when I despair for my self, I shall spare no other person. Therefore take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your Sons endeavours, for I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how you can be ignorant thereof. As for my Son, Madam, or my fidelity to you, you shall find that you censure falsly. Wherefore, since you so negligently pursue your Love, you must not lay the blame on others: For you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise not the Authority of a Mistress with him, but the submission of a Slave. Which method perhaps was discreet at first, but since he is obstinate, you should make him feel your power, and constrain him, by Torments, to obey your pleasure. It is the manner of Youths to despise when they are Courted, but to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit on Compulsion: Wherefore, he will do that by Punishment, which he refus'd on En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties. You seem to speak rightly, said <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sace,</hi> but how can I endure to see him chastiz'd. You are too tender, replyed <hi>Cybele,</hi> as though he would not by light chastisement be made to embrace Pleasure; and for your part of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, you will be rewarded with your outmost Wishes; but if you cannot bear the spectacle, deliver him to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to be scourg'd as for some fault, which you may hear though not see; and if you find him change his mind, you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58429:157"/>
may at pleasure put an end to his Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arsace</hi> suffer'd her self to be perswaded; for Love, when despis'd, spares not the Object, but turns Kindness into Revenge. Calling therefore the Chief Eunuch to her, she gave him Orders accordingly. He being by Nature envious, and possest with inveteracy against <hi>Theagenes,</hi> for what he had seen and suspected, immediately threw him into Bonds, and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with Stripes and Hunger. The place was dark where he kept him, and though he knew the cause, he dissembled, often asking <hi>Theagenes</hi> the reason; who gave him no answer; wherefore he daily renew'd his Punishment, and more severely than <hi>Arsace</hi> intended. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and suffering none to come to him beside <hi>Cybele,</hi> who perpetually visited him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to commiserate his condition, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their former acquaintance, but indeed to find if he were to be wrought upon by the Tortures. He shew'd himself more a Man, more resolute than ever, yielding his Body to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, triumphing in his Misfortune, that gave proof of his Love to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That all was well with him if she did but know his Constancy; continually calling her his Light, his Life, and Soul. When <hi>Cybele</hi> perceiv'd this, (contrary to the will of <hi>Arsace</hi>) she gave command to have his torments encreased. Nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther thus did she hope for success, but last means
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58429:158"/>
were to be try'd when affairs were desperate; she expected that <hi>Oroondates,</hi> when he should hear of it, would take Revenge on <hi>Achemenes.</hi> She fear'd lest <hi>Arsace,</hi> when her passion was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, would lay violent hands on her self, and that consequently it were impossible for her to escape; wherefore, if things came to the worst, she resolv'd to involve all together in the same fate.</p>
            <p>Returning therefore to <hi>Arsace,</hi> We lose our labour, Madam, said she, he is still more reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and obstinate, having always <hi>Chariclea</hi> in his Mouth, and solacing his sufferings with her Name. Let us therefore cast forth our last An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and remove this Obstacle to our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: If he shall once know that she is dead, he will of course admit your kindness, despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his former Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arsace</hi> catcht at what she said, being before enrag'd with Jealousie; you advise well, said she, I will take care to have her dispatch'd: But whom shall we get to perform this? For though the power be in your own hands, yet the <hi>Persian</hi> Laws forbid to put any to Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Judgment of the Magistrates. You must therefore contrive to lay some Crime to her Charge: Yet if you think fitting (for I would run any hazzard for your sake) I will attempt her Life by Poyson. <hi>Arsace</hi> approv'd hereof, and commanded her to do it. She therefore immediately went about it; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58429:158"/>
               <hi>Chariclea</hi> in Tears and Lamentations, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, compose your self, and now take some Repast with me. What reason have I to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you, said <hi>Chariclea</hi>? For it has been your continual practice to deceive me. I swear by the Gods, answer'd <hi>Cybele,</hi> that this day all things shall be well with you, and you shall be freed from all your Cares: only do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore destroy your self having now fasted for so many days: Taste therefore of what is now set before you. <hi>Chariclea</hi> obey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d her, though not without suspicion; but partly assenting to her Oath, and partly for Joy of what was told her: For the mind easily believes what it earnestly desires. She therefore sat down to eat. While the Attendant fill'd the Wine, <hi>Cybele</hi> beckon'd to her first to give the Cup to <hi>Chariclea</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her self. But the Old Lady, before she
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58429:159"/>
had drank to the bottom, spilling the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to storm, and looking sternly upon the Waiter, was immediately enflam'd, and seiz'd with Convulsions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chariclea</hi> was fill'd with horrour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to lift her up; she likewise call'd the assistance of them that were present; for the mischief seem'd swifter than an Arrow, the Poyson being of so strong a Tincture, as to destroy the youngest and strongest Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in a feeble and old Body it dispers'd it self in a minute through all the Vitals. The Convulsions now remitting, she lay motionless, a blackness overspreading her Skin. Though, I suppose, her Rage, for being deceiv'd, gave no small help to the ferment. For even now, breathing her last, she did not intermit her frauds, but partly with signs, partly with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken words, perswaded them that <hi>Chariclea</hi> had Poyson'd her. At the same minute that she gave up the Ghost, <hi>Chariclea</hi> was brought bound to <hi>Arsace.</hi> She therefore demanding whether she had procur'd the Poyson, and affirming that if she deny'd, Tortures should force her into Confession, <hi>Chariclea</hi> became an unwonted spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to the Beholders. For without any meanness of Spirit, or concern in her Face, she enter'd smiling into her Presence, partly out of Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cience of her Innocence, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Joy that she should not survive <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> if he were dead; and also because the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58429:159"/>
Death which she design'd to perpetrate on her self, was now to be perform'd by other hands. O Princess, said she, if my <hi>Theagenes</hi> live, I am guiltless of this Action; but if he be dead, there is no need of calling Council, or inflicting Tortures, you may spare your self that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: You have me here who destroy'd the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that bred you up, kill me therefore without delay. You can do nothing more grateful to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who has resisted your impious sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arsace</hi> was enrag'd hereat, and commanded her to be struck: Carry, said she, this Victim, bound as she is, to let her Lover see how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously she returns his Constancy; command <hi>Euphrates</hi> to load her all over with Chains, and leave them together, till the <hi>Persian</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy shall be assembled to morrow for her Condemnation. By this time the Maid that serv'd the Wine was brought in: She was an <hi>Ionian</hi> Slave, and the same that by <hi>Arsace</hi> was appointed to wait on <hi>Chariclea.</hi> Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she was mov'd with kindness to her, or by Divine Impulsion, she sigh'd and wept most bitterly. O wretched Creature, said she, and void of all Crime! The standers-by being in wonder hereat, and urging her to speak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, she confessed that she her self gave the Poyson to <hi>Cybele,</hi> having receiv'd it first from her, to administer it to <hi>Chariclea:</hi> That, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was through concern at so unwonted a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58429:160"/>
Practice, or whether mistaking the Signs of <hi>Cybele,</hi> ordering to minister first to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> she changed the Cups, and gave the Poyson to the Old Lady. She was therefore led to <hi>Arsace,</hi> as thinking she should please her in clearing <hi>Chariclea.</hi> But when she had given her this account, <hi>Arsace</hi> commanded her also to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Custody, as an Accomplice in the fact, and to be kept for the next days Session. She also summon'd the <hi>Persian</hi> Magistrates, by Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, to be ready. When therefore they were sat, early in the morning, <hi>Arsace</hi> gave in her Accusation, telling all that had past, condoling also with Tears, the loss of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that bred her, who was dearer to her than her life; appealing to the Judges with how much courtesie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he had treated the stranger, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn had done her such Injury. <hi>Chariclea</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd nothing to the Charge, but confest the Crime, affirming that she gave the Poyson, adding also that she would likewise have taken off <hi>Arsace,</hi> had she not been prevented. For having told her resolutions over-night to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and conferr'd with him, she resolv'd to undergo any manner of Death, to depart from a life so full of trouble, of implacable Fortune, and endless Wanderings; she there bid him her last farewel. The Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Jewels, with the rest that were expos'd with her, which she always secretly preserv'd, she now placed next to her Body, carrying, as it were, with her the Rites of her Funeral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:58429:160"/>
She therefore own'd every Crime that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and more than were charg'd. For which reason the Judges hardly forbore from in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some of them had seen her led to Tryal, others, by reason of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour spread all over the City, came to have a view of her. <hi>Arsace</hi> was also present, and sat a Spectator on the Wall: For it would have troubled her not to have beheld <hi>Chariclea</hi> suffer.

O Sun and Earth (she cryed out) O powers above, and you that below take Vengeance on wicked Souls, you are witnesses that I am Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of all that is laid to my Charge. But that I my self willingly submit to Death, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable troubles which I sustain. Receive me therefore with favour. However, take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and with a strong Guard of <hi>Persians</hi> laid hands on <hi>Chariclea.</hi> Then looking sternly upon the People, Are you not asham'd, said she, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue from punishment a Woman that is a Witch and Poysoner by her own Confession? While you give her aid, you do violence to the <hi>Persian</hi> Laws; to the Judges, Deputy, and King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. You are mistaken, in imputing her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to the Gods: Will you not come to your sences, and find that this is the effect of her Witchcraft, in which she has such command, as even to restrain the power of Fire. Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore to morrow in Common Council, and you shall not only hear her Confession, but also those of her Accomplices, whom I have in Custody.</p>
            <p>Herewithal she led her away, herself going next to her, and commanding the Guards to keep off the Crowd. But the People were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, part of them had thoughts of resistance, part of them having still some suspicion of her Witchcraft, and the rest fearing the Power of <hi>Arsace. Chariclea</hi> therefore is once more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and loaded with more Irons; reserved for a second Sentence and Execution: But still blessing her fortune, in seeing <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> and conferring with him about what had passed. For <hi>Arsace</hi> had so order'd it, out of Malice, that the young pair might behold each others misery, and be mutually afflicted with each others sufferings: For she knew that the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58429:162"/>
torment of the person belov'd, more affected the Lover than the party that suffer'd. But it was by them esteem'd as an Advantage, to see each others Constancy. It was some relief to converse together, and comfort one another with the consideration, that what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd was upon the account of Truth and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>After they had till midnight discours'd, in such a manner as was proper for Lovers that were never more to talk together; they at last talk'd of the Miracle that happen'd about the Fire. <hi>Theagenes</hi> imputed it to the kindness of the Gods, who shewed their Indignation against the unjust Decree of <hi>Arsace</hi>; but <hi>Chariclea</hi> was doubtful. That Accident, said she, seems to have come by Divine Providence, but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd only for greater Misfortunes, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Gods, unless they have secretly decreed to give relief at the greatest Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theagenes</hi> advis'd her to think more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Divine Powers: Be propitious to us, O ye Deities, said he!

the Bonds of <hi>Arsace</hi>? But how that shall be, is neither manifest nor credible to us, but to the Gods it may be possible: Let them take care of that who gave the Prophecy. That part which related to me you have already seen accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my wonderful preservation. And though at that time I knew not that I carry'd my safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard about me, yet I now understand that I did. Those precious things that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with me in my Infancy, I have always accustom'd to carry conceal'd about me, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our necessities when brought to the last dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but if Death should overtake me, to answer the Charge of my Funeral. Amongst these, <hi>Theagenes,</hi> there are Bracelets of great value, with <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>AEthiopian</hi> Stones, with a certain Ring given by my Father to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which is the Stone call'd <hi>Pantarbe,</hi> set in a Square, with Sacred Letters about it. It seems to have some Divine Virtue in it, by which it repell'd the power of the Flames, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving those that carry it, from any hurt. I conjecture, and know so much, by what was suggested by the Divine <hi>Calasiris,</hi> who told me, That the same was expressed in the Writings that were found with me. This seems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, said <hi>Theagenes,</hi> by the Deliverance that you have had; but what <hi>Pantarbe</hi> shall defend us from to morrows danger? For though it should still defend from the Fire, it cannot give Immortality; and <hi>Arsace</hi>'s Malice will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58429:163"/>
some more violent means to destroy us. And would to Heaven that the same sort of Death, and in the same hour, would dispatch us both! I should think this Death but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease from all our suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erings. Take heart, said <hi>Chariclea,</hi> we have another <hi>Pantarbe</hi> promis'd in the Oracle.</p>
            <p>While they were employ'd in these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, each affirming, That the others misery more afflicted them than their own: obliging themselves, by mutual Oaths, to preserve their Loves and Vertue to Death. It being now in the very dead of night, <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his fifty Horse, arriv'd at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mphis.</hi> When they had waken'd the Sentinels, and had given account of themselves, they were immediately receiv'd into the Deputies Palace. <hi>Bagoas</hi> left his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany without, to guard the House, to be ready for his Defence, if any Resistance were made. He himself, in the mean time, went a private way, easily forcing the Doors, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silence, to the place where <hi>Euphrates</hi> was, the Moon not being yet quite set; finding him therefore in Bed, he awaken'd him, who in disorder cry'd out, Who are you? It is I, said <hi>Bagoas,</hi> command a light to be brought in. He therefore order'd the Boy that waited on him, to bring in a Taper, so as to disturb none of the rest. When this was done, and the Boy departed, What Mischief, said <hi>Euphrates,</hi> has occasion'd this untimely and unexpected Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val?
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58429:164"/>
There needs not many words, said <hi>Bagoas,</hi> read these Letters, but before take notice of the Seal, and know that <hi>Oroondates</hi> sent them; and that it is as much as your Life is worth, not to perform what they import.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Euphrates</hi> had run over the Letters; As for <hi>Arsace,</hi> said he, she will be sorry, having yesterday fallen into a Fever, which still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues so violent, that there is small hope of her Life. But for my part, I would not deliver these Letters to her, though she herself ask'd for them; for I know she would destroy both her self and us, before she would send away the young Pair. Know however, that you are come in good time to take them away, and must therein use your utmost endeavour. Take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on them, they having suffer'd a hundred Tortures, unwillingly inflicted by me, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd by <hi>Arsace.</hi> They seem however of Noble Birth, and for the Experience that I have had of them, of Vertuous Conversation. Having said this, he brought him to the Prison, where <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goas</hi> no sooner beheld them, though wasted with Watchings and Torture, yet he was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at their Stature and Beauty. But they supposing that <hi>Bagoas</hi> was come at that silent time of the Night, to lead them to a Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Execution, were a little troubled. But soon recovering a chearful countenance, they made it appear how little they were concern'd. <hi>Euphrates</hi> now coming up, and knocking out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58429:164"/>
the Wooden Peg with which their Irons were joyned, Take your Sacrifice, <hi>Arsace,</hi> he cry'd out: She thinks in night and darkness to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her horrid Crime, but the Eye of Justice is sharp in discovering and bringing to Light the Deeds of Darkness. Do you execute what you are commanded, and whether Fire, Sword, or Water is determin'd against us, let us only have the same Death. <hi>Chariclea</hi> desired the same. The Eunuchs weeping, led them forth in their Chains. When they were come out of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties house, <hi>Euphrates</hi> staid there. But <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his fifty Horse, having taken off their Bond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t only what might secure, but not burden them; mounting them on several Horses, and putting them in the middle of the Guards, made towards <hi>Thebes</hi> as fast as he could. When they had travell'd all the rest of the night, and till nine the next morning, without any stop, the Sun then growing hot, they could proceed no farther, being spent also for want of Sleep, <hi>Chariclea</hi> especially; they determin'd therefore to take up somewhere to rest themselves, and refresh their Horses. There was a certain Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley at the foot of a Promontory of the <hi>Nile,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most surrounded with the Water, which made an Eddy: There was much Grass and Herbage on the place, as being always well Water'd, every where shaded with Sycamore Trees, and such others as grow on the Banks of the <hi>Nile:</hi> There <hi>Bagoas,</hi> with his Company, took up,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58429:165"/>
using the Trees for a Tent, he sat down with the rest to feed, compelling also <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>sons that were presently to die; but he perswaded them there was no such thing intended; That they carry'd them not to Death, but to <hi>Oroondates.</hi> But now the Heat of the day decreasing, the Sun being no longer over their Heads, but faln Westward, and beating on their sides, while <hi>Bagoas</hi> was going to take Horse again, a certain Horse-man in a sweat, and out of breath with hard Riding, came up, and took him aside to speak with him: He fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes upon the ground, as it were, full of thought concerning what had been told him: Take Comfort, Strangers, said he, your Enemy <hi>Arsace</hi> is dead by her own hand, understanding that you were taken away, preventing a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, by a voluntary Fate: For she would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have escaped punishment from <hi>Oroondates,</hi> or the King; and if she had not been put to Death, at least must have led the remainder of her Life in Disgrace. <hi>Euphrates</hi> sends me this Intelligence. Wherefore be of good Hope, for I am well assur'd that you have done no body wrong, and she that injur'd you is Dead. Thus spake <hi>Bagoas</hi> in imperfect <hi>Greek</hi>; adding also, That he himself was glad, having suffer'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyranny of <hi>Arsace:</hi> Wherefore he the more encourag'd his Prisoners: For he hop'd that <hi>Oroondates</hi> would be pleas'd with his service, if he

Ornaments of the <hi>Persian</hi> Court.

               </gap>s, according to the Ancient Laws of our Country. Having therefore rewarded the Spies, he gave the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners into the close custody of persons that could speak their Language; giving them great Charge to treat them with Respect and Care; to supply them with the best Provision, and above all, to preserve them from all Contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, because they were reserved for Victims: Lastly, That their Bonds of Iron should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and Fetters of Gold put upon them: For Gold amongst the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> is made use of for all things that Iron is amongst other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>This was done as he commanded. When therefore the former were taken off, and the Golden Chains put on, <hi>Theagenes</hi> smiling, said, What means this splendid Change? Fortune flatters us, in rendring us rich by our Captivity,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58429:168"/>
since we are only Captives of greater Price: <hi>Chariclea</hi> also smiled, and desired him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive better hopes of what the Gods fore-told. <hi>Hydaspes</hi> now attacking the City, and thinking to carry it at first onset, found himself deceived, the Besieged so manfully resisting his Forces, and beating them off; adding also Scoffs and Contumelies. He was therefore enraged that they so much as offer'd to resist, and did not surrender themselves on the first Attack: He resolved to lose no time, or make such a Siege, whereby some might be taken, and some escape; but at once to overthrow the whole City by an inevitable Destruction.</p>
            <p>He thus order'd the Work: He made a Ditch about the Ground that lay next to the Walls, (yet at such distance that the Slings and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows from the Town could not reach it) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ten Men to every ten Yards, to be dug of a sufficient breadth and depth; some therefore broke the Earth, while others receiv'd the Mold, which they piled up on that side of the Trench that was next his Camp, which serv'd as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Fortress to the Town: None from thence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to molest the Work, not daring to sally forth against such Numbers; and their Slings not throwing so far, as the distant space reach'd between the two Walls. Having presently finish'd this affair, by multitude of hands, he began another Project. When this Round Ditch was compleated, he left part of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58429:169"/>
casting up a Bank, and from thence made another Trench, that turned off to the River <hi>Nile,</hi> (which Trench he banked up on both sides) when therefore he had joined the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Banks to those of the River, breaking down the Fence, as it were, by opening a Sluce, he let the Stream into his Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t it was heard at a vast distance.

               </gap>t themselves to do all that was possible for persons in such exigence. In the first place, as the Wood-work of their Gates began to give way, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y stopt up the Chinks with Straw and Pitch, setting props and weights against them; they also ran up Buttresses to support their Wall. One brought Earth, another Ston<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, a third Straw, and whatever they could get together; no Hands were unemploy'd, Women, Children, and Old Age set themselves to the work: for so general and pressing a Calamity excused none. But to the more Youth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul, Orders were given to make a subterranean Passage to the Enemies Bulwark.</p>
            <p>The Work was performed after this manner. They first sunk a Pit, five yards deep perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, then by the help of Torches, they dug
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58429:169"/>
strait before them, a passage to the Enemies Banks; those that were behind still in order receiving the Earth from them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which was convey'd into the City-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and there laid on a heap. This they did, with design that when the Water should fall into this Cavern, it should force it self a passage out another way. But they were prevented, for the <hi>Nile</hi> fell so plentifully into the Upper Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, that the space between the two Walls was now a standing Lake, so that <hi>Syene,</hi> an inland Town, was now turn'd into an Island, quite sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Water. The Wall sustain'd the weight thereof for one whole day, but when it was swelled higher, and also had sunk underneath the foundation, the ground being soft and spungy, it then in several places began to yield, and threaten a Deluge on the City.</p>
            <p>The next Evening, a Part that was between two Towers, fell down; yet not so as to lye below the Flood, but so as presently to threaten an Inundation: Upon which a great Cry was set up amongst the Inhabitants, that reach'd to the Enemies Camp; and with hands lift up towards Heaven, beseech'd the assistance of the Gods. They besought <hi>Oroondates</hi> to send Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers to beg Peace with <hi>Hydaspes.</hi> He was forced to submit, but being shut in with the Waters, no Messengers could pass: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fasten'd Petitionary Letters to Stones, which he threw from Slings, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

and shot Arrows into the Boats, that came for their preservation. Thus Men that despair of Life, yet reckon it as an advantage, for a while to delay their Fate. Yet they so order'd their business, as not to wound, but only to keep them off. The <hi>AEthiopians</hi> likewise discharg'd their Arrows, not knowing the intentions of the <hi>Persians</hi>; by which means several of the wounded fell down headlong from the Wall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water. The War therefore grew hot, till a certain Illustrious Person of <hi>Syene</hi> coming between, intercepted those that were on the Wall, by speaking on this manner: O frantick Men, said he, and grown stupid with Calamity, do we repel those persons whose Aid we so lately begg'd, and make War with them at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of their coming to relieve us, beyond our expectation? If they come with a friendly mind, declaring matter of Peace, they are our Preservers; if with hostile intentions, you will easily vanquish them, though they were arrived to the very Wall. But to what purpose (if we regard our safety) should we destroy these, when we are environ'd with such a Sea, and vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers behind? Why do we not therefore receive them, and know for what purpose they are sent? His Judgment was approved by all, the Deputy himself applauding it; they then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselves, and ceased from any further Action.</p>

               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:58429:171"/>When the passage for the Ship-men was clear, and the Townsmen, by White Flags, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they should have free Landing; the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> went nearer, and from their Vessels, as it were so many Pulpits in a Theatre, they spoke in this manner; O <hi>Persians,</hi> and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Syene,</hi> know that <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> King of the Eastern and Western <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent also yours; as he knows how to Conquer, he likewise understands how to shew Mercy: That is the part of Courage, but this of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

               </gap>nts the Vertue of a Souldier, the other peculiar only to himself. Whereas therefore he has your Lives in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, either to give, or take them away; but since you are suppliant, he offers you delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, without the ruine of War. Moreover, he does not impose the terms of freedom upon you, but leaves you your selves to choose them: For he governs not the Fortunes of Men by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, but Clemency. To this Message the <hi>Syeneans</hi> answer'd, That they would deliver Themselves, Wives and Children, into his Power, to deal with them as he pleased: That they would likewise deliver the City into his hands, if they surviv'd, which in that extremity was uncertain, unless their Destruction was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Hydaspes. Oroondates</hi> offer'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <hi>Philae</hi> and the <hi>Smaragdan</hi> Mines, which were the occasion of the War, but desired that he would exact no more from him, nor require
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58429:171"/>
him to resign up himself or his Souldiers. But if <hi>Hydaspes</hi> were pleas'd indeed to exercise Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, That he would suffer those that made no resistance to depart to <hi>Elephantina</hi>; for that it were the same thing for him to die now, as to be afterwards put to death, by his King, for giving up his Army: Nay, it would be much worse, since the present would be only a single, and usual sort of Death, but the other with the severest kind of Torments.</p>
            <p>When the Legates heard this, they turn'd their Prows, and related all to <hi>Hydaspes.</hi> He smiling, and much reproving the folly of <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Nor did they that were within the Town spare their pains, not despairing of preservation, though beyond hope. They therefore made
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58429:172"/>
Suffs under ground, to receive and carry off the Water. Others brought props to the Walls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which they easily did, heaping the Stones which from the ruines fell into the Town. But after they thought themselves safe enough on this account, yet they were not without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; in the middle of the night, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part of the Bulwark, which the <hi>AEthiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the Evening had begun to dig down, (whether it were that that part was more loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heaped up, so as to let Water sink into the Foundation, or whether it broke the sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost dug through, when the Work-men were gone, or whether it happen'd by Divine Will) beyond all expectation, it fell down, with so great a noise, that both Armies were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, both <hi>AEthiopian</hi> and <hi>Syeneans</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Town-walls to be tumbled down at once: But these being secure, continu'd in their Tents, remaining satisfy'd to know what it should be, when day-light was return'd. But the Citizens ran every where to their Walls, and as every one saw his own part entire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ruine was on some other side; till the breaking day dispell'd their fears, when they saw where the Breach was, and that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e passed away. But now the <hi>AEthiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> diverted the Flood, making Cataracts, which they propt with Timber, lining them also with Mud and Straw, which the multitude of hands easily brought together. Thus the Waters pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58429:172"/>
away entirely, yet was there no passage to each other, for the depth of Mud which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, which, though it seem'd dry and crust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, yet it continued moist at bottom, so that neither Men nor Horse could pass, without being foundred therein.</p>
            <p>Thus the time passed for two or three days; The Townsmen, by setting open their Gates, and the <hi>AEthiopians,</hi> by laying down their Arms, mutually declaring Peace. This Truce was more remarkable, because it was without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Parties, and neither of them set any Watch. They that were in Town gave themselves to Pastimes, for it happen'd then to be the Festival of <hi>Nile,</hi> which is accounted the greatest of any among the <hi>AEgyptians</hi>; which is celebrated at the entrance of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Solstice, when the River first begins to swell; and for that reason this Solemnity is held by them in greatest Honour. The <hi>AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> suppose <hi>Nilus</hi> to be a God, and the most Supream, his Stream vying with the Coelestial River, because it waters their Fields without Rain, or Assistance from Heaven; it self sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the want of showers with its yearly overflow. These are Vulgar Traditions. But a likelier reason of giving him this Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is their reckoning the Copulation of hot and moist, the cause not of generation, but preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man; and that the <hi>Nile</hi> supplies the Moist, and their Earth the Dry. Yet these are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58429:173"/>
also Vulgar Conceptions: But the most skilful in Mysteries, say that <hi>Isis</hi> signifies the Earth, and <hi>Osyris</hi> the <hi>Nile,</hi> changing the names for the things. That therefore the Goddess burns with Desire of him, and always rejoyces at his return; and he being retired, laments again, as struck with blasting Lightning. This fiction their Divines have framed, as I suppose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not have their Mysteries pryed into by profane persons.</p>
            <p>Let this suffice for the present; for out of Reverence we also forbear to mention their deeper Mysteries. We will therefore return to the Transactions of <hi>Syene.</hi> This Festival Day being risen, the Natives apply'd themselves to the killing of Sacrifices; though their Bodies were over-labour'd with their Distresses, yet their Minds were never the less active for the service of their God. But <hi>Oroondates</hi> watching his opportunity, in the dead of the Night, when the Townsmen, after their Banquets, were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in Sleep, by stealth led out his Army, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an hour before given the charge of that Gate, through which he meant to pass, to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Centries. Command was given to the Officers to leave all their Horses behind them, that they might be no incumbrance, nor by their Noise discover what was done; but every man to take his Armour, and a Board or Plank along with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58429:173"/>After they were thus assembled at the Gate, they cast down the Planks which each had brought, placing them along in such Order that the one touched the other, the last still handing them to those that went before; by which means, as with a Bridge, they passed safely over the Slime. Coming to dry ground, (the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> suspecting no such thing, nor keeping any Watch) they marched with all possible speed by them, towards <hi>Elephantina.</hi> And without any obstacle, were received into the Town, by reason of two <hi>Persians,</hi> that (as it was agreed between them) sat upon the Walls, to expect their coming at that time of the night, who accordingly set open the Gates for their Entrance. At the break of Day, the people of <hi>Syene</hi> perceiv'd the <hi>Persians</hi> were fled, every one missing him that lodged in his House: They were further inform'd by conferring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and lastly, by the Bridge of Boards, which they found laid over the Ooze. Once more therefore they were seized with Terrour and Consternation, that they shewed so little Faith to <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> after having so much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced his Clemency, in permitting the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> to escape. They therefore resolved with one Voice, to go out of the City, and surrender themselves to the <hi>AEthiopians,</hi> with Oaths of their Ignorance, if possibly they might obtain Mercy. Being therefore all gather'd together, of both Sex, and all Ages, with Boughs in their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58429:174"/>
hands, and lighted Tapers, to shew their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, bearing the Images of their Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. When they had passed the Bridge, they fell on their knees, at distance, before the <hi>AEthiopians,</hi> and, as it were, at a Signal given, set up a general and lamentable Cry, deprecating Punishment by their humble Posture. Lastly, to move the greater Compassion, they set down their Children before them, permitting them to go which way they would, mollifying the Rage of the <hi>AEthiopians,</hi> by that Age, free from all suspicion of Deceit. The Infants therefore, with Consternation, through Ignorance of what was done, and frighted with the foresaid La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, ran away from their Parents, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>AEthiopians</hi>; others, not of growth to follow, fell on their faces, and lay crying on the Ground; Fortune even in them, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the posture of Suppliants, begging Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> seeing this, and supposing that they came only in a more humble and earnest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to supplicate, sent Messengers to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>now the meaning; and why they came without the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>? They inform'd him of all, the flight of the <hi>Persians,</hi> their Innocence, the Festival, and how, after the Banquet, being possess'd with Sleep, the <hi>Persians</hi> escaped; whom yet they could not have hinder'd, had they known there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Hydaspes</hi> believing what was told to him, suspecting what afterwards happen'd, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Oroondates,</hi> calling only their Priests

               </gap> him, with the Gods, which they brought for the greater solemnity, conjur'd them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to tell if they knew any thing of the <hi>Persians</hi> Designs; Whither they were gone, or in what they placed their greatest Trust? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, They knew not for certain, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd that they were gone to <hi>Elephantina,</hi> where the greatest Party of their Army were gather'd together: <hi>Oroondates</hi> putting his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Trust in his Bard Horse.</p>
            <p>When they had thus supplicated, <hi>Hydaspes</hi> did not think fit to enter the City, but sent two Companies to search if there were any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in the business, and if they found none, to continue there as a Garrison. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dismissed the Townsmen with gracious Promises, he drew forth his Army in Battel aray, to receive the <hi>Persians,</hi> if they came out against him; and if not, to set upon them. Nor had he put them into a readiness before he was inform'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the <hi>Persians</hi> were o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im. <hi>Oroondates</hi> having drawn the greatest part of his Forces to <hi>Elephantina,</hi> was forced himself with a few to take into <hi>Syene,</hi> as we have already shewn, where he receiv'd Mercy of <hi>Hydaspes</hi>; yet was he so full of guile, as to withdraw to his foresaid Army, placing all his hopes in Celerity, and thinking to come upon <hi>Hydaspes</hi> unprovided.</p>
            <p>When the two Armies were now in sight of each other, the <hi>Persian</hi> Pride was shewn, dazling
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58429:175"/>
the whole Field with Golden and Silver Arms, for the Sun then rising f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll upon the <hi>Persians,</hi> reflected from them, like Lightning, to a great distance. The <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> made up the Right Wing, their Armed Men going before, and the Archers bringing up the Rear, that being eas'd from the Incumbrance of Armour, they might more dextrously shoot their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, protected by the Armed Body. He pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his <hi>AEgyptian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Companies on the Left Wing, adding also Archers and Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whom he commanded to make Excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gall the Enemies Flank. He himself came with the Main Body, splendidly seated on a Chariot, with Guards on each side for his security, his Bard Horse being ranked before him, in which he put his greatest trust; in this posture he adventured to begin the Battel. For this Party was most Warlike, and like a Wall or Bulwark, planted before the rest of his Army.</p>
            <p>The manner in which they were Armed was thus: A chosen person, of great Strength and Stature, put on a Helmet, with a Face made to it, exactly resembling that of a Man. This covered the Head all down to the Shoulders, places only being left open for the Eyes: His Right Hand held a Weapon bigger than a Spear, while their Left was free to manage the Reins; a Sword hanging by his side; not only his Breast, but his whole Body was covered with Armour,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58429:175"/>
joined with Scales of Iron and Brass, in form of a quadrangle; one being laid waving over the other; which thus by degrees went to their extremity, the Plates being firmly riveted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet framed so as to sit without any Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to the Body, and every where plying to it: Every joint thereof turning on Wire, and extending or contracting with the motion of the Person. Thus was it wrought from the Head to the Knee, a vacancy being only left for the inside of their Thighs, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar next to their Horse. Such is the Fabrick thereof, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels all manner of Darts or Spears. From the Foot there was an Iron Boot, that at the Knee joined curiously with the Armour. In the same manner they also Armed their Horses, securing their Legs, while their Head to their Crest is entirely Armed, a Covering of Iron Plates thrown over his Back, falling down on each side to his Flank, yet so loose as not to incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his going, while it gave him protection. The Man being thus equipp'd, and, as it were, cast in Armour, is lifted up upon his Horse, not being able, by reason of the weight, to mount himself. When the Fight is begun, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reins to his Horse, and clapping Spurs to them, he rusheth upon the Enemy, as it were a Tempest.</p>
            <p>The Pike, near to the part where a long Steel Blade comes out, is fasten'd to the Horses Neck, by which means it is supported; it is also hung
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58429:176"/>
at the other end by Thongs to the Horses Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in such manner as not to hinder, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Hand of the Person that directs it: So that by the Horses motion, the force is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; by which means two or three at a time are often born upon the Point.</p>
            <p>The Deputy being thus provided, and his Forces drawn up in this manner, left the River on his Back, being much less in number than the Enemy, which served him for a Wall, to keep him from being surrounded. <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> on the other side thus order'd his Battel: Against the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> in the Right Wing, he placed his Souldiers from <hi>Meroe,</hi> skilful in stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fight; as also the <hi>Troglodytae,</hi> with those of the Neighbouring Country, from which Cinnamon is brought, in light Arms, and swift of foot, to engage the Adversaries Left Wing. But understanding the <hi>Persians</hi> middle Ranks to be their chief strength, he opposed to them himself, with Elephants bearing Towers, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the <hi>Blemmii</hi> and <hi>Seri,</hi> with Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions what to do when they were engaged.</p>
            <p>When Signals on both sides were given, by the <hi>Persians</hi> with Trumpets, by the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> with Hammers and Kettle-drums. <hi>Oroondates</hi> encouraging his Party, led them on. <hi>Hydasp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> commanded his Men to advance slowly at first, that the Elephants might keep up with them, and also that the <hi>Persian</hi> Horse in the middle might be disorder'd, before the whole Bodies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58429:176"/>
were join'd. When they were now within the Cast of a Dart, and the <hi>Blemmi</hi> perceiv'd the Bard Horse of the Enemy to come on fiercely, they observ'd what had been commanded by <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> the <hi>Seri</hi> being left to guard the Elephants, they made up speedily before the rest, against the Bard Horse, who thought them distracted, being so few in number, to set upon a Party so well Armed. The <hi>Persians</hi> likewise spurred up faster, to take advantage of their rashness, not doubting to dispatch them at the first Encounter.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Blemmi,</hi> when they were come hand to hand, as it were at one sign, sunk down all together, setting one Knee to the ground, and putting their Heads and Backs under the Horses Bellies, receiv'd no harm, but from their treading sometimes upon them. But they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what was beyond all expectation, stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Bard Horse up into their Bellies, which part alone was unarm'd: Wherefore not a few were cast off by their Horses, enraged with their wounds, whom the <hi>Blemmi</hi> stabb'd (as they lay on the ground) on the inside of their Thighs. For the <hi>Persian</hi> Cataphract is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with Armour, that he cannot stir, when once dismounted. Those that kept their Saddles were carry'd directly upon the <hi>Seri,</hi> who on their approach, retreated behind their Elephants, whose vast Bodies served them for a Bulwark. By this means there was great
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58429:177"/>
Slaughter made of the Horse, insomuch that they were almost utterly cut o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f: For the Horses frighten'd with the sight of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, leaped and started, some flying out one way, and some another, putting their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into disorder. They that sat upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants (six Archers being allotted to each Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereof each Beast carry'd two) shot so fast from thence, that their Arrows seem'd a Cloud, and so exactly aim'd, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wounded the <hi>Persians</hi> in the Eyes, who accordingly ran confusedly one amongst ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All that were born forward against their wills by the mettle of their Steeds, came direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Elephants.</p>
            <p>They were therefore thus consumed, being partly trodden down by the Elephants, partly cut down by the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>i,</hi> making Excursions from behind their Elephants, as it were from an Ambuscade. The few that escaped, went o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> without any memorable performance, and not the least hurt done to the Elephants. Those Beasts are clad in Iron when they go to War, beside the natural hardness of their Skin, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with a tough Scurf or Scale, too firm for any Spear to pierce.</p>
            <p>All being at length put to Rout, the Deputy himself fled at last most shamefully on a <hi>Nysaean</hi> Horse, leaving his Chariot behind him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, those that were of his Left Wing were yet ignorant hereof, and stood stoutly to their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58429:177"/>
work, though receiving more Wounds than they gave; sustaining all difficulties: For the Troops from the Cinnamon Region, with whom they encountred, pressed them very hard, and reduced them to the last Distress; flying off whensoever the others came on, far out-stripping them; yet shooting back, and wounding as they fled: But as the others Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, came furiously again upon them, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Flanks with Slings and little Darts, all which were notwithstanding Mortal, the Piles being dipped in Serpents Blood. They bear a round Cover on their Heads, stuck through with Arrows, the shaft end whereof is placed next their Heads, the Pile, even to the Feathers, coming out above. Thus every one marches clattering to fight, exposing a naked Body to the Foe: Crowned, as it were, with Arrows, which have no Iron on their Points, nor have any need of it: By reason that they are made of a Dragons Back-bone, an ell in length, the natural hardness whereof being sharpen'd at one end, serves for a point, from whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call such kind of Arrows, Bones. The <hi>AEgyptians</hi> notwithstanding stood a long time to it, joining their Shields together, and sustaining showers of Darts, though they were impatient of War, yet now either glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in contempt of Death, or fearing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Revolters.</p>
            <p>But when they knew the Cataphracts, the chief hope and strength of their Battel, were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58429:178"/>
fled, the very <hi>Persians,</hi> and Deputy himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn without any signal performance (save some small damage done to the <hi>Meroenses</hi>) but much more receiv'd, even they at last gave over the Conflict, and turned their Backs.</p>

therefore resolved on the danger of the Field, where I might either perform something that was beyond expectation, as many opportunities happen in a Fight skilfully managed, (the event of War it self being always uncertain) or, at least, if I escaped with life, to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse left, nothing that was in my Power having been omitted.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> warned them to be moderate in their Praises of him; and spent the rest of the day in diversion, entring Banquet with the <hi>AEthiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

            <p>The next day, sitting on a Tribunal, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed the Booty of the War amongst his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to every one according to his performance.

But your Testimonials, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Theagenes,</hi> which you have carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, will shew that it is no Forgery. The Credentials, said <hi>Chariclea,</hi> are Credentials to them that exposed them, but to them that know them not, or at least not all of them, they are no more than common Jewels and Bracelets; which also may bring with them suspicion of Theft. Or, supposing that <hi>Hydaspes</hi> acknowledge them, who is there to perswade him that <hi>Persina</hi> gave them or was Mother to the Child?</p>
            <p>By this time they were come in sight of the King, <hi>Bagoas</hi> also was brought along with them. <hi>Hydaspes</hi> seeing them rais'd himself a little from his Throne; and crying out to the Gods to be propitious, sat down again. His Attendants asking what happen'd to him, and occasion'd that Start; This morning I imagin'd just such a Daughter to be born to me, and in a days time grown to her full Stature: And whereas I am no regarder of Dreams, I forgot it, but now on sight of her likeness it returns to my Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:58429:181"/>They persuading him, that there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Images often form'd in the fancy, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token future realities; he nevertheless neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Vision, and ask'd them who, and what they were. <hi>Chariclea</hi> being silent, and <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> answering, That they were <hi>Greeks,</hi> and Kindred: Hail <hi>Greece,</hi> said he, that furnishes us with such Noble Sacrifices for our Triumph. Then smiling to his Attendants aside, Why had I not a Son likewise born to me in my Dream, (said he) if Dreams are, as you say, Pictures of things to come? Then turning to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and speaking to her in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, (which is of high esteem amongst the Gymnosophists of <hi>AEthiopia,</hi>) But why, Virgin, are you silent, said he, and Answer to no Interrogations? At the Altar of the Gods, answer'd she, to whom we are destin'd Sacrifices, you shall know both me and my Parents. <hi>Hydaspes</hi> again ask'd her, Of what Country? They are partly present, said she, and shall be altogether so at that time. <hi>Hydaspes</hi> then smil'd, and said, Certainly this Daughter of Vision, dreams her self, in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to find her <hi>Grecian</hi> Parents in <hi>Meroe.</hi> Let them therefore be taken care of, to be made Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of our Sacrifices. But who is this that stands next them, and seems to be an Eunuch? The Servants answer'd, That he was indeed an Eunuch, and named <hi>Bagoas.</hi> Let him follow them, said he, not to be himself a Victim, but to take care of another Victim, this Virgin, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58429:182"/>
she be preserv'd Immaculate for the Ceremony. Eunuchs are the best Guards, for being deprived themselves of enjoying, they out of envy take care that no body else shall.</p>
            <p>He then survey'd the remainder of Captives, and dispos'd of them, giving some for Servants, whose condition was formerly such; but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that were of free Birth, he restored to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

The rest were pensive, only these smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with chearful Countenance: <hi>Chariclea</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing constantly on <hi>Persina,</hi> so that she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd thereat, and said, O Sir, What a Virgin have you commanded to be Sacrific'd? I never saw so great Beauty and Resolution. Her Age and Form extremely move me; if our Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had liv'd, she would have been now of her years: I wish to the Gods you could find some means for her Delivery. I should be pleas'd to have her an Attendant at my Table. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the unhappy Creature is a <hi>Grecian,</hi> for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there such a Beauty in <hi>AEgypt.</hi> She is a <hi>Greek,</hi> answer'd he, by Father and Mother, whom she promis'd to produce in this presence, but how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat can be possible, I do not imagine: But that she should be deliver'd from this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I am sure is absolutely impossible, though I my self could wish it, and am touch'd with Compassion for her. Our Laws exact a Man to be Sacrificed to the Sun, and a Virgin to the Moon; and she being first taken, the people will not otherwise be satisfy'd: One help only remains, which is, if she prove not a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for such the Sacrifice requires; and if so, she is uncapable of your Reception. Let her be so found, said <hi>Persina,</hi> rather than Die; nor can she be much blamed, after such Exile and Travels, especially having Beauty, that could scarce escape Force and Rape. <hi>Hydaspes</hi> then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Fire to be brought, by the Priests, from
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58429:187"/>
the Temple, on which the Captives were to tred. Bars of Gold were heated over this Fire, and had this Virtue, That every unchaste or perjured person were burned with treading on them, but such as were otherwise, receiv'd no harm. The Corrupted Persons they appointed to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and other Gods. After <hi>Theagenes</hi> had trod there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was found Chaste, which was with wonder beheld, he being of such Youth and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; wherefore he was set apart, to be offer'd to the Sun. Then, said he to <hi>Chariclea</hi> aside, is Death the Reward of Chastity in <hi>AEthiopia?</hi> But wherefore do you not now discover your self? What other time do you expect? or will you stay till the Knife has pierc'd our Throats? Therefore declare your self: When you are known, 'tis possible I may be saved for your sake; at least you will be safe your self, which will be my satisfaction in Death.</p>
            <p>She told him her Time was now at hand; and so, without command, put on her holy Vestment, which she brought with her from <hi>Delphi,</hi> wrought with Gold, and set with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; then with her hair dishevell'd, and, as it were, inspired with Divine fury, she leap'd upon the Coals, where she stood a long time without hurt, the Fire only giving addition to her Beauty; so that in that Holy Attire, she seems to the Beholders rather a Goddess than Mortal Woman: So that the most Superstitious amongst them heartily wished her Deliverance.

What is there to be done for her Relief? You trouble me in vain, said <hi>Hydaspes</hi>; your pity is foolish on one that cannot be saved; and seems from the Beginning, for her Excellence, to be reserv'd for the Gods. Then turning to the Gymnosophists, he asked them, Why they did not begin? The Gods forbid, (answer'd <hi>Sysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathres,</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> that the people might not understand him) for we have too much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd our Eyes and Ears with what is already done. As for our parts, we will retire into the Temple, being of opinion that these humane Sacrifices are abomination to the Gods; we could also wish no Blood of any other Creature to be shed on such account, as knowing that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and bloodless Offerings are most grateful to the Divine Powers. However, your presence, Sir, is necessary, since the customes of the Country exact it, and your people will not otherwise be satisfy'd.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58429:189"/>
But who was the Person that found her, took her up, and bred her, I am yet to seek; or who it was that carry'd her into <hi>AEgypt.</hi> How may I be assur'd that this is She? And whether the Infant that was expos'd be not Dead, while he that found her, took advantage of his good Fortune; to impose on our desire of having a Child, by proposing a Changeling instead; and Colouring the Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that this Examination would more properly be made at Home; and not in so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick an Audience. Then was <hi>Hydaspes</hi> more anxious than before: Then said <hi>Chariclea,</hi> these Signals were my Mothers, but this, Sir, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly your own; giving him the Ring with the

I know these tokens, said he to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi>; but not that you came by them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Daughter; for not to insist on other Doubts, your Colour is strange and never seen in <hi>AEthiopia.</hi> The Infant was also white which I carry'd away (said <hi>Sysimathres</hi>) besides the time of her Age agrees, it being now Seventeen Years since she was expos'd. Beside I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the same Lustre of her Eyes, the same Fair Lineaments, Complexion, and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd Beauty. You speak well, said <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> and rather like a Patron, than Judge of her Cause; but take heed, least in favouring her, you bring question of Scandal upon my Wife: It being impossible, that we being both <hi>AEthiops,</hi> should have a Fair Child. We call him the best Judge answer'd <hi>Sysimathres,</hi> who is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Equity: But how do we seem more, to Patronize the Maid than you? For your Censure we are not concern'd, whose business is more to approve our selves to the Gods than to Men: So that is enough for us to satisfy our own Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to your Doubt concerning her Colour, the <hi>Fascia</hi> it self answers it: That <hi>Persina</hi> conceiv'd a Daughter of this Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; by looking on the Picture of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> in your Bedchamber: If you doubt the likeness, the Picture is here at hand, compare them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you will see no difference between the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Painted Virgin.</p>

The same Parental Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction seiz'd <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> though with more manly Government, yet he also embraced her, and not without Tears. After this, waving his Hand, he silenced the buzzing amongst the Croud. O you that are present, said he, you have seen and heard me this day prov'd a Father beyond all expectation.

            <p>
               <hi>Chariclea</hi> could scarce forbear crying out at the mention hereof, but governing her Affection, once more attempted him in these words:</p>
            <p>O Sir, there is no need to seek for another of my Sex, since the people have excused me: But if you must, there must also another Youth be found, or if that be not done, no other Maid, for I my self must also die: For the Gods have determin'd me to Live and Die with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> not yet understanding her, said, I commend this Humanity in you Daughter, towards a <hi>Grecian</hi> and Stranger, the Companion of your Exile; but it is impossible to exempt him from Sacrifice without Violation of our Religion, neither will the people dispense therewith. O King, answer'd she, if I may not call you Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the Mercy of the Gods has spared my Body, the same Clemency will spare my Soul: But if the Destinies must have it so, that this Youth must needs adorn the Ceremonies, grant me yet one Request, that he may be kill'd by my Hand.</p>

As soon therefore as <hi>Merabus</hi> came near his Presence, a Manly Youth and tall of Stature surpassing all about him, the <hi>AEthiopian</hi> Guards with respect, made way for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> came down from his Throne to meet him, embracing him with paternal Courtesie, and saying; you come in good time, my Son, to assist our Triumphant Rites, and also your

own Nuptial Ceremonies: Since the Gods, who were Authors of our Love, have, beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, produced a Daughter for us, and for you a Bride. Of this affair more at leisure; at present, if you have any thing to mention on behalf of your Country, declare it. <hi>Meraebus</hi> at mention of a Wife, blushed so as to have it perceiv'd through the duskiness of his Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion. After a little pause, Other persons, said he, will present you with the best Rareties of their Country to adorn your Triumph, but I, with what I judg'd most suitable to your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Temper, for a Present offer you a Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, inur'd to Blood, and exercised in Arms, so that none dare oppose him; in Wrestling, Whirl-bat, or any other Warlike Exercise, of such Skill and Strength, that none are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him. Accordingly he beckon'd to have him brought in presence.</p>
            <p>He therefore came forward, and was of that stature, that when he stooped to salute <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daspes</hi> Knees, he still seem'd tall as any of the rest. Immediately, without waiting for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he stripped himself before all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, challenging any person to single Combat. When none appear'd, though the King often summon'd, by the Herald; You shall receive, said <hi>Hydaspes</hi> to him, a Present fit for your Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Bulk; withal commanding an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, of vast Magnitude, to be brought forth for him: He willingly receiv'd it. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58429:193"/>
when the Beast appear'd, laughed extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the pleasant Humour of the King. With this Derision taking Revenge on him whom they did not dare to encounter. After <hi>Merae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> were admitted the Embassadours from the <hi>Seri,</hi> bringing two Vestments, made by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects of their Country, the one of <hi>Tyrian</hi> Dye, the other Snowy White. Having tender'd their presents, they were rewarded by the King, with Release of certain Prisoners in his custody.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Legates came next, with Spices and Perfumes, the product of their Country, in such quantities, that they perfum'd all the Air around. After them, the <hi>Trogloditae,</hi> with Gold, and Griffins with Golden Bridles. Then the <hi>Blemmi,</hi> with Arrows made of Dragons Bones, and made up in circular form: And these, O King, said they, we present you with less costly than others Offerings, but of Service to you against the <hi>Persians</hi> on the Rivers Bank. They are more esteem'd by us, said <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> than so many Talents of Gold, withal inviting them to make what Demands they pleased. When they requested abatement of Tribute, he released it to them for ten years successively.</p>
            <p>When these had thus made their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (most of them being r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58429:193"/>
an Animal of strange Form and Nature, of the size of a Camel, but of spotted Skin, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Scales. His hinder parts and Belly like a Lion, his fore Legs and Shoulders exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Members; a long Neck, and waxing very slender, from so large a Body: His Head resembling a Camel, in bigness twice exceeding the <hi>Lybian</hi> Ostrich, horribly rowling his Eyes, that seem'd as if enflam'd with Red Lead. His Gate was still more strange, being like no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals, but moving the two Legs on his Right Side together, and then those on his Left, carrying forward first the one Side of his Body and then the other. Of temper so tame and gentle b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When this Creature appear'd, the multitude were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd, and gave him from his Various Shape, the name of <hi>Camelopardalis.</hi> He was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a great Disorder which thus happen'd.</p>
            <p>There were a Yoak of Bulls placed before the Altar of the Moon, four White Horses at the Altar of the Sun, ready for the Sacrifice. The Horses spying this strange Monster, were so terrify'd that two of them broke out of their hands that held them, as also one of the Bulls, and ran out wild. They could not however break through the press, the Souldiers joining in a Ring, and with their Shields obstructing their passage. They were at once the occasion of great Laughter and Terrour; the persons at
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58429:194"/>
distance shouting to see others born down, and trodden by them: All things were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd that stood in their way. The Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was so great, that <hi>Persina</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> open'd the Curtain to look out. At this time <hi>Theagenes,</hi> whether out of his Natural Vigour, or Inspiration from the Gods, seeing his Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers dispers'd with the fright, started up from the Altar where he kneel'd, and snatching from thence a cleft stick, leap'd on the Back of one of the Horses that were left, and using his Main for a Bridle, forc'd him on, and turn'd the Bull that had broke loose. The Spectators at first thought that he intended to make his escape, and set up a cry that they should not suffer him to pass. But they soon perceived he had no such intention: For pursuing the Bull, and catching hold of his Tail, he drove him before him, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously avoiding his short Turns. With this management he so brake his Mettle, that he now suffer'd him to ride side by side to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the Sweat of each Beast mingled with the other.</p>
            <p>They ran with their Heads so even together, that the people, at distance, took the Horse and Bull for one Creature, and applauded <hi>Theag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus were all the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude employ'd. <hi>Chariclea</hi> in the mean time look'd on with horrour, not knowing what he intended and fear'd more for his danger than for her own Life when lately at Stake. <hi>Persina</hi> perceiv'd her
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58429:194"/>
concern, and said to her, You are troubled, Daughter, for this Stranger; I confess I cannot my self help pitying his Youth, but yet I hope he will escape this hazard, and be preserv'd safe for the Sacrifice. How absurd is it (answer'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea</hi>) to wish him to escape Death, that he may Dye! But, Oh Mother, if you can save his Life, you will do a thing most grateful to me! <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina</hi> partly suspecting her passion, said, Though it be impossible for me to preserve him, yet take Courage to acquaint me with your concern with this Stranger; if it has not been altogether ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, yet a Mothers kindness knows how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the frailty of a Child. <hi>Chariclea</hi> then wept bitterly, and cry'd out, 'Tis the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of my Misfortune to speak to understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons, yet not be understood; but must be forced to an open and gross Confession.</p>
            <p>As she was now going to reveal the whole matter, she was once more hindred by a new shout amongst the people. <hi>Theagenes</hi> having now fronted the Bull, quitted his Horse, leaped on the Bulls Neck, and clasping his Arms round the roots of his Horns, his Hands fasten'd in his Fore-head Tassock, his Face lying between the Horns, the rest of his Body hanging with all its weight, down over the Beasts right Shoulder, insomuch that he was often trod upon; yet he so incumbred his passage by this means, and tired him, that directly over against the place where <hi>Hydaspes</hi> sate, he tumbled down on his Head, but so
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58429:195"/>
that his Hoofs were turn'd uppermost, and his Horns struck into the Sand, so that his Head seem'd fast rooted to the Earth; his Legs all the while sprawling in the Air. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, sounding his Conquest: The people answer'd with shouts, and promiscuously gabbling, extoll'd him to the Skies. The Kings Servants, therefore, as they were order'd, some led <hi>Theagen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When they had long pressed for it, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daspes</hi> at last consented.

With these words he put himself in posture: fixing his Feet firmly to the ground, his whole Body put in the best order: Thus he impatiently waited the assault of his Adversary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>AEthiop</hi> seeing this, with a look of Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Indignation mixt together, ran furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously upon him, hitting <hi>Theagenes</hi> on the Neck with his Elbow, as heavily as if he had struck him with a Leaver; then drawing back, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out aloud at his own performance.</p>

               <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who was vers'd from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in Exercises, knew that such robustuous Strength, was not directly to be engag'd, but deluded by Art, expos'd the other side of his Neck for a second blow, which the <hi>Barbarian</hi> repeated,

The people now Shou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted louder than before; nor could <hi>Hydaspes</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger contain himself, but leaping down from his Throne, cry'd; O hard necessity of Law, what a Noble Youth are we compell'd to destroy. Then calling him to him, said, it only now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that thou be Crown'd for the Sacrifice. This Famous though unserviceable Victory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a Crown: That I should set you free is not in my Power, but as much as I can do in favour of you, I will; so that if you have any request to make to me before you Die, propose it. With these words, he put a Golden wreath on his Head, beset with Diamonds. Grant me therefore, said <hi>Theagenes,</hi> what I shall request, since you have promis'd it.

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Hydaspes</hi> had read this, he ask'd which was the Person amongst the Legates, who was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58429:197"/>
mention'd in the Letters, who is in search of his Daughter: When they shew'd him the Old man, O Stranger, said <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> I will do all that <hi>Oroondates</hi> has desired: Ten Virgin Captives only we brought away, and whereas one of them is known not to be her, do you survey the other Nine; and if you find her, take her. The Old Man fell down to embrace his feet, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Virgins, as they were brought before him, found not her amongst them; therefore he sorrowfully said, None of these, O King, is she. I was ready to gratify you, said <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> you must blame your fortune if you cannot find her; for you are free to satisfie your self that none other came with our Camp.</p>
            <p>When the Old Man had bent his brows, and wept a while, he lifted up his Eyes, surveying the Company around, and of a sudden ran forth as if he had been mad. When he was come up to the Altar, taking off his Cloak, and twisting it like a Rope, he cast it about <hi>Theagenes</hi> his Neck, and cry'd out in all their hearing, I have found thee, O my Enemy, I have gotten thee, thou mischievous and accursed Man! The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would have taken him off, but he would not quit his hold, till he had leave to bring him before <hi>Hydaspes</hi> and the Council; to whom he addrest himself in this manner, O King, said he, this Man is the Robber that has taken away my Daughter even from the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and now, like a pious person, he kneels before

               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> commanding him to speak more plainly, <hi>Charicles</hi> (for he was the Old Man) conceal'd the Truth concerning <hi>Chariclea,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lest if she were dead by the way, he should be troubled by her true Parent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No man could longer contain himself: <hi>Sysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathres</hi> kept silence along time, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knew the whole Mystery, till it were bolted out by little and little: Then coming forth, he Embraced <hi>Charicles,</hi> and said, your Adoptive Daughter, whom I once deliver'd to you, is well, found, and prov'd to be Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King, which you your self, also well know. <hi>Chariclea</hi> also ran forth from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, like one distracted, without regard to her quality, or years, and falling at <hi>Charicles</hi> his Feet, said, O Father, no less dear to me, than my natural Parent, take what revenge you please upon me, notwithstanding, all the excuse that I have of the Gods, Commands for what I did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Persina</hi> also turning to <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> said, assure your self, Sir, that it is so, This young <hi>Grecian</hi> is your Daughters Husband. The people were overjoy'd at the Discovery, though they imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, understood it, or rather were Divinely

inspired, with the knowledge thereof. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries were reconcil'd to attend this Wonder; Sorrow being joyn'd with Mirth, and Tears with Smiles: The cruel Slaughter, which was every moment expected, turn'd into a Holy and Bloodless Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>O Wisest of Men, said <hi>Hydaspes</hi> to <hi>Sysimathres,</hi> instruct us what we are to do? to decline the Sacrifice of the Gods, is Sacrilege, and to Kill the Innocent, and such as they favour, Impious.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Sysimathres</hi> (not in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as before) but in <hi>AEthiopian,</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of all, thus exprest himself. O King, said he, Darkness is sometimes thrown over the most descerning Understandings, to produce the greater joy. You ought long since, to have been sensible, That the Gods would not permit this Sacrifice, resolving to make your Daughter <hi>Chariclea,</hi> happy in all her desires; accordingly they have hither brought her Foster-father, from the midst of <hi>Greece</hi>: They have likewise sent Frights and Disorder to disturb the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as signifying, that more agreeable O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings should be made: They have lastly shewn you, a Bridegroom for your Daughter; this <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth, whom they have with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles deliver'd. Wherefore let us obey their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and no more offend them with humane Victims, whose best Sacrifices, are Prayers and Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sysimathres</hi> having said this with an audible

voice, <hi>Hydaspes</hi> took <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Charicle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> by the Hand, saying, you who are present, and see that these things are come to pass, by the direction of the Divine Powers, whose will it is impossible to resist, since you also seem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Choice, bear Witness to the Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which I here ratifie; which we will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm by Holy Rites, and so let us fall to Worshiping our Gods. The whole Army, with redoubled Shouts and Clapping their Hands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest their consent to the match.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> then approach'd the Altars, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to begin the Solemnities, said, O Sun our Lord, and Moon our Patroness: Since <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> are by your good Will, declared Husband and Wife, I doubt not, but you will accept their O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ferings, and suffer them to do Sacrifice in our Steads. Having thus said, he took the Mitres, the Ensigns of Priesthood, from his own and <hi>Persina</hi>'s Head, placing them on <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea.</hi> When this was done, <hi>Charicles</hi> call'd to mind, the Oracle deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to him at <hi>Delphi,</hi> was now compleated, which foretold concerning this Young Pair, that they should arrive at a Soil parch'd with Heat;

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus Crown'd with Mitres, and vested with Priesthood by <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> the Ceremonies
