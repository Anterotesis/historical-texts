         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they muſt needs (upon the ſuppoſition) bring forth a party-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Reformation, as <hi>Labans</hi> ſheep brought forth ſpeckled and
ſpotted lambs, by looking upon the pilled rods which <hi>Jacob</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
them with, at the time of their conception<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 30. 38, 39.</note>.</p>
            <p>But what if we be bound by covenant and oath, to reform, as
well according to the examples of the beſt reformed Churches,
as according to the Word of God? I anſwer:</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe, no man ever covenanted, or ſware, to reform accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the example of any Church, or churches whatſoever, in
oppoſition to the Word of God:<note place="margin">To violate an abominable and accurſed oath, out of conſcience unto God, is an holy and bleſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> or if they did either, they have
cauſe to abhor themſeves in duſt and aſhes for it. And to reform
with them, or according to their example, in concurrence with
the Word of God, is nothing but what every man ſtood bound in
conſcience unto, whether he had covenanted or ſworn it, or no.
So that covenanting or ſwearing to reforme <hi>according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the beſt reformed Churches,</hi> as well as <hi>according to the
Word of God,</hi> doth no wayes bind any man to regard or minde
their reformation for matter of example or imitation further then
this comports with the Word of God; and thus farre, they who
reform <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> muſt neceſſarily follow
their example, at leaſt materially, and ſo cannot falſifie in the leaſt
with their covenant and oath.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the ſons of ſuch a Reformation as hath been oft na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
muſt beware of ſeparating between mens ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113430:4"/>
conveniences, when God by his providence hath graciouſly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them together. <hi>What therefore God hath joyned together, let no man put
aſunder,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Mar. 19. 5.</note> (ſaith our Saviour.) The rule or precept is generall, (though
given upon a ſpeciall occaſion) and ought to take place (eſpecially)
in all things which concern the comfort and peace of men. If ſo, how can
that Reformation be according to the Word of God, which ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
force men from their dwellings, the conveniencie whereof affords
them, and theirs, the beſt of their ſubſiſtence in the world; or elſe from
their relation unto ſuch a Miniſter or Paſtor, by whom God is pleaſed
to bleſſe them in their ſpirituall eſtate, incomparably beyond what they
have any ground to expect from that Paſtor they muſt in ſuch a caſe
ſubject themſelves unto? Yea, or which ſhall interdict the precious
ſouls of men their ſpirituall accommodation from the hand of ſuch
Paſtors, who want the eyes, and tongues, and hands of other men, and ſo
can neither ſee, nor ſay, nor do many things, which they can; and yet
may be eminently ſerviceable in the work of Jeſus Chriſt, and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
gifted for the edification of ſuch and ſuch men? A Reformation
<hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> muſt not ſacrifice the comforts of the people
of God, upon the ſervice of the credits or advantages of their Miniſters.
The people were not made for Miniſters, but Miniſters for the people.</p>

and be carefull to do both the one and the other, both to gather and to

abſolve the leſſe, and condemne the more innocent. <hi>I charge thee before

               <note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 2. 1.</note>. Therefore that Reformation w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
juſtifieth thoſe, who <hi>profeſſe they know God, but deny him</hi> (and that moſt

their doubts &amp; ſcruples in things appertaining to the knowledge

word of God.</hi> For doubtleſs, he that ſaith he beleeves that there are three
perſons and one God, and yet gives demonſtrative teſtimonies (or be it
but ſtrong preſumptions) againſt himſelfe, that he indeed and in truth
neither beleeves the one nor the other, is a far greater offender, and
conſequently deſerves a far greater puniſhment then hee who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

ſhall puniſh men, and that with greater ſeverity, not for not beleeving,
but for not profeſſing to beleeve, or for profeſſing not to beleeve that
which indeed they do not beleeve, and ſhall connive at, or paſſe over
