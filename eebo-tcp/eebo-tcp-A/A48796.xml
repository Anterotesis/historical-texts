            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> was not ſo great in his Fortune, as he was mean in his Original: his honeſt and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parents helped him to a good Conſtitution, and a great Spirit, (two hopeful ſteps to Greatneſſe;) and his Ambition gave the opportunity to encreaſe it: he was as pregnant at <hi>Ipſwich-</hi>School, as he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29485:10"/>
was promiſing in <hi>Canterbury-</hi>Colledge; where his Induſtry &amp; parts advanced him to a command over Noble-men in the Earl of <hi>Dorſet's</hi> Family, as a School-maſter; as his Policy had promoted him to an Imperiouſneſſe over Kings in the quality of States-man. <hi>The firſt ſtep to Greatneſſe in a Scholar, is Relation to a Nobleman:</hi> The beſt Education for the Court, is in the Palace: Nature made him <hi>capable,</hi> the School and Univerſity made him a <hi>Scholar;</hi> but his Noble Employment made him a <hi>Man:</hi> At <hi>Oxford</hi> he read Books, at my Lord's he read Men, and obſerved Things: His Patrons two Parſonages beſtowed upon him, was not ſo great a Favour as the excellent Principles inſtilled into him; he being not more careful to inſtruct the young Men, then their Father was to tutor him: his Bounty makes him rich, and his Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation potent: His Intereſt went far, his Money farther. Biſhop <hi>Fox</hi> was Secretary to K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and he to Biſhop <hi>Fox;</hi> the One was not a greater Favourite of the King's, then the other was his; as one that brought him a Head ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious of all Obſervations, and a Spirit above all Difficulties: Others managed the Affairs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Wolſey</hi> underſtood its Intereſt: His Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence was good abroad; his Obſervations cloſe, deep, and continued at home: He impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what he knew, and bought what he knew not He could make any thing he read or heard his own and could improve any thing that was his own to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was he <hi>in</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> but the Biſhop was <hi>out</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> to whom he muſt have ſtooped, as he did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29485:10"/>
unto Nature and Age, had not he raiſed his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant equal to himſelf in the Kings Favour, and above <hi>Howard:</hi> He was forbid by the Canon, Heirs of his Body; he was enjoyned by his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make an Heir of his Favour, equally to ſupport and comfort his old Age, and maintain his Intereſt. Children in point of Policy, as in point of Nature, are a Bleſſing, and as Arrows in the hand of a mighty man; and happy is that old Courtier that hath his Quiver full of them, <hi>he ſhall not be aſhamed when he ſpeaks with his enemies in the gate.</hi> The old man commends <hi>Wolſey</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh for one fit to ſerve a King, and command Others: Forreign Employment is the Stateſmans firſt School; to <hi>France</hi> therefore he is ſent, to poiſe his Engliſh Gravity with French Debonairneſs: A well-poiſed Quickneſs is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper. From Forreign Employment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Old King, he is called home to ſome Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Services under the Young One: He as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found the length of <hi>His</hi> Foot, as he fitted him with an eaſie Shoo; the King followed his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the Cardinal enjoyeth <hi>His</hi> Power: The One purſued his Sports while <hi>Youth,</hi> the other his Buſineſs while <hi>Time</hi> ſerved him: <hi>(Give me to Day, and take thou to Morrow, is both the Courtier and the Chriſtian's Language:)</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite took in the Council-Table Debates and other State-affairs in the Maſs and whole Bulk of them by Day, and the King had the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them extracted, and the ſum of them repreſented to him at Night: All State-Buſineſs was diſpoſed of by him, and moſt Church-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments beſtowed upon him; the Biſhopricks of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29485:11"/>
                  <hi>Durham, Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>York</hi> were in his poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all other Promotions in his Gift: He was inſtalled in the Kingdom (during King <hi>Henry</hi>'s youthfulneſs) and had the Church in <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> His great Services indeed could not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged without a great Revenue, nor his greater Power ſupported, but by an able Purſe, which may buy off Expedients as readily as his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may command them.</p>
               <p>Two Corrivals he had, <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham, Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk: Brandon</hi> he deſpiſed, as rather beſides, ſaith my Author, then againſt him; he being the Kings Companion in Pleaſure, and <hi>Wolſey</hi> his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in Policy; the Duke great with young <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Biſhop with the King: <hi>Buckingham</hi> he feared, as popular; and undermined, as proud: (that Tower muſt fall, whoſe Foundation is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) <hi>Buckingham</hi> was high in Birth, Honour and Eſtate; <hi>Wolſey</hi> higher in Prudence, whoſe Malice did the brave Duke much miſchief, and his own Folly more: (Vain-glory (writes <note n="a" place="margin">Tho. Ful. <hi>Holy State.</hi> p. 251.</note> my Friend) ever lieth at an open guard, and gives much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of play to her Enemies:) A deboyſt King is jealous, and a weak Nobleman ambitious. In fine, he is attainted of High Treaſon, (though ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corrival to the King in his Cloaths then his Crown, in his Vanities then his Authority:) but a cunning Upſtart quickly blows off a young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemans Cap and Feather, and his Head too, when it ſtands in his way.</p>
               <p>His power againſt <hi>Buckingham</hi> was his Shield againſt all others: One Defence well managed, one Adverſary throughly ſuppreſſed, is a Security
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29485:11"/>
at Court, where two men ſeldom fall the ſame way.</p>
               <p>Many envied the Archbiſhop, the Cardinal, the Legate <hi>de latere,</hi> the Lord Chancellour; but all <hi>feared</hi> the Favourite: moſt were diſcontented, but none durſt ſhake their Heads, leſt they fell off with <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s: the Biſhops diſpleaſure was more fatal then the Kings, whoſe wrath was <hi>violent,</hi> but not <hi>laſting;</hi> as the Others anger was of leſs fury, but more malice: his Power was great, and his Juſtice equal; for he was too proud to be bribed, and too powerful to be over-born. But <hi>England</hi> was too narrow a Theatre for this great Spirit, and he aſpires to <hi>Rome;</hi> and having been theſe many years Pope of this other world, would have been of that beyond the waters: his leap was great from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and his riſe as good: <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was his Client, and his Maſters Servant; the Cardinals were his Penfio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and when they failed (as he is no Fox whoſe Den hath but one hole, and he no Stateſman who when one way is ſtopped, cuts not out another) he falls off from the German Emperour to the French King; where, if he could not carry his own Deſign, he would hinder the Emperours; (and Revenge is an Advancement) (ſo great was he, that his Friendſhip balanced <hi>Europe,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed Emperours, threatned Kings, and was fatal to Queens) if he cannot be Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> he will ſhew he is as good as King of <hi>England;</hi> for finding that the King wanted a meet Yoak-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for his Bed, and a lawful Heir-Male to his Crown, and obſerving Queen <hi>Katharines</hi> Age a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her Husbands, and her Gravity above her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29485:12"/>
Age, being more Pious then Pleaſant, a better Woman then Wife, and a better Wife for any Prince then King <hi>Henry;</hi> he promotes a Divorce (upon ſome Scruples intimated by the Spaniard ſome years before in a Treaty about the Princeſſe <hi>Mary</hi>'s Marriage, which others had forgot, but the Cardinal laid up) between the King and Queen: but that was not all; but knowing that King <hi>Henry</hi> could not have a Wife to his minde, until he had a Pope of his own chuſing, he would help him to a young Wife, but he muſt raiſe him to a new power; <hi>Wolſey</hi> muſt be Pope, or King <hi>Henry</hi> could not be divorced: and to make all ſure, he was no ſooner to be parted from a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Spain,</hi> then he was to be joyned to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>France;</hi> whoſe Nuptial Ring ſhould wed King <hi>Henry</hi> to <hi>Her,</hi> and King <hi>Francis</hi> to <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miſſing of Power, he meditates Honour; and inſtead of laviſhing his infinite Treaſure upon airy Expectations, he beſtoweth it on real Monuments, which make his Memory as Renowned as his Life. That Stateſman lives to ſmall purpoſe, whoſe Actions are as ſhort as his Life, and his Exploits of no longer duration then his Age.</p>
               <p>At this time, though King <hi>Henry</hi> bore the Sword, yet Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> (as I am told) bore the ſtroke all over the Land, being Legate à la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere, by vertue whereof he viſited all Churches and Religious Houſes, even the <hi>Friers Obſervants</hi> themſelves, notwithſtanding their ſtoutneſſe and ſtubbornneſs, that firſt oppoſed him. Papal and Royal Power met in him, being the Chancellour of the Land, and keeping ſo many Biſhopricks in <hi>Commendam,</hi> that his yearly Income is ſaid to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29485:12"/>
equal, if not to exceed the Revenues of the Crown: He gave the firſt blow to Religious Houſes, by making one great Colledge of forty ſmall Monaſteries; to make way, as ſome thought, upon the Popes conſent, procured by him, to the overthrow of all.</p>
               <p>He called all Captains and Officers to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who bought off their own ſmall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his great one, and paid him the Penalties of their Cheats with the Gains of it; the Richeſt of them eſcaping, and the Pooreſt onely made exemplary. Several Courts of pretended Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he erected; to redreſs the poor, that was the Colour; to inrich himſelf, that was the Reality: at whoſe conſtitution the Law-Courts were unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, ſo ſpecious was their ſeeming Integrity; at the laſt they are deſerted, ſo manifeſt were their real Grievances; the people not flocking ſo faſt after the Novelty, as they ran away from the Cheat.</p>
               <p>What he did to reform the Courtiers, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, he did to reform the Clergy as Legate; erecting a Court Legantine (not without danger of a <hi>Praemunire)</hi> wherein all Clergy were viſited; the Rich in their Purſes, that excuſed them, the Poor in their Reputation, that compounded for them. Neither did his profits ariſe from the Living onely, but the Dead; he engroſſing the Probation of all Wills and Teſtaments within his own Court.</p>
               <p>And not long after, he hath a Patent under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to do what he pleaſed in the French Court, in order to the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe thither; as he hath likewiſe after, with his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29485:13"/>
Maſters leave, under the great ſeal of <hi>France:</hi> After which honour, he was with the Kings order, by the Engliſh Subjects, the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> honoured at no leſſe rate then that of a Prince; and by the Clergy (who kept cloſe to the publick temper) with Proceſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the ſame rate with a Pope. Great he was in <hi>England;</hi> greater in <hi>Germany,</hi> where all the Nobility atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> was carried before him; and the Emperour obſerving his Commiſſion and Honour, met him with his whole Train, and harangued it with him no leſs then two days. He that over-ruled Empires might well preſume on Subjects; and no ſooner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he return, then by his own Authority he levieth four ſhillings in the pound of every man that was worth fifty pound <hi>per annum;</hi> and when that would not do (pretending to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen that he had been upon his Knees to revoke thoſe Commiſſions) other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for a Benevolence, which loſt him as much in the Countrey, as his Reformation of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold did him at Court: But the King employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to <hi>France,</hi> as his Second, and takes his leave of him as his intimate Friend; 1200 Horſe attended him: <hi>Calice, Bullein, Amiens</hi> honour him with the name of <hi>The Peaceable Cardinal;</hi> and the Statue of a Cardinal <hi>Reſcuing a Church and a Pope from danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> going over to <hi>France</hi> upon an extraordinary Embaſſy, had for his Attendance <hi>Tonſtal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Lord <hi>Sands,</hi> late Chamberlain, the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. More,</hi> Sir <hi>H. Guilford,</hi> and 200 Horſe; and was met

two days journey from <hi>Paris</hi> by King <hi>Francis</hi> and his mother, carrying with him 140000 <hi>l.</hi> though ſilver was but 20 <hi>d.</hi> an ounce, to aſſiſt that King in the War againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; and furniſhed with ſuch a Plenipotentiary Commiſſion, that he gave Law to <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Popedome:</hi> and he comported himſelf with ſuch dexterity and high wiſdome, that all the Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who had their eyes fixed upon him, admired him.</p>
               <p>The King gave him many places, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him his magnificent Palaces; fitting his humour with pleaſant habitations, and he ſuited his ambition with power and authority.</p>
               <p>But the King broke with him at laſt about the divorce, being vexed with ſo many delays, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, retardings, and prorogations between two Popes, <hi>Clement</hi> that was, and <hi>Wolſey</hi> that would be: yet rather eaſed him of his burdens, then deprived him of his preferments; continuing him Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> (when he turned him out of his Chancellourſhip of <hi>England)</hi> where he lived rather like a <hi>Prince</hi> then a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> providing as magnificently for his <hi>Inſtallation,</hi> as a King ſhould for his <hi>Coronation:</hi> which unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ambition was improved by his enemies malice and the Kings jealouſie to his ruine: for in the midſt of his ſolemnities he is arreſted by the Kings order, whoſe wrath was the <hi>Meſſenger of Death;</hi> and in his way to <hi>London,</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted between hope and fear, died at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> giving his ſervants large rewards, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſerved none but the King; and breathing out his ſoul in words to this purpoſe, <hi>viz. If I had ſerved the God of heaven as faithfully as I did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29485:14"/>
my Maſter on earth, he had not forſaken me in my old age, as the other hath done,</hi> he died, ſwelling in his body as he had done in his mind. When good men die ſuddainly, it is ſaid they are poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; and when the bad fall unexpectedly, as he did, it is ſaid they poyſon themſelves. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unpitied, becauſe he had lived feared; being the great Bias of the Chriſtian world.</p>
               <p>Too ſuddain proſperity in the beginning, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeth us in the end: while we expect all things flowing upon us as at firſt, we remit our care, and periſh by neglecting. Every head cannot bear wine, nor every ſpirit a fortune: Succeſs eats up Circumſpection. How many a man had ended better, if he had not begun ſo well? It's the Emphaſis of miſery, to be too ſoon happy: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity growing up with experience, takes a man in a firm ſettlement, inured to all events. I will ever ſuſpect the ſmooth waters for deepneſs: in my worſt eſtate I will hope, in the beſt I will fear; in all, I will be circumſpect and ſtill. Rufiling Ambition reacheth great Honours, a Sedate Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility ſupports it: the Lower the Baſis, the higher and ſtronger the Pyramide. Love, the Iſſue of Humility, guardeth the weakeſt; Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the Daughter of Pride, ruines the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> was good Grammar for <hi>Wolſey</hi> a School-maſter, but not for the Cardina a States-man: to be humble to Superiours, is <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> to Equals, is <hi>courteſies</hi> to Inferiours, <hi>nobleneſs</hi> and to all, <hi>ſafety;</hi> it being a vertue that for a her lowlineſs commandeth thoſe ſouls it ſtoop to.

               <p>SIr <hi>William Brandon</hi> dying in King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh's ſervice, no wonder if his ſon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his favour; it being as prudent to continue his Loyal ſpirit in his ſon, as it was juſt to reward it. He was as intimate with <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth in his pleaſures when a <hi>childe,</hi> as in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels when a <hi>man.</hi> There was a ſympathy between their active ſpirits, which improved the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their tender years to a firm friendſhip in their age: at a Tilting in <hi>Paris,</hi> to which many young Noble-men were licenſed to go, <hi>Brandon</hi> overcame others every day, and one day himſelf, (againſt a Gyant <hi>Almain)</hi> where the Lords look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not on him with more envious, then the Ladies with gracious eyes; who (ſaith my Author) dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more glances in love, then the other did ſpears in anger againſt him. He is the compleat Courtier, in whom Beauty and Valour, <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> are joyned in one happy conſtitution, which awes and allures Beholders.</p>
               <p>Being employed to bring over Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth's Relict, to her Brother, he won her to himſelf: whether his affections were ſo ambitious as to climb up to her, or hers ſo humble as to condeſcend to him, may be the ſubject of a more amorous diſcourſe: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29485:15"/>
with himſelf that matters of this nature are never ſure till finiſhed, that ſo Royal an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity happened but ſeldome, and that leave for ſuch an enterprize was eaſier gained when it's done, then when doing; he humbly requeſted his Majeſty to give way to that Match, which was indeed already concluded: who after ſome State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcontent, was quickly pleaſed; the Duke being no leſs eſteemed by him for many years, then he was beloved by the people. His Genius was more Martial then Mercurial; and we hear of him oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the French Wars, then in the Engliſh Councils.</p>
               <p>Being vexed with the delays at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the deluſions at <hi>Bridewel,</hi> (where the Cardinals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to their inſtructions at <hi>Rome)</hi> one day he knocks on the Table in the preſence of the two Cardinals, and binds it with an Oath, That it was never well in <hi>England</hi> ſince Cardinals had any thing to do therein: and from that time forward, as an active Inſtrument, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the aboliſhing of the Popes power in <hi>England;</hi> againſt whom he was not more active in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 1534, then he was vigilant in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee 1535: in the one, cutting off the head; in the other, weakening the members of that Church. He made provident, yet moderate uſe of his Maſters favours; thereby obliging others, and ſecuring himſelf; being above Mercenary incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations as much in his thoughts, as in his fortune: he was neither too near the King, leſt he were weary of him; nor too far off, leſt he forgot him, or thought himſelf neglected by him. His intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of attendance gave others no advantage,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29485:15"/>
but rendred him more gracious: he neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed nor confined his Maſters affection. It was eaſie for him to riſe, being deſcended of Noble Blood, (which is never envied for its advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and as eaſie to keep high, being well ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in his Princes diſpoſition, whoſe inclination when found is half fitted; ever pleaſing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Natural</hi> humour, never his <hi>Vicious.</hi> Having attained a competent heighth, he choſe rather to grow ſtronger by relation, then higher by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements. <q>Some Favourites whoſe heels have been tripped up by their adverſaries, have with their hands held on their Allies till they could recover their feet again.</q> His familiarity, and the eaſie acceſs to him, made him popular: his pliant temper kept him a Favourite, until he died in the full favour of his Prince, though (as Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> obſerved) <hi>They who were higheſt in this Kings favour, had their heads neareſt danger.</hi> He had a becoming Bluntneſs not unlike his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which we call Free-heartedneſs in Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Conſcience and Chriſtian ſimplicity in Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-men; Valour in Souldiers.

               <p>
                  <hi>CRanmer</hi> had a Noble Blood, quickning and raiſing his ſpirit, as he had an indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable induſtry to improve it. He was a Gentleman born in <hi>Arſelecton</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and a Noble-man bred in <hi>Jeſus-</hi>Colledge in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi> His Anceſtors were no leſs eminent at <hi>Cranmers-hall</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> then he was at <hi>Lambeth</hi> in <hi>Surrey.</hi> They came in with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, (as one <hi>Cranmer</hi> a French Ambaſſadour in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time, at the Archbiſhops Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, made it evident) and he with the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Education was as Gentile as his Birth, onely his mild ſpirit meeting with a ſevere Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, his memory was weakened, and his ſprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs allayed: but the auſterity of the School was ſweetned with the exerciſes of the Country, which his Father indulged him when young, and he indulged himſelf when aged; handling his great Horſe as nimbly, his Bow and Net as dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly as any man in his family. His Marriage withdrew him from the Colledge, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Church-preferment, as the Kings did him from the Church it ſelf. He whoſe marriage forbid him a Fellowſhip in <hi>Jeſus-</hi>Colledge, had a Lecture in <hi>Buckingham-</hi>houſe for his Parts and Reputation, where at once he prepared others for publick Employments, and himſelf alſo. He lived as ſoberly at the <hi>Dolphine-</hi>tavern with his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29485:17"/>
wife, (whatever the Papiſts have ſurmized) as he did ſtudiouſly at <hi>Buckingham-</hi>houſe with his Scholars. His Name was ſo famous, that <hi>Wolſey</hi> was not more ſollicitous to tranſplant him as an Ornament to <hi>Oxford,</hi> then <hi>Fiſher</hi> was to retain him in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where he was eminent for the Arts, more for Divinity, which (when as one of the three Cenfors he examined <hi>Candidates)</hi> he ſaid he expected not in the difficult trifles of <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> but in the ſacred ſenſe of Scriptures, the ancient Doctrine of Fathers, the grave Canons of Councils, the ſolid Politeneſs of the Greek and Hebrew Learning; and which he lived as well as he taught, in his ſober temperance, his mild meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (ſo placable, ſo courteous, that to offend him, was the way to ingratiate with him) his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet moderation, his grave reſolution equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the frowns and ſmiles of fortune. Thus qualified, he was by a Providence commended to his Majeſty: for there being a Plague in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> as there was all over <hi>England,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> retired to <hi>Waltham</hi> with two of his Pupils, the ſons of one Mr. <hi>Creſſy:</hi> where upon the Kings Progreſs thither, he met with his Chaplain and Almoner Dr. <hi>Foxe,</hi> (afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)</hi> who lodging with him at Mr. <hi>Creſſy's,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed the Kings Divorce. <hi>Cranmer</hi> conceived that the ſpeedieſt courſe were to prove the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of the Match by Scripture; whence it would follow, that the Pope at firſt had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpenſe therewith; and that the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> would ſooner and truer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the caſe then the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This paſſage <hi>Foxe</hi> reports to the King, who well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed

               <p>The King having declared before all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was his beſt Servant, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth him in his beſt ſervice, the Reformation of Religion, wherein all others failed; but the King, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Brandon</hi> backed him ſo far, that he had the Bible and the neceſſary Offices of the Church tranſlated into Engliſh: He had both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities at his command: He brought the Lords Houſe and Convocation to his Lure; and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a Power, 1. To grant Diſpenſations in all things not repugnant to Gods Law, nor the Kings ſafety: 2. To determine Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, He as charitably as politickly adviſed the King to accept of Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s partial Subſcription, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Learning and Reputation.

He was ſo charitable, that he interceded with the King for his Enemies; ſo munificent, that he made the Church and his own Houſe a Refuge for Strangers; particularly for <hi>P. Fagius, P.

The King loved him for his Integrity, the People for his Moderation: He was <hi>called</hi> the Kings <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>was</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> His Piety reduced the Church, and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy the State: He ſpake little to others, he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much with himſelf: Three words of His could

do more then three hours diſcourſe of Others: He wouſd ſay, as <hi>Victorinus, There is a time to ſay nothing, there is a time to ſay ſomething, but there is never a time to ſay all things.</hi> That King who awed all Others, feared Him. A Second to the Eternal Power, is the Wiſe Man uncorrupt in his Life. He was the <hi>Executor</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Will</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Life-time, and the firſt of <hi>His,</hi> after his Death.</p>
               <p>As <hi>He</hi> ſpurred King <hi>Henry</hi> to a Reformation, ſo King <hi>Edward</hi> did <hi>Him;</hi> whoſe Prudence was not ſo forward as the Others Zeal, who looked at what was Lawful, as He did at what was Convenient. He maintained the Churches Power as reſolutely againſt Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi>'s Scruples, notwithſtanding potent Interceſſion; as he reformed its Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Popes Intereſt, notwithſtanding a general Oppoſition. He allowed not the leaſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in, not the leaſt contempt of the Church: He reſtored its primitive Doctrine and Diſcipline, leſt it ſhould be an <hi>impure Church;</hi> he upheld them, leſt it ſhould be <hi>none:</hi> He was one of fourteen that compiled the <hi>Common-Prayer:</hi> He was One of Two that ſet out the Homilies; and the onely man that publiſhed the <hi>Inſtitution of a Chriſtian man,</hi> and other good Books. With his Advice King <hi>Edward</hi> did much, and deſigned more: He was the chief Author of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the firſt Commiſſioner in them: He was Preſident of the Aſſembly at <hi>Windſor,</hi> (for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) and of the Council at <hi>London:</hi> His Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were ſtrict and ſevere; as much grounded on the Canon of Scripture, as on the Canons of the Church: He convinced more Papiſts with his

Reaſon and Moderation, then others by their Power: His Heart never failed him in his Life, and it was not burned at his Death. He <hi>did</hi> ſo much for the Proteſtant Religion in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Days, that he foreſaw he ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> for it in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s: He was unwilling to wrong Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> therefore he refuſed at firſt to ſign King <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Teſtament,</hi> but Duke <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>Will:</hi> He was willing to continue the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, therefore he ſigned it at laſt.

There went a bleſſing along with all his Servants, and happineſs with his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>His Apophthegms were grounded on experience and judgement. He would ſay, 1. <hi>He was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways merry that laughed. 2. The world is undone by looking on things at diſtance. 3. To aim at Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour here, is to ſet up a Court of Arms over a Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. 4. If I would employ my Goods well, I may be contented to looſe them; if ill, I ſhould be glad. 5. He that is covetous when he is old, is as a Thief that ſteals when he is going to the Gallows. 6. Bags of Gold to us when Saints, will be but as a bag of pebble-ſtones when men. 7 The greateſt puniſhment in the world were to have our wiſhes. 8. Puſillanimity is a great temptation. 9. Affliction undoes many; Pleaſure moſt. 10. We go to Hell with more pain then we might go to Heaven with.</hi> Of Hereſie he ſaid, <hi>Like as before a great ſtorm the Sea ſwelleth, and hath unwonted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without any wind ſtirring; ſo may we ſee here many of our Engliſh-men, which a few years ago could not endure to hear the name of an Heretick or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, now to be contented both to ſuffer them, and to praiſe them ſomewhat, yea, to learn by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29485:22"/>
as much as they can be ſuffered, to finde fault, and to tax willingly the Church, the Clergy, and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. 11. The more of any thing elſe we have, but Riches, the more good we are. 12. Who would not ſend his Alms to heaven? who would not ſend his Eſtate whither he is to be baniſhed? 13. Some men hate</hi> Hypocriſie, <hi>and love</hi> Impudence. 14. When any detracted others at his Table, he ſaid, <hi>Let any man think as he pleaſeth, I like this room well. 15.

               <p>Indeed throughout his Works he argueth ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he reaſoneth profoundly, he urgeth aptly, ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth exactly, expreſſeth himſelf elegantly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth learnedly.

               <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> ſcrupled his firſt marriage, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> told him, <hi>That neither he nor my Lord of</hi> Durham <hi>were ſo fit to adviſe him in that caſe, as St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>St.</hi> Jerome, <hi>and the other Fathers.</hi> His advice was ſo unſeaſonable, that it oppoſed the King; yet ſo grave and honeſt, that it pleaſed him. His Experience and Prudence had a fore-ſight next door to Prophecy; and from the unquiet times of King <hi>Henry,</hi> did he gueſs the ruine of King <hi>Charles.</hi> He converted many with his Arguments, more with his Prayers, which workt wonders of reformation on the erroneous, as they did of recovery on the weak. He wiſhed three things to <hi>Chriſtendome:</hi> 1. An U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Peace: 2. An Uniform Religion: 3. A Reformation rather of Lives then Religion. He never asked any thing of his Majeſty but Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and never took any thing more acceptable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29485:23"/>
then Service. His Alms were liberal to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and good works numerous <note n="g" place="margin">He built a Chappel at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> and hired an Alms-houſe there.</note> towards God. He would take no Fees from the Poor, and but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ones from the Rich. All <hi>London</hi> was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him for his Counſel at home, and all <hi>England</hi> for his Peace at <hi>Cambray,</hi> where he out-did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>The King raiſed him to the Chancellourſhip, but not to his own opinion: he profeſſed he would ſerve his Majeſty, but he <hi>muſt</hi> obey his God: he would keep the Kings <hi>conſcience</hi> and his <hi>own.</hi> His Wiſdome and Parts advanced him, his Innocence and Integrity ruined him: his Wit pleaſed the King, but his Reſolution croſſed him. <hi>Wolſey</hi> was not ſo proud and reſerved, as Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was open and free to the meaneſt: his minde was not ſo daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with honour, but he could foreſee his fall. When his ſons complained how little they gained under him, <hi>I will do juſtice</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for your ſakes to any man, and I will leave you a bleſſing;</hi> decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day againſt his own ſon that would not hear reaſon. Firſt, he offered the Judges the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Grievances; and when they refuſed, he did it himſelf.—No <hi>Subpoena</hi> was granted but what he <note n="h" place="margin">With the cauſe atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the Attorney, in token whereof when one <hi>Tubbe</hi> brought him a <hi>Subpoena</hi> to ſubſcribe, finding it frivolous, he writ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it <hi>a tale of a tub.</hi>
                  </note> ſaw, no Order but what he peruſed; nothing paſſed from him towards the ſubject, but what became a good Magiſtrate; nothing towards his Maſter, but what became a faithful ſervant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King nor Queen could corrupt, neither could the whole Church in Convocation faſten any thing upon him. To one who told him of his Detractors, he ſaid, <hi>Would you have me puniſh thoſe by whom I reap more benefit then by all you my friends?</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Patience is the Companion of true Perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:29485:23"/>
But he managed not his truſt with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and dexterity, then he left it with honour; leaving not one cauſe undecided in the <hi>Chancery:</hi> foreſeeing that he could not at once content his Majeſty and his own heart. His Servants upon his fall he diſpoſed of as well as his children; and his Children he taught to live ſoberly in a great Eſtate, and nobly in a mean one. He never put an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick to death when Chancellour, neither would he ſuffer Hereſies to live when a private man. When my Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> came to him in his retirement, he adviſed him to tell the King what he ought, not what he can do; <hi>ſo ſhall you ſhew your ſelf a true and faithful ſervant, and a right worthy Councellour: for if a Lyon knew his own ſtrength, hard were it for any man to rule him.</hi> The King feared him when he could not gain him, and therefore he was ſifted in his former carriage and preſent temper, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued conſtant to his duty, and even under his chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. He was open-hearted to all that came, yet ſo wary in his diſcourſe with the Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> that his enemies confeſſed he deſerved rather honour then a check for that matter. When the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> told him, <hi>that the wrath of a Prince is death;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Nay, if that be all, you muſt die to morrow, and I today.</hi> He behaved himſelf at all Examinations at once wiſely and honeſtly. When Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> told him, <hi>he muſt obey the King which was certain, rather then follow his conſcience which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;</hi> he replyed, <hi>It's as certain that I muſt not obey the King in evil, as that I muſt follow my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in good.</hi> When the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> told him, <hi>his conſcience ſhould yeild to the wiſdome of the Kingdome,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>He would not conform his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29485:24"/>
to</hi> one Kingdome, <hi>but to the</hi> whole Church. He underwent his ſufferings with as much cheerfulneſs as his preferment; pleaſing himſelf with his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and enjoying his miſery; reſolving to obey God rather then man, to leave others to their own conſciences; to cloſe with the Catholick Church rather then the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to ſubmit to general Councils rather then to Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> put to him this Queſtion, <hi>Whether if the Parliament made a Law that he were Pope, would he not ſubmit to it?</hi> and he replyed, <hi>If the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made another that God ſhould not be God, would you obey it?</hi> Though he could not own the Kings Supremacy, yet he would not meddle with it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Writings or diſcourſe; ſhewing himſelf at once a civil man, a good Chriſtian, and a noble Confeſſour. His ſoul was well ſetled; his ſtature was mean, but well proportioned; his complexion phlegmatiqne; his countenance amiable and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; his voice plain and diſtinct; and his temper ſound and healthful.</p>

that being the firſt time his Eminent Parts were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: An advantagious ſtarting is more then half way in the Race of Preferment: For hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is firſt Maſter of the Kings Jewels, and then of what was more precious, his <hi>Secrets.</hi> His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inclined him to the Churches Reformation, his Intereſt complied with the Kings; he unlocked the ſecrets of Monaſteries by his Spies, and put the King upon deſtroying them by his Power: The Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> made him Chancellour, to ſave it ſelf; where though he did no great good, yet his Greatneſs kept others from doing harm, in an Age wherein Covetouſneſs could quarrel a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as well as an Abbey, into ſuperſtition. He was truſted by the King with the Rolls and Records of <hi>England;</hi> and by the Scholars, with the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Statutes of their Univerſities: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Univerſity, in order to the Reformation of the Church; enjoyning the ſtudy of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the Tongues, inſtead of School-Divinity and Barbariſm; recommending <hi>Ariſtotle, Agricola, Melancthon,</hi> to their reading; and the Doctrine which is in Spirit and in Truth to their Faith: and razing the Popes Bulls, to make way for the Kings Favour.</p>
               <p>He was an eminent Miniſter of State, and chief Governour of the Church; proceeding in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation very diſcreetly, modelling the Church-Laws very prudently and moderately: looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Monaſtical Abuſes very narrowly and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; mawling Religious Houſes, violently pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down thoſe Neſts, that the Rooks might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: His Maſter had diſobliged the Pope, and he weakeneth him: It was not ſafe to diſown his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29485:26"/>
and entertain thouſands of his Creatures. <hi>If a Kingdom be divided againſt it ſelf, it cannot ſtand;</hi> and if one part of the Engliſh pay their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to a ſupream Head at <hi>Rome,</hi> and another to a ſupream Governour in <hi>England,</hi> they muſt both fall. If the perſons might diſturb the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is fit their Eſtates ſhould ſecure it; and if the Papiſts ſhould foment a War, their Lands ſhould maintain it: But <hi>Cromwel</hi> contrives that the Pope ſhould confirm Alienations in <hi>Wolſey,</hi> before he ſhould practiſe it for the King. As the King knew whom he employed, when he truſted him: ſo he knew whom he truſted, when he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Doctor <hi>Lee</hi> (an able ſervant to an abler Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) <hi>He</hi> firſt decoyed Religious Men out of their Covents by the allurement of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them out by <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> As the Abbeys improved his Eſtate, ſo his Maſter advanced his Honour: he had one Privy Seal always to act by, and was Keeper of another: He had no ſooner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Earldom for himſelf, but foreſeeing the alteration of Affairs, he ſecured a Barony for his Son, not forfeitable by the Attainder of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Within five years he was Maſter of the Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, Secretary of State, Baron, Vicar-General, Maſter of the Rolls, Knight of the Garter, Keeper of the Privy-Seal, Lord High Chamberlain, and Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> within five months he quitted place, and in five minutes loſt all.

His Greatneſs was allayed with his Goodneſs; and the Envy of the One, mitigated by the Liberality of the Other: He had not more Suiters at his door then Alms, (two hundred at a time:) Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was a Name of Awe and Reverence to the Rich, and bleſſed by the Poor: That Name <note n="d" place="margin">Stow <hi>Sur.</hi> London.</note> levelled the proudeſt Citizens Houſe for his conveniency, and bowed the pooreſt mans Knee to his Honour. He could at pleaſure work upon the Lords by the Commons, and on the Commons by the Lords; as Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> perſwaded the Commons to four ſhillings in the pound upon the Lords preſident; and the Lords to as much upon the Commons: and he kept up the Cardinals way of Anticipation, that the people ſhould be always one Subſidy before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand: He ſet up the old Taxation of Knighthood at Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Coronation, and levied it.</p>
               <p>He confirms the Kings Supremacy by a Law, and eſtabliſheth his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Succeſſion by an Oath, firſt taken by the Parliament, and then by the Kingdom; for whoſe ſupport he contrives the leſſer Monaſteries ſhould be firſt eſcheated, and then the greater. He was ſo honeſt, that he acquits Queen <hi>Anne</hi> in his Letter to the Queen; yet ſo much a Stateſman, that he condemn'd her upon the Bench.</p>

But to ſecure the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved its Religion; that as ſome few late Acts had diſobliged the Pope, a new frame of Chriſtianity might exclude him: The differences between Us and <hi>Rome,</hi> were to be widened, leſt they ſhould <hi>cloſe;</hi> and he judged it prudence to engage the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the eſtate in one bottom, that he might hold the One out of the tenderneſs of the Other. The Kings Supremacy cut off the Papiſts, and the Six Articles the Proteſtants: Reformation muſt be managed leaſurely, and alteration of Religion by juſt degrees; Inſtruction preceding execution, and the peoples capacity growing up with their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Regulation.</p>
               <p>The times are troubleſome, but <hi>Cromwel</hi> calm and quiet, and watchful over Occurrences; Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection giving him an advantage of a new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Audley</hi>'s Birth was Generous, his Education more: <hi>Eſſex</hi> bred him to that Honour which his Anceſtors loſt: His Soul ennobled his Body, and his Body graced his Soul: The one quick, ſolid, apprehenſive and judicious; the other tall and majeſtick: <hi>King Henry loved a Man;</hi> and here was one whoſe Auſterity was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed with Debonairneſs, whoſe Gravity was ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with Pleaſantneſs; whoſe Knowledge was as large as his Authority, whoſe Wit was equal with his Wiſdom; whoſe Memory was ſtrong, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſolid. His fair Eſtate brought him to the Temple; his proficiency in the Law, to the Court: His <hi>reading</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Priviledges</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the Kings <hi>Service,</hi> his <hi>ſpeaking</hi> for the <hi>Prerogative</hi> in Parliament brought him to the Kings <hi>Favour.</hi> Although the Liberties of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can never be ſecured without the Prerogative of the Soveraign (who cannot do the good they would, if he wants a power to do the evil they fear;) yet his firſt Preferment was to withdraw him from Popularity, and the ſecond onely to confirm him to Soveraignty. <hi>Noble Service</hi> is the way to a <hi>Royal One:</hi> His Stewardſhip to the Dutchy of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> raiſed him to the Attorneyſhip of that of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter.</hi> But in troubleſome and deſigning times a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Orator is a good Courtier; and leading Parts in Parliament or Convocation are great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:

In the black Parliament he was a Member by his own Intereſt, and a Speaker by his Majeſties Choice: Sir <hi>Tho. More</hi> was to ſerve the Crown in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Audley</hi> was to ſucceed him in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons.</hi> When Abbey-Lands were beſtowed on the King in grofs, and returned by him to the leading Lords and Commons in the Retayl, moſt of that Parliament looked for ſhares; Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> for the firſt <hi>cut,</hi> to ſecure himſelf with the King: He was always in favour with the <hi>Queens,</hi> who had no leſs Intereſt in the Kings <hi>Heart,</hi> then the Kingdom had in his <hi>Head.</hi> The. Age was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, Intereſt nor ſo; Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was fixed on the One, above the alterations of the Other: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what was moſt <hi>convenient</hi> at a time when there was nothing <hi>lawful.</hi> He was well ſeen in the flexures and windings of Affairs, at the depth whereof other Heads not ſo ſteady turned giddy: He had the Arts of a Stateſman, and the cloſeneſs of a Politicion: Reſerved he was, but no Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler: <q>For if a man have that penetration of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he can diſcern what things are to be laid open, and what to be kept ſecret, and what to be ſhewed with half ſights, and to whom and when, (which indeed are Arts of States and Arts of Life) to him an Habit of Diſſimulation is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance and a poorneſs.</q> He (as an able man) was always frank and open, but wary; knowing how to ſtop and turn within the compaſs of Equity and Honeſty. He underſtood <hi>buſineſs</hi> well, and <hi>men</hi> better; and knew King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Temper bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Himſelf, whom he ſurprized always to his own bent, never moving any of his ſuits to him, but when in haſte, and moſt commonly amuſing him

with other matter until he paſſed his Requeſt. His Actions were managed for applauſe as well as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: for when made Sergeant, he was the firſt of eleven; his Entertaining-Day was the laſt of ſix: The King, who paid for his Dinner, was invited to it. He watched the Circumſtances of his Actions, that they might be Taking, as well as their Iſſue, that they might be Uſeful; and contrived that the leaſt of his publick Actions ſhould come off with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. He followed the moſt paſſable rather then the moſt able men living, in a time when active men were more uſeful then the vertuous. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> at once gratified the preſent Humour of the King, and the conſtant Temper of the People, in ſix Bills againſt the Clergy: 1. Againſt the Extortions of their Courts. 2. The Exaction of their Corps and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. 3. Their worldly Occupations, as Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, Tanning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4 Merchandize. 5. Their Non-Reſidencies. 6. The Pluralities of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the mean Salaries of the Learned. When in ſome Debates between the Lords and Commons, Cuſtome was urged; Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> replied, <hi>The uſage hath ever been for Thieves to rob at Shooters Hill, is it therefore lawful?</hi> He brought the Clergy within a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> to awe them; and afterwards in their pardon, he and other Members included their own; which the knowing King would not paſs, when it was demanded as of Right; yet afterwards granted it of his own accord, when it was received as of Grace. When Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> could not act with the times, Sir <hi>Thomas Audley</hi> could; the One being weary of the Seal, the other takes it; being made Lord Keeper in Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his life-time, and Lord Chancellour after his death: owning no Opinion

againſt the Government of <hi>England,</hi> nor any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt its Intereſt. The King might well truſt him with his Conſcience, when he truſted the King with <hi>his,</hi> owning no Doctrine but what was eſtabliſhed, ever judging the Church and State wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then himſelf. He was forced to <hi>take</hi> Q. <hi>Anne,</hi> but he would not <hi>condemn</hi> her; rather <hi>eſcaping</hi> then refuſing unwelcome Employments, wherein he muſt either diſpleaſe his Maſter or himſelf. He was <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but not <hi>wilful;</hi> waving ſuch ſervices <hi>dexterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> wherein he muſt oppoſe his Maſter <hi>dangerouſly.</hi> Thoſe Inſurrections which others Rigor had raiſed, his Moderation allayed; breaking the Factions with Indulgence, which might be ſtrengthened with Oppoſition: <hi>Cromwel</hi> pulled down Popery with his Power, <hi>Audley</hi> kept it down with his Policy, enjoyning the Preachers to detect the follies of that way, which is reckoned the wiſdom of this World, He had a moderate way to ſecure the Priviledges of Parliament, by freedom from Arreſts; and the good will of the Citizens, by an Order about debts.</p>
               <p>By theſe courſes he died as much in the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as he lived: Patience can weather out the moſt turbulent Age, and a ſolid Judgement the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate times: The reſerved and quiet man is the moſt ſecure.

               <p n="7">7. Not an inſipid changing of words was his gift, but a ſmart retort of matters, which every body was better pleaſed with than himſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He always told a ſtory well; and was as good at a neat continued diſcourſe, as at a quick ſentence; contriving it in an handſome method, cloathing

particulars of his life, raiſed him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An indefatigable induſtry, 1. In his reading, leaving behinde him 23 <hi>Folio</hi>'s of Notes. 2. In his practice, bequeathing 3502 Caſes he managed himſelf to his Executor.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. A rich and a well-contrived marriage, that at once brought him a large Eſtate, and a larger Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: the ſame tie that allied him to his Wives Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, engaged him to <hi>many.</hi>

He was Steward of 129 Mannors at once, and of Counſel to 16 Noble-men.</p>

               <p n="6">6. His care and integrity in managing, his Repute in promoting, his Reaſon and Eloquence in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his Succeſs in carrying his cauſes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His eminence and activity in the two profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parliaments of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, where he had
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29485:35"/>
the hearts and purſes of the people at his command, and the eye of his Soveraign upon his perſon.

It was judged the moſt ambition could be aimed at in King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh's time, to ſhew a mans parts before his judicious and diſcerning Majeſty; then whom none underſtood Worth better, none valued it higher.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His Oppoſition to <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi>'s too ſevere Proſecution of Poenal Laws, while <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was living; and his laying of it before him ſo faithfully, that he repented of it when he was a dying. <hi>He is high a while, that ſerves a Princes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt; he is always ſo, that is careful of his publick good.</hi>

None a worſe Enemy, none a better Friend. Choice he was in commencing, but conſtant in continuing Friends: <hi>Many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but few Friends,</hi> was his Obſervation; ſaying, <hi>He had been undone by his Acquaintance, had he not been raiſed by his Friends.</hi>

His care of time. <hi>To day I have not reigned,</hi> ſaid the Emperour when he had done no good: <hi>To day I have not lived,</hi> ſaid the Judge when he had done nothing. So much he prayed Morning, Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at Noon, according to the way of thoſe times, as if he never ſtudied; ſo much he ſtudied, as if he never practiſed; ſo great his practice, as if he never converſed; and ſo free his converſe with others, as if he lived not at all to himſelf: Time

(of which others are ſo prodigally expenſive) was the onely thing he could be honeſtly <hi>covetous</hi> of: full whereof he died, leaving this inſtruction to poſterity, <hi>That we ſhould not complain we have little time, but that we ſpend much either in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or in doing evil, or in doing nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>

eminent when he <hi>can.</hi> His friends devotion to the Church, and relation to the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> made him a Scholar; his own Inclination, a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: an Inclination that brake through all the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble reſtraints of pedantique ſtudies and coerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (wherewith many a great Soul in <hi>England,</hi> (enjoying not the freedome of forreign parts, but tied to ſuch employments, though never ſo unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as their friends put them to) are debaſed and loſt) to an eminencie (more by obſervation and travel, then by reading and ſtudy) that made him the Wonder of the Univerſity, and the Darling of the Court. When he was called to the Pulpit, or Chair, he came off not ill; ſo prudential were his parts for Divinity! when advanced to any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Truſt in the Univerſity, he came off very well; ſo incomparable were his parts for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p>His Policy was obſerved equally in the ſubject, and in the contrivance of his Sermons and diſcourſe; where though all knew he read but little, yet all ſaw that (by a Scheme and method his ſtrong head had drawn up of all Books and Diſcourſes) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all Learning: his <hi>Explications</hi> of the Text were ſo genuine, ſo exact, as if he had ſpent his time in nothing elſe but Criticks and Commentators. His Diviſions ſo Analytical, as if he had been nothing but Logick: His Enlargements ſo copious and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, as if he had ſeen nothing but Fathers and Schoolmen. The curious and pertinent mixture of Moral Sentences, ſo various, as if he had been but a Humaniſt: the drift and deſigne of all, ſo cloſe, that it argued him but (what indeed he was) a pure Pate-Politician. His Parts commended him to

Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> as his ſupport: the Cardinal brings him to his Maſter as his ſecond, and he thruſts out <hi>Wolſey</hi> as his Rival; but yet pretended to advance that ambitious Man more highly, that he might fall more irrecoverably. He ſets him upon his deſignes of being <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe make him none in <hi>England.</hi> He caught the Cardinal by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as he would have done Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> by his Interrogations; at which he was ſo good, that he would run up any man either to a Confeſſion or a <hi>Praemunire.

               <p>WE may ſay of him, he was born in <hi>Kent,</hi> and bred in <hi>Chriſtendome:</hi> for when twelve years of Age, he was ſent for his Grammar-Learning with his Tutor into <hi>France,</hi> for his Carriage into <hi>Italy,</hi> for his Philoſophy to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> for his Law to <hi>Grays-Inne;</hi> and for that which compleated all, the government of himſelf, to Court; where his Debonnairneſs and Freedome took with the King, as his Solidity and Wiſdome with the Cardinal. His Maſter-piece was his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency between King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> during the agitation of that great buſineſs of the Divorce between the ſaid King and his Queen <hi>Katherine.</hi> His Policy was ſeen in catching the Cardinal in that fatal word, <hi>The King may ruine me if be pleaſe!</hi> but that ruined him. His ſervice was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29485:37"/>
to be <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Inſtrument in demoliſhing Abbeys, as he was the Kings. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was the firſt that came to undo the Commonwealth, ſober; Sir <hi>Anthony St. Lieger</hi> was the firſt that ſaved this Kingdome drunk: for in being abroad one night very late, and much diſtempered, he muſt needs fancy an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary light in the Cardinal's Cloſet; with which Fancy he ran to the King, and although much in drink, prevailed with him ſo far, that he ſends to the Cardinal, and there findes that Juncto that threatned his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>He was the firſt <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> becauſe <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was the firſt King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> King <hi>Henry's</hi> affection would promote him any where, but his own reſolution and ſpirit commended him to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man whom all <hi>Ireland</hi> could not rule; therefore (as the Jeſt goes) he ſhould rule all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Three times had the Iriſh Rebels made their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remn ſubmiſſion to other Deputies: the fourth time now they make it to him, throwing down their Girdles, Skins and Caps. So great a man was the Lieutenant, ſo great his Maſter! No ſooner was be poſſeſſed of the Government, but he thought of Laws, thoſe Ligaments of it: The moſt rational and equitable Laws were thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> but too rational to be impoſed on the Brutiſh Iriſh: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Knight conſidering (as he ſaith in the Preface of his Conſtitution) that they (poor ſouls) <hi>could not reliſh thoſe exact Laws, to live or be ruled by them,</hi> immediately enacted ſuch as agreed with their capacity, rather then ſuch were dictated by his ability; his Wiſdome (as all mens muſt) doing what was moſt fit and convenient, rather then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29485:38"/>
what was moſt exact; what they could bear, more then what he could do: as remembring he had to do with <hi>Faeces Romuli,</hi> rather then <hi>Reſpublica Platonis;</hi> a rude, rather then a reduced people. What he could, he ordained according to the incomparable Rule of the Engliſh Laws; what he could not, he eſtabliſhed according to his preſent judgement of the Iriſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. He ſaw the Kingdome could never be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Maſters power, while the Church was obedient to the Popes: therefore as he perſwaded the Nobility to ſurrender their Eſtates to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty at <hi>London,</hi> ſo he compelled the Clergy to make over theirs at <hi>Dublin:</hi> There remains but little of the firſt in his Majeſties hands, ſo honourable was he in reſtoring it; and as little in his Succeſſors, ſo religious and juſt were they in reſigning it to the ſame uſe for ſubſtance to which it was at firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in vain it is to reform Laws, unleſs we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form perſons too: therefore as he ſent <hi>Orders</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Iriſh Nobility in their ſeveral Countries, ſo he ſent for themſelves (to the reſpective Houſes built for them by his Majeſty near <hi>Dublin)</hi> to be civilized in the Court. <hi>Caeſar came, ſaw,</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame;</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony came, ſaw,</hi> and <hi>ſetled:</hi> A man had thought there had not been ſo much corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Romiſh Church, as to admit Children to Church-Livings, (for which Men are hardly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient!) but that Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leiger</hi> was forced to make this Law, <hi>That no Children ſhould be admitted to Benefices.</hi> We had not known this ſin, had not the Law ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not inveſt any under ſixteen years of age in Benefices.</hi> The Clergy he found there too many, and the Nobility too few; he leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the number of the one to weaken the Pope,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29485:38"/>
and improved the other to ſtrengthen his Maſter, of whom they held not onely their Eſtates, but their Baronies too, as obliged to duty in point of Honour as well as in point of Intereſt. But in vain doth he civilize the preſent Generation, and neglect the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as therefore he provided Cities for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſo he erected Schools for the Children, that the one might forget their Barbariſm, and the other never know it. Three things he ſaid would ſettle a State: 1. Good God-fathers and God-mothers performing their Vows: 2. Good Houſholders o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking their Families: 3. And good School-maſters educating Youth; this laſt, the moſt uſeful, though the moſt contemptible profeſſion.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Athenian</hi> being asked what God was, ſaid, <hi>He was neither Bow-man, nor Horſe-man, nor Pike-man, nor Foot-man, but one that knew how to command [all theſe.]</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leiger</hi> was neither Souldier, nor Scholar, nor Stateſman, yet he underſtood the way how to diſpoſe of all theſe to his Countries ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and his Maſters honour; being all of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently, though none of them pedantickly and formally in himſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> (as <hi>Anaximander</hi> ſaid) had good Laws, but uſed them ill; our Deputy had bad Laws, but governed by good.</p>
               <p>It was thought by many wiſe men, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous rigour and unreaſonable ſeverity which ſome men carried there before him, was not the leaſt incentive that kindled and blew up into horrid flames the ſparks of diſcontent, which wanted not pre-diſpoſed fuel in that place; where deſpair being added to their former diſcontents, and the fears of utter extirpation to their wonted oppreſſions. It is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29485:39"/>
too eaſie to provoke a people too prone to break out to all exorbitant violence, both by ſome principles of their Religion, and their natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Liberty; both to exempt themſelves from their preſent reſtraints, and prevent after-rigours: wherefore he was inclined to that charitable conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence and <hi>Chriſtian indulgence</hi> which often diſſipates their ſtrength whom rougher oppoſition fortifieth, and puts the oppreſſed Parties into ſuch Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may moſt enable them to get a full revenge on thoſe they count their Perſecutors; who are commonly aſſiſted by that vulgar commiſeration which attends all that are ſaid to ſuffer for Religion or Liberty.</p>
               <p>To conclude this: Four things Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leiger</hi> was eminent for:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was none more grave in Counſe then he, in the morning: none more free at Table, at noon: none more active in the after-noon: none more merry at night.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That his Orders were made but ſlowly, ſo wary he was; but executed quickly, ſo reſolute he was too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he contrived all his Deſigns ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, that in the courſe of affairs they were done to his hand; and he was the Deputy that made no noiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That as the Souldier (finding his firſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Alexander</hi> to be difficult) danced about the Court in an Antique faſhion, until the ſtrangeneſs of the ſhew made the King himſelf Spectator, and then throwing off his diſguiſe, he ſaid, <hi>Sir, thus I firſt arrive at the notice of your Majeſty in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a fool, but can do you ſervice in the place of

He was one that had much knowledge, therefore much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in all, but eſpecially in the Intrigues of the Scots affairs: In the Battel of <hi>Muſcleborow</hi> he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered &amp; brought up our ſcattered Troops, inviting them to fight by his own Example; and for his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was made <note n="a" place="margin">There were two ſorts of theſe Knights, the firſt made by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by way of Reward: Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> was of the ſecond ſort, and the laſt that ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that ſort.</note> Knight-Banneret. Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> made him Chancellour of the Dutchy. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his laſt Embaſſie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his houſe at <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> was built by his Steward in his abſence, far greater then himſelf deſired, ſo that he never joyed therein; and died ſoon after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1587, in the 80 year of his Age.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> underſtood two things: 1. A Man: 2. A Diſh of Meat; and was ſeldom deceived in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For a Man, none more compleat then Sir <hi>Ralph,</hi> who was at once a moſt exquiſite Writer, and a moſt valiant and experienced Souldier; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29485:40"/>
that ſeldom meet, (ſo great is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Sword and the Pen, the Coat of Mail and the Gown) yet divided this man and his time; his nights being devoted to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his days to action. Little was his Body, but great his Soul; the more vigorous, the more contracted. Quick and clear were his thoughts, ſpeedy and reſolute his performances. It was he that could not endure the ſpending of that time in deſigning one action, which might perform two or that delay in performing two, that might have deſigned twenty. A great Eſtate he got honeſtly and ſpent nobly; knowing <hi>that Princes honour them moſt, that have moſt; and the People them onely that employ moſt:</hi> A Prince hath more reaſon to fear mony that is ſpent, than that which is hoorded becauſe it is eaſier for Subjects to oppoſe a Prince by Applauſe then by Armies. <hi>Reward</hi> (ſaid Sin <hi>Ralph</hi> when he was offered a ſum of money) <hi>ſhould not empty the Kings Coffers; neither ſhould Riches he the Pay of Worth, which are meerly the Wages of Labour:</hi> He that gives it, embaſeth a Man; he that takes it, vilifieth himſelf: who is ſo moſt Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is leaſt. Since Honour hath loſt the <hi>Value</hi> of a Reward, Men have loſt the <hi>Merit</hi> of Vertue, and both become mercenary; Men luſting rather after the Wealth that <hi>buyeth,</hi> then after the Qualities that <hi>deſerve</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Two things he obſerved broke Treaties; <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,</hi> when Princes are ſucceſsful; and <hi>Fear,</hi> when they are unfortunate.

               </p>
               <p>Three things <hi>Cato</hi> repented of: 1. <hi>That he went
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29485:40"/>
by water when he might go by land. 2. That he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Woman with a ſecret. 3. That he loſt Time.</hi> Two things Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> relented for: 1. <hi>That he had communicated a ſecret to two. 2. That he had loſt any hour of the morning, between four a clock and ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He learned in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, as <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Inſtrument, what he muſt adviſe (in point of Religion) in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Counſellour: His Maxime being this, <hi>That Zeal was the Duty of a private Breſt, and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Intereſt of a publick State.</hi> The Proteſtants Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>'s Conſcience would have in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> kept in hope; the Papiſts his Prudence would not have caſt into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.

               </p>
               <p>He ſaw the Intereſt of this State altered ſix times, and died an honeſt Man: The Crown put upon four Heads, yet he continued a Faithful Subject: Religion changed, as to the publick conſtitution of it, five times, yet he kept the Faith.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Spartan</hi> one day boaſted that his Countrey-men had been often buried in <hi>Athens;</hi> The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> replied, <hi>But we are moſt of us buried at home.</hi> So great was Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>'s ſucceſs in the Northern Wars, that many a <hi>Scotch man</hi> found his Grave in <hi>England;</hi> ſo exact his conduct and warineſs, that few <hi>Engliſh men</hi> had theirs in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the ſame ground giving them their Coffin, that did their Cradle; and their Birth that did their Death.

               <p>SIr <hi>William Paget</hi> was born in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> of honeſt Parents. He was ſo able and truſty a Miniſter of State, that he was privy Counſellour to four ſucceſſive Princes: He was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; who employed him Embaſſador to <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth made him Chancellour of the Dutchy, Comptroller of his Houſhold, and created him Baron of <hi>Beaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert. Queen Mary</hi> made him Keeper of the Privy-Seal. <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> highly reſpected him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing with his Attendance at Court, in favour to his great Age. Duke <hi>Dudley</hi> in the days of King <hi>Edward,</hi> ignominiouſly took from him the Garter of the Order, ſaying, <hi>He was not Originally qualified for the ſame:</hi> But this was reſtored unto him by <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> He died very old, <hi>Anno</hi> 1563. and was buried in <hi>Lichfield.</hi> His Education was better then his Birth, his Knowledge higher then his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: His Parts above his Knowledge, and his Experience beyond his Parts: A general Learning furniſhed him for Travel, and Travel ſeaſoned that Learning for Employment. His Maſter-piece was an inward Obſervation of other Men, and an exact knowledge of Himſelf. His Addreſs was with ſtate, yet inſinuating: His Diſcourſe free, but weighed; his apprehenſion quick, but ſtaid: His ready and preſent mind keeping its pauſes of thoughts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

3. Travel, where they ſaw what they read, and made that a ſolid apprehenſion and obſervation, which was before but a fluid notion and a floating imagination: Our Knight was happy in all Three, but ſo compleat in the laſt, that he had the Vertues and Port of a <hi>German,</hi> as if he had been a Native of that place; and loathed the Vices, as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen it: Thereby he could get ſo far within that people, that he ſaw all their Intrigues; and be yet ſo reſerved, that they could ſee nothing: The ableſt <hi>German</hi> Divines guided his conſcience, and the greateſt Stateſmen his Negotiation. He kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperour by the Princes, the French by the Emperour, and the Pope by them all. So much ſervice did the good Knight to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, in his Wife <hi>Katharine</hi>'s Caſe; and ſo much the whole Kingdom, in that of Religion; that he equally fled Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s wrath, and her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions Perſecutions. His ſtrong parts ſet off his comprehenſive knowledge; his reſolute ſpirit, his parts; and his preſence and meen, <hi>all:</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> always chuſing an Embaſſador that might repreſent his Perſon as well as his Power: And Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had his <hi>Hogh</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as <hi>Henry</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His knack was his <hi>foreſight,</hi> which made that an Adviſo in <hi>England,</hi> which was hardly a known de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign there: ſaying uſually, <hi>His Maſter maintained not Embaſſadors ſo much to write</hi> Hiſtories <hi>as</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. The <hi>Trojans</hi> ſent to condole with <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his Son that was dead two year ago; he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and condoled with them for <hi>Hector,</hi> that was ſlain as many hundred years. Our Embaſſador in <hi>France</hi> adviſeth Sir <hi>Richard</hi> of a Battel fought a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29485:44"/>
Week before, and he in anſwer makes a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Battel of <hi>Spurs</hi> fought many years before; and adds, <hi>I and You are not here to tell old ſtories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things, he ſaid, he was troubled with, <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice;</hi> and two Remedies he had againſt them, <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Reſolution.</hi> Always he wheeled with the firſt Mover, yet he had private motions of his own: Singular, but modeſt: So faithful he was, that he would declare his Opinion; yet ſo wary, that he would not ſtand in it againſt his Prince; knowing, that if he did it out of prudence, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Princes Ability ſuſpected; if out of his own ſagacity, it blemiſhed his Integrity: Both equal inconveniencies, to intimate the Maſter Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or the Servant Corrupt.</p>
               <p>When others preſſed for an over-ſtrict Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this Gentleman urged, That <hi>Diſtempers in the Body and State are reduced by Phyſicians and Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not to what they ſhould be, but to what they can be:</hi> Freedom, Moderation and Impartiality are the beſt tempers of Reforming Counſels and Endeavours: What is acted ſingularly, muſt offend more then it pleaſeth; a ſtudy to gratifie ſome men, being a likely way to injure all: The novelty of exceſſive and immoderate undertakings giving not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the vulgar of a preſent Age, as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of them give offence to the Generations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s diſcourſe to him was to this purpoſe: <hi>That the Reformation of hearts ſhould go before that of Churches; and men ſhould try that on their own hearts which they deſign upon the Church: For Deformities within, will ſoon betray the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29485:44"/>
of publique Reformation to ſuch private deſigns as muſt needs hinder the publique Good. It would be an eaſie matter for Favourites to reform Kings Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (ſaith <hi>Malvezzi) if it were not a hard thing to reform their own houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One asked him, <hi>Why his Embaſſie tended ſo much more to preſerve his Maſters Dominions, then to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them?</hi> And he replied what is fathered on <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>That Getting is a Chance, but Keeping is a Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a long reſidence abroad, he thought of an Habitation at home; which he no ſooner began at <hi>Caſhobery</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> but King <hi>Edward</hi> going out of the World, the good Knight was forced out of his houſe and the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>He was the firſt that ſaid, <hi>Policy is not the learning of ſome Rules, but the Obſervation of Circumſtances, with a preſent minde in all junctures of affairs; which</hi> (he would ſay) <hi>was their happineſs onely, that had good memories:</hi> For when one ſaid he had <hi>ſeen much, heard more, and read moſt: You were</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>a more compleat man, could you ſay, I remembered as much.</hi> Secretary <hi>Walſingham</hi> would ſay, <hi>My Lord, ſtay a little, and we ſhall have done the ſooner:</hi> Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid, <hi>It ſhall never be ſaid of me, That I will defer till to morrow what I can do to day:</hi> And Sir <hi>Richard Moriſin, Give me this day, and take the next your ſelf.</hi> Noble was his Reſolution, when he ſaid, <hi>He ſcorned to take penſions from an Emperour of Germany, ſince an Emperour of Germany took pay of the King of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſtatute was ſomething tall, and procured him reverence; his temper reſerved, and commanding ſecurity to his perſon and his buſineſs. <hi>He that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:29485:45"/>
knoweth to ſpeak well, knoweth alſo where he muſt hold his peace,</hi> ſaid the old <hi>Graecian: Think an hour before you ſpeak, and a day before you promiſe,</hi> ſaid this <hi>Engliſh-Roman.</hi> With <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our he prevailed for the Popes aſſiſtance, and with <hi>Maximilian</hi> for his Maſters againſt the French.</p>
               <p>Never was his Maſter <hi>Henry</hi> ſo high, as to ſet him above treating; nor his Soveraign <hi>Edward</hi> ſo low, as to make him afraid of War; although he looked upon the way of Treaties, as a retiring from fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Beaſts, to arguing like men; whoſe ſtrength ſhould be more in their Underſtandings, then in their Limbs. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaid a great Prince) <hi>greater confidence in my Reaſon then in my Sword; and am ſo reſolved to yeild to the firſt, that I thought neither my ſelf nor others ſhould uſe the ſecond, if once we rightly underſtood one another.</hi> It's <hi>humane</hi> to uſe <hi>Reaſon</hi> rather than <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to <hi>ſeek peace and enſue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtian was his Temper, and Religious his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; ſo charitable, that he relieved the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as though he had been none himſelf; and ſo conſtant, that he continued his ſufferings, as if there were no other. Much good did his Countenance do the Exiles in the Courts of Forreign Princes; and more his Authority at the Troubles of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> where his Motive to love, was the hatred of the Enemy.</p>

What was Law alwayes, was then a Reſolution, <hi>Neither to deny, nor defer, nor ſell Juſtice.</hi> When our Judge came upon the Bench, he knew no more then <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> or <hi>Levi,</hi> Father or Mother, neither Friend nor Intereſt: for when his Couſin urged for a kindeneſs, <hi>Come to my Houſe</hi> (ſaith the Judge) <hi>I will deny you nothing; come to the Kings Court and I muſt do you juſtice?</hi> And when the Attorney-General beſpake his favour in a publick Cauſe; <hi>Trouble not your ſelf,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I'll do the King right:</hi> The King is caſt, the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29485:50"/>
expoſtulates; the Judge ſatisfieth him, <hi>That he could not do his Majeſty Right, if he had not done ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Prudence ſo tempered his zeal for his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, that he over-ſtrained not the Prerogative to bring in fears and jealouſies of Tyranny on the one hand; and his Integrity ſo balanced his Popularity, that he never depreſſed it to broach bold opinions and attempts of Liberty, on the other: complying with none of thoſe humours that an imaginary dread of oppreſſion, or a dangerous preſumption of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may tranſport to irregular exceſſes either for the one, or againſt the other.</p>
               <p>As his Majeſty was ſecured by his Loyalty, ſo his Subjects were by his Patience, a Vertue he carried with him to the Bench, to attend each circumſtance of an Evidence, each allegation of a Plea, each plea in a Cauſe; <hi>hearing</hi> what was <hi>impertinent,</hi> and <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> what was <hi>proper.</hi> His uſual ſaying (as Sergeant <hi>Mandevil</hi> reports it) being, <hi>We muſt have two ſouls, as two ſieves, one for the Bran, the other for the flour; the one for the Groſs of a Diſcourſe, the other for the Quinteſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame day that there was no Cauſe to be tried in the <hi>Chancery</hi> in Sir <hi>Tho. More</hi>'s time, there were but three in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> in Sir <hi>John Fitz-James</hi> his time: the reaſon whereof ſome <hi>imagine</hi> was Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s extraordinary power (that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed all Cauſes to his Legantine Court;) others <hi>know</hi> it was the Judges Integrity, who was too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to <hi>allow,</hi> as that Age was too plain to <hi>contrive</hi> delays and obſtructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France</hi> would ſay, when he was adviſed to take Revenge of thoſe that had
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29485:50"/>
affronted him before he came to the Crown, <hi>That it became not the King of</hi> France <hi>to revenge the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to the Duke of</hi> Orleans. A Perſon that had notoriouſly wronged Sir <hi>John</hi> when a Templer, in the caſe of his Chamber, was to be tried before him for his whole Eſtate when a Judge; the Adverſaries among other ſhifts made uſe of this old Quarrel; whereupon Sir <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>It doth not become a Judge upon the Bench to revenge a wrong done in his chamber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things upheld him in thoſe boyſterous times: 1. Silence, 2. Patience: both wary Vertues that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom endanger their Owner, or diſpleaſe their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours. The People of thoſe times would live and die with the Pope and Councel; and this Judge, with the King and Parliament: The grand Article of his Faith was, <hi>I believe as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves:</hi> and the great Rule of his Practice was, <hi>I will live as the Law directs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a tried Man, whoſe Faith and Honour was above his Life and Fortune; whoſe Generoſity was above that firſt temptation of <hi>Money,</hi> as his Spirit was above the ſecond of <hi>Danger:</hi> No fear here of delivering up Priviledges to day, for fear of the King; or Prerogative to morrow, for fear of the Subject: No, an unbiaſs'd Temper between both, make up this honeſt man; who came on to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with great Expectations, and went off with great Applauſe: being one of the three men of whom it is ſaid, <hi>That becauſe they never pleaſed their Maſter in doing any thing unworthy, they never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him in doing any thing that is juſt.</hi> When baſe compliance goeth off with the contempt of thoſe it hath humoured, a Noble Reſolution comes off with the Reverence of thoſe it hath diſcontented.</p>

               <p>It appears by our Author, that the like Letters, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> were ſent unto Sir <hi>Edward Stanley,</hi> and ſome other men of principal note in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is more in the Education then the Birth (though that be Noble too) of this Gentleman: much Generous Blood ſparkled in his Veins, more Arts and Sciences thronged in his Soul: A learned Prince brought up a learned Gentry, the moſt hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of whom think themſelves as much obliged to imitate his Vertues, as the moſt degenerate were inclined to practiſe his Vices. Four excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts were at once entertained in his Fathers Houſe: 1. A compleat Grammarian and Linguiſt, <hi>Parker:</hi> 2. An exact Mathematician and Hiſtorian, <hi>Calvius:</hi> 3. A skilful Muſitian, <hi>Pallevicino;</hi> and 4. An active Dancing-maſter and Souldier.</p>
               <p>The Latine Tongue then wearing out its Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, he ſpake and writ elegantly: <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Works he kenned particularly: <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Lives and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29485:52"/>
(that Book which, as <hi>Gaza</hi> ſaid, would furniſh the World, if Learning were loſt) he epitomized punctually: The active and practical part of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, he ſtudied intently. And, as the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of his Nature, and ſweetneſs of his Temper, he added to theſe ſeverer ſtudies, thoſe more airy of Muſick, Poetry and Heraldry.</p>
               <p>

None pleaſed the King at Court more, ſuch his Learning to ſatisfie him, ſuch his Debonairneſs to delight him; (for, as Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> ſo Sir <hi>William Molineux</hi> got in with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth by a Diſcourſe out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> in the morning, and a Dance at night:) None ſerved him better in the Country; ſuch his obligations upon Tenants and Neighbours, that he had ſix thouſand men at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: ſuch his prudence and juſtice, that there were more differences ended in his Parlour, then in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> ſuch his care and watchfulneſs,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29485:52"/>
that no Treaſon ſtirred, but his Agents diſcovered, and his Militia was at an hours warning to ſuppreſs it: The Idea of an Engliſh Gentleman! In Favour at Court! In Repute in the Country! At once Loved and Feared!</p>
               <p>Four things he took ſpecial care of: 1. That the Poor might have their ſtated Alms. 2. That the Prieſts might enjoy their known Dues. And 3. That his Tenant might be ſo well uſed, that he might thrive; and but ſo well, that he ſhould not be idle. 4. That every Body ſhould be employed: ſaying, <hi>He had rather they ſhould be buſie, though doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, at the charge of his Purſe; then that they ſhould be idle, doing nothing at all, at the charge of their own pretious time.</hi> In a world, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all Capacities a publick Good, and died a common Loſs: Leaving in his Family that beſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie, A good Example; and his Country that laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monument, A good Name, for two things that he hated; 1. Depopulating Incloſures: 2. Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Inhancements of Rents: For he died with this Advice to his Son, <hi>Let the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwoods grow.</hi> The Tenants are the ſupports of a Family, and the Commonalty are the ſtrength of the Kingdom. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thriftily, but force not violently either your Bounds or Rents above your fore-Fathers.</hi> His Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity never failed of being called to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor his Activity of being uſeful there: None underſtood better how to move, to preſs, to quit, to divert, to eſcape, to watch and mould a buſineſs: None knew better the confederacie of Contrivers, Speakers, Sticklers, Dividers, Moderators, and the <hi>I</hi> and <hi>No-</hi>Men, their Method and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: None more patient and induſtrious, when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29485:53"/>
a lower Faction was firmer in conjunction, and a few that were ſtiff, tired out many more moderate: He had no eaſineſs to be impoſed upon, no weakneſs to be deluded no low Intereſt to be corrupted by fond hopes or fair promiſes of Preferment, to wave the very pinch of a diſpute; no pleaſure or vanity to be debauched, while the vigilant Faction ſteals a Vote worth a Kingdom; no ſloath nor neglect, to be ſurprized; no vanity of diſcourſe, to loſe his Maſter, no partiality to be biaſſed, no diſcontent to ſatisfie, no paſſion to miſguide: As one that <hi>hated</hi> nothing, but what was Diſhoneſt; <hi>feared</hi> nothing, but what was Ignoble; and <hi>loved</hi> nothing, but was Juſt and Honourable.</p>

This Bill was aggravated moſt effectually, by three moſt pinching conſiderations: <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Kings Honour was by him diminiſhed: That the ſtate of the Realm was by him decayed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented: That the courſe of Juſtice was by him obſtructed. A great Undertaking, this! To bring down this lofty Prelate! (whom his Maſter created the <note n="*" place="margin">When Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.</note> Kings Fellow, and his own pride made his Superiour) But as Wiſe as Great, if we regard the five Politick circumſtances:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Queen was engaged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The People were oppreſſed.</p>

               <p n="5">5.

               <p>Neither did the Pope eſcape him abroad, better then the Cardinal at home: For his next action we finde is a Declaration drawn by him, <hi>Jo.

               <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Darcy</hi> was one of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's firſt Counſellours, ſo advanced (as moſt of his Fellows) not for Affection, but Intereſt; owing his Promotion to his own ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, rather then his Maſters favour.

               <p>A while after he is Earl Marſhal, and Embaſſador to King <hi>Francis</hi> about thoſe two grand points:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the French King ſhould ſet up a Patriarch:</item>
                  <item>2. That he ſhould ſtop up all the payments made to <hi>Rome,</hi> with fair promiſes of that ſupply of men and money he then moſt wanted.</item>
               </list>
               <p>When the Pope ſtuck to Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> three things he adviſed the King to:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To teach the people that a general Council was above the Pope, and proclaim that he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To fix upon every Church-Door the Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the late Statute againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To conſederate with the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> the Eſtates of the Empire and the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns. Three things that would ſettle his People at home, and ſtrengthen his Intereſt abroad: To which he added the Statute of Succeſſion, the Oath of Supremacy, ſir <hi>William Howard</hi>'s Embaſſy to the Scotch King, the ſuppreſſion of Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the War in <hi>Ireland</hi> under ſir <hi>William Sheffington,</hi> and a thorow ſearch into the bottom of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in the North, by a connivance and delay.</p>
               <p>But all his ſervices could not quit him from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, nor his popularity from envy: The Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> accuſeth him to excuſe himſelf, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſeconds him to ſecure himſelf: and (as unhappineſſes follow one another in the ſame order as one wave floweth after another) his Nieces miſcarriages
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29485:58"/>
threatned his fall; but that the honeſt man (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from a Letter the whole Council ſent to ſir <hi>William Paget</hi> then reſident in <hi>France)</hi> was the firſt that declared againſt her, and put the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt ſafe and honourable ways of trying her; which ſatisfied his Majeſty ſo far, that he employed him as chief in the Treaty upon the Borders, and General in the War when that Treaty failed; Sir <hi>Anthony Brown,</hi> upon his Recommendation, being added to the Commiſſioners in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to the Privy-Council in <hi>England,</hi> as Maſter of the Kings Horſe, as Sir <hi>John Gages</hi> was Comptroller of his Houſe.</p>
               <p>Several Perſons came to <hi>London</hi> for a Reward of their Scotch ſervices; this Duke gave the King a wary and grave counſel, to beſtow upon them as much Land as they could win in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Greatneſs is fatal: The King is old and teſty, the Government diſordered and irregular, the Duke too ſtifly honeſt to comply, the Council envy him; and in this Juncture his Wives paſſion diſcovereth his Minions, and they, to ſave themſelves, his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacies and ſecrets: His ſon, a man of a deep under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of a ſharp wit and great valour, bred up with <hi>Henry-Fitzroy</hi> at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Paris,</hi> was beheaded before his face. His Favourite Mrs. <hi>Holland</hi> depoſed, That he ſaid many looked for the Protectorſhip (when the King, who lived and moved by Engines and Art, rather then by Nature, ſhould die) but he would carry it: That the King did not love him becauſe he was loved by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but he would follow his Fathers Leſſon, which was, <hi>That the leſs others ſet by him, the more he would ſet by himſelf:</hi> That he had a Daughter for the King
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29485:59"/>
as well as others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Eſtate was great, his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er greater; the Kings occaſions had ſwallowed up the one, and his Enemies ambition the other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his humble ſubmiſſion before the Council, and his many ſervices to the King; had not his Majeſties death ſaved his Life.</p>
               <p>As the deepeſt Hate is that which ſprings from violent Love, ſo the greateſt Diſcourteſies oft ariſe from the largeſt Favours. It is indiſcreet to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs any, dangerous a Prince with Kindeneſſes; which being Fetters, are Treaſon on that Perſon: But Suſpicion! Ah ſad Suſpicion!

               <p>His Eſtate was much waſted in the ſervice of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſeventh, and as much improved by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which amounted in the beginning of his Reign to 11800000 <hi>l. i. e.</hi> at the rate of money now adays, ſix millions and an half; which he diſpenſed ſo thriftily, that old <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> could not trapan him; and yet ſo nobly, that young <hi>Henry</hi> was pleaſed with him.

When News was brought that <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> were ſlain, it was this Earls opinion that his Majeſty had done more like a good King then a good Maſter.

               <p>He ſends <hi>Rouge Croix</hi> to the Scotch King, to tell him, <hi>That though he ſaw no Enemy at Sea, he hoped to finde ſome upon the Land: That he came to juſtifie</hi> Bretons <hi>death, which it was as much below a King to revenge, as it was below a Privy Counſellour to have deſerved: That he</hi> expected <hi>as little mercy as he</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; <hi>his ſword being commiſſioned to ſpare none but the King, whom no hand muſt touch.</hi> To this Defiance, he added a Caution to the Herauld, <hi>That

to judge: but when a matter exceeded his capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or out-reached his ſphere and orb, he had either a peremptory and great word to urge it, or a ſleight to wave it, or a ſubtlety to perplex it, (that his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed fellow-Commiſſioners ſhould as little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it) or a countenance and geſture to overbear it.

               <p>

Three things ſet him up:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His large expences for ſhew at Court.</item>
                  <item>2. His ſtrength and manhood at Juſts.</item>
                  <item>3. His skill and experience in the Field.</item>
               </list>
               <p>He was the beſt for embatteling an Army in thoſe times: obſerving,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The number, ſtrength and experience of his Camp.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The nature and extent of the place, whether champaign or incloſed, hilly or plain, wooddy or mooriſh, ſtraight or large; that he might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly diſpoſe of diſtances and ſtands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Incloſures he aimed at for his Foot, and Champaign for his Horſe, together with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of winde and ſun.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He impales the Flank and Reer with Muskets, Pikes and Carriages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Diviſions were ſundry, but well ordered to relieve one another: His main Battels three: the largeſt in the front, the next in the middle, with ſome ſpaces between for the firſt to rally it ſelf, or embody with the ſecond; the third and ſtrongeſt in the Rear, ſo divided that the two firſt Battels may retreat into it, and draw up in its Rear, to watch the Enemies diſorder in purſuit.</p>
               <p>It's obſerved of the Turks, that they never put their <hi>Janizaries</hi> (their beſt Souldiers) in the Front, but make uſe of them for Reſerves, by which they have been very ſucceſsful: This Noble Marqueſs went not by rote or fore-conceived Rules, but by preſent Prudence, obſerving time, place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; neither would he lie open to an Enemies deſign by a conſtant Method, but alter his Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, and contradict all the Rules of Diſcipline, to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29485:68"/>
diſorder the Enemy, and diſappoint his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He hath ſometimes compounded the wings of his Battel of the ableſt men, and the Battel it ſelf of the meaneſt; ordering them, if over-powered, to make their retreat to the Rear of the other Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, through the ſpaces appointed for that end; which the Enemy perceiving, followeth (not ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the drift) not without diſorder, (as in all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits) between the two ſtrong wings, who cruſh them in pieces: his field-Pieces after once or twice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, were drawn within the Diviſions of the main Battel, to fire the Enemy at his next approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if the front were diſordered: and to avoid the execution of his Enemies, his files were thin, and his Dragoons ready to ſeize theirs, whereby at leaſt they were hindered from ſhooting; his Forlorn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the main Battel, and out of the Flanks thereof iſſued with Fire-pots and Granadoes upon the engaged Enemy.</p>
               <p>His Horſe were in four Battalia's, whereof the firſt was the greateſt, lined with ſhot, placed on each wing of the main Army; always opening upon the opening of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The greateſt truſt between man and man, is the truſt of giving Counſel: <hi>For in other confidences</hi> (ſaith my Lord <hi>Bacon) men commit the parts of life, their Lands, their Goods, their Children, their Credit, ſome particular affair; but to ſuch as they make their Counſellours, they commit the whole, by how much the more they are obliged to faithfulneſs and integrity.</hi> None was more truſted then the Marqueſs, none more truſty: none underſtood clearer what was fit, noneſpoke plainer what he underſtood. <hi>What wants
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:29485:69"/>
a Soveraign?</hi> (ſaid a flattering Courtier:) <hi>Truth;</hi> (ſaid a ſerious King.) Never had King more need of it then <hi>Henry,</hi> never leſs of it then he; whom it was leſs fatal to Ruine, then to Diſpleaſe. But this Souldier was as much above Fear as Flattery, that told him when penſive, <hi>That never was that man merry, that had more then one Woman in his Bed, more then one Friend in his Boſom, more then one Faith in his Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So wary was this Gentleman, that he was not raſh, and ſo loſt his advantage: ſo valiant, that he was not contemptible, and ſo loſt his command: He led others by the ſtrongeſt authority of his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, his own Example; he was led himſelf by the beſt Guide, his own Obſervation, his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: His Book limited not his Deſign, nor his Paper-plot his Undertakings.</p>
               <p>Land-ſervice was his Exerciſe, but the Sea his Delight: the Compaſs his Study, the Stars his Care, Trade his Thoughts, our own and forreign Havens his Diſcourſe, a Sea-man his Familiar, and three Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fights his Triumph: His converſe and ſpeech was Souldier-like, plain, ſhort, ſmart and material: there was a time when he would ſay nothing, and a time when he would ſay ſomething; but never a time when he would ſay all.</p>
               <p>He was, in a word, the happy man, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the times could not endure his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, nor he their Vices, died at once full of honour at Court, and applauſe in the Country, with this Monument from the King, <hi>That Honeſt and Good Man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd thus concluded that great Cardinal: A man in whom ability of parts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry were equally eminent; though, for being employed wholly in ambitious ways, they became dangerous Inſtruments of power, in active and mutable times. By theſe arts yet he found means to govern not onely the chief affairs of this Kingdom, but of</hi> Europe; <hi>there being no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, which, in his turn did not ſeek to him: and as this procured him divers Penſions, ſo, when he acquainted the King therewith, his manner was, ſo cunningly to diſoblige that Prince who did fee him last, as he made way thereby oftentimes to receive as much on the other ſide. But not of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes alone, but even of the Pope and Clergy of</hi> Rome <hi>he was no little courted; of which therefore he made eſpecial uſe, while he drew them to ſecond him on moſt occaſions. His birth being otherwiſe ſo obſcure and mean, as no man had ever ſtood ſo ſingle: for which reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his chief indeavour was not to diſpleaſe any great Perſon; which yet could not ſecure him againſt the divers Pretenders of that time. For
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:29485:77"/>
as all things paſſed through his hands, ſo they who failed in their ſuits, generally hated him: All which, though it did but exaſperate his ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet this good reſultance followed, that it made him take the more care to be Just; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo he obtained the reputation in his publick hearing of Cauſes: For as he loved no body, ſo his Reaſon carried him. And thus he was an uſeful Miniſter of his King, in all points, where there was no queſtion of deſerving the Roman Church; of which (at what price ſoever) I finde he was a zealous Servant; as hoping thereby to aſpire to the Papacy, whereof (as the factious times then were) he ſeemed more capable then any, had he not ſo immoderately affected it. Whereby alſo it was not hard to judge of his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; that Prince, who was ableſt to help him to this Dignity, being ever preferred by him; which therefore was the ordinary Bait by which the Emperour and the French King, one after the other did catch him. And, upon theſe terms, he doubted not to convey vaſt treaſures out of this Kingdom, eſpecially unto</hi> Rome, <hi>where he had not a few Cardinals at his devotion; by whoſe help, though he could not attain that Supreme Dignity he ſo paſsionately deſired, yet he prevailed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much of their favour, as he got a kinde of abſolute power in Spiritual Matters at Home: Wherewith again be ſo ſerved the Kings turn, as it made him think the leſs of uſing his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:29485:77"/>
One error ſeemed common to both, which was, That ſuch a multiplicity of Offices and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were inveſted in him. For as it drew much envy upon the Cardinal in particular, ſo it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated no little from the Regal Authority, while one man alone ſeemed to exhauſt all: Since it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Princes to do like good Husband-men, when they ſow their Grounds, which is, to ſcatter, and not to throw all in one place. He was no great Diſſembler, for ſo qualified a Perſon; as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his buſineſſes (for the moſt part) ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, as he got more by keeping his word then by breaking it. As for his Learning, (which was far from exact) it conſiſted chiefly in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of the</hi> Thomiſts, <hi>wherewith the King and himſelf did more often weary then ſatisfie each other. His ſtile, in Miſſives, was rather copious then eloquent, yet ever tending to the point. Briefly, if it be true (as</hi> Polydore <hi>obſerves) that no man ever did riſe with fewer vertues, it is true that few that ever fell from ſo high a place had leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer crimes objected againſt him: Though yet</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore <hi>(for being at his firſt coming into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>committed to Priſon by him, as we have ſaid) may be ſuſpected as a partial Author. So that in all probability he might have ſubſiſted lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when either his pride and immenſe wealth had not made him obnoxious, and ſuſpected to the King, or that other than Women had oppoſed him: Who, as they are vigilant and cloſe Enemies, ſo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29485:78"/>

for their good Lord of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and the Sea-men would die with their noble Lord <hi>Seymour.</hi> When the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had deluded King <hi>Henry</hi> in his correſpondencies with <hi>France</hi> beyond all patience, and had been forborn beyond all ſafety or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Sir <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> is firſt ſent to treat, and then to ſight; which he did with that ſucceſs, that 300 of his men, and a ſtratagem, (to poſſeſs the <hi>Scots</hi> with an apprehenſion that the whole Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Army was upon them) took and killed 30000 <hi>Scots,</hi> had more priſoners then they could keep, more booty then they could diſpoſe of; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this to their Victory, That they broke the Kings heart.</p>
               <p>There was no end to be expected of a War with <hi>Seotland,</hi> but by marrying that Kings Daughter to our Soveraigns Son. This Match was my Lord <hi>Seymour's</hi> intereſt as well as the Kings: his prudence and experience is therefore employed firſt to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> it; and when that would not do, (ſo great and ſo croſs the Papal power there by Cardinal <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> means) his Valour and Reſolution is ſent with 10000 to <hi>compel</hi> it: in order whereunto, <hi>May</hi> 4. landing at <hi>Granther Gray,</hi> he marcheth in order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Leith,</hi> which (after a defeat given the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, the Earls of <hi>Arran, Huntley, &amp;c.</hi> by his Harquebuſiers) they entred, and thence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> (my Lord <hi>Dudley</hi> leading the Front, our Earl the Battle, and the Earl of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> the Rereward:) there the Keys are offered them upon conditions; which they refuſing, (and ſo making the Enemy deſperate, who reſolveth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to periſh nobly, then be undone by ſubmiſſion) the Town holds out, and they are able to do no

               <p>Two things he was eminent for:</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Advice, that not the leaſt Punctilio of the Law ſhould be neglected: whereupon the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> and other Nobility were impriſoned <hi>for eating Fleſh in Lent.</hi> A ſecret and unobſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Law, is a cloſe undermining of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which muſt be either its ſelf in indulging nothing, or be nothing in allowing <hi>all.</hi> Liberty knows no reſtraint, no limit, when <hi>winked</hi> at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For his Popularity, in advancing the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence 52000 <hi>l.</hi> beyond expectation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> muſt have War as long as there is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in their Country, and Intereſt in <hi>France:</hi> This Noble Earl cutteth off the Invaders, layeth waſte the Country, and (that the ſource of thoſe troubles might be <hi>damned</hi> up) entreth <hi>France</hi> with 80000 men; and after ſome skirmiſhes, brought the King thereof to a peace and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>In purſuance whereof, while King <hi>Henry</hi> was in <hi>Bologn,</hi> he made his Will, wherein the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> Lord High Chamberlain is appointed Principal Counſellour to his Nephew: and not long after he dieth, and leaves the Kingdome to his ſon, and his ſon to his Uncle, whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vote made Protector, and Intereſt a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Council, which the times required a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but their humours made factious. The peace with King <hi>Francis</hi> and the Emperour was but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29485:83"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> were irreconcileable, the Pope implacable, Religion unſetled, the Clergy out of frame, the People diſtracted, and the Nobility at variance. A great Counſellour King <hi>Henry</hi> leaves his ſon, and a greater his Uncle makes him: <q>In <note place="margin">Bacons Eſſ. 116.</note> counſel is ſtability: things will have their firſt or ſecond agitation: if they be not toſſed upon the Arguments of Counſel, they will be toſſed upon the Waves of Fortune.</q> But yet this Lord miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, in that the Council underſtood him better then he did them: And he adviſed with them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick, where men ſpeak warily, and in compliance with others humour; then in private, where they deliver themſelves more freely, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to their own humours. (The Rule is, <hi>Ask an inferiour mans advice in private, that he may be free; and a ſuperiours in publick, that he may be reſpectful.)</hi> But he did well, 1. In that the ſame matter if weighed, was never propounded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the ſame day. 2. In that he had fixed days of petitions, for the peoples and his own eaſe. 3. In that he poyzed his Committees of contrary Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; that watched and balanced each other to a moderation moſt ſafe for the Kingdome and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 4. That he had of all Profeſſions ſuch at his command as opened the ſtate of a buſineſs before any Commiſſioners debated it. 5. That he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diſcovered his own inclination, left it byaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his <hi>Counſel.</hi> 6. That to prevent a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Council, he weakned their power and priviledges, their credit, their dependencies, either by office or expectation, their opportunities and correſpondencies, ſo that he could eaſily remove any when faulty, diſcover any when dangerous,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29485:84"/>
diſgrace any when bold, and not fit to be entruſted with the <hi>Counſels, Reſolves, Deliberations</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities</hi> of the State. In order to which, he had two uſeful Reſolutions, 1. To ſuppreſs Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, 2. To encourage Accuſations. His firſt Acts were Shew and Pomp, (neceſſary for Greatneſs) <hi>viz.</hi> The Knighting of the King, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Duke. His next are <hi>Realities:</hi> as, 1. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling the Country for a Parliament, conſidering the temper of the people, and the pulſe of the laſt Parliament; redreſſing Grievances, ſetling Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by ſuch Legal Rules, as that the people ſhould not be corrupted with money, overborn by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, tranſported by fear or favour to an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or an unſuitable choice; and taking a juſt time to prepare the people for the deſigned ſettlement, by his grave and ſober Injunctions, by godly and good Books of Inſtructions, by a wholſome form of Prayer, (compoſed at <hi>Windſor)</hi> by a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act tranſlation of the Bible, by ſeveral Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for moderation and order on all hands, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting all Preachers but ſuch <hi>learned, ſober, grave</hi> and <hi>diſcreet</hi> men as were Licenſed thereunto under the Lord Protector's and my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His promoting the Match with <hi>Scotland</hi> firſt by Ambaſſadours, and then by an Army, whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was this: <hi>viz.</hi> The avant-guard of 3 or 4000 <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet</hi>'s march.</note> foot-men at Arms, and 600 light-horſe led by the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> the main Battle of 6000 foot, and 600 men at Arms, and 1000 light-horſe, led by the Protector; and the Rear of half ſo many, led by the Lord <hi>Dacres;</hi> the Artillery of 16 Pieces of Ordnance making one Wing, the men at Arms
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29485:84"/>
and Demilances the other. For the Avant-guard and half of the Battel riding about two flight-ſhot from their ſide, the other half of the Battel: and the whole Flank of the Rear was cloſed by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, being 12000 Carts and Waggons; the reſt of the men at Arms and Demilances marching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. A few skirmiſhes and ſtratagems paſſed, when a Trumpeter is ſent by <hi>Huntley</hi> to challenge the Protector; to whom the Protector replying like a wiſe man, That <hi>it was not for a perſon of his truſt to duel it with a private man;</hi> The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſaid, <hi>Trumpeter, bring me word that thy Maſter will perform the Combat with me, and I'll give thee 100 Crowns. Nay, rather,</hi> ſaid our Duke, <hi>bring me word that he will give us Battle, and I will give thee 1000 l.</hi> But in 25 days he gains a greater <note n="a" place="margin">The ſame day that 30 years ago they were beaten at <hi>Flodden.</hi>
                  </note> Battle, over-runs the Country with the loſs of no more then 65 men, to that of 25000 <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. His third Exploit was, Diſpenſing <note n="b" place="margin">He made the firſt and laſt Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets.</note> Honours ſo nobly, that they were due encouragements to Vertue; though yet ſo warily, that they ſhould not be either a burden or a danger to the Crown.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He gave the Commonalty great content, in pulling down Encloſures by Proclamations; and the Nobility no leſs, by ſetting up Land-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by Rule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He engaged both, by a good bargain of Church-lands, confirmed by this Parliament.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He weakneth the Papiſts, 1. By conniving at them until they broke out to ſuch outrages as made them lyable. 2. By dividing them when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, with hope of mercy on the one hand, and fear of his Army on the other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>French</hi> taking the advantage of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

               </p>
               <p>But Greatneſs is fatal; and his Brother that ſhould have ſupported this great man, ruines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and him. He had married a Lady high in ſpirit; his Brother the Queen-Dowager, higher in place: <note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Stanhope,</hi>

By marrying the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and then by ſeizing the Kings perſon and the Government: ſo honeſt this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, (a plain man, and of no over-deep inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Practices) that he gave way to his Tryal, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (though ſomewhat ominous as it happened) <hi>I'll do and ſuffer Juſtice:</hi> ſo Uxorious, that he ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his death. And now he ſtands alone, wanting his Brothers cunning to reach <hi>Warwick,</hi> or his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to check <hi>Norfolk.</hi> The people are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that one weak and unjuſtifiable Act of his, The pulling down of ſo <hi>many</hi> of Gods Churches in the City, to build one <hi>Someſet-</hi>houſe in the <hi>Strand.</hi>

Stadlow,</hi> then Eloquence and Life by <hi>John Ayliffe.</hi> They delay: Sir <hi>Anthony Wingfield</hi> Captain of the Guard perſwardes the King of the Lords modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and and Loyalty; the Duke is to anſwer for himſelf: the Laywers charge him with removing <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> to <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> where he kept a Court of Requeſts, and determined Title of Lands; the Souldiers with the detaining of their pay, and betraying our-French Gariſons; the States-men with the engroſſing of all Authority. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> vigilantly but cloſely manageth all diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to his deſigne with this great advantage, that he was ſubtle, cloſe, and implacable, while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was free-ſpirited, open-hearted, humble, hard to diſtruſt, eaſie to forgive.

               <p>But <hi>Warwick</hi>'s deſigne for the Crown ripening, and <hi>Somerſet</hi> being the moſt eminent obſtruction in his way, having weakned, before he ruines him, now he chargeth him with Treaſon, to make a noiſe; and with <hi>Felony,</hi> to do execution: the Council is packed, he looſeth his life (for a ſmall crime, and that on a <note n="d" place="margin">For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving the death of a Privy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

not be jealous; better to act, then deſigne; to perform, then plot. When he was diſcharged of Treaſon, there was ſo loud a ſhout in <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> as was heard to <hi>Long-acre;</hi> when condemned of Felony, there was a ſilence and amazement for three hours.

               <p>His Couſin Sir <hi>William</hi> was brought by his Siſter to Court, and advanced by his Brother to Honour; being for his Majeſties ſake as well as his own, made Lord <hi>Far</hi> of <hi>Kendal,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton</hi> by King <hi>Edward:</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> deprived him of his Eſtate and Honour for ſiding with the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reſtored him to both, for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Proteſtant <hi>Religion.</hi>

then he ſtudied him, that his Rules might comply with his Inclination, and his Lectures with his temper: Lectures, that were rather Diſcourſes inſtilled to him Majeſtically, as a Prince; then Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beaten into him pedantiquely, as a School-boy.

Three years he had that place; and in that three years did <hi>England</hi> more ſervice, ſo great his Parts, Learning and Religion! more kindneſs, ſuch his eminency in both! and gave the people more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſuch his Integrity and Dexterity! then all that went before him, and moſt that came after him. He was the firſt that brought in the uſe of a Diary, and his Pupil the next that practiſed it: His Aphoriſm it was, That a dark and imperfect refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion upon Affairs floating in the memory, was like words diſperſed and inſignificant; whereas a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat view of them in a Book, was like the ſame words pointed in a period, and made ſignificant.</p>
               <p>Much did the Kingdome value him, but more the King: for being once deſperately ſick, the King carefully enquired of him every day; at laſt his Phyſitian told him there was no hope for his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given over by him for a dead man: <hi>No,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>he will not die at this time; for this morning I begged his life from God in my Prayers, and obtained it.</hi> Which accordingly came to paſs; and he ſoon after, againſt all expectation, wonderfully recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

               <p>But though his Prayers ſaved his Tutors life, none could ſave his; who died with the Proteſtant Religion in his heart and arms: and Sir <hi>John</hi> had died with him, but that being outed of all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerments, he outed himſelf from the Kingdome: loving to all the Engliſh Exiles at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> and well beloved all over <hi>Germany;</hi> until truſting to the Stars too much, (would he had either not gone

Forced he was to ſit with <hi>Bonner</hi> in his Courts, but forced he would not be to joyn with him in his Judgement: look on he did, but weep and groan too.</p>
               <p>A good Chriſtian he was, witneſs his pious Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; an excellent States-man, as appears by his <hi>True Subject to the Rebel;</hi> a Book as ſeaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed (by Doctor <hi>Langbaine</hi> of Queens Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Oxford)</hi> in the excellent King <hi>Charles</hi> his troubles, as it was at firſt written in the good King <hi>Edward</hi>'s commotions.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>SIr <hi>Tho. Wentworth</hi> of <hi>Nettleſted</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> ſo a younger Family, (confeſſed by the <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> in his Coat) deſcended from the <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi> of <hi>Wentworth-wood-houſe</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and was created Baron <hi>Wentworth</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. He was a ſtout and valiant Gentleman, a cordial Proteſtant, and his Family a Sanctuary of ſuch Profeſſors; <hi>John Bale</hi> comparing him to the good Centurion in the Goſpel, and gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him the cauſe of his converſion from a <hi>Carmelite.</hi> The memory of this good Lord is much (but unjuſtly) blemiſhed, becauſe <hi>Calis</hi> was loſt the laſt of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: The manner was huddled up in our Chronicles, (leaſt is beſt of bad buſineſs) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is the effect: The Engliſh being ſecure by reaſon of the laſt Conqueſt at St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> having notice thereof, he ſate down before the Town at the time (not when Kings go forth to, but return from battle) of mid-winter, even upon <hi>New-years-day.</hi> Next day he took the two Forts of <hi>Riſebank</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-bridge,</hi> (wherein the ſtrength of the City conſiſted) but whether they were undermined or undermoneyed, it is not decided, and the laſt left moſt ſuſpitious. Within three days the Caſtle of <hi>Calis,</hi> which commanded the City, and was under the command of Sir <hi>Ralph Chamberlain,</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:29485:92"/>
was taken, the French wading through the Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (made ſhallower by their artificial cut) and then entring the Town, were repulſed back by Sir <hi>Anthony Ager</hi> Marſhal of <hi>Calis,</hi> the onely man, ſaith <hi>Stow,</hi> who was killed in the fight, (underſtand him, of note) others, for the credit of the buſineſs, accounting fourſcore loſt in that ſervice. The French re-entring the City the next day, being <hi>Twelfth-day,</hi> the Lord <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> Deputy thereof made but vain reſiſtance, which (alas) was like the wrigling of a Worms tayl after the head thereof is cut off; ſo that he was forced to take what terms he could get, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Towns-men ſhould depart (though plundered to a Groat) with their lives, and himſelf with 49 more, ſuch as the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhould chuſe, ſhould remain priſoners to be put to ranſome.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This was the beſt news brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> and worſt to <hi>London</hi> for many years before: It not onely abated the Queens chear the remnant of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> but her mirth all the days of her life. Yet might ſhe thank her ſelf for looſing this Key of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe ſhe hung it by her ſide with ſo ſlender a ſtring, there being but five hundred Souldiers effectually in the Gariſon; too few to manage ſuch a piece of importance. The Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> following, was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly condemned for Treaſon, though unheard, as abſent in <hi>France:</hi> which was not onely againſt Chriſtian charity, but Roman juſtice; <hi>Feſtus</hi> confeſſing it was not faſhionable amongſt them to deliver any man to die, before he which is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed have the accuſers face to face, and have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29485:93"/>
to anſwer for himſelf concerning the crime laid againſt him. It was well for this Lord that he was detained in <hi>France</hi> till his ranſome was paid, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dead, who otherwiſe probably had loſt his life, if he had had his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> coming to the Crown, he found the favour, or rather had the juſtice to be tryed again, and was acquitted by his Peers; finding it no treachery, cowardiſe or careleſsneſs in him, but in Sir <hi>John Harlſton</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Chamberlain,</hi> the one Governour of <hi>Riſebank,</hi> the other of <hi>Calis-</hi>Caſtle: for which they were both condemned to die, though their judgement was remitted. This Lord was the onely perſon I have read of, who thus in a manner played Rubbers when his head lay at ſtake; and having loſt the fore, recovered the after-game. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very aged man, 1594. Thus far Mr. <hi>Fuller.</hi>

               <p>Two ways a Courtier advanceth himſelf: the firſt, that more leiſurely, ſlow, though ſure, of watching Offices, Preferments and Dignities that may by ſteps bring them to the Kings preſence: The ſecond, that more quick and ſhort, but moſt <hi>practiſed,</hi> of following the Court for ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commiſſions and particular ſervices to the Empire, as may (without the danger of delays that muſt be fatal amidſt ſo many Competitors) recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to his favour. It was below Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Eſtate to ſtoop to that firſt method; it ſuited more with his activity to embrace the ſecond. Two uſually-inconſiſtent qualities he had, The cloſeneſs of an Agent, and The Valour of a Souldier. To <hi>Rome</hi> he was ſent in diſguiſe, and to <hi>Treport</hi> with an

               <p>SIr <hi>Clement Paſton</hi> was a Souldier, and a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Son; Valour running in the Blood for three Generations, and maturated by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Heroick Actions for Glory and Succeſs.

Rich</hi> Lord Chancellour, (ſaith my Author) then living in <hi>Great St. Bartholomews,</hi> though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly concurring with the reſt, began now ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to favour the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and ſent him a Letter, therein acquainting him with all paſſages at the Council-board, ſubſcribing the ſame (either out of haſte or familiarity) with no other Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſave <hi>To the Duke;</hi> enjoyning his ſervant, a new Attendant, as newly entred into his Family, ſafely to deliver it. The man made more haſte then good ſpeed; and his Lord wondring at his quick return, demanded of him where the Duke was when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him the Letter: <hi>In the Charter-houſe,</hi> (ſaid the ſervant) <hi>on the ſame token that he read it at the Window, and ſmiled thereat.</hi> But the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> ſmiled not at the Relation, as ſadly ſenſible of the miſtake, and delivery of the Letter to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> no great friend of his, and an utter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet.</hi>

               <p>Wonder not if this Lord roſe early up the next

morning, who may be preſumed not to have ſlept all night: He hieth to the Court; and having gotten admittance into the Bedchamber before the <note place="margin">This ſtory is related from the mouth of his Grandchild the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> that laſt was.</note> King was up, fell down on his knees, and deſired that his Old Age might be eaſed of this burthen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome Office; pleading that there ought to be ſome preparatory intervals in States-men between their temporal buſineſs and their death: in order to which, he deſired to retire to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his own Devotions. Nor would he riſe from the ground till the King had granted his Requeſt. And thus he ſaved himſelf from being ſtripped by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by firſt pulling off his own cloaths, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had loſt his Chancellours place for reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecrets of the Council-board.</p>
               <p>There are few places ſo impregnable, but Nature hath left in them ſome place or other by which they may be taken: none being armed at all points ſo well, but there is ſome way left whereby he may be ſurprized. He is the ſtrongeſt that hath feweſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. He was a wiſe man that ſaid, <hi>Delay</hi> hath undone many for the other world, <hi>Haſte</hi> hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done more for this, <hi>Time</hi> well managed ſaves all in both.</p>
               <p>But there is a Wheel in things, which undoeth all thoſe that have not a Wheel that anſwereth it in their Souls; I mean a great capacity to comply and cloſe with thoſe grand Viciſſitudes that with ſmall and unobſerved circumſtances turn round the World, which this great Man was Maſter of, who had his eye upon the turns, flexures and poynts of things and buſineſs, and his ſtate and intereſt ready to correſpond: He knew when to proceed, when to make a ſtand, and when to retire. It's ſaid of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:29485:97"/>
Grandees, <hi>That they are the firſt that finde their own Griefs, and the laſt that finde their faults:</hi> Our Lord was quick in both, and hath taught us this, <hi>That certainly men of great fortunes are ſtrangers to themſelves; and while they are in the puzzle of buſineſs have no time to tend the welfare either of Body or Soul; and that they muſt withdraw from this world, before they retire into another:</hi> For, <hi>Illi mors gravis incubat, qui notus nimis omnibus, ignotus moritur ſibi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are no more Remarques of this Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, than that he was the Father of this Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme, <hi>Well done, if warily;</hi> and Great Grand-father to the preſent Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi>

               <p>HE had his Birth at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> and his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Oxford:</hi> His Birth commended him to <hi>All-Souls,</hi> and his Breeding to the Court: His Study was like his Inclination, rather active then contemplative, his preſent thoughts foreſeeing and providing for his future Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But Induſtry and Parts may prepare a man, it is opportunity and occaſion that muſt advance him; and never had a man fairer opportunity, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made a man better uſe of it.</p>
               <p>None but Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> would the Univerſity pitch upon, to complement <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; none but Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> could pleaſe him, although he was as great a <hi>Scholar</hi> as he was a <hi>King,</hi> and as much an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſt as both: as he was inclined, ſo he ſtudied; as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:29485:98"/>
he ſtudied, ſo he writ; not with a Pedants imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, but a Stateſmans prudence: ſo elegant was his Latine, that a Critick would have advanced him Profeſſor; ſo various his Learning, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> would have preferred him Prebend; and yet ſo grave and wiſe the matter and compoſure of his ſpeech, that the King deſigned him a Stateſman.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> is deputed to congratulate his coming: who conſidering that a man cannot every day ſpeak to Kings, contrived (ſaith my Author) the matter of his ſpeech moſt manlike, politick and pertinent, the phraſe of it polite and majeſtick; ſo that what with his comely preſence, his becoming carriage, his flowing expreſſion, his graceful elocution, he gained that applauſe from the Court and Univerſity, that the one was as eager to have him, as the other was loth to part with him: the Univerſity was proud of him, but King <hi>Henry</hi> commanded him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of him in forreign parts, to adde practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Four things he ſaid kept him in, under all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, during the four Princes Reigns whom he ſerved:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That he thought few Things would ſave a man.</item>
                  <item>2. That he was always intimate with the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lawyer, and ableſt Favourite.</item>
                  <item>3. That he ſpake little, and writ leſs.</item>
                  <item>4. That he had attained to ſomething which each party eſteemed ſerviceable to them, and was ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, that all thought him their own.</item>
               </list>
               <p>When a compleat man, he was called home, to be firſt Clerk of the Council, a place of great Truſt; ſecondly, Secretary of State, a place of great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; thirdly, Maſter of the Requeſts, an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of great Diſpatch and Buſineſs; and fourthly, Treaſurer of the Houſhold, an Employment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant care.</p>
               <p>No Age wanted an able man more, no Age had one more willing to ſecure the Univerſities, than that which choſe him to be Chancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at the ſame time that his Prince made him Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Houſhold. Sacriledge it ſelf then gaping after the Univerſity-Lands, durſt not tempt ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

a Man, nor perſwade ſo great a Scholar, nor fright ſo reſolute a Stateſman to betray or yeild up thoſe ancient Encouragements of Learning and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Loth was <hi>Oxford</hi> to part with him when a Scholar, glad to entertain him a Stateſman, with a power to protect her, well tempered with Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to love her; he who is now the <hi>Father</hi> being lately the <hi>Son;</hi> maintained by a part of it, as he now maintained the whole. That was a ſcrambling time, when it was <hi>catch who catch can.</hi> I finde not any particular favour conferred, or benefaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by him in perſon on the Univerſity; but this great good he did, That his Greatneſs kept others from doing any harm. Many hungry Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers had hopes to catch Fiſh, (and Fiſh it would be, whatever came into their Nets) on this turning of the tide, and alteration of Religion: How eaſie was it for covetouſneſs in thoſe times to quarrel the Colledge-Lands into ſuperſtition! Sacriledge ſtood ready to knock at their Gates; and alas! 'twas paſt their Porter's power to forbid it enterance, had not Sir <hi>John Maſon</hi> vigorouſly oppoſed it, and aſſiſted the Univerſity on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>He inciteth them to the ſtudy of the Tongues; becauſe <hi>ſenſum alicujus rei non poteſt ille aſſequi qui rudis eſt Idiomatis quo traditur:</hi> and directed the reading of <hi>Ariſtotle, Agricola, Melanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Univerſity, that could not enjoy his preſence, craves his protection; and foreſeeing in the fall of Abbeys, their danger, eſpecially when Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:29485:100"/>
erected for ſuperſtition were given by ſtatute to the King, choſe Sir <hi>John Maſon</hi> their Chancellour, who was at once a Favourite of Power and of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the greateſt Lay-Stateſman that was a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the greateſt Scholar that was a Lay-Stateſ-man: He was not contented to ſecure, but he muſt improve <hi>Oxford,</hi> gaining it New Priviledges, when it feared the loſs of its old ones.</p>
               <p>A grave and reſerved man he was, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Intrigues and Motions of thoſe dark and uncertain times, and his nimble and preſent Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could accommodate them. His Maxime was, <hi>Do, and ſay nothing:</hi> Commending the active and cloſe man, whoſe performances were as private, coherent, continued and ſuddain as his counſels; who would not ſpend that time in adviſing, that would ſerve for executing: Many were his penſions to Scholars at home, more to Agents abroad that aſſiſted either his ſtudies or employments, whom he deſigned an honour to his middle, and a ſupport to his old age. He had a peculiar way of ſatisfying ſuiters by plain dealing and diſpatch: he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all ſuits either into matter of Equity, or a ſuit of Controverſie; or into matter of Deſert, or a ſuit of Petition: In the firſt he had his Referrendaries, to ſee the matter compounded between both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rather then carried by either: In the ſecond, he preferred all ſuitably to their Abilities. No man underſtood better the nature of Court-places than he, and none ſaw further into Court-Perſons.</p>
               <p>Two things, he ſaid, always promoted a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Secreſie: (Boaſting, which is the way of ſome Courtiers, though it diſcourageth ſome
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:29485:101"/>
Competitors, yet it awakeneth Others.)</item>
                  <item>2. Timing of it, with an Eye to thoſe about us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>He would adviſe a Man to begin with a little and mean ſuit: For though (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves) <hi>iniquum petas &amp; aquum feras,</hi> is a good Rule, where a man hath ſtrength of favour; yet otherwiſe a man had better riſe in his ſuit: For he that would have ventured at firſt to have loſt his <hi>Suitor,</hi> will not in the concluſion loſe both the <hi>Suitor</hi> and his own former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>It's from him, while he lived, that we learned Celerity is the beſt Secreſie; Prudence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is the onely Fortune; Converſe is the great Education; Boldneſs a mans ſureſt Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; Good Nature is the eminent Nobility; and a well-weighed Honeſty the onely Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>
               <p>It's by him, when he died, we are taught that Moderation out-laſts Violence, Modeſty Ambition, a Publique Spirit a Private One: That to act alone may be as Profitable as Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but to joyn with others, moſt ſafe: That to ſtudy the nature of a Prince, may for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent advance; but to underſtand the Intereſt of his Kingdom, is always ſecure: The one way being as uncertain as the frail Perſon it depends upon, the other as ſure as the laſting State it ſerves.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>William Stamford</hi> was of <hi>Straffordian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; <hi>Robert</hi> his Grandfather living at <hi>Rowley</hi> in that County: but <hi>William</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> and purchaſed Lands at <hi>Hadley</hi> in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> where Sir <hi>William</hi> was born <hi>Auguſt</hi> 22. 1509. He was bred to the ſtudy of our Municipal Laws; attaining ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence therein, that he was preferred one of the Judges of the Common Pleas. His moſt learned Book of <hi>The Pleas of the Crown,</hi> hath made him for ever famous amongſt men of his own Profeſſion. There is a ſpirit of retraction of one to his Native County, which made him purchaſe Lands, and his ſon ſettle himſelf in <hi>Straffordſhire.</hi> This worthy Judge died <hi>Aug.</hi> 28. and was buried at <hi>Hadley</hi> in this Shire, in the laſt year of the reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> 1558.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> had a Judge that would give no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and King <hi>Henry</hi> had one that would take none. <q>There have been thoſe Lawyers that turned the point of Law upon the Law it ſelf; that wounded the Eagle with a feather from his own Wing, and ſtabbed the perſon of Princes with their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that dethroned Kings with a moot-point, and overthrowed a Government at a Reading.</q> This Judge underſtood, that as the Law is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the people, ſo Prerogative is the ſtrength of the Law; and that that is the beſt temper of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29485:102"/>
Government where Kings have ſo much power to do evil, that they may be able to do good.</p>
               <p>Miſerable experience hath taught us, that ſince power hath been wreſted from Princes, that neither they nor their people can be ſafe, if both be not in ſuch a way as the Law hath intruſted the publick ſafety and welfare; which conſiſts in a full power belonging to the King, to ſecure Liberties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Property, and protect their People in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the fruits of their induſtry, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of thoſe Laws to which themſelves have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. He ſets himſelf good Rules, as well to create good preſidents, as to follow them; reducing things to their firſt inſtitution, and obſerving wherein and how they have degenerated: yet ſtill taking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of both times; of the ancienter time, what is beſt; and of the latter, what is fitteſt. He made his courſe regular, that men might know what to expect; but not peremptory, that Knaves might not know how to impoſe upon him: always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf well, when he digreſſed from his Rule. Preſerve the right of his place he would, but not ſtir Queſtions of Juriſdictions; rather aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his right in ſilence, and <hi>de facto,</hi> then voice it with claims and challenges. He directed in moſt Affairs, but was buſie in none: none readier to give, none readier to take helps and advices. His ſpeech was more diſcreet then eloquent; rather particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſuitable to the preſent things and perſons, then generally orderly and artificial. He could ſpeak quick and deep too, never uſing many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, leſt he were tedious; ever ſome, leſt he were blunt: ſo warily did he deliver what he knew, that he was ſometimes thought to know what he did
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29485:102"/>
not. He knew what <hi>might</hi> be ſaid, ſo good his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and he knew what <hi>ſhould</hi> be thought, ſo great his judgement: commanding the diſcourſe where-ever he was, by that prudence that could bring it on and off; and that variety that happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled Arguments with Tales, Reaſons with Opinions, and earneſt with jeſt. His Decrees were the Hedges of Propriety, his Diſpatches cool, his Caſes rightly ſtated; his Reports ſavour of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Prudence, of Books and Men. How diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly would he moderate the rigorous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Petty and Poenal Laws! how exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the deſigne and drift of the more fundamental and reaſonable! Here no Intrigues to perplex, no Attendance to tire, no Hazards to diſcourage, no Checks or Delays to vex, no ſurreptitious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to ſurprize; no defeats of hopes, or falſeneſs of friends to diſappoint; no negligence of Agents, or intereſt of Parties to betray; no Oratory or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm to varniſh or hide a matter: all things clear as Juſtice, and ſmooth as Integrity.</p>
               <p>By diligence and moderation, with their gentle degrees and augmentations, and his own watchful obſervance, he climbed to Excellency. A man is neither good, nor rich, nor wiſe at once; it being a double work to be great: 1. To remove Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and accommodate Adverſaries: 2. To watch and aſſume the advantage. What is longeſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, is longeſt declining: the Roſe that buds one day, withereth the next: The Oak that is an Age a growing, is five ſtanding. He had thoſe lower Vertues that drew praiſe from the Vulgar, which he neglected, (knowing that they were more taken with appearances then realities) he had middle

that they admired, and good men obſerved; he had his higheſt Vertues, which they perceived, and great men honoured: In a word, a fragrant fume he had, that filled all round about, and would not eaſily away. Although he deſpiſed the Flatterer praiſe, as baſe; and avoided the Cunnings, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; yet he would ſay of a deſerved Fame, That being nothing, or but ayr at beſt, it doth all: for it's ſufficient to breed Opinion, and Opinion brings on ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>He obſerved of himſelf, that he came very hardly to little Riches, and very eaſily to great Riches: For when a mans Stock is come to that, as my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> obſerves, that he can expect the prime of the Markets, and overcome thoſe Bargains which for their greatneſs are few mens money, and be Partners in the Induſtries of younger men, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mainly increaſe with thoſe two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers of Gain, 1.

               <p>He hath left theſe two Principles behind him for <note place="margin">See Ep. ad Lect. Lees Plees des Coron.</note> thoſe of his own profeſſion:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That that they ſhould reduce every Statute to the Common Law and Cuſtome whereon it is grounded.</p>

               <p>Some Lawyers aſſert the Subjects Liberty, and retrench the Prerogative (as too much power to be truſted for a mortal man) within the known Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Law, that ſo Subjects may be at a certainty

               <p>Upon ſerious and ſolid Books he beſtowed a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reading; the one curſorily, by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the other exact, by way of digeſtion.</p>

               <p>And indeed, in ancient times, the Sergeants and <note place="margin">Vid. Cok. in Littl. Prefat.</note> Apprentices of Law did draw their own pleadings, which made them good Pleaders.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was Sergeant at Law to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.

He married <hi>Katharine</hi> Daughter of <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Chandois,</hi> but died without iſſue.</p>
               <p>A Lawyer, and a Lawyers ſon: yet one whoſe Zeal for the Religion of that time advanced, rather then his Law; to ſerve rather his Princes intereſt, then his Court: that being the happy, ſhall I ſay? or unhappy time when the Soveraign and the State did often conſult with Judges, and the Judges more often conſult with the Soveraign and State. Yet although a particular reſpect raiſed, a general fair carriage kept him up; He obſerved not onely things, but times; not onely times, but perſons: therefore when old Poenal Laws came before him, he confined them in the execution, that that which was made for <hi>terrour,</hi> ſhould not be for <hi>rigour;</hi> and the Inſtrument of Government ſhould not be the ſnare of the People. When Informers of that Court were too buſie, he checked them: when violent proſecution, cunning advantages, combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, power, or great counſel balanced an honeſt cauſe, he ſet all things <hi>even.</hi> His invention was

                  <hi>David Brookes</hi> motion, to part with the Church Profits. Patient and grave he was in hearing, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and weighty in ſpeaking: None would direct an Evidence more orderly, none moderated the length or impertinency of Pleaders more diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: None would recapitulate, ſelect, collate the material points of what had been ſaid, more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; none gave judgement more ſatisfactorily; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways commending a good Lawyer that miſcarried; a good way to uphold in the Client the reputation of his counſel, and beat down in him the conceit of his cauſe. He died with ſome projects in his breaſt for the Revenue, and ſome for the Law; whereof one was a compoſition for the Purveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and another a regulation of the Wards: both at that time thought, till regulated, as unprofitable for the Crown, as they ſeemed to be burthenſome to the ſubject. He had a cloſe way of diſcovering Concealments, as he had a ſevere one of puniſhing frauds. His word was, <hi>One Law executed, is worth twenty made.</hi> None more auſtere in caſe of others wrong, none more mild in that of his own; and he would ſay, <hi>What is done, is done.</hi> Weak men concern themſelves in what is paſt, while the wiſe take care of what is preſent and to come. <hi>If a man wrongeth me once, God forgive him,</hi> (ſaith the Italian:) <hi>if he wrongeth me the ſecond time, God forgive me.</hi> Others may be even with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in revenge, he would be above them in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.

               <p>Or, Laſtly, That there be no money lent out upon terms but to the State, which may make its advantage of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed, conſidering on the one hand that Uſury
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29485:113"/>
decayeth the Kings Cuſtome, bringeth money to few hands, damps Induſtry and Invention, beats down the price of the Land, and by eating up pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Eſtates breeds a publick Poverty: It were to be wiſhed it were forbidden.

               <p>He had the breeding of Courtiers ſo long, until he was one himſelf: At once reading <hi>Machiavel</hi> for my Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi>'s Inſtruction, and obſerving it for his own uſe. His Parents deſigned him for ſtudy, his Nature for buſineſs. His preſence aſſiſted his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and his complaiſance his preſence; and his good Nature, both: A good Nature that would have ſpoiled a Politician in any other but Doctor <hi>Wilſon,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom was the largeneſs of his Soul, not the narrowneſs of a ſhift. He had that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive and penetrating judgement, that he could at once ſhew the greateſt prudence in laying his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and the greateſt Integrity in managing it, as rather <hi>ſecurely knowing</hi> than <hi>warily cloſe.</hi> 
                  <q>But he that is onely real, had need have exceeding great Parts of Vertue; as the Stone had need be rich; that is ſet without foil: Therefore He was ſomething a Courtier: There are ſmall matters that win great commendation, becauſe they are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29485:114"/>
continually in uſe; whereas the occaſion of any great action cometh but on feſtivals, and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to attain ſo much ceremony and courtſhip not to deſpiſe it.</q> He had a way of conveying effectual and imprinting paſſions among comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuitable to perſons and buſineſs: He had his familiarity to Inferiours, that made him not cheap: his ſtate among Equals, that made him not envied: and his obſervance to Superiours, that made him no Flatterer: His Behaviour like a well-made ſuit, not too ſtreight, or <hi>point deviſe,</hi> but juſtly meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and free for exerciſe or motion. He had a ſlow but a ſure way to honour, which was nothing elſe in him but a diſcovery of his Vertues and Worth upon any occaſion without any diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>It was his Intereſt as well as his Gift, to be more learned then witty, more reverend then plauſible, more conſiderate then active. His thoughts were as his inclination, grave; his diſcourſe as his reading, ſubtle; his action as his Education, well weighed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as his temper, even and ſmooth as cuſtom, and reſolved as a habit gotten in that advancement of Vertue, A well-diſciplined Society; where Example teacheth, Company comforteth, Emulation quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, Glory raiſeth. None had a more skilful method to ſway Nature in others, none more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent minutes and ſeaſonable degrees to check it in himſelf: His Rule being, Never to practiſe any thing until perfect: for ſo he might exerciſe his weakneſs as well as his abilities, and induce one habit of both.</p>
               <p>Three things he aimed at:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The ſearch of Truth by Induſtry.</item>
                  <item>2. The attainment of it by Apprehenſion.</item>

                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:29485:114"/>
3. The enjoyment of it by Aſſent.</item>
               </list>
               <p>He is a happy man that is above the troubled and confuſed Regions of Opinions, Fancies, Prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in that clear and undiſturbed one of Truth and Reality: Though yet my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> obſerveth, That <hi>if there were taken out of mens mindes vain opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, flattering hope, falſe valuations and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as one would, and the like,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it would leave the mindes of a number of poor men poor ſhrunken things, full of melancholy and indiſpoſition, and unpleaſing to themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither took he greater pleaſure in knowing than in relating and doing what is true, ſound and plain, without thoſe crooked courſes that ſhew a creeping rather then a raiſed nature; and, as Mr. <hi>Mount aigne</hi> obſerves, is a bravery and facing of God, and a ſhrinking from and being coward before man.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, what all great men know, That he was ſix times a Slave:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To Himſelf and his Inclination, till he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Reaſon.</item>
                  <item>2. To the World and its Inſolence, till he had improved his Fortune.</item>
                  <item>3. To his Pupils and their Tempers, till he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their Genius.</item>
                  <item>4. To Fame and its Reports, till he was known in the World.</item>
                  <item>5. To his Soveraigns and their Humours, till he found their Intereſt. And</item>
                  <item>6. To his Buſineſs, till he had attained Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus it is with all Grandees, who exchange their power over themſelves for that over others, and with great pains come to greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:29485:115"/>
Two things he wiſhed when called to the world, Power and Reſolution. A <hi>naked</hi> Man is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, (for it's Power that begets Fear, it's Fear that makes Gods, and rules the world) an eaſie Man is uſeleſs: a facile-natured man may be a good Companion for a private perſon, but no Servant to a Prince: Remiſsneſs and Connivance are the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of unſetled Governments. The Game of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority will not admit of too open a play.</p>
               <p>In a word, he was one that knew the reſorts and falls of buſineſs, though he could not ſink into the main of a matter; being one that packed the Cards better then he played them.</p>
               <p>Three things compleated this Secretary:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Quick diſpatch and induſtry.</item>
                  <item>2. Conſtant intelligence and correſpondence.</item>
                  <item>3. A large and ſtrong memory.</item>

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29485:115"/>
or ſo order affairs in point of power, that you ſhall not need to fear or flatter any faction: for if ever you ſtand in need of them, or ſtand to their courteſie, you are undone.</hi>

               <p>His Place called upon him to ſuppreſs with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity ſuch ſeditious reflexions upon the State, as came to his knowledge: but his inclination was to diſſipate them with connivance and contempt. To be oppoſed, renders a Faction conſiderable; to he deſpiſed, (and watched) ridiculous: <hi>To go about to ſtop the firſt appearances of ſedition, is</hi> (ſaith my Lord <hi>Bacon) but to make a wonder long-lived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His knack was a politick and artificial nouriſhing and entertaining of hopes; and keeping men in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe is one of the beſt Antidotes againſt the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of diſcontent: it being obſerved by the foreſaid States-man, to be a certain ſigne of a wiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; Proceedings, to hold mens hearts by hopes, when it cannot by ſatisfaction; and when it can handle things in ſuch manner, as no evil ſhall appear ſo peremptory, but that it hath ſome out-let of hope: which is the eaſier done, becauſe both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons and factions are apt enough to fiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves, or at leaſt to boaſt what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</p>
               <p>In a word, although he made not ſo much noyſe as other men, yet he as effectually promoted the three main Supporters of this Nation, 1. Its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commodities, 2. Its Artificial Manufactures, 3. Its Vecture and Carriage; and ſo died with that content and reſolution, that they do who are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Fate in the purſuit of great Actions, and publick Deſignes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Portman</hi> Knight, was born of wealthy and worſhipful Extraction at <hi>Portman</hi>'s <hi>Orchard</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> a fair Mannor, which deſcended to him by inheritance, the Heir of the <hi>Orchard</hi> being match'd into his Family. He was bred in the ſtudy of the Common Law; attaining to ſuch eminency therein, that <hi>June</hi> 11. 2 of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> he was made Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, continuing two years in the place, and dying therein for ought I finde to the contrary; and a Baronet of his Name and Linage flouriſheth at this day with a great and plentiful Eſtate. No doubt but he died in his place, there being none of thoſe things that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſgrace and downfal with them, incident to him.</p>
               <p>For the firſt thing that ruines a Courtier, is a boaſting of his own ſervice; and then our Knight, <note place="margin">The things that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a Favourite.</note> none more modeſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is an undutiful obſervation of our Princes actions; and none more faithful and meek.</p>
               <p>The third, is the revealing or abuſing of ſecrets; and none more reſerved and civil.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing, is either provoking the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> or dividing them among <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> he was too wiſe for the one, his deſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather alliance then quarrel, to adde intereſt to his Eſtate, and honour to his Riches; and too quiet for the other. <hi>Many have an Opinion not wiſe,</hi> (ſaith that Oracle) <hi>that for a Prince to govern his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29485:116"/>
Eſtate, or for a great Perſon to guide his Proceedings, according to the reſpect of factions, is a principal part of policy: whereas contrarywiſe, the chiefeſt wiſdome is either in ordering thoſe things that are general, and wherein men of ſeveral factions do nevertheleſs agree; or in dealing with, or correſpondence to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons one by one. Mean men in their riſing muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here; but Great men that have ſtrength in themſelves, were better to maintain themſelves indifferent and neutral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth particular that pulleth down a man, is a miſunderſtanding of his own intereſt, or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Our Judge underſtood both, being equally made up of <note n="*" place="margin">The firſt of theſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the other his perſon.</note> 
                  <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Haepheſtion,</hi> faithfulneſs and compliance.</p>
               <p>The ſixth, is the hatred of the <hi>many,</hi> (whom this perſons integrity always obliged, there being no herd more feral then an enraged multitude) or the envy of the <hi>great,</hi> whom his warineſs diſobliged not; it being more fatal to incenſe a Favourite who <hi>would</hi> be above all affronts by his greatneſs, then a Prince who is ſo by Law.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh misfortune, is to be too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the ſecrets of Princes; wherewith Sir <hi>William</hi> never meddled without aſſiſtants, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without a Warrant.</p>
               <p>The eighth, is unſucceſsful Counſel; and our Knight went the ſafe and middle way, neither to be feared nor envied, which he was always preſent to ſecond, proſecute or correct, as he ſaw moſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>His ſharp and ſound judgement to diſtinguiſh Perſons, Affairs, and other Circumſtances, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly how to order the manner of his Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:29485:117"/>
was much; his well-weighed and wary, though quick apprehenſion and experience from Men and Books, more; his particular memory, and its minute obſervation for his conduct and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, moſt of all. His care of vain and idle Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions balanced his ſoul, his temper managed it: his love was choice and cautious; his hope moderate and knowing; his confidence ſlow, but certain; his deſires and joys allayed and checked, or quickened by the edge of his anger, or the caution of his fear; and all ſedate with his foreſight.</p>
               <p>Nature did this perſon ſome wrong in his Body, but made him amends in his Soul: the <hi>fails</hi> of the One, are <hi>foils</hi> to ſet off the Other: the firſt comes off with more Glory, by the pully and defect of the ſecond: Beſides that the unkindneſs of <hi>Nature</hi> puts men often upon being eminent in <hi>Art;</hi> that the happineſs of this, may divert men from obſerving the unhappineſs of that.</p>
               <p>But of all the Vertues his conſtant and growing Soul raiſed him to, this was one, That he durſt not entertain a Gift, which (as he ſaid) <hi>conquers both the fooliſh and the wiſe:</hi> which in publick places it is a Vice to accept, and not a Vertue to offer: It being a <hi>ſnare</hi> rather then a <hi>favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next was Diligence: Neglect waſtes a man as inſenſibly as Induſtry improves him: We need no more but ſit ſtill, and Diſeaſes will ariſe onely for want of exerciſe. Man's a Watch that muſt be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and wound up every day: the leaſt incuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſteals to improficiency or offence, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeingly weighs us down to extremity: Diligence alone is a fair Fortune, and Induſtry a good Eſtate.</p>

               <p>This Noble Perſon had his plainneſs from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his ingenuity from his Mother, his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by Travel and Navigation: his Blood endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to his Soveraign, and his Abilities advanced him to her ſervice: He promiſed no leſs to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, then his Father and Uncle had performed to her Father. The Anceſtors merit is ſecurity for Poſterities, who will hardly forfeit that favour with one act of their own unworthineſs, that was gained by ſo many of their Predeceſſors ſervice. Like a well-drawn picture this Lord had his eye on all round: on his Queen, to be faithful; on his Country, to be publick-ſpirited; on his Family, to be honourable; on the preſent Age, to be active; and on the future, to be renowned.</p>

                  </gap>noble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with action. The <hi>Alvaes</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> were for four Generations together Commanders by Land, and the <hi>Howards</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for as many, Admirals at Sea. None ever had <hi>more</hi> Power, none uſed <hi>leſs</hi> then he: The more Authority he had allowed him over others, the more Command he obtained over himſelf.</p>
               <p>Twice did he mortgage his Eſtate for his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Pay; many times did he venture his Life for their encouragement. None directed more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and yet none acted more reſolutely. Equally did he divide the profit, equally ſhare the honour with his followers, who under him never dared, and never feared a danger. Manners make a man, ſaith the Courtier; Money makes a man, ſaith the Citizen; Learning makes a man, ſaith the Scholar: but Conduct makes a man, ſaith the Souldier. This Lords ſpirit never put him on ſo forwardly, but his warineſs took care how to come off as ſafely. He that fights ſhould deſpair, but he that commands ſhould hope.

Young men in the manage of Affairs embrace more then they can hold, ſtir more then they can quiet, flee to the end without conſideration of the means and degrees; purſue ſome few principles, and extream remedies they have chanced upon raſhly, which they will neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs nor reform. Old men object too much, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult too long, adventure too little, repent too ſoon, and ſeldome purſue things home to their full peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. My Lord was an happy compoſition of both himſelf, and had of either about him, that the coldneſs and warineſs of Age might correct the heat of Youth, and the Activity of Younger might be directed by the Experience of Riper Ones: The one gave <hi>Authority,</hi> and the other <hi>Life</hi> to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

His Fortune made him a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Induſtry an Heir; coming to Court, where they that have Eſtates, ſpend them; and they that have none, gain them.

               <p>Rich he was for expence, and expend he did upon honour and good Action: his ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences were the third of his Eſtate, and his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary none of it; his Rule being, Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſadvantages muſt be balanced with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary advantages.

               <p>HIs favour was firſt purchaſed by his Fathers blood, and improved by his own cunning.

                  <hi>King, may advance his Poſterity.</hi> Something high he was in the Kings favour, becauſe ſtanding on his fathers Grave; but higher as he ſtood on his own Merit: He knew his Fathers ſervice made his way to favour; his own Education therefore muſt prepare him for employment. Favour without Parts is a reproach; Parts without favour are a burden. The King reſtored him to his Fathers blood, and his own induſtry recovered his Abilities. There are thoſe that under the notion of wiſdome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the greateſt folly, either in too much conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the world without, or in too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on themſelves within: Sir <hi>John</hi> was made up of both; ſome time he allowed for Action, more for Conſideration. <q>There is not any thing ſo prejudicial to Action, as to be bent upon Action without intermiſſion: for as the eye ſeeth not the Objects touching it, but thoſe onely more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; ſo the underſtanding continually plunged in Affairs, is not ſo quick-ſighted in occurrents, as his who ſometime retireth himſelf from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Action, beholding it aloof off by conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29485:128"/>
In the heat and tumult of Affairs, Reaſon hath not that power as may give conduct and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to active life: beſides, experience teacheth us, that the eye having loſt its quickneſs with too much looking upon the light, recovereth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the dark: the ſpirit in like manner dazled, weakened, tranſported and diſtracted among the multitude and variety of Affairs, ought to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and recover its force in the privacy of ſome ſmall retreat</q>; which Sir <hi>John</hi> made to <hi>Italy,</hi> the ſeat of policy and experience; whence I pray God he brought no more (ſaith my Author) then his <hi>cloſeneſs</hi> and <hi>reach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Soveraign ſaw he deſerved Honour, but ſaw not without offence to the Populacy how to confer it, until the ſubtle Youngſter ſhewed him a middle way, (upon the ſtrange death of the Viſcount <hi>Liſle,</hi> who loſt his life for joy that it was ſaved) by petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning for that honour as a favour, which upon his Mothers account was his <hi>right:</hi> The crafty Youth entered himſelf of the Cardinals Retinue firſt, and then of the Kings. Much was he employed by him at Sea, as an Overſeer of the Navy; more in the Field, as Director-General; moſt of all in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and French Court, as a Spy. He was too good a Proficient in his School to fall with him, therefore we immediately obſerve him riſing with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> until the King made him <hi>Admiral,</hi> and he with his 200 ſayl upon the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> made himſelf <hi>renowned;</hi> inſomuch that the King left him the next year Viceroy of <hi>France,</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of <hi>Calice</hi> and <hi>Bulloign:</hi> where to revenge the French attempts upon the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> he drew his Fleet up to the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy,</hi> landed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29485:128"/>
6000 men at <hi>Treport,</hi> burned the Suburbs of that Town with the Abby, deſtroyed 30 Ships there in the Haven, and then returned, not having loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fourteen perſons in the whole Voyage: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in a Treaty between <hi>Ard</hi> and <hi>Guiſnes,</hi> wherein he was Commiſſioner with the Earl of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Secretary <hi>Paget,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> the French were contented that we held <hi>Bulloign</hi> till they paid us 800000 Crowns within the term of eight years. For the further Eſtabliſhment whereof, he and the Biſhop of <hi>Dureſm</hi> are employed to take Oath of the French King and the <hi>Daulphine.</hi> His Maſter <hi>Henry</hi> dieth, but not his deſigne with him: <hi>Norfolk</hi> is out of his way; <hi>Seymour</hi> will be ſo: he is now Executor of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Will, he will be of his own. But as Nature, ſo Policy works by degrees; firſt the graft, then the tree; after that, the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: next that, the fruit: firſt meaner Eſſays, and then higher Actions. There was nothing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted at home, until we were ſecured and feared from abroad; he therefore leads the Vantguard a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo ſucceſsfully, that he is made Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Here his ſpirit had enſnared him, had not his conduct brought him off. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector refuſed a Combat as not becoming him, <hi>Warwick</hi> offereth one: <hi>Bring me word</hi> (ſaid he to the Herald that brought the Protector a Challenge from the Lord <hi>Huntley) that thy Maſter will perform the Combat with me, and thou ſhalt have an hundred Crowns for thy pains.</hi> But a publick Conduct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a General better then perſonal Valour; and he muſt ſo far onely remember he is a Souldier, as not to forget he is a Commander, and ſo a whole Army too.</p>

               <p>Againſt the French, that took the opportunity of thoſe Turmoyls, he was ſo proſperous, that he ſent them home from <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey</hi> with the loſs of two thouſand men.</p>
               <p>Honour he had enough, and Power too, yet not what he aimed at; (our Souls are infinite as in their duration, ſo in their capacity.) Ambition is like choler, which is an humour that maketh men active, earneſt, full of alacrity and ſtirring, if it be not ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; but if it be ſtopped, and cannot have its way, it becometh aduſt, and thereby malign and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: So aſpiring men, if progreſſive and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (their paſſage to advancement being clear) are rather active then perilous; but if curbed with ſome obſtructions, their ſecret diſcontent caſts an evil aſpect upon all perſons and actions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes rather dangerous than ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>This great Earl's greater minde was uſeful, when proſperous abroad; but at home troubleſome, when finding a plain man in his way to height, great in his power, greater in his Soveraigns affections, and greateſt of all in his knowing Brother; whoſe <hi>Spirit</hi> bare up his Authority, as his Authority ſupported <hi>His</hi> Courage: In that <note n="6" place="margin">

Intereſt and Blood united theſe Brothers ſo ſtrongly, that there was no dividing of them, but by practiſing on their Wives, whoſe Humours were above their Intereſt, and Fancy above their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Their precedence is made a queſtion at Court, where it bred firſt a diſtance, and upon an Interview contrived in this Lords houſe, a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; that difference is improved to an animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (he can do little that cannot blow up a ſpark in a Womans Breſt to a flame) that animoſity to malice, and malice cannot dwell long in thoſe weaker breſts without a miſchief; miſchief they cannot do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: (The Ivy cleaves to the Oak, and theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to their Husbands, though both ruine the things they cling to:) What ſuggeſtions!

               <p>There is not a more admirable Wiſdom direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrarieties of Nature to an Harmony, than there is a cloſe reach in ſome men to reconcile varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Humours, Affections, Oppoſitions, Rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Events and Changes to one Deſign. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors eaſineſs is betrayed to confidence; his too late fears, to a confidence at firſt, and at laſt to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities: the hopes of ſome were encouraged; the grievances of others were aggravated and pitied; the envy of a third part was excited; and He the

ſoul in all and every part of the action. <q>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was free ſpirited, open-hearted, humble, hard to diſtruſt, eaſie to forgive: The Earl was proud, ſubtle, cloſe, cruel and implacable; and therefore it was <hi>impar congreſſus</hi> between them, almoſt with as much diſadvantage as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a naked and an armed perſon.</q> Two nets are laid to take the Protector; the one breaks, the other holds: The Treaſon was onely to give a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the Felony for deſigning the death of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> a Privy Counſellour, did the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He being removed out of the way, this Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> as his Predeceſſor, meditates the honour of King-making. To this purpoſe he joyns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by alliance to the beſt Families, and advanceth his children by employments to the greateſt truſts; particularly (what Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> ſaith had been better if it had never been) his Son <hi>Robert</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Earl of <hi>Leiceſter)</hi> was ſworn one of the ſix or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gentlemen of the Kings Chamber: upon which particular the foreſaid Hiſtorian obſerveth, <q>That after his coming into a place ſo near him, the King enjoyed his health but a while.</q> The Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> is trained by his enemies to ſuch fears and jealouſies, as tranſport him beyond his own good nature, to an attempt one morning upon the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> abed; where being received with much kindneſs, his heart relented, and he came off <hi>re infecta.</hi> At his coming out, one of his company asked him if he had done the deed? he anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Then ſaid he, <hi>You are your ſelf undone.</hi> And indeed it ſo fell out: for when all other Accuſations were refelled, this

               <p>This, notwithſtanding many Divertiſements u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, went ſo near the conſumptive Kings heart, that he prepares for death. The Duke now within ken of his deſigne, conſidering the Kings affection for Reformation, the Lords and other Purchaſers kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Church-lands, the Judges fear, the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers compliance, carried on a Will with a high hand, (trembling with anger, ſaith Judge <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> if any oppoſed him; yea, ſaying, <hi>That he would fight in his Shirt with any that contradicted it)</hi> wherein the Crown was beſtowed on <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> his fourth Sons Wife, (the Princeſſes <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> being laid aſide.) But he forgot (as what man, though never ſo reaching, can conſider all things?) that there is an inviſible Power in <hi>Right,</hi> that there is a natural Antipathy in Engliſh men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uſurpation, and as great an inclination for the ſucceſſion: <q>A Point they had conned ſo well of late out of the Statute made for that purpoſe, that they could not well be put out of it by this new-ſtarted Deſigne.</q> The People ſtand by Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> the Council notwithſtanding their Engagement to ſtand by him at his going away, (when he obſerved in <hi>Shore-ditch</hi> that the People gazed on him, but bid him not <hi>God ſpeed;</hi> and he

               <p>For upon <hi>Paul</hi> the Third's death, the Cardinals being divided about the Election, the Imperial part, which was the greateſt, gave their voice for Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Pool;</hi> which being told him, he diſabled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and wiſhed them to chuſe one that might be moſt for the glory of God, and good of the Church.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Queen bare the Cardinal an unfeigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for ſix reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For his grave and becoming preſence, that endeared him no leſs to thoſe that ſaw him, then his parts and prudence did to thoſe that converſed with him: The Diamond is then orient, when ſet in Gold.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For his diſpoſition, as calm as her Majeſties, and as meek as his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:29485:137"/>
3. For his Age: being about ten years older, the proportion allowed by the Philoſopher between Husband and Wife.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For Alliance: ſhe being daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and he Grandchild to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For his Education with Her, under his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For his Religion, for which he was an Exile, as ſhe was a Priſoner, and both Confeſſors.</p>
               <p>But now when the marriage with Prince <hi>Philip</hi> was conſummated, <hi>Pool</hi> at laſt got leave for <hi>England;</hi> and to wipe away all ſuſpition of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> wherewith he was formerly taxed, he became a <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> that he might be believed a <hi>cordial</hi> Papiſt: <q>For <note place="margin">Full. Hiſt. Cent. 16. p. 14.</note> meeting in <hi>Brabant</hi> with <hi>Emanuel Tremelius,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting ſome favour from him, he not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him relief, but returned him rayling terms; though formerly he was not onely his very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friend, but his God-father too, when of a Jew he turned Chriſtian. Arrived in <hi>England,</hi> (as the Hiſtorian goeth on) he was firſt ordained Prieſt, being but Deacon before, and then conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, at <hi>Bow;</hi> where rich in coſtly Robes, and ſitting on a guilded Throne, his Pall was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him: Adorned, he preſently mounts the Pulpit, and makes a <hi>dry Sermon</hi> of the uſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Pall, without either Language or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; all admiring the jejuneſs of his Diſcourſe, as if putting off his Parts, when putting on his Pall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He made the breach formerly between <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:29485:137"/>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> by exaſperating both ſides: he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles it, obliging many by his carriage, awing as many by his preſence, dazling all by his pomp and ſplendour. Now he confirmeth the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Clergy-men into their Benefices; he legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth the Children of forbidden marriages; he ratifieth the Proceſſes and Sentences in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; and his Diſpenſations were confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Two things he was intent upon:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church-Priviledges; whereof one he procured was, That the Clergy ſhould not ſhew their Horſes with the Layty, but under Captains of their own chuſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, who was as intent upon the <hi>French,</hi> and looked upon the Legate as the principal Promoter of the laſt War in <hi>France,</hi> ſends Cardinal <hi>Peito</hi> to eaſe him of his Legantine Power in <hi>England.</hi> But the Queen ſo ordered the matter, that by her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative ſhe prohibited <hi>Peito</hi> entrance into <hi>England,</hi> and got the foreſaid Power eſtabliſhed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> as ſhe did likewiſe 1000 <hi>l.</hi> 2 year for his better ſupport out of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The more he lived in <hi>England,</hi> the more he was Italianized; converſing with their Merchants, and practiſing their thrift; his Pomp being (ſaith my Author) rather gaudy then coſtly, and his attendance more ceremonious then expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Fearful he was of a Bank here, (if Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died) careful of one beyond Sea if he lived: therefore as he ſends all his Eſtate to <hi>Italy</hi> by his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will when he died, ſo he did moſt of it by Bills of Exchange while he lived: the firſt was judged his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Policy, (the heart whereof is prevention) the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his Gratitude, beſtowing his Superfluities on them who had relieved his Neceſſities. Of all his Eſtate, <hi>Aloiſius Priol</hi> took but the Breviary he had always in his Pocket, ſo devout he was! and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary he had always in his Cloſet, ſo exact he was to obſerve what was done by others, and recollect what had eſcaped himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Die he did not of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Phyſick wilfully taken by himſelf, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſuggeſts; nor of Engliſh Poyſon, given him by the Proteſtants, as <hi>Oſorius</hi> affirms; but of a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Ague, then Epidemical in <hi>England,</hi> and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant above the ordinary nature of that Diſeaſe. This man was a Catholick in his Intereſt and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Proteſtant in his Conſcience. <hi>We cannot</hi> (was his ſaying) <hi>give too much to Gods grace, nor too little to our own merits.</hi> He ſaid when he came to <hi>England, I came hither not to condemn, but reconcile; not to compel, but deſire.</hi> He would burn the Aſhes of one or two Proteſtants when dead, to avoid the ſuſpition of Hereſie; but the Bodies of none when alive, to contract the real guilt of Cruelty.

               <p>HIs Name and his Valour is as ancient as the Conqueſt; Vertue flowing in every Age of that Family with its Honour and Worth, keeping pace with their Advancements. In every man that we meet with, there are three things that immediately offer themſelves to our Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Mind.</item>
                  <item>2. The Behaviour. And</item>
                  <item>3. The Perſon.</item>
               </list>
               <p>His Mind was befriended by Nature with a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a capaciouſneſs, helped by publick Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſolidity and ſtayedneſs; improved in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with Obſervation, and raiſed by the ſlow, but happy degrees of his Preferments to Skill and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. <hi>They had need be ſlow and wary in that place where there is no failing the ſecond time, the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:29485:139"/>
firſt errour being irremediable:</hi> therefore well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Policy imitateth Nature, which worketh ſlowly, and ſtep by ſtep, cauſing the Blade to come from the Grain, the Tree from the Graft, the Bloſſom from the Tree, and Fruit from the Bloſſom: ſo (ſaith my Author) ought Policy to raiſe great perſons from one degree to another; to the end, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made their Eſſays in meaner matters, they may finiſh their Maſter-pieces in more eminent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. 2. He that demeans himſelf well, is ever uſhered in by a friend that recommends him to the company that knew him not.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> had a <hi>moving</hi> beauty that waited on his whole Body, as that ſtanding one doth upon the Face and Complexion: Such a grace and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs waited on his Noble Meen, as exacted a liking, if not a love from all that beheld him.</p>
               <p>A midling Clarity and quickneſs is beſt in Wine, that is, neither too thick upon the Lees, nor yet too quick: our Knights comportment and carriage was neither dull nor vapouring, neither groſs nor affected, but of a becoming temper, at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Clown and the Pedant, what's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and what's invidious. 3. But both theſe were ſet off with his Perſon, of a middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither tall to a formidableneſs, nor ſhort to a contempt: ſtraight and proportioned, vigorous and active, with that pure blood and ſpirits that flowed and flowred within his ſwelling Veins, and diſpoſed him to thoſe natural and innocent, thoſe manly and noble Exerciſes of Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, I ſay, which he was not exquiſite in, for that is vanity; nor ignorant of, for that's meanneſs: but a graceful exerciſe, (wherein he was careleſly eaſie,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:29485:139"/>
as if it were rather natural motion, then curious and artificial practiſing) which endeared his ſeverer Vertues to that place where the worth that riſeth muſt be complaiſant and pleaſing, as well as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful. But the favour which proceeds from perſonal grace and comelineſs, although it ſeem to be doubly united, yet it is that which is ſooneſt diſſolved and diſſipated, there being nothing ſo inconſtant as mens humours, which not onely change through Ages, but alſo by ſome ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or accident which may ariſe: Sir <hi>John</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought himſelf into Court by what humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but kept himſelf in there by thoſe things that did oblige him; and ſtood not upon his Majeſties pleaſure, but his Intereſt; adding to his more aiery Courtſhips, more ſolid Employments. From the ſofter Court therefore we muſt follow him to the Camp, and that before <hi>Terwyn,</hi> where we finde him daring and active: 1. In skirmiſhing the French every day; 2. In recovering the red Gun over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in a Lane from 10000 French, under the Earl St. <hi>Paul</hi> as General, with 250 reſolute Reformades under himſelf but Captain; although he was once taken Priſoner, as before <hi>Calice,</hi> where he redeemed himſelf from the Officer that had taken him for 250 Crowns, on condition he would conduct him ſafe from the French Quarter, as the man did, until they were gone ſo far, that Sir <hi>John</hi> takes him Priſoner, compelling him to the Reimburſement of his money, with 200 Crowns more, to be beſtowed on the Common Souldiers. As ſeverely active was he at the ſiege of <hi>Tournay,</hi> as the oldeſt Souldier; and yet as innocently plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant at the Mask there, as the youngeſt Courtier.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:29485:140"/>
One of the ſixty he was that went with the King to cut off the Paſſage between that City and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and one of the eleven that went with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to entertain the Ladies at <hi>Liſle.</hi> From ſerving one King in <hi>France,</hi> he had the honour as it was thought to kill another in <hi>England,</hi> (I mean <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Scotland)</hi> and challenge a third in <hi>Paris.</hi> The ſame thing raiſed him, that advanced <hi>Wolſey:</hi> for he being ſent to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> (after Treaſurer <hi>Napbant</hi> had brought him to Court) diſpatched his buſineſs ſo ſoon, that the King chid him for not being gone, when he was returned; and withal asked him, Whether he had ſeen the Poſt that he had ſent after him about a circumſtance that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped him? He anſwered, He met him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but he had preſumed to adde that particular of his his own head, for which he asked his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties pardon, and had his favour too for the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and the Almonerſhip. Sir <hi>John</hi> was commanded with 1500 men to cut off the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to <hi>Terwyn:</hi> which he performed with that ſpeed and ſucceſs, that when the King ſaw him, he ſaid, <hi>I, I, Sir</hi> John, <hi>while we are fooling, the Town is relieved. So it is indeed,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for I have ſent them 2000 Carcaſes, and they have ſpared me 1200 Wagons of Proviſion. I but,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>I ſent after you to cut off the Bridge</hi> Dreban. <hi>That,</hi> replyed the Knight, <hi>was the firſt thing I did: wherefore I am upon my knees for your Majeſties grace and pardon. Nay then,</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>by Lady, thou haſt not my pardon, but my favour too.</hi> 
                  <q>He is the man for a Princes ſervice, whoſe minde is preſent, and prudence is ready to meet with ſuddain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and accommodate unexpected emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</q>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:29485:140"/>
The firſt effect of that favour, was his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination for one of the ſixteen that anſwered the French Challenge at the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s Marriage, at <hi>Paris, November</hi> 7, 1513. which ſhewed his man-hood, and how valiant he was. The ſecond was, that he was one of the Forty five that were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Majeſty at the inſtant of his Interview with the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Guiſnes;</hi> which was an Argument of his preſence, and how goodly a man he was. The third was, that he was one of the Twenty two that with the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, and Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams</hi> Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, propoſed that ſecret, and therefore ſucceſsful Deſigne upon <hi>Britain,</hi> under pretence of <hi>Scowring the Narrow Seas,</hi> (for now he is as good in the Sea as he had been in the Field) for which he and eight more of his fellow-Captains, Sir <hi>Joh. Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, &amp;c.</hi> are Knighted by the aforeſaid Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral: which ſpeaks him a Sea-man, and indeed one of a general capacity. The fourth was, the great Truſt his Majeſty repoſed in him, when he was ſent in diſguiſe to widen the difference that was newly broken out between the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the High Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King; which he managed ſo well, that the diſcontented Duke declares for the Emperour and the King of <hi>England;</hi> to the great encouragement of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, the ſatisfaction of his Majeſty, and the ſucceſs of his Deſigne upon <hi>Anchor, Boungard, Bray,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, where Sir <hi>John</hi> ſhewed himſelf as active now, as he was before cunning; as much ſurpaſſing the French Spirit in action, as he had over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Prudence in Negotiation.</p>
               <p>But in vain was it to ſerve that King, unleſs a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:29485:141"/>
man obliged the Cardinal, (he that courts the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> muſt not neglect her little Saints) him he attended in his ſecond Journey to <hi>France,</hi> firſt to honour, and then to ſerve him. And now after his deceaſe, when King <hi>Henry</hi> had done the work of mercy (which was moſt proper for himſelf, as being moſt popular) upon the <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> Rebels, he deputed the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Indeed Courts being thoſe Epitomes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through ſtrangers look into Kingdomes, ſhould be Royally ſet off as with Utenſils, ſo with attendance, that might poſſeſs all Comers with reverence there, and fear elſewhere.</p>
               <p>His Perſon graced his Imployment, and therefore his Majeſty honoured his Perſon with the Order of the Garter, and the Title of Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> and that his Preferment might keep pace with his Honour, he is made Lord Privy Seal, and his Nephew Sir <hi>John Gage</hi> Controller.

In the Kings laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was the fifth perſon, and in his Sons Council the fifth; to whom he diſcovered a French Plot the <hi>firſt</hi> year of his Raign, and for whom he broke the <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Rebels, what with delays, what with ſtratagems, to divide them according to their ſeveral Inclinations, the <hi>ſecond,</hi> for which ſervice he was made Earl of <hi>Bedford:</hi> The <hi>third,</hi> in the Faction at home between the <hi>Seymours</hi> and the <hi>Dudleys,</hi> he was Neuter: in the Treaties abroad between the French King and his Majeſty of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was Principal; where he obſerved three Rules: 1.

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> aimed at the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> to divert him and ſecure <hi>Scotland,</hi> deſign'd him for the Queen of <hi>Scots;</hi> whom he watched for two things: 1. That ſhe ſhould either match with an Engliſh Subject, or 2. With a ſoft and weak Forreigner; that either the Scots might be in league with us, or have no peace at home.</p>
               <p>His laſt ſervice I finde is a complement, when he was ſent by the Queen as her Deputy, with a font of maſſie Gold worth 1043 <hi>l.</hi> to hold King <hi>James</hi> at his Baptiſm; with expreſs command not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Lord <hi>Darley</hi> as King.

               </p>
               <p>There are three kindes of Underſtanding: The one, that is adviſed by its ſelf; the ſecond, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth when it is informed by another; the third, that neither is adviſed by its ſelf, nor by the aſſiſtance of another. If this Doctor failed in the firſt, and his own invention, he exceeded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of making uſe of others; for he was one of them that never heard or read what was not his own. His Profeſſion was the Civil Law, that guideth forreign Negotiations: His Inclination was that general Policy that manageth them.</p>
               <p>His Eminencies were three:</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Reſervedneſs: Whereby he never did what he aimed at, never aimed at what he intended, never intended what he ſaid, and never ſaid what he thought; whereby he carried it ſo, that others ſhould do his buſineſs, when they oppoſed it; and he ſhould undermine theirs, when he ſeemed to promote it. A man that was to be traced like the Fox, and read like Hebrew, backward: If you would know what he did, you muſt obſerve what he did not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Boldneſs. Authority ſometimes meets
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:29485:143"/>
with thoſe impediments, which neither power can overcome, nor good fortune divert, if Courage and Fortitude break not through and ſurmount them; and the motions of the iraſcible faculties, ſuch as Hope, Boldneſs and Choler, being well ordered, and conducted by Reaſon, engage thoſe difficulties ſhe encountereth in the execution of her deſigns: Reaſon diſcovered him his enterprizes, his Will enclined him to them, and the noble tranſports of his regular paſſions ſet out both with that ardour and vehemencie, as bear down obſtacles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the deſign: A hope he had, that never raſhly engaged him in deſperate undertakings; an audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that precipitated him not weakly into impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and a choler that led him not blindly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruines: Conſideration managing the firſt, Diſcretion and Foreſight the ſecond, and Reaſon the third. What doth it avail a man to be wiſe, in knowing what is fit to be done; prudent, to invent means; juſt, to appropriate affairs to publick good; authorized and happy, to cauſe them to ſucceed; if a Courage, guided by Reaſon, accompanied with Prudence, ruled by Diſcretion, animated by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Boldneſs, be not diligent, quick and prompt for Execution? His Nature was generous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: His Education (like that of the Roman Youth among Stateſmen) manifold and ſolid: His Soul was free, and diſ-engaged from any particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eloquence: That added to his Parts what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours do to a Picture; ſtate, grace and light: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the Ornament of a Man, Speech the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Reaſon, and Elequence the grace of Speech; wherein the Orator excelleth other men, as much
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:29485:144"/>
as they do other creatures. His Wiſdom adviſed his Prudence contrived, his Courage reſolved, and his Eloquence perſwaded; adding at once grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to his Deſigns, and vigour to his Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; as that wherewith he could ſatisfie mens Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and maſter their Paſſions, by which he carried them whither he pleaſed: His lively Expreſſion animates his Reaſon, his Eloquence his Expreſſion, and his Geſture his Eloquence; whereby he charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Senſes, mollified Hearts, incited Affections, framed Deſires, checked Hopes, and exerciſed a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Empire over every man he dealt with.</p>
               <p>Theſe qualities improved with Travel, raiſed the Doctor to be the Chancellour's Secretary, and the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>HIs Family had not endeared its ſelf to the antient Kings by its ſervice, nor his Grand-father himſelf to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh by his Relation, more then <hi>He</hi> did <hi>Himſelf</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth by his Merit. He was a great Pattern of antient Vertue, that in the greateſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enjoyed the leaſt Liberty: Vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: One whoſe Power was attended with Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>(there was an Eye in the ancient Scepters)</hi> and his Sollicitude with Temperance; (he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands himſelf, commands the World too.) While ſome mens imprudent integrity can do no harm, and others baſe cunning can do no good; Sir <hi>William's</hi> Prudence and Integrity was equally able for both, as there was occaſion. Very cloſe and ſucceſsful were his and my Lord <hi>Sheffield's</hi> Negotiations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: Very reſolute and manly his Conduct at home. He was one of the twenty four Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth while he lived, and one of the ſixteen Executors of his Will when he died. All great Undertakers muſt avoid ſoftneſs and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacie, the bane of great Natures and Actions: For where there is love and pleaſure, there is fear; and where there is fear, there is that which enchains Generoſity and confines Courage.</p>
               <p>He had his double Diary; the firſt for Actions, the ſecond for Obſervations upon them: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his and Sir <hi>William Kingſton's</hi> Manuſcripts
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:29485:146"/>
give a great light to the Hiſtory of thoſe times: In which Diary we finde what actions he did againſt the Scots by conſtant alarms with three thouſand <hi>Welch,</hi> and what againſt <hi>Ket's</hi> Rebels by notable ſtratagems with two thouſand. The man is compleat that hath a Head and a Heart.</p>
               <p>As to the Faction in King <hi>Edward's</hi> time, he would not concern himſelf, looking on accuſations in a Commonwealth as great advantages to check am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and vent diſcontent; that the one may not aſpire too dangerouſly, nor the other break out too irregularly. And as little concern'd was he in King <hi>Edward's</hi> Will; his buſineſs being rather obeying the Soveraign <hi>that was,</hi> then determining who <hi>ſhould be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a throughly adviſed man: one that gazed not on the iſſues, but enquired into the reaſons and ſprings of Actions.</p>
               <p>Very uſeful he was in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Council, and no leſs in King <hi>philip's</hi> War; where he got St. <hi>Quintin</hi> for him, and a laſting Renown for himſelf: who died in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, and left this plain Character behinde, <hi>That he was a noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, of a truſty, a free and an open Nature.</hi>

               <p>IJoyn them both in my Obſervations, becauſe they agreed both in their diſpoſitions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Both Nobly Religious, and ſo bleſſed themſelves, and being a bleſſing unto others: Their

Religion was attended with Magnanimity, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Wiſdom, Prudence, Valour and Counſel, as the Products of it; and with Succeſs as the Iſſue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Both famous and renowned; having Honour, as the ſhadow doth the Sun, going before them in their younger years, to make their way to action; keeping even with them in their middle age, to countenance and credit their proceedings; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them in old Age to eternize and embalm them: Both making their way to Honour as <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus</hi> in <hi>Strabo,</hi> by ſaying what was well, and doing what was better; or with <hi>Socrates,</hi> by being what they appeared, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more then they were: (Vertue, though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, may ſatisfie me; it muſt be renowned, or it cannot ſerve others:) But action is the life of things, and good diſpoſitions are rather a mans Inclinations than his Vertue. Both therefore were in their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage regular, in their Conduct obſervant, in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes obliging, in their Paſſions even, in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments ſevere, and in their Services equal.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Mannors</hi> firſt weakened the <note n="*" place="margin">In King <hi>H.</hi> 8's time, when they riſe againſt the Reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Rebels, by ſuch diſcreet Propoſitions as met with many of their Humours and Intereſts, and then reſolved to engage them, but that the little Brook <hi>Dun</hi> ſwelled miraculouſly to a River, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Armies: And at the ſame time Sir <hi>Ralph Euers</hi> held <hi>Scarborough-</hi>Caſtle, where he had no Souldiers but his own Servants, nor any ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for twenty days, but bread and water. For this ſervice he is made Lord Warden of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> is Lord Governour of the North.</p>
               <p>Both did his Majeſty as much ſervice in Peace for

               <p>HE was one of the greateſt Courtiers at Masks and Revels, one of the beſt Captains at Sea, and one of the moſt valiant and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commanders by Land. None more pleaſing to the Engliſh Ladies, none more terrible to the French King. Cunningly did he diſcover the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Deſigne upon <hi>Navarre</hi> to his Majeſty, by pretending a Revolt to that King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and as cunningly did he draw the French Troops into a ſnare, by counterfeiting a retreat towards <hi>Britany.</hi> His Advice had ſaved the Admiral at <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and his Foreſight did reſcue Sir <hi>Edward Belknap</hi> near <hi>Guiſnes.</hi> He was Knighted for his Service at <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> and made Marſhal for his Succeſs at <hi>Flodden.</hi> He was one of them that perſwaded the City to its duty at <note n="*" place="margin">When the riſing was there.</note>

(You muſt let a Prince be a Prince in every thing.)

Sir <hi>Thomas Mannors</hi> the firſt Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> of that Name diſcovered, and Sir <hi>William Kingſton</hi> told his Majeſty the Cardinals Plots againſt the Kings Marriage with Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and his Deſigne to marry him to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Alanzon:</hi> A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, that becauſe it ſeemed to over-reach his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in cunning, and really did croſs his Inclination in malice, that incenſed his Majeſty to a paſſion which could be appeaſed with no leſs a ſacrifice then the Cardinals fall: in order to which, the next ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this Knight, is as Lieutenant of the Tower to take him to cuſtody: which he did at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with a Noble reſolution, conſidering that mans greatneſs, with a due reverence regarding his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and with a tender compaſſion reſpecting his condition; perſwading him gently of the Kings <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> at that very time when he was come to be an Inſtrument of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And what he did to a Cardinal now, he did to Queens afterwards: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Prince commanding higher ſervices then King <hi>Henry,</hi> nor ſubjects diſcharging them more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly then Sir <hi>William:</hi> becauſe therefore he was ſo ſevere a Lieutenant in the Tower, he is made a Provoſt-Marſhal in the Field; in which capacity, after the <hi>Devonſhire-</hi>Rebels defeat, we have theſe two remarkable ſtories of him.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

in the Town, and therefore he muſt ſet up two Gallows. The Mayor did ſo. After Dinner Sir <hi>William Kingſton</hi> thanks him for his Entertainment, and then deſires him to bring him to the Gallows: where when they were come, Sir <hi>William</hi> asked him, Whether they were ſtrong enough? <hi>I, I'll warrant thee,</hi> ſaith the Mayor. <hi>Then,</hi> ſaith Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, get you up upon them.

               <p>THree things advanced men in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days: 1. Their Extraction: 2. Their Wit: 3. Their Comelineſs and Strength. For the Firſt, his Name was up ſince <hi>Battle-Abbey-Roll;</hi> as to the ſecond, it was enough that he travelled with <hi>Wolſey:</hi> and touching the third, there need be no other inſtance then that at <hi>Paris,</hi> where upon the <hi>Daulphin</hi>'s Proclamation of ſolemn Juſts, the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Nevil</hi> and He, anſwered the Challenge; as not long after he encountered King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where he had the great Honour of a ſtrong and valiant Knight, and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of being overthrown by his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Having engaged his Majeſties Perſon at home, he had the Honour to repreſent it abroad; where his Commiſſion was to complement the French King about his Liberty, but his Buſineſs to obſerve the ſtate of that place: Where he ſaw that a Kingdom governed by a Prince who hath under him other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Lords, as that of <hi>France,</hi> is no longer ſafe, than thoſe Lords are either in Humour, or in Purſe; being always in danger either from their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content or corruption: 2. That Faction is always eager, while Duty is modeſt and temperate.</p>
               <p>This Occaſion ennobled his Vertue, and his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue improved the Occaſion ſo well, that I finde him ſo eminent a Parliament-man the 22th of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:29485:151"/>

And at Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Coronation my Lord <hi>Vaux,</hi> Sir <hi>John Mordant,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ten more, are made Knights of the Bath.</p>
               <p>Having acquitted himſelf Nobly in Court and Council, he attends the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> againſt the Scots, as Commiſſary; and Sir <hi>John Wallop</hi> with Sir <hi>John Rainsford,</hi> as Marſhal: for his Services in both which capacities, he is made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in <hi>England;</hi> and with the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Sir <hi>John Gage,</hi> made Field-Marſhal, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the Army before <hi>Bulloign:</hi> And not long after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Treaſurer of the Houſhold, and one of the Aſſiſtants for the Over-ſeeing of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Will.</p>
               <p>When ſome were joyning Others with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, others for limiting him, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> would ſay, That (as <hi>Machiavel</hi> ſaith, <hi>No Laws,</hi> ſo) <hi>No good could be done by a Governour that was not abſolute, without either a Reſtraint or a Competitor.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> a man full of wit and wiſdome, was a Gentleman, and a man of Law, and of great knowledge therein; whereby, together with his other parts of Learning and Dexterity, he was prompted to be Keeper of the Great Seal; and being kin to the Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> was brought by his help in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queens favour.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman underſtood his Miſtreſs well, and the times better: He could raiſe Factions to ſerve the one, and allay them to ſuit the others. He had the deepeſt reach into Affairs of any man
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:29485:153"/>
that was at the Council-table: the knottieſt Head to pierce into difficulties: the moſt comprehenſive Judgement to ſurround the Merit of a Cauſe: the ſtrongeſt memory to recollect all circumſtances of a Buſineſs to one View: the greateſt patience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and conſider; (for it was he that firſt ſaid, <hi>Let us ſtay a little, and we will have done the ſooner:)</hi> and the cleareſt reaſon to urge any thing that came in his way in Court or Chancery. His favour was eminent with his Miſtreſs, and his Alliance ſtrong with her States-men. No man ſerved his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign more faithfully, none ſecured himſelf more wiſely. <hi>Leiceſter</hi> ſeemed wiſer then he was, <hi>Bacon</hi> was wiſer then he ſeemed to be; <hi>Hunſdon</hi> neither <hi>was</hi> nor <hi>ſeemed</hi> wiſe. Much Learning my Lord <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> gained in <hi>Bennets</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> more Experience in <hi>Paris</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> His Dexterity and Diſpatch advanced him to the Court of Wards, his deep Experience made him Lord Keeper. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance was the Policy of that time. <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> married two Siſters; <hi>Walſingham</hi> and <hi>Mildmay</hi> two more: <hi>Knowles, Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> were link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the prudent Queen having all her Favourites Relations and Dependencies in her eye, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them according to their ſeveral Intereſts. Great was this States-mans Wit, greater the Fame of it; which as he would ſay, <hi>being nothing, made all things:</hi> For Report, though but Fancy, begets Opinion; and Opinion begets Subſtance. He was the exacteſt man to draw up a Law in Council, and the moſt diſcreet to execute it in Court. When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers urged the repeal of that Act whereby Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was declared Illegitimate, he rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it, chuſing the cloſure of a feſtered Wound
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:29485:153"/>
more prudent then the opening of it; and judging it more wiſdome to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the world with the old Law, <hi>That the Crown takes away all defects;</hi> then to perplex it with new diſputes, <hi>Whether Queen</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth <hi>were Legitimate.</hi> State-miſcarriages are rather to be privately connived at, then publickly redreſſed; the remedy it may be doing no more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then putting the people in minde of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap. He neither affected nor attained to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>Mediocria firma,</hi> was his Principle and his Practice. When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> asked him, <hi>Why his Houſe was ſo little?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Madam, my Houſe is not too little for me, but you have made me too big for my Houſe. Give me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, rather then a great one. He had a very Quaint ſaying,</hi> ſaith <hi>Robert Naunton, and he uſed it often to very good purpoſe,</hi> That he loved the Jeſt well, but not the loſs of his Friend. <hi>He would ſay, That though</hi> unuſqniſ<expan>

               <p>His Intelligence abroad, was no leſs then his Prudence at home; and he could write to a friend in <hi>Ireland</hi> what the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could do for two years together, and what he could not do. His Advices from his Penſioners abroad, were preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> once a fortnight; 1. clearly and plainly; 2. methodically and diſtinctly; 3. ſpeedily and ſeaſonably; 4. truly and fully.

Sir <hi>Edward Cookes</hi> Motto: and he had rather tire out Oppoſition by his Moderation, then improve it by his Impatience. Others were raiſed to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance Factions, he to ſupport the Kingdome: Fickle Favour toſſed them, conſtant Intereſt ſecured him. No fewer then the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Arundel, Pembroke, Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> contrived his fall; but reaſon of State and his Miſtreſs kept up his ſtanding. Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> adviſed them to clap him up, ſaying, <hi>That then men would open their mouths to ſpeak freely againſt him:</hi> but the Queen underſtanding hereof, and ſtanding, as I may ſay, <note n="d" place="margin">Camb.

Great was the value the Queen ſet upon him, as her ableſt Miniſter of State: for coming once to viſit him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick of the Gout at <hi>Burleigh-</hi>houſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and being much heightned with her Head-attire then in faſhion, the Lords ſervant who conducted her through the door, ſaid, <hi>May your Highneſs be pleaſed to ſtoop.</hi> The Queen returned, <hi>For your Maſters ſake I will ſtoop, but not for the King of</hi> Spain. She would make him always ſit down in her preſence: ſaying, <hi>My Lord, we make uſe of you not for your</hi> bad Legs, <hi>but your</hi> good Head.</p>
               <p>He was a good friend to the Church as then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law; adviſing his ſon <hi>Thomas</hi> never to build a great Houſe, or beſtow any great charge upon an Impropriation, as fearing the foundation might fail hereafter: yet conniving at ſober Non-conformiſts, to ſtrengthen the foundation at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he checked the forwardneſs of private men,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:29485:156"/>
and advanced the honour of the publick Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on all hands. <hi>Good my Lord,</hi> (ſaith he in his Letter to Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> in the behalf of ſome ſqueamiſh Miniſters) <hi>bear with my ſcribbling; I write with the teſtimony of a good Conſcience: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the peace of the Church; I deſire concord and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the exerciſe of our Religion: I fear no ſenſual or wilful Recuſant. I would not make Offenders, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I protect them. And I pray your Grace bear this, (and perchance a fault) and yet I have ſharply admoniſhed them, that if they will be Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in their</hi> Churches, <hi>they muſt be corrected: and yet upon your Graces anſwer to me,</hi> Ne ſutor ultra Crepidam: <hi>neither will I put</hi> Falcem in alterius Meſſem. (Was his Chaplain <hi>Traverſe</hi> his hand in all this?) And then again: <hi>If I had known his fault,</hi> (ſaith he of <hi>Brown) I might be blamed for Writing for him.</hi> Thus he carried matters without paſſion and prejudice prudently, as became ſo great a States-man. He was not <hi>rigid,</hi> yet he was <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> He would help the good-natured, yet puniſh the ſtubborn: He would rather be where nothing is lawful, then where all things are ſo. He would never skrue up the Law to the pitch of cruelty, nor unlooſe it to the remiſsneſs of Libertiniſm.</p>
               <p>He was no leſs honourable a Patron of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, then he was a faithful Son of the Church: (the Church ſtrengtheneth the State, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities furniſh both:) particularly in the caſe of <hi>Rent-corn,</hi> which (ſaith my Author) firſt grew in Sir <hi>Thomas Smiths</hi> head, yet was ripened by <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leighs</hi> aſſiſtance; whereby, though the Rents of the Colledges ſtand ſtill, their Revenues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>

He was not ſurer of all Church-men and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by his Obligations upon them, then he was of all by his complaiſance and pleaſantneſs. None more grave then he in Publick, none more free in Private; eſpecially at his Table, where he drew ſomething out of his heavieſt gueſts; having an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Dexterity in reading and obſerving men, their own occaſional openings in common diſcourſe; there being more hold to be taken of a few words caſually uttered, then of ſet ſolemn Speeches, which rather ſhew mens Arts then their Natures, as indited rather of their brains then hearts. His power awed many, his converſation obliged more. He had his hour to put on his Gown, and his hour to put it off: When he would ſay, <hi>Lie thou there, Lord Treaſurer;</hi> and bidding <hi>Adieu</hi> to all State-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he diſpoſed himſelf to his quiet and reſt.</p>
               <p>He laid the Deſignes of War by his own Theory, and his friends Intelligence; yet he adviſed peace, and died before the Queſtion was determined, <hi>Whether a War with</hi> Spain? Others underſtood the <hi>Nature</hi> of War, but he onely the Expediency and <hi>Conveniency.</hi> If War was neceſſary, none more forward to promote it, none more careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: knowing, that in vain do the brows beat, the eyes ſparkle, the tongue threaten, the fiſt bend, and the arm ſtrike, if the belly be not fed, and the back cloathed: and indeed this was his Maſter-piece, that the Queen vying Gold and Silver with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had Money or Credit when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had neither; Her Exchequer, ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, though but a Pond in compariſon, holding water, when his River fed with a Spring from the <hi>Indies,</hi> was dreined dry.

that that Queen paid her Obligations in Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather then Money; giving away not above two Largeſſes of that nature in her life.

               <p>He was a very exact and a wary Obſerver of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Tranſaction; witneſs this paſſage to Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> Embaſſador in <hi>France: The rare manner of your Entertainment, hath moved the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to muſe upon what ſcore it ſhould be, being more then hath been uſed in like caſes to her Embaſſadors, and ſuch as beſides your own report hath been by others lately advertiſed: And for that in ſuch things Gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be doubtful, I pray you by your next advertiſe me what your ſelf do think of it; and in the mean time I know you are not untaught to judge of the difference between</hi> fair words <hi>and</hi> good deeds, <hi>as the ſaying is,</hi> Fortuna cum adblanditur Capitum advenit.</p>
               <p>His thoughts of a Rebel that ſubmitted, take in theſe words: <hi>Of late</hi> Shane Oneal <hi>hath made means to the Lord Deputy of</hi> Ireland <hi>to be received into grace, pretending that he hath meant no manner of unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the Queen: by which is gathered that he groweth weary of his lewdneſs: yet I think he is no

And yet you ſhall ſo order the matter,</hi> (ſaith he to a French Ambaſſador) <hi>as not that you ſhall finde fault with this manner of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: for that ought properly to be to the Spaniſh or Portugal Embaſſador, with whom you may ſometime deal, to underſtand how they do, know what is done, and how they do interpret it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the King of Scots murther, he would ſay, <hi>There are words ſpoken which I hold beſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs: Neither would I have you</hi> (ſaith he to his friend) <hi>utter any of theſe things, not doubting but ſhortly God will cauſe the truth to be revealed.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the unreaſonable words of Princes, he ſaith, <hi>If hereof the Embaſſador</hi> (meaning the French) <hi>ſhall make any ſiniſter report, you may as you ſee cauſe well maintain the Queens anſwer to be very reaſonable, as having cauſe to miſlike the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Writing of the Queen thereon: which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs you may impute to the unadviſedneſs of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary: for ſo the Queens Majeſty doth impute it.</hi>

               <p>Of Forraign News he writes to Sir <hi>Henry Norris, That he would be glad to have a Note of the Names of the chiefeſt Nobility of</hi> France, <hi>and with whom they be married: adding thereto any other thing that may belong to the knowledge of their lineage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as you ſhall think meet.</hi>

               <p>He writes, That her Majeſty being a Prince her ſelf, is doubtful to give countenance to ſubjects. <hi>I wiſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to have a Kalendar of them who are with the Prince, and alſo to ſee the Edicts that have lately paſſed from the King againſt them, and that in theſe troubleſome times, wherein accidents are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly reported, your advices were large and repeated,

               <p>Of the Diſtractions of <hi>France,</hi> thus to our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in <hi>France: If you told the Queen-mother ſo as of your own head, as a thing you hear ſpread abroad in the world, I think you might do well, and ſpeak truly: for as for the Popes Miniſters, their Profeſſion is to prefer the Weal of their own Church before the good ſtate of any Kingdome on earth; and whatſoever come of any thing, they look onely to the continuance of their own ambitious Ruling. And as for other Miniſters of Princes, or for men of War, it is a truth infallible, The more they do impoveriſh that Monarchy of</hi> France, <hi>the better they think their own Eſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of a plot diſcovered, he writes: <hi>We can truly hit no man, wherefore it is neceſſary that you ſpeak again with the Party that gave you this Intelligence; and if the matter be of truth, and not a diſguiſing to ſome other purpoſe, he can as well obtain you the knowledge of the party in certainty, as thus to give a gueſs at him: for as he hath his Intelligence of the matter which he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you, ſo may be attain to a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Proteſtants he ſaith, <hi>I pray you put them in comfort; that if extreamity ſhall happen, they muſt not be left: for it is ſo univerſal a cauſe, as none of the Religion can ſeparate themſelves one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We muſt all pray together, and ſtand faſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

Of a Profeſſor he writes, <hi>The Queens Majeſty will in no wiſe hear of ſuch matters, which ſhe thinketh are but changeable, and without fruit; although I had earneſtly moved her Majeſty to have adventured ſome ſmall piece of money upon ſuch a man: therefore I ſee no remedy but to pay him as well as may be with good words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Plot again: <hi>Methinks that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that tell you ſuch pieces of tales, if the whole were true, might as well tell you the whole, as ſuch obſcure parts: which if they do not, you might well alledge them to be but devices to breed unquietneſs and ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as I wrote before unto you, they might be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with offer of rewards, that the truth of the matter might be diſcloſed: and ſurely me thinks ſtill, ſince the Informers will not be known of the particulars in more certainty, that theſe things are intended to bring us into their places: but yet no diligence is to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>

               <p>His Actions brought him to the preſence, and his Preſence commended Him to the Heart of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> But the ſhadow doth not more naturally attend the Sun, then Envy doth Favour: Since he muſt riſe, its contrived he ſhould riſe ſo high, that he muſt fall: Yet he might have lived longer, it was thought, if his Wife had not there more favour then himſelf: <hi>Abraham</hi> was afraid <hi>of,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was undone <hi>by</hi> his <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Beauty: This is certain, he was no ſooner in his Grave, than the ſame great man whom he declared his Enemy at his Death, was his Succeſſor in his Marriage-Bed.</p>
               <p>Ambitious was he of the Iriſh Service, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle were others to fill up his Sayls ſo wide, as to be over-turned; at once diving into, and ruining him by his Humour: Weary was he of the Court, and weary, as he obſerved, was that of him: In comes <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in this juncture, and advanceth him

                  <hi>employ</hi> it. His friends at Court grew few and cold, his foes many and active; his affronts continual to diſorder him by paſſion, or ſink him in deſpair.</p>
               <p>His Commiſſion was but ſhort before, but is none now; onely three hundred men ſtick to him: his Money failing, his Noble Followers withdrawing, his Common Souldiers mutiny, and he is recalled. And happy had he been, could he have been quiet: but nothing would compleat ſome mens Deſignes, but his Ruine; and nothing could ruine him but Honour, that at once pleaſed his humour, and waſted his Eſtate. Earl-Marſhal of <hi>Ireland</hi> he is made, and thither he goeth in great ſtate to die, <hi>anno</hi> 1576, and the 36 of his Age: a year fatal to that Family, which none of them exceeded but the laſt, who had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>THomas Radcliff</hi> Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> was of a very Noble and Ancient Lineage, honoured through many Deſcents by the Title of Viſcounts <hi>Fitz-Walters.</hi> He was a goodly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of a brave noble Nature, true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his friends and ſervants, noted for honeſty: a very excellent Souldier, being one of the Queens Martialiſts, who did very good ſervice in <hi>Ireland</hi> at her firſt acceſſion, till ſhe recalled him to the Court, where ſhe made him Lord Chamberlain; and though he was not endowed with the cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dexterity as others were, yet upon his Death-bed he gave his friends a caveat whom they ſhould beware. His words, (ſaith Sir <hi>Robert Naunton)</hi> are theſe: <hi>I am now paſſing into another World, and muſt leave you to your Fortunes, and to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:29485:163"/>
the Queens Graces: but beware of the Gypſie, for he will be too hard for you all; you know not the beaſt ſo well as I do.</hi> His Proweſs and Integrity drew the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers after him, <hi>Leiceſter's</hi> Courtſhip and Cunning the Courtiers, <hi>Cecil's</hi> Prudence and Service the States-men.</p>
               <p>He ſucceeded his Father in his Fortune, and in his Favour; his Prudence and Reſolution promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>North;</hi> his good husbandry and skill in Surveying, making him Juſtice in <hi>Eyre</hi> of all the Parks beyond <hi>Trent;</hi> and his comely Preſence advancing him Lord Chamberlain. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> poyzed her State by Factions abroad, and Parties at home; her chiefeſt wiſdome lying in her general correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and complyance with each Party, as her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt lay in their incomplyance and diſtance from one another. My Lord of <hi>Suſſex</hi> left this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial behind him, That for Riſing Men to ſtick to a ſide, is neceſſary; For Great Men to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, is wiſe: and this, That he and my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> cleared and purged the Court: their croſs Obſervations refining each perſon that was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Court; none daring any injuſtice while <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> obſerved him on the one hand, and <hi>Suſſex</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him on the other.

hath been heard to pronounce; in a divided Court the Creatures of one Party being the Enemies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, no leſs powerful; and ſo they both become liable to accuſation, or capable of defence: and from the ſparkles of this claſhing, not onely Perſons and Actions, but the Publick Councils came to be refined from the Ruſt and Cankers that grow by an Unanimity. Faction can be as little ſpared in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as an Eye or an Ear, as through which the Prince hath a clearer apprehenſion of his own and others Affairs, then he can have when his followers are all agreed: through the percuſſion of equal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as through that of Flint and Steel, all things coming to light by Debates, that might either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or eclipſe a Princes glory.</p>
               <p>When my Lord of <hi>Suſſex</hi> could not overbear <hi>Leiceſter</hi> with Power, he did it with Policy; and by yeilding to him, conquered him: for (as he obſerved) when he and his friends retired, <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and his ſubdivided; and he was checked more by the Ambition he taught his own Followers, then by the competition of his Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>When Factions are carried too high, and too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, it is a ſigne of weakneſs in Princes, and much to the prejudice of their Authority and Buſineſs: The motions of Factions under Kings, ought to be like the motions (as the Aſtronomers ſpeak) of the <note place="margin">Verulam's Eſſays.</note> Inferiour Orbs, which may have their proper Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but yet are ſtill quietly carried by the higher motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had an happy time of it, if it were but for this, That her Favourites Diviſions were her ſupport: for thereby ſhe attained the knowledge of all things that happened, ſo as no Suit or Deſigne paſſed the

               <p>The Character this third great Lord of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left behind him, was, <hi>This year died a man of a great ſpirit and faithfulneſs to his Country:</hi> and therefore none freer then he of his thoughts, none ſounder then he in his counſels. Nor did this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Communication betray his future Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the diſcovery of his Enemies, as they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his heart to the obſervation of his Prince: for through a ſeeming unconſtancy, not of words, but of action; not his weakneſs, but his nimbleneſs, (the Bird on the wing is ſafe) he could ſo often va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as it was not eaſie to diſcover where or when he would be buzzing, and give the blow: by which unſteady carriage, He ſo befooled his Adverſaries with their Spies and Penſioners, as they were at a loſs what to inform their Patrons of, or themſelves how to reſolve.

               <p>HE was Son to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Preſident of <hi>Wales.</hi> A Perſon of great Parts, and in no mean grace with the Queen. His Mother was Siſter to my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> from whence we may conjecture, how the Father ſtood up in the place of Honor and Employment; ſo that his Deſcent was apparently Noble on both ſides. For his Education, it was ſuch as Travel and the Univerſity could afford: for after an incredible proficiency in all the Species of Learning, he left the Academical life for that of the Court, whither he came by his Uncles invitation, famed aforehand by a Noble report of his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; which, together with the ſtate of his Perſon, framed by a natural propenſion to Arms, he ſoon attracted the good opinion of all men; and was ſo highly prized in the good opinion of the Queen, that ſhe thought the Court deficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him: and whereas (through the fame of his deſerts) he was in the election for the Kingdome of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſhe refuſed to further his advancement, not out of Emulation, but out of fear to looſe the Jewel of her times. He married the Daughter and ſole Heir of Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> then Secretary of State; a Lady deſtinated to the Bed of Honour, who (after his deplorable death at <hi>Zutphen</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where he was Governour of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> at the time of his Uncles being there) was married

to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſince his death to my Lord of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> all perſons of the Sword, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of great Honour and Vertue. He had an equal temperament of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> Valour and Learning, to as high a pitch as Nature and Art could frame, and Fortune improve him: ſo Dexterous, that he ſeemed born for every thing he went about. His repreſentations of Vertue and Vice, were not more lively in his Books, then in his Life: his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His Soul was as large as his Parents, and his Complexion as Noble; an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Line of both; the modeſty of the Mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the activity of the Father. A man ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave, ſo familiarly ſtaid, ſo prettily ſerious he was above his years: Wiſdome gained by travel, Experience raiſed from Obſervations, ſolid and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Learning drawn from knowing <hi>Languet</hi> his three years Companion, and choiceſt Books, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him for the love of all, and the reverence of moſt. His Converſe was not more cloſe at home, then his Correſpondence abroad; equally mixed with Policy, Pleaſure, Wiſdome and Love: his Worth being penned up, and ſmothered within the narrowneſs of his fortune, ſallied not out to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but pleaſure; ſweetning the Affairs of State with the Debonnairneſs of the Stage; his Romance being but Policy played with <hi>Machiavil</hi> in jeſt, and State-Maximes ſweetened to a Courtiers Palate. He writ men as exactly as he ſtudied them, and diſcerned humours in the Court with the ſame deep inſight he deſcribed them in his Book.

He put Life into the dead Notions of Anceſtors, made Philoſophy practicable; joyned the Arts as cloſely in him, as they are in themſelves. His Book is below his Spirit: a Spirit to be confined with Kingdomes, rather then Studies; to do what was to be written, then onely to write what was to be done. All eyes were upon him but his own: at firſt, in all Affairs he was the laſt; at laſt, he was the firſt: obliging all men that ever he ſaw, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that were worth obliging. All were pleaſed with his <hi>Arcadia</hi> but himſelf, whoſe years advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him ſo much beyond himſelf, as his Parts did beyond others: He condemned his <hi>Arcadia</hi> in his more retired judgement to the fire, which wiſe men think will continue to the laſt Conflagration. His private Correſpondence with <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> about the higheſt Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> was ſo exact and prudent, that he aſſured Sir <hi>Fulke Grevil</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a Kingdom in Forreign Parts, though he had not an Office in <hi>England.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> held his Authority in the Low-Countries by his Counſel when <hi>alive,</hi> and gave it over when he was <hi>dead.</hi>

by him; all excellent Perſons thronged to him; all ſerviceable men were entertained by him; and he among them a Prince, whoſe minde was great, but his ſpirit greater. He taught <hi>England</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Honeſt Dealing, the Intereſt of being Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.

Although a private Gentleman, he was a publick Good; of a large, yet uniform diſpoſition: ſo good, that the great Monarch <hi>might</hi> truſt; ſo great, that a little one <hi>muſt</hi> fear him: ſomething he did for Fame, moſt for Conſcience: His publick ſpirit, which might have enjealouſed the cautious wiſdome of other Princes, promoted the concerns of his own. He was ſent to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Rodalph,</hi> but he dealt really with the Proteſtant Princes, and raiſed a Ceremony to a piece of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.

               <p>SIr <hi>John Perrot</hi> was a goodly Gentleman, and of the Sword: and as he was of a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deſcent, as an Heir to many Exſtracts of Gentry, eſpecially from <hi>Guy de Bryan</hi> of <hi>Lawhern;</hi> ſo was he of a vaſt Eſtate, and came not to the Court for want. And to theſe Adjuncts he had the Endowments of Courage, and heighth of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had it lighted on the allay of temper and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the defect whereof, with a native freedome and boldneſs of ſpeech, drew him into a Clouded ſetting, and laid him open to the ſpleen &amp; advantage of his Enemies. He was yet a wiſe man, and a brave Courtier, but rough, and participating more of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29485:170"/>
then ſedentary motions, as being in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation deſtinated for Arms. He was ſent Lord-Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he did the Queen very great and many Services: Being out of envy accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of High Treaſon, and againſt the Queens will and conſent condemned, he died ſuddenly in the Tower. He was <hi>Englands</hi> profeſſed Friend, and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hattons</hi> profeſſed Enemy: He fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would <hi>ſtand</hi> alone. In the Engliſh Court at that time he that held not by <hi>Leiceſters</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leighs</hi> favour, muſt yeild to their frowns: What ground he gained in Forreign Merits, (as the Sea) he loſt in Domeſtick Intereſts. The moſt deſerving Receſſes, and ſerviceable abſence from Courts, is incompatible with the way of intereſt and favour. His boyſterous carriage rather removed then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was to his coſt, what he would have been to his advantage; chief in Command, and firſt in Council. His ſpirit was too great to be ruled, and his Intereſt too little to ſway. He was ſo like a Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the <note n="a" place="margin">They ſay his father married a Familiar of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's.</hi>

Boldneſs indeed is as neceſſary for a Souldier, as Action for an Orator; and is a prevailing quality over weak men at all times, and wiſe men at their weak times: yet it begins well, but continueth not; cloſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with the wiſer ſorts ſcorns, and the vulgars laughter. Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> was better at Counſel then Complement, and better at Execution then

Counſel. None worſe to command firſt on his own head, none better to be ſecond, and under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of others. He could not adviſe, becauſe he looked not round on his dangers: he could not execute, becauſe he ſaw them not. His alliance to his Soveraign commended him at firſt to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and gave him up at laſt to her jealouſie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too near to be modeſt, and too bold to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the more ſervice he performed, he was thereby onely the more dangerous, and withal unhappy; his Succeſſes onely puffing up his humor, and his Victories ripening his ambition to thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sallies againſt the Queens honour and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that had coſt him his life, had he not ſaved it with thoſe very Rants he loſt himſelf by: for when he had out of an innocent confidence of his cauſe, and a haughty conceit of his Extraction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated his Noble Jury to his Condemnation, he had no more to ſay for himſelf then <hi>Gods death! will the Queen ſuffer her Brother to be offered up as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the envy of my frisking Adverſaries?</hi> On which words the Queen refuſed to ſigne the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Execution, though preſſed to it from Reaſon and Intereſt, ſaying, <hi>They were all Knaves that condemned him.</hi> It's obſerved of him, that the Surpluſage of his ſervices in <hi>Ireland</hi> abated the merit of them; and that it was his overſight to have done too much there. His mortal words were thoſe in the great Chamber of <hi>Dublin,</hi> when the Queen ſent him ſome reſpectful Letters after her Expoſtulatory ones, with an intimation of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Deſigne: <hi>Lo, now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhe is ready to piſs her ſelf for fear of the</hi> Spaniard; <hi>I am again one of her white Boys.</hi>

He always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized buſineſs, and preferred motions in the heat of other diverſions; and if he muſt debate it, he would hear all; and with the advantage of afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſpeeches, that either cautioned or confirmed his reſolutions, he carried all before him in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion beyond reply. He out-did the Jeſuites in their own bowe, and over-reached them in their own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation, and mental reſervation; never telling a Lye, but warily drawing out and diſcovering truth. As the cloſe Room ſucketh in moſt Air, ſo this wary man got moſt intelligence, being moſt of our Papiſts Confeſſour before their death, as they had been their Brethrens before their treaſon. He

ſaid what another writ, <hi>That an habit of ſecrecy is policy and vertue.</hi> To him mens faces ſpake as much as their tongues, and their countenances were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes of their hearts. He would ſo beſet men with Queſtions, and draw them on, &amp; pick it out of them by piece-meals, that they diſcovered themſelves whether they anſwered or were ſilent. This <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Proverb was familiar with him, <hi>Tell a Lye, and finde a Truth;</hi> and this, <hi>Speak no more then you may ſafely retreat from without danger, or fairly go through with without oppoſition.</hi> Some are good onely at ſome affairs in their own acquaintance; <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> was ready every where, and could make a party in <hi>Rome</hi> as well as <hi>England.</hi> He waited on mens ſouls with his eye, diſcerning their ſecret hearts through their tranſparent faces.</p>
               <p>He ſerved himſelf of the Factions as his Miſtreſs did, neither advancing the one, nor depreſſing the other: Familiar with <hi>Cecil,</hi> allied to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and an Oracle to <hi>Suſſex.</hi> He could overthrow any matter by undertaking it, and move it ſo as it <hi>muſt</hi> fall. He never broke any buſineſs, yet carried ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: He could diſcourſe any matter with them that moſt oppoſed; ſo that they in oppofing it, promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. His fetches and compaſs to his deſigned ſpeech, were things of great patience and uſe. Twice did he deceive the French as Agent, once did he ſettle the <hi>Netherlands</hi> as Commiſſioner, and twice did he alter the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> as Embaſſadour. Once did <hi>France</hi> deſire he might be recalled, becauſe he was too hard for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and once did <hi>Scotland</hi> requeſt his remand, becauſe he would have overturned their Conſtitution: 53 Agents did he maintain in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29485:173"/>
Forreign Courts, and 18 Spies: for two Piſtols an Order, he had all the private Papers of <hi>Europe:</hi> few Letters eſcaped his hands, whoſe Contents he could read and not touch the Seals. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> read his Lectures at <hi>Rome</hi> one moneth, and <hi>Reynolds</hi> had them confuted the next. So patient was this wiſe man, <hi>Chiſelhurſt</hi> never ſaw him angry, <hi>Cambridge</hi> never paſſionate, and the Court never diſcompoſed. Religion was the intereſt of his Country, (in his judgement) and of his Soul; therefore he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it as ſincerely as he lived it: it had his head, his purſe, and his heart. He laid the great founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtant Conſtitution as to its policy, and the main plot againſt the Popiſh as to its ruine. He would cheriſh a plot ſome years together, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Conſpirators to his own and the Queens preſence familiarly, but dogging them out watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: his Spies waited on ſome men every hour, for three years; and leſt they could not keep coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he diſpatched them to forraign parts, taking in new Servants. His training of <hi>Parry</hi> who deſigned the murder of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the admitting of him under the pretence of diſcovering a Plot to the Queens preſence, and then letting him go where he would, onely on the ſecurity of a Dark Sentinel ſet over him, was a piece of reach and hazard beyond common apprehenſion. But Kingdomes were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, as well as private perſons.

               <p>THe Lord <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was the youngeſt ſon then living of <hi>Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> he was alſo one of the firſt to whom Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave that honour to be Maſter of the Horſe. He was a very goodly perſon, and ſingular well featured, and all his youth well favoured, and of a ſweet aſpect, but high foreheaded, which was taken to be of no diſcommendation: but towards his latter end grew high-coloured and red-faced. The Queen made him Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> for the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of his Anceſtors ſake, both in her Fathers and Siſters Reigns. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his death in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the marriage of his Lady yet living, deeply ſtains his commendation. But in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of his Letters and Writings, there was not known a Stile or Phraſe more religious, and fuller of the ſtreams of Devotion. He was ſent Governour by the Queen to the United States of <hi>Holland,</hi> where we read not of his wonders; for they ſay, <hi>Mercury,</hi> not <hi>Mars,</hi> in him had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy. To the Policy he had from <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> his Father, and the Publican <hi>Dudley</hi> his Grandfather, he added, they ſay, Magick and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology; and to his converſe with Wiſe men, his familiarity with Wizards. Indeed he would ſay. <hi>A States-man ſhould be ignorant of nothing, but ſhould have all notices either within his own or his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents command.</hi>

His Brother <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was the Heir to the Eſtate, and he to the Wiſdome of that Family. He was the moſt reſerved man of that Age, that ſaw all, and was inviſible; carrying a depth not to be fathomed but by the <hi>Searcher of Hearts.</hi> Many fell in his time, who ſaw not the hand that pulled them down; and as many died that knew not their own Diſeaſe. He truſted not his Familiars above a twelve-month together, but either tranſported them for Forreign ſervices, or waſted them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. His Ambition was of a large extent, and his Head-piece of a larger. Great was his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on <hi>England,</hi> greater on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all on <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> where this cloſe <hi>Genius</hi> acted inviſibly, beyond the reach of friends, or the apprehenſion of enemies. Declining an immediate oppoſition in Court-factions, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sir raiſed always young Favourites to outſhine the old ones: ſo balancing all others that he might be Paramount himſelf. The modern policy and practices were but ſhallow to <hi>his;</hi> who by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Queens Match, could hinder it; who could decoy <hi>Hunſdon</hi> to <hi>Berwick, Pembroke</hi> to <hi>Wales, Sidney</hi> to <hi>Ireland;</hi> while what with his great Train, what with his growing Popularity, he was called the <hi>Heart</hi> of the Court.</p>
               <p>To make his Baſis equal to his Heighth, he enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſtrengthened his Intereſt by Alliance with the chief Nobility, to whom he was related. By his Patronage of Learning, over which he was Chancellour; by kindneſs to the Clergy, whoſe Head he ſeemed to be; by his command over all men, whom either his favours had won, or his frowns awed; everybody being either within the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:29485:175"/>
Obligation of his Courteſies, or the reach of his Injuries. He adviſed ſome complyance with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> for the Match he propoſed; while by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he altered Religion ſo, as it muſt be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; deſigning Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for his own Bed, while ſhe made his way to the Queen of <hi>Scots:</hi> whoſe refuſal of him he made as fatal to her, as his Marriage would have been advantageous; (The Queen of <hi>England</hi> promiſing to declare her next Heir to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe ſhe failed of Iſſue, upon that Match.) <hi>Leiceſter</hi> trepans <hi>Norfolk</hi> to treat a Match with the Scotch Queen; and her to accept it, to both their ruine: both being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in ſuch fooliſh Enterprizes by their enemies practices, as made <hi>Leiceſter</hi> able in the head of a new Aſſociation in the Queens defence, to take off <hi>Norfolk</hi> and his Ladies head. He was always before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with his Deſignes, being a declared enemy to After-games.</p>
               <p>His Intereſt was Popery, until my Lord <hi>North</hi> put him upon Puritaniſm, but his Religion neither: He promoted the French and Poliſh Match at Court, and diſparaged them in the Country. When Cardinal <hi>Chatillian</hi> advertized her Majeſty how <hi>Leiceſter</hi> drave Royal Suiters from her Court, he was ſent to another World. He that would not hold by his favour, muſt fall by his frown; Arch-biſhop <hi>Grindal</hi> not excepted. His hand beſtowed all favours, and his brows all frowns: the whole Court was at his Devotion, and half the Council at his beck. Her Majeſty ſuſpected, but durſt not remove him. His Intelligence was good in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> better in <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſt in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was governed by his Allies, and the Court by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:29485:175"/>
himſelf. The <hi>Tower</hi> was in his ſervants hands, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> under his Creatures Government, and the Law managed by his Confidents. His treaſure was vaſt, his gains unaccountable, all paſſages to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being in his hand at home and abroad. He was never reconciled to her Majeſty under 5000 <hi>l.</hi> nor to any Subject under 500 <hi>l.</hi> and was ever and anon out with both. All Monopolies are his, who commanded moſt mens Purſes, and all mens Parts. A man was oppreſſed if he complyed with him, and undone if he oppoſed him. In a word, his deſigne was thought a Crown, his Parts too large for a Subject, his Intereſt too great for a Servant, his depth not fathomable in <hi>thoſe</hi> days, and his Policy not reached in <hi>theſe.</hi>

He was firſt made Vice-Chamberlain, and ſhortly after advanced to the place of Lord Chancellour: A Gentleman, that beſides the Graces of his Perſon, and Dancing, had alſo the Adjectments of a ſtrong and ſubtile capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: one that could ſoon learn the Diſcipline and Garb both of Times and Court. The truth is, he had a large proportion of Gifts and Endowments, but too much of the ſeaſon of Envy. As he came, ſo he continued <hi>in</hi> the Court in a Mask. An honeſt man he was, but reſerved. Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> talked,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:29485:176"/>
and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> thought. His features ſet off his body, his gate his features, his carriage his gate, his parts his carriage, his prudence his parts, and his cloſe patience his prudence. The Queen loved him well for his activity, better for his parts, beſt of all for his abilities, which were as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his experience, as that was above his learning, and that above his education. The little the wary man <hi>did,</hi> was ſo exactly juſt and diſcreet; and the little he <hi>ſaid,</hi> was ſo prudent and weighty, that he was choſen to keep the Queens Conſcience as her Chancellour, and to expreſs her ſenſe as her Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: the Courtiers that envyed the laſt capacity, were by his power forced to confeſs their errours; and the Sergeants that would not plead before him in the firſt, by his prudence to confeſs his abilities. The Chancellourſhip was above his Law, but not his Parts; ſo pregnant and comprehenſive, that he could command other mens knowledge to as good purpoſe as his own. Such his humility, that he did nothing without two Lawyers: ſuch his ability, that the Queen did nothing without him. Two things he ſaid he was jealous of, His Miſtreſſes the Queens <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> and his Mother the Churches Diſcipline: the one, that Majeſty might be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do as much good; and the other, that Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity might not be free to as much evil as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. His enemies advanced him, that they might weaken him at Court by his abſence, and kill him at home by a ſedentarineſs. This even and clear man <hi>obſerved</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> their practices, cloſing with Malice it ſelf to his own advancement, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the moſt perverſe enmity to the greateſt kindneſs.</p>

None Nobler, none leſs aſpiring: none more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, yet none more punctual in his hours and orders.

He was a faſt man to his Prince, and firm to his friends and ſervants, downright, honeſt, and ſtout-hearted, having the charge of the Queens Perſon both in the Court, and in the Camp at <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> The integrity of his temper allayed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his birth; which had rendred him dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, if the other had not vouched him faithful. He ſpoke big, but honeſtly; and was thought rather reſolute then ambitious. His words were as his
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:29485:177"/>
thoughts, and his actions as his words. He had Valour enough to be an eminent Souldier in ruffling times, and a renownedly honeſt man in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> Reign. His Latine, faith Sir <hi>Robert Naun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and his diſſimulation, were both alike. His cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſwearing, and obſcenity in ſpeaking, made him ſeem a worſe Chriſtian then he was, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knight of the Carpet then he ſhould be. The Polititians followed <hi>Cecil,</hi> the Courtiers <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and the Souldiers <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> whoſe hands were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his head, and his heart then both. He led ſo brave a Train of young Gallants, as after another threatned a Court, but after him ſecured it; whoſe Greatneſs was not his Miſtreſſe jealouſie, but her ſafeguard. One of his blunt Jeſts went further then others affected Harangues; the one being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the other forced. His faithfulneſs made him Governour of <hi>Berwick;</hi> a place of great ſervice: and General of the Engliſh Army; a place of great Truſt. He had ſomething of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> Choler, but none of his Malice. A right Noble Spirit, not ſo ſtupid as not to reſent, not ſo unworthy as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſenſe of Injuries. To have the Courage to obſerve an Affront, is to be even with an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: to have the patience to forgive it, is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him. There goeth a ſtory of him, that when his Retinue, which in thoſe times was large, would have drawn on a Gentleman that had returned him a box on the ear, he forbad them in theſe Souldier-like words: <hi>You Rogues, cannot my Neighbour and my ſelf exchange a box on the ear, but you muſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</hi>

               <p>The Character of this Prelate, a man of a calm and reſerved minde, but of a gravely obliging car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: wiſe and wary; and that a ſolid wiſdome rather then a formal; well ſeaſoned with pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and well broken to Affairs: of a fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, between Frugality and Magnificence: A great Cheriſher of Manual Arts, eſpecially ſuch as tended to ſplendour or ornament; entertaining the moſt exquiſite Artiſts with a ſetled Penſion. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually divided he was between the Prieſt and the States-man; Great with his double Power, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical and Civil: by Nature more reſerved then

popular, with Vertues fitter to beget eſtimation then love. In his Chancellourſhip he was ſerved with able followers, rather by choice then number, and with more neatneſs and ſervice then noiſe. As Midland Countries in buſie times are moſt ſecure, as being fartheſt, and moſt participating of the common Intereſt: ſo your moderate and middle men in troubleſome and perplexed times, are moſt quiet, as leaſt concerned in the reſpective Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and moſt intent upon the common good.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29485:182"/>
Father in his living Son, this Gentleman is thought to have penned that moſt judicious and elegant Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, (recorded in</hi> Holinſhed's <hi>Hiſtory, pag. 1266.) and preſented it to the young Earl, conjuring him by the Cogent Arguments of Example and Rule to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizare.</hi>

                     <hi>His third Patron was Sir</hi> John Perrot, <hi>Deputy alſo of</hi> Ireland; <hi>who ſo valued his counſel, that in State-affairs he would do nothing without him. So great his Employment betwixt State and State, that he croſſed the Seas thirty ſeven times, until deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly at laſt he came into a port of honour, wherein he ſundry years anchored and found ſafe Harbour. For he receiving the honour of Knighthood, was ſworn of her Majeſties Privy-Council for</hi> Ireland, <hi>and Chancellour of the Exchequer therein. Now his grateful ſoul courſing about how to anſwer the Queens favour, laid it ſelf wholly out in her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: wherein two of his Actions were moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Firſt, he was highly inſtrumental in Model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Kingdome of</hi> Ireland <hi>into Shires, as now they are; ſhewing himſelf ſo great a lover of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity under which he was born, that he advanced the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29485:183"/>
Compliance therewith (as commendable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary) in the Dominions annexed thereunto. His ſecond ſervice was, when many in that Kingdome ſhrowded themſelves from the Laws, under the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of power; making Force their Tutelary Saint, he ſet himſelf vigorouſly to ſuppreſs them. And when many of the Privy-Council, terrified with the greatneſs of the Earl of</hi> Deſmond, <hi>durſt not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Inſtrument wherein he was proclaimed Traytor, Sir</hi> Edward <hi>amongſt ſome others boldly ſigned the ſame, (diſavowing his, and all Treaſons againſt his Friends and County) and the Council did the like, commanding the publication thereof. As to his private ſphear, God bleſſed him, being but a third Brother, above his other Brethren. Now, though he had three Wives, the firſt a</hi> Villiers, <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a</hi> Spilman, <hi>the third the Widow of</hi> Herlakenden <hi>of</hi> Wood-church <hi>in</hi> Kent, <hi>Eſquire; and though he had ſo ſtrong a brain and body, yet he lived and died childleſs, intercommoning therein with many Worthies, who are, according to</hi> Aelius Spartianus, <hi>either improlifick, or have children</hi> in Genitorum Vituperium &amp; famarum Laeſuram. <hi>God thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him the pleaſure of poſterity, he craved leave of the Queen to retire himſelf, and fixed the reſidue of his life at</hi> Wood-church <hi>in</hi> Kent, <hi>living there in great Honour and Repute, as one who had no deſigne to be popular, and not prudent; rich, and not honeſt; great, and not good. He died in the 56 year of his Age, the 13 of</hi> October 1591. <hi>and is buried at</hi> Wood-church <hi>under a Table-Marble-Monument, erected to his memory by his ſorrowful Lady ſurviving him.</hi>

               <p>HIs Predeceſſors made more noyſe it may be, but he had the greater fame: their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was feared, his Goodneſs was loved. He was Heir to his Uncles Ingenuity, and his Fathers Valour; and from both derived as well the <hi>Laurel</hi> as the <hi>Coronet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His God and his Soveraign were not more taken with the ancient ſimplicity that lodged in his plain breaſt, then the people were endeared by that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humility that dwelt in his plainer cloaths and carriage. (The moſt honourable Perſonages, like the moſt honourable Coats of Arms, are leaſt gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.) In the election of the firſt Parliament of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and as a conſequent to that in the ſettlement of the Kingdome, Sir <hi>William Cecils</hi> Wiſdome did much, the Earl of <hi>Arundels</hi> Induſtry more, but the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Popularity did moſt. Never Peer more dread, never more dear: as he could engage the people to comply with their Soveraign at home, ſo he could lead them to ſerve her abroad. That Martial but unfortunate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> draweth firſt towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> (for the firſt Cloud that would have dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened our glorious Star, came from the North, <hi>Whence all evil,</hi> is equally our Proverb and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) as Warden of the middle and Eaſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but he is ſeconded by the Duke, as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General of the North-parts; where his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:29485:185"/>
commands a Treaty, and his Authority a League, Offenſive and Defenſive, to balance the French Intereſt, to reduce the North parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and keep the peace of both Kingdomes. Now as the watchful Duke diſcovered by ſome private Paſſages and Letters that <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be invaded by the French: ſo he writ to his Soveraign, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Spaniſh &amp; French Embaſſadors O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures, ſhe would proceed reſolutely in her prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for <hi>Scotland;</hi> as ſhe did under his Conduct, until the young Queen was glad to ſubmit; and the King of <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Cecil</hi> and <hi>Throgmortons</hi> means now buſied at home, to come to terms.</p>
               <p>He brought the Kingdome to Muſters, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ply Husbandry, the Nobility to keep Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the Juſticers to Salaries. The Enſignes of St. <hi>Michael</hi> were beſtowed upon him as the Nobleſt, and on <hi>Leiceſter</hi> as the deareſt Perſon at Court: Now <hi>Arundel,</hi> who had ſpent his own Eſtate in hope of the Queens, under pretence of recovering his health, travelled abroad to mitigate his grief. When the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> were openly for the Queens Marriage, for the future ſecurity of our preſent happineſs; the Duke, though privately of their mind, yet would diſcourſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Succeſſors take off the peoples eyes from the preſent Soveraign.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was the ſafeſt way to keep all Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors in ſuſpence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Succeſſors, though not deſigned, may ſucceed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas when known, they have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the Arts of their Competitors.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that moſt men (whatever the buſie Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:29485:185"/>
of the Succeſſion pretended) have no more feeling in publick matters then concerneth their own private intereſt. But he had a private kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Queen of Scots, which he diſcovered in all the Treaties wherein ſhe was concerned. 1. In Love-Letters to her, notwithſtanding that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> bid him take care what pillow he <hi>reſted his head on.</hi> 2. In his Mediations at Court ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune for her, that the Queen would ſay, <hi>The Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>ſhall never want an Advocate while</hi> Norfolk <hi>lives.</hi> And, 3. By ſome private tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Pope and Spaniard: to which <hi>Leiceſters</hi> craft trepanned him againſt his friend <hi>Cecils</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which in a dangerous juncture coſt him his life. For the people wiſhing (for the ſecurity of the ſucceſſion in a Proteſtant and an Engliſh hand) that the good Duke were married to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his onely Daughter to her young Son; ſubtile <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Throgmorton</hi> laid a Train for the plain man by Conferences with <hi>Murray, Cecil, &amp;c.</hi> until a Plot was diſcovered: and the Duke, notwithſtanding <hi>Cecils</hi> advice to marry a private La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, retiring to <hi>Norfolk</hi> to finiſh the Match with the Queen, was upon Letters taken with <hi>Roſſe</hi> ſurprized, and committed to the Tower, he ſaying, <hi>I am betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and undone by mine own, whilſt I knew not how to miſtruſt, which is the ſtrength of wiſdome.</hi> After a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Tryal, he is beheaded for Indiſcretions rather then Treaſons, looſing his head becauſe he wanted one. Never any fell more beloved, or more piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſuch his ſingular Courteſie, ſuch his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Bounty, not unbecoming ſo great a Peer. High was his Nobility, large his Intereſt, ſingularly good his Nature, comely his Perſon, manly his
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:29485:186"/>
Countenance, who (ſaith <hi>Cambden)</hi> might have been a great ſtrength and Ornament to his Country, had not the cunning practices of his malicious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and ſlippery hopes, under colour of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, diverted him from his firſt courſe of life. His death was a blot to ſome mens Juſtice, to all mens Diſcretion that were concerned in it, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally odious, though quietly endured: which proves (ſaith one) <hi>That the common people are like Rivers, which ſeldome grow ſo impetuous as to tranſcend the bounds of Obedience, but upon the overflowing of a general Oppreſſion.</hi>

Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> employed him her Leiger a long time, firſt in <hi>France,</hi> then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> finding him a moſt able Miniſter of State: yet got he no great Wealth; and no wonder, being ever of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite party to <hi>Burleigh</hi> Lord Treaſurer: Chamberlain of the Exchequer, and Chief Butler of <hi>England,</hi> were his higheſt Preferments.

to underſtand the ſcope the Reformed propounded to themſelves, their means to compaſs what they aimed at, and (if at any time they were aſſiſted) upon what terms a League might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the two Kingdomes. The Advices collected from all his Obſervations he ſent to the Queen, were theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſhe ſhould not reſt in <hi>dull Counſels</hi> of what is <hi>lawful,</hi> but proceed to <hi>quick Reſolutions</hi> of what is <hi>ſafe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That to prevent, is the policy of all Nations; and to be powerful, of ours. <hi>England is never peaceable but in Arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That how cloſe ſoever they managed their Affairs, it was a Maxime, <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> bore the ſtate of the French Embaſſy, and Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> the burden, who gave dayly Directions to Sir <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Killigrew</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Randolph</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Mewtas</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> to the two firſt, to enjealous the Princes of thoſe Countries; and to the laſt, to unite the Nobility of <hi>Scotland;</hi> he in the mean time ſuffering himſelf to be taken priſoner by the Proteſtants at the battle of <hi>Dreux,</hi> that he might with leſs ſuſpition impart ſecret Counſels to them, and receive as ſecret Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from them; until diſcovering their lightneſs and unconſtancy, they ſecured him as a perſon too cunning for the whole Faction, and too skilful in raiſing Hurley-burleys and Commotions. When the young Queen of Scots would needs marry the young Lord <hi>Darley,</hi> he told her that was long to be
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:29485:187"/>
deliberated on which was to be done <hi>but once.</hi> And when that would not do, he adviſed, 1. That an Army ſhould appear upon the borders: 2. That the Eccleſiaſtical Laws ſhould be in force againſt Papiſts: 3. That <hi>Hertford</hi> ſhould be ſecured: and, 4. That the Lord <hi>Dudley</hi> ſhould be advanced. But the Queen being married to the Lord <hi>Darley,</hi> an eaſie and good-natured man, whom Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> wiſhed to her Bed next <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her ſubjects, <hi>Throgmorton</hi> diſputes the Queens Authority and non-accountableneſs to any againſt <hi>Bucbanans</hi> damned <note n="c" place="margin">De jure Reg. apud Scotos.</note> Dialogue of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples power <hi>over Kings;</hi> until ſmelling their deſigne of revolt to the French, and cruelty upon the Queen, he perſwaded her to reſigne her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaying, <hi>That her Reſignation extorted in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is a juſt fear, was utterly void.</hi> The next news we hear of this buſie man, was in his two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes to the Queen of Scots friends: 1.

                  <hi>Cecil,</hi> whom they might then (he ſaid) deal with: 2.

               <p>HIs Greatneſs ſupported his Goodneſs, and his Goodneſs endeared his Greatneſs; his Heighth being looked upon with a double aſpect: 1. By himſelf, as an advantage of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: 2. By others, as a ground of Reverence. His great Birth put him above private reſpects, but his great Soul never above publick ſervice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he repaired by ways thrifty, yet Noble, what his Anceſtors had impaired by neglect. Good Husbandry may as well ſtand with great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as Breadth may conſiſt with Heighth. His Travel when young, at once gained experience, and ſaved expences; and his marriage was as much to his profit as his honour. And now he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his full Grandeur, when the intireneſs of his Minde, complyed with the largeneſs of his Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a ſpreading Charity. Other Lords made many poor by Oppreſſion; he and my Lord of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would jeſt, made all the Beggers by his liberality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a famous Hoſpitality: wherein, 1. His Houſe was orderly; a Colledge of Diſcipline, rather then a Palace for Entertainment; his Servants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many young Gentlemen trained up to govern themſelves by obſerving him; who knew their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and underſtood themſelves. 2. His Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Native, <hi>(all the Neceſſaries of</hi> England <hi>are bred in it)</hi> rather plentiful then various, ſolid then dainty,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29485:188"/>
that coſt him leſs, and contented his gueſts more. His Table conſtant and even, where all were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and none invited. 3. His Hall was full moſt commonly, his Gates always; the one with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentry and Yeomen, who were his Retainers in love and obſervance, bringing good ſtomacks to his Table, and reſolved hearts for his ſervice; the holding up of his hand in the Northern buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as effectual as the diſplaying of a Banner: The other with the, 1. Aged, 2. Maimed, 3. Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poor, whoſe craving was prevented with doles, and expectation with bounty; the firſt being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with meat, the ſecond with money, and the third with employment. In a word, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> obſerves, That Hoſpitality lieth buried ſince 1572, in this Earls Grave: whence may that Divine Power raiſe it, that ſhall raiſe him; but before the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when there will be plenty to beſtow in one part of the world, and no poor to be relieved; poverty in the other, and no bounty to relieve.</p>
               <p>Neither was he Munificent upon other mens charge: for once a moneth he looked into his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, and once a week to his Disburſements, that none ſhould wrong him, or be wronged by him. The Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> he would ſay, <hi>ſhall keep his own Houſe:</hi> wherefore it's an Obſervation of him and the ſecond Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> That when they were buried, not a Trades-man could demand the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Groat that they owed him, nor a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the reſtitution of a peny they had wronged him. They ſay, The Graſs groweth not where the Grand Seigniors <hi>Horſe treads;</hi> nor doth the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thrive where the Noble-men inhabit: But here every Tenant was a Gentleman, and every
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:29485:189"/>
Gentleman my Lords Companion: ſuch his Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards the one, and great penyworths to the other. Noblemen in thoſe days eſteemed the love of their Neighbours more then their fear, and the ſervice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ealty of their Tenants more then their Money. Now the Landlord hath the ſweat of the Tenants brow in his Coffers, then he had the beſt blood in his Veins at his command.</p>
               <p>That grand word, <hi>On mine Honour,</hi> was ſecurity enough for a Kingdome, and the onely Aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he uſed. It was his priviledge, that he <hi>need</hi> not ſwear for a teſtimony; and his renown, that he <hi>would</hi> not for his honour. Great was this Families eſteem with the people, and eminent their favour with their Soveraigns; as which ever beſtowed its ſelf in obliging their Liege-people, improving their intereſt, and ſupporting their Throne: for though they were a long time great Kings of <hi>Man</hi> and Hearts, yet were they as long faithful ſubjects to <hi>England.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That he never baſely killed in <hi>cold</hi> blood, them that had nobly eſcaped his Sword in <hi>hot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That he never led the Souldiers without pay, or quartered in the Country without money.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That though he was ſecond to none that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in War, ſuch his Valour! yet he was the firſt that ſpake for Peace, ſuch his ſweet Diſpoſition!</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he would never ſuffer that a Clergy-man ſhould be abuſed, a Church violated, or the Dead be unburied.</p>

                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:29485:190"/>
6. That he would never force an Enemy to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; always ſaying, <hi>Let us diſarm them of their beſt Weapon, Deſpair:</hi> nor fight an Enemy before he had skirmiſhed him, nor undertake a defigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he conſulted his God, his Council, his Friends, his Map and his Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>His own Abilities commended, and his alliance with Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> Lord Deputy, whoſe Siſter he married, promoted him to the Government of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Once did the Queen ſend him thither for his Brothers ſake, four times more for his own ſake; a ſufficient evidence (ſaith my Friend) of his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Integrity, ſince Princes never truſt <hi>twice,</hi> where they are <hi>once</hi> deceived in a Miniſter of State. He kept up his Miſtreſſes Intereſt, and ſhe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; enjoyning the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> ſo much above him in honour, to truckle under him in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when Governour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and he Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland. Defend me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luther</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Saxony, with your Sword, and I will defend you with my pen. Maintain my Power,</hi> ſaith the Miniſter of State to his Soveraign, <hi>and I will ſupport your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things he did for the ſettlement of that Kingdome:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He raiſed a Compoſition in <hi>Munſter.</hi>

                  </item>

               <p>AN excellent Man, and one that faſhioned his <hi>own Fortune:</hi> His Diſpoſition got fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and his Prudence wealth, (the firſt to grace the ſecond, and the ſecond to ſupport the firſt) under King <hi>Henry</hi> the eigth, whoſe Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law he was by his wife, and Chamberlain by his place.

Under King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, he had a gainful Office in the Court of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: during the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the Politick Precept, <hi>Bene vixit, qui bene la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit.</hi> No ſooner came Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Crown, but he was called to State-employment; and it was not long before he was made Chancellour of the Exchequer. It is obſerved, That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer never fareth ill but under a good Prince; ſuch who out of Conſcience will not oppreſs their People, whilſt Tyrants paſs not for that they ſqueeze out of their Subjects. Indeed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was very careful not to have her Coffers ſwelled with the Conſumption of her Kingdome, and had conſcientious Officers under her; amongſt whom, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was a principal one. This Knight, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Gods bleſſing on his Eſtate, and knowing that, <hi>Omne beneficium requirit Officium,</hi> caſt about to make his return to God.

Not to build on another mans foundation,</hi> but on his own coſt he erected a new Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by the name of <hi>Immanuel.</hi> A right godly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was; a good Man, and a good Citizen; though ſome of his back friends ſuggeſted to the Queen that he was a better Patriot then Subject: and he was over-popular in Parliaments, inſomuch that his Life ſet <hi>ſub nubecula,</hi> under a Cloud of a Royal Diſpleaſure: yet was not the Cloud ſo great, but that the beams of his Innocence meeting thoſe of the Queens Candour, had eaſily diſpelled it, had he ſurvived longer, as appeared by the great grief of the Queen, profeſſed for the loſs of ſo grave a Councellour, who leaving two Sons and three Daughters, died <hi>anno Domini</hi> 1589.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman being employed by vertue of his place to advance the Queens Treaſure, did it indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly, faithfully, and conſcionably, without wronging the Subject, being very tender of their Priviledges; inſomuch that he complained in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>That many Subſidies were granted, and no Grievances redreſſed:</hi> which words being repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his diſadvantage to the Queen, made her to diſaffect him, ſetting in a Court-Cloud, but (as he goeth on) in the Sun-ſhine of his Country, and a <hi>clear Conſcience,</hi> (though a mans Conſcience can be ſaid no otherwiſe clear by his oppoſition to the Court, then a man is ſaid to have a good heart when it is but a bold one.)

                  <q>SIr <hi>William Drury</hi> was born in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where his Worſhipful Family had long flouriſhed at <hi>Haulſted.</hi> His name in <hi>Saxon</hi> ſoundeth a Pearl, to which he anſwered in the pretiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his diſpoſition, clear and heard, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and valiant, and therefore valued deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly by his Queen and Country. His youth was ſpent in the <hi>French</hi> Wars, his middle-Age in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his old Age in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He was Knight-Marſhal of <hi>Barwick,</hi> at what time the <hi>French</hi> had poſſeſſed themſelves of the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in the minority of King <hi>James.</hi> Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> employed this Sir <hi>William</hi> with 1500 men to beſiege the Caſtle; which ſervice he right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily performed, reducing it within few days to the Owner thereof. <hi>Anno</hi> 1575. he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> whither he went with competent Forces, and executed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Juſtice in deſpight of the Oppoſers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:29485:193"/>
County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> as a Palatinate peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated unto himſelf.

               </p>
               <p>In the laſt year of his Life he was made Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and no doubt had performed much in his place, if not afflicted with conſtant ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the forerunner of his death, at <hi>Waterford,</hi> 1598.</p>
               <p>He was one of that Military Valour which the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> wiſheth about a Prince in trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times, that held a good eſteem with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy, and an exact correſpondence with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſs; whereby he united himſelf to each ſide by endearments, and divided them by diſtruſt; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſlow motions of the people, that they ſhould not be excited and ſpirited by the Nobility; and the ambition of the Great Ones, that it ſhould not be

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1577, when that excellent Act paſſed, whereby it was provided, <hi>That a third part of the Rent upon Leaſes made by Colledges, ſhould be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Corn, paying it either in kind or in money, after the rate of the beſt prices in</hi> Oxford <hi>or</hi> Cambridge<hi>-markets, the next Market-days before</hi> Michaelmas <hi>or our</hi> Lady-day: For the paſſing of this Act, Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Smith</hi> ſurprized the Houſe; and whereas many conceived not the difference between the payment of Rents in Corn or Money, the knowing Patriot took the advantage of the preſent cheap year, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hereafter Grain would grow dearer, Man-kinde dayly multiplying, and Licenſe being lately given for Tranſportation; ſo that now when the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities have leaſt Corn, they have moſt Bread.

couch it in too compact generals: by the firſt whereof we give the parties we deal with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to look down to the bottom of our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and by the ſecond, to look round to the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> of it.

               <p>Much was he employed in matters of State, and was one of the Commiſſioners who ſate on the tryal of the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> He wrote a Book on the Foreſt-Laws, which is highly prized by men of his Profeſſion.

He was firſt made Maſter of the Horſe, and then admitted of her Council of State. In his Youth (part whereof he ſpent before he came to reſide at Court) he was a very fine Gentleman, and the beſt Horſe-man and Tilter of the Times, which were then the manlike and noble recreations of the Court: and when years had abated theſe exerciſes of Honour, he grew then to be a faithful and profound Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour. He was the laſt Liver of all the Servants of her favour, and had the honour to ſee his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Miſtreſs, and all of them laid in the places of their reſt; and for himſelf, after a life of a very noble and remarkable reputation, he died in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Old Age, full of Riches and Honour.

To which happineſs it conduced not a little, that though he had a good, yet he had a reſtrained appetite (a Knife upon his Throat as well as upon his Trencher) that indulged it ſelf neither fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent nor delicate entertainment; its Meals, though but once a day, being its preſſures; and its faſts, its only ſenſualities: to which temperance in diet adde, but that in ſleep, together with his diſpoſal of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               <p>
                  <hi>ARthur Gray</hi> Baron of <hi>Wilton</hi> is juſtly recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt the Natives of <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> whoſe Father had his habitation (not at <hi>Wilton</hi> a decayed Caſtle in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> whence he took his Title, but) at <hi>Waddon,</hi> a fair Houſe of his Family not far from <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſucceeded to a ſmall Eſtate, much diminiſhed on this ſad occaſion. His Father <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> being taken Priſoner in <hi>France,</hi> after long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual ſolliciting to be (becauſe captivated in the publick ſervice) redeemed on the publick charge, at laſt was forced to ranſome himſelf with the ſale of the beſt part of his Patrimony. Our <hi>Arthur</hi> endeavoured to advance his Eſtate by his Valour,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:29485:208"/>
being entred into Feats of War under his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Father at the ſiege of <hi>Leith</hi> 1560, where he was ſhot in the ſhoulder, which inſpirited him with a conſtant antipathy againſt the Scots. He was afterwards ſent over Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1580; where before he had received the Sword, or any Emblems of Command, <hi>ut acricribus initiis terrorem incuteret,</hi> to fright his foes with fierce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, he unfortunately fought the Rebels at <hi>Glandilough,</hi> to the great loſs of Engliſh Blood. This made many commend his Courage above his Conduct, till he recovered his credit, and finally ſuppreſſed the Rebellion of <hi>Deſmond.</hi> Returning into <hi>England,</hi> the Queen chiefly relied on his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for ordering our Land-forces againſt the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> in 88, and fortifying places of advantage. The mention of that year (critical in Church-differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about diſcipline at home, as well as with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign force abroad) mindeth me that this Lord was but a back-friend to Biſhops; and in all diviſions of Votes in Parliament or Council-table, ſided with the Anti-prelatical Party. When Secretary <hi>Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that State-Pageant, (raiſed up on purpoſe to be put down) was cenſured in the Star-chamber a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſs of the Queen of Scots, this Lord <hi>Gray</hi> onely defended him, as doing nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but what became an able and honeſt Miniſter of State. An Ear-witneſs ſaith, <hi>Haec fusè oratoriè &amp; animosè Greium diſſerentem audivimus.</hi> So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides bluntneſs, (the common and becoming Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Souldiers) he had a real Rhetorick, and could very emphatically expreſs himſelf. Indeed this Warlike Lord would not wear two heads under one Helmet, and may be ſaid always to have born
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:29485:209"/>
his Beaver open, not diſſembling in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but owning his own Judgement at all times what he was. He deceaſed <hi>anno Domini</hi> 1593.</p>
               <p>Three things he was obſerved eminent for: 1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch; <hi>San Joſeph</hi> having not been a week in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before he had environed him by Sea and Land. 2. For his reſolution, that he would not parley with him till he was brought to his mercy, hanging out a white flag with <hi>Miſericordia, Miſericordia.</hi> 3. For his Prudence: 1. That he ſaved the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, to oblige the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> 2. That he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Country, to enrich his Souldiers: 3. That he decimated the Souldiery, to terrifie Invaders; and hanged all the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to amaze the Traytors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Fitz-alan</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> when Steward at King <hi>Edward's</hi> Coronation, or Conſtable at Queen <hi>Mary's,</hi> was the firſt that rid in a Coach in <hi>England;</hi> my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was the firſt that brought a Coach hither: one of a working Brain, and a great <hi>Mechaniſt</hi> himſelf, and no leſs a Patron to the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious that were ſo. That there was an emulation between him and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> was no wonder; but that the inſtance wherein he thought to diſgrace him, ſhould be his ſeverity to the Engliſh Traytor, and the Forreign Invadors, would ſeem ſtrange to any but thoſe that conſider, 1. That Princes of late would ſeem as they look on the end, and not the means; ſo they hug a cruelty, and frown on the inſtrument of it; who while he honeſtly ſacrificeth ſome irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar particulars to the intereſt of Soveraignty, may be made himſelf a ſacrifice to the paſſion of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.

               <p>SIr <hi>William Pelham</hi> was a Native of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> whoſe ancient and wealthy Family hath long flouriſhed in <hi>Laughton</hi> therein. His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Peace, and Valour in War, cauſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to employ him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was by the Privy-Council appointed Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to govern that Land in the interim betwixt the death of Sir <hi>William Drury,</hi> and the coming in of <hi>Arthur Gray,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

had entred in thereat, to the final ruine of that Kingdome, had not his Providence prevented it. For in this juncture of time, <hi>Deſmond</hi> began his Rebellion 1579, inviting Sir <hi>William</hi> to ſide with him; who wiſely gave him the hearing, with a ſmile in to the Bargain. And although our Knight for want of Force could not cure the wounds, yet he may be ſaid to have waſhed and kept it clean, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning it in a recovering condition to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> who ſucceeded him. Afterwards he was ſent over into the Low-Countries 1586, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Engliſh Horſe therein. It is ſaid of him, <hi>Brabantiam perſultabat,</hi> He leapt through <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant;</hi> importing celerity and ſucceſs, yea, as much Conqueſt as ſo ſuddain an expedition was capable of.</p>
               <p>He had a ſtrong memory whereon he built his experience, and a large experience whereon he grounded his actions: There was no Town, Fort, Paſſage, Hill or Dale, either in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> but he retained by that ſtrong faculty, that was much his Nature, more his Art; which obſerved pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, what it ſaw publickly; recollected and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the night, what he obſerved by day; truſting his head with ſolids, but not burthening it with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies. Company is one of the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Mankinde, and the great delight of this man, (it's unnatural to be ſolitary; the world is ſinked together by love, and men by friendſhip) who obſerved three things in his converſe, that it ſhould be, 1. even, 2. choice, and 3. uſeful; all his friends being either valiant, ingenious, or wiſe: that is, either Souldiers, Scholars, or States-men. Four things he was very intent upon during his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

in <hi>Ireland:</hi> 1. The Prieſts, the Pulpits, and the Preſs: 2. The Nobility: 3. The Ports: 4. The Forreigners.

A man of a conſtant toyl and induſtry, buſie and quick, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an enemy to the idle and ſlow undertakings, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a great weakneſs to ſtand ſtaring in the face of buſineſs, in that time which might ſerve to do it. In his own practice he never conſidered longer then till he could diſcern whether the thing propoſed was fit or not; when that was ſeen, he immediately ſet to work: when he had finiſhed one buſineſs, he could not endure to have his thoughts lie fallow, but was preſently conſulting what next to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
               <p>Two things this Gentleman profeſſed kept him up to that eminence: 1. Fame, that great incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Excellency. 2.

               <p>The firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> found this brave Earl commanding <hi>Ireland</hi> in peace and plenty, with three hundred and twenty Horſe, and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty Foot, prudently gariſoned, and well paid: And the ſecond employed him thither again, with Inſtructions, <q>That he ſhould beware above all things, leſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> being an uncivil people, and therefore the more ſuperſtitious, ſhould by the cunning practices of the <hi>French,</hi> be excited to rebellion under the pretext of Religion. 2. That he ſhould fortifie <hi>Ophale</hi> with Caſtles and Forts. 3. That he ſhould engage the Souldiery with large Poſſeſſions. 4. That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould hold their Eſtates in Fee. 5.

               <p>At what time <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperoun cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom all Engliſh men wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed married, all Proteſtants married to a Proteſtant, and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> had deſigned for himſelf, there aroſe a <hi>deadly feud</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh Court</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> that favoured the Match upon common Principles of Government; and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who oppoſed it upon a private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of his own. <q>Certainly very great and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hopes do they foſter, who have already attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things beyond hopes.</q> The open-hearted Earl would call his Antagoniſt an Upſtart, that had but
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:29485:218"/>
two Anceſtors, his Father, a Traytor; and his Grandfather, a Publican. The Court is divided, the Earls are always attended with their armed Guards, until the Queen, who took pleaſure in, and made uſe of the innocent emulation of her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but was afraid of the dangerous conteſts of her Favourites, rather skinned over, then healed the rupture.</p>
               <p>At the Emperours Court, whither he is ſent with the Order of Saint <hi>George,</hi> he preſſeth the Marriage cloſely, as much out of love to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as hatred to <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> having nothing more ordinary in his diſcourſe then that a Forreign Prince was to be preferred before the nobleſt Engliſhman for the three grand things of <hi>Honour, Power</hi> and <hi>Wealth.</hi> But what he promoted publickly, the Lord <hi>North,</hi> who was joyned with him rather as his Guardian then his Colleague, oppoſed privately, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a few fond ſcruples broke the moſt ſolemn Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; wherein yet this Earl behaved himſelf with a Gallantry that gained him a familiarity from the Emperour, a reverence from the Archduke, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from all the people, and his Miſtreſs a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that Court, that ſtood her in great ſtead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the attempts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Germany</hi> he returned with much honour, to Command in the <hi>North</hi> with more, where he and his old ſetters at Court diſcovered the grand Plot in the <hi>North,</hi> as <hi>Hunſdon</hi> and his old Souldiers at <hi>Berwick</hi> defeated it, and both haraſſed the Scotiſh Borders: all things yeilding to thoſe two grand Diſpoſers of the World, now predominant in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Wiſedome</hi> and <hi>Cecil</hi> at home, <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Hunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

abroad; and both with <hi>Suſſex</hi> at home, now for his approved Wiſdome and Fidelity made Privy Counſellour, and abroad alway Lord General.</p>
               <p>Of many, I pitch on this one Argument, Of the greatneſs of his Minde, that he ſcorned to trample <hi>the Proſtrate;</hi> that he had a juſt Paſſion, but not an unworthy Malice for an Enemy whom he had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous goodneſs to pity when unhappy, as well as a brave ſpirit to conteſt with when injurious. The leſſer fry of adverſaries railed againſt, this great one pleaded for <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> when his practices againſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi>'s marriage with the Queen confined him to the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor;</hi> and his Menaces had caſt him to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> had not my Lord, minding more the common Intereſt then his private reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, firſt moderated the Queens Paſſion with Reaſon, and then overcame it with this Jeſt, <hi>You muſt allow Lovers their jealouſie.</hi>

               <p>SIr <hi>John Puckering</hi> was born at <hi>Flamborough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> He was ſecond Son to his Father, a Gentleman that left him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a plenteous nor a penurious Eſtate. His Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was more beneficial to him then his Portion; gaining thereby ſuch skill in the Common Law, that he became the Queens Sergeant, Speaker in the Houſe of Commons, and at laſt Lord Chancellour of <hi>England.</hi> How he ſtood in his Judgement in the point of Church-Diſcipline, plainly appeareth by his following Speech, delivered in the Houſe of Lords 1588.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And eſpecially you are commanded by Her Majeſty to take heed, that no ear be given, nor time afforded to the weariſome Sollicitations of thoſe that commonly be called</hi> Puritans, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal the late Parliaments have been excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly importuned: which ſort of men, whilſt that (in the giddineſs of their ſpirits) they labour and ſtrive to advance a new Elderſhip, they do nothing elſe but diſturb the good repoſe of the Church and Commonwealth: which is as well grounded for the body of Religion it ſelf, and as well guided for the Diſcipline, as any Realm that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Truth. And the ſame thing is already
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:29485:220"/>
made good to the world by many of the Writings of godly and learned men, neither anſwered nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable by any of theſe new-fangled Refiners. And, as the preſent caſe ſtandeth, it may be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether they, or the Jeſuites, do offer more danger, or be more ſpeedily to be repreſſed. For, albeit the Jeſuites do empoyſon the hearts of Her Majeſties Subjects, under a pretext of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to withdraw them from their Obedience due to Her Majesty; yet do they the ſame, but cloſely, and in privy-corners: But theſe men do both teach and publiſh in their printed Books, and teach in all their Conventicles, ſundry Opinions, not onely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to a well-ſetled Estate, and the Policy of the Realm, by putting a Pike between the Clergy and the Layty; but alſo much derogatery to her ſacred Majeſty and her Crown, as well by the diminution of her ancient and lawful Revenues, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Her Highneſs Prerogative and Supremacy, as by offering peril to her Majeſties ſafety in her own Kingdome. In all which things, (however in other Points they pretend to be at war with the Popiſh Jeſuites) yet by this ſeparation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the unity of their fellow-ſubjests, and by abaſing the Sacred Authority and Majeſty of their Prince, they do both joyn and concur with the Jeſuites in opening the Door, and preparing the way to the Spaniſh Invaſion that is threatened againſt the Realm.</hi>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> firſt employed this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and my Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> took firſt notice of him.

               <p>THat Meteor of the Court! raiſed onely in an exceſs of heat and vapours, to fall in a clearer day: for having good parts to act, an eaſie nature to comply, and a good diſpoſition to be impoſed on, he was raiſed to play others parts rather then his own, in thoſe intricate and dark times, when fools were put to execute what wiſe men adviſed; and the world ſaw but the plain-ſide of the great watch of State, within which all the Springs were incloſed and hid.</p>
               <p>That he was but of a private capacity, and ſo ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be raiſed, as one that would neither outſhine nor outdare his Patron, <hi>(Machiavil</hi> hath a Rule, <hi>(Diſc. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) That it is a very great part of wiſdome ſometimes to ſeem a fool, and ſo lie out of the reach of <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie)</hi> appears from his Negotiations, that were either payment of money in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> a Merchants buſineſs; or taking ſecurity of the Merchants in <hi>France,</hi> a Scriveners part; or pacifying the tumult in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the task of a Burgomaſter. <hi>Beale</hi> the Clerk of the Council and he were joyned in Commiſſion, always to deal with the Scots; the one the auſtereſt, and the other the ſweeteſt man living. When the firſt frighted thoſe rude people with Expoſtulations, the ſecond got into them with infinuations. A hard and a ſoft, a Hammer and a Cuſhion, breaks a Flint; Fear and Love rule the world. His grand Caſe,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:29485:229"/>
as that great Hiſtorian layeth it, is briefly this: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proteſtants thought themſelves in danger while the Queen of Scots was alive; many Papiſts thought themſelves undone while ſhe was impriſoned: theſe laſt preſs her to ſome dangerous undertakings; of the firſt, ſome were for ſecuring, others for tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and a third party for poyſoning her: to which purpoſe many Overtures were made, though yet none durſt undertake it that had either Eſtate or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to looſe; being ſo wiſe as not to underſtand what was meant by the ſtrange Letters that were ſent, elſe they might have faln into this Gentlemans fortune; who unadviſedly venturing between the honour and ſafety of his Soveraign, was ground to nothing betwixt the fear of one party, and the ſhame of the other.</p>
               <p>But this mild, but ſtout, becauſe honeſt man, was not ſo weak in the perpetration of this fault, as he was wiſe in his Apology for it, ſaying, He would not confeſs a guilt, and betray his integrity; nor yet ſtand upon a Juſtification, and forget his Duty. He would neither conteſt with his Soveraign, nor diſparage himſelf; but clear himſelf as an honeſt man, and ſubmit as a thankful ſervant, and a good ſubject.</p>

               <head>Obſervations on the Life of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is obſerved, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had his Introduction to favour by the Lord of <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who had married his Mother; a tye of Affinity. This young Lord was a moſt goodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in whom was a kind of Urbanity, or innate Courteſie, which both won the Queen, and too much took upon the People, to gaze upon the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adopted Son of her favour. He was noted even of thoſe that truly loved and honoured him, for too bold an Ingroſſer both of Fame and Favour. Having upon occaſion left the Court for a while, he gave a fair opportunity for his foes to undermine him; ſo that he lived a mixture between Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Adverſity: once very great in her favour, which was afterwards loſt, for want of conſideration and cunningneſs. He was raiſed by <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to prize <hi>Rawley,</hi> as <hi>Rawley</hi> was by <hi>Suſſex</hi> to check <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi> Indeed Pity firſt opened the door to him for his Fathers ſake that died in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Alliance led him in for his Father-in-laws ſake <note n="a" place="margin">Leiceſter. <hi>See Sir</hi> H. Wottons <hi>Obſervali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </note> that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Court. His own Royal Blood welcomed him for his Mother <hi>Knowles,</hi> that was kin to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; his good Parts, his tall and comely Perſonage, his ſweet Diſpoſition, and incomparable Nature; his noble Anceſtors, his fair, though impaired For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, brought him firſt to favour, and then to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.</p>
               <p>He was a Maſter-piece of Court and Camp; his
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:29485:234"/>
Beauty ennamelling his Valour, and his Valour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a foile to his Beauty; both drawing thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpects of love and honour; both <hi>awing,</hi> both <hi>endearing.</hi> It was his Nobleneſs that he diſtruſted none, it was his Weakneſs that he truſted all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſuffered more from thoſe that ſhould have been his friends, then from them who were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Good Man! his ruine was, that he meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red other breaſts by his own; and that he thought Mankinde was as innocent as his own perſon. His Merit gained applauſe, and his Paraſites ſwelled it to Popularity; and the laſt enjealouſied that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty which the firſt had obliged. His youthful and raſh Sallies abroad, gave too much opportunity to his Enemies whiſpers, and too viſible occaſions for her Majeſties ſuſpicion, that he was either weak, and ſo not to be favoured; or dangerous, and ſo to be ſuppreſſed. Abſence makes Princes forget thoſe they love, and miſtruſt thoſe they fear. Exact Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence is the ſinew of private and of publick friendſhip. So great a Maſter he thought himſelf of his Soveraigns affection, that he muſt needs be Maſter of himſelf, and ſteal to <hi>France</hi> without leave, where, ſaid the Queen, he might have been knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the head as <hi>Sidney</hi> was. His Journey to <hi>France</hi> was not more raſh, then his Voyage to <hi>Cales</hi> was renowned; yet the one gave the Envious arguments of his diſobedience, and the other of his Diſloyalty; his enemies ſuggeſting, that in the firſt he contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Miſtreſs, and that in the ſecond he had a deſigne upon her.</p>
               <p>His Action at <hi>Cales</hi> was applauded; but his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs were too ſolemn, his Panegyricks too high, his Train too Princely, his Honours and Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:29485:234"/>
too cheap, his Popularity too much affected, and his Ear more open to hear what he <hi>had done,</hi> then what <hi>he was.</hi> If his Manhood had been as ſlow as his <note n="b" place="margin">He was one of them whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe but ſlowly.</note> Youth, he had been moderate: if his Life had anſwered his <note n="c" place="margin">Under Dr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift.</hi>
                  </note> Education, he had been patient: if his Eye had been as open upon his Enemies, as his Ear to his friends, he had been cautious: if he had been as happy in his conſtant converſe, as he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging in his firſt addreſs, he had been a Prince: if he had had either leſs Fortune, or a greater Soul; either leſs of the Dove, or more of the Serpent, he had bid fair for a Crown; or at leaſt had ſaved his Head. The People wiſhed him well, but they are unconſtant; the Queen loved him, but ſhe is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: his Followers are numerous, but giddy; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, but ill advice: his Enemies are few, but watchful on all occaſions: for is he pleaſed? they ſwell it to pride and vain imaginations: is he croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? they improve it to diſcontent and ſedition. An Army muſt be ſent againſt <hi>Tyrone;</hi> he is not willing that any other ſhould lead it, and unwilling to lead it himſelf; yet over he goeth fatally: for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was knotty, and his diſpoſition ſmooth; his power was large, but that with as large a minde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled him: his Army was great, but that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a great deſigne, precipitated him: his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Crown was defended, but that loſt him his head. He had exact advices from friends, eſpecially from Sir <hi>Francis Bacon;</hi> and great directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his Prince, but he followed his own: when he ſhould have fought the main body of his Enemy, he skirmiſheth their Forlorns; when he ſhould have returned with a noble Conqueſt, he ſtole home af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſuſpitious Treaty: the Royal Checks that
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:29485:235"/>
ſhould have inſtructed, incenſeth him; and what was deſigned a chaſtiſement, he turns to a ruine. Beloved he is of the People, but that aggravateth his raſhneſs; flattered by Courtiers, but that ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his humour: followed he is by the diſcontented of Church and State, but that increaſeth the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: ill adviſed he is by heady <hi>Cuffe</hi> and <hi>Meyriche,</hi> and that haſteneth his fall: humbled he is by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Rivals, and that enrageth him: eaſie and open was his Nature; cloſe, active, and vigilant his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Valiant he was, but therefore feared; Noble and obliging to all hopeful men, and therefore watched. A great Party he had, but they had no Head: A Minion he was at once to Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but he had no Balance. A Man of great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but no Deſigne: One that had too much Religion and Fidelity to be a Traytor, too good a Nature to be ſafe, too much preſumption on affections when abſent to be ſteady. He preſumed too much on his own ſtrength, or his friends wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when he came out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> he was too much wrought upon by his enemies when he came to <hi>London,</hi> which had too much to looſe to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a Rebellion; and went not to <hi>Wales,</hi> where his fathers and his own goodneſs had engaged 1000 Lives and Fortunes. In a word, <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs, <hi>Bacon</hi>'s ſtayedneſs, Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi>'s hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Sir <hi>Fulke Grevil</hi>'s modeſty, added to his Parts and Preſence, his Valour and Liberality, his good Nature and large Heart: his favour with his Prince, and popularity with the Subjects, had raiſed him to a capacity with the great Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to ſet the Engliſh Crown on what Head he pleaſed;
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:29485:235"/>
although it was the univerſal opinion, he had no other ambition then to ſet it on King <hi>James</hi> his head, which it belonged to, with his own hands: his deſigne was well principled, but not well moulded; he had many hands, but no able heads: his correſpondence was univerſal, but not firm and exact; his Nature was active, but impatient; his Intereſt was popular, not throughly underſtood; he neither comprehending the Inclinations of the Kingdome in groſs in Parliament, nor in the retayl in its particular diviſions. The Catholicks might have been his, but he was too good-natured to cajole them: the State was well inclined, but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate after ſo long Proſperity. Hope of Pardon ſent him to his Grave with more ſilence then was expected from him, and the Peoples regret; and with more ſorrow then became a Queen or her Kingdoms a ſafety. His Party was too needy, and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels too violent. Ambition and good Nature are incompatible. Others counſels are never ſo faithful as our own. When we hear others advice, let our Reaſon judge of it: when great, be wary; when ſucceſsful, reſerved; when riſing, ſtayed; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that Age when men were poyſoned with Oyl, and undone with Honey: when active, modeſt; when checked, yeilding; when dandled, diſtruſtful; when flattered, fearful; when great, not abſolute, (as my Lord would have been in point of favour againſt my Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> and valour againſt my Lord <hi>Norris.)</hi> Serve not your Followers, but employ them: Let others ſervice adminiſter to your deſigne, not your power to theirs: Let great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons encourage greater; and let Honour be your merit, and not your expectation. Some have been
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:29485:236"/>
buſie in the enquiry of what reaſon the Virgin-Queen had for her kindneſs to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and this man, (if there be a reaſon in any, much leſs in Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al love, ſave the affection its ſelf that bears it) true, he had Vertue and ſuffering enough at his firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to engage the kindneſs and the pity of a worſe Princeſs: yet ſome then diſcourſed of a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Stars that made way for that of their minds. Certainly (ſaith <hi>Cambden)</hi> the inclination of Princes to ſome perſons, and their disfavour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, may ſeem fatal, and guided by high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers.</p>

               <head>A Parallel between the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by <hi>H. W.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe beginning of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> I muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute wholly, or in great part to my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> but yet as an Introducer or ſupporter, not as a Teacher: for as I go along, it will eaſily appear, that he neither lived nor died by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Always certain it is, that he drew him firſt into the fatal Circle from a kinde of reſolved pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateneſs at his houſe at <hi>Lampſie,</hi> in <hi>South-wales;</hi> where, after the Academical life, he had taken ſuch a taſte of the Rural, (as I have heard him ſay) and not upon any flaſhes or fumes of Melancholy, or traverſes of diſcontent, but in a ſerene and quiet mood, that he could well have bent his mind to a retired courſe. About which time, the ſaid Earl
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:29485:236"/>
of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> bewrayed a meaning to plant him in the Queens favour: which was diverſly interpreted by ſuch as thought that great Artizan of Court to do nothing by chance, nor much by affection. Some therefore were of opinion, that feeling more and more in himſelf the weight of time, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tired (if there be a ſatiety in power) with that aſſiduous attendance, and intenſive circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which a long-indulgent fortune did require, he was grown not unwilling, for his own eaſe, to beſtow handſomely upon another ſome part of the pains, and perhaps of the envy.</p>
               <p>Others conceived rather, that having before for the ſame ends brought in, or let in Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and having found him ſuch an Apprentice as knew well enough how to ſet up for himſelf, he now meant to allie him with this young Earl, who had yet taken no ſtrong impreſſions. For though the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was a little before this, whereof I now ſpeak by occaſion, much fallen from his former ſplendour in Court: yet he ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in ſome luſtre of a favoured man, like billows that ſink by degrees, even when the wind is down that firſt ſtirred them.</p>
               <p>Thus runs the diſcourſe of that time at pleaſure; yet I am not ignorant that there was ſome good while a very ſtiff averſation in my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> from applying himſelf to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> for what ſecret conceit I know not; but howſoever, that humour was mollified by time, and by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and to the Court he came under his Lord.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had another kinde of Germination; and ſurely had he been a plant, he would have been reckoned amongſt the <hi>Sponte Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentes:</hi>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:29485:237"/>
for he ſprung without any help by a kinde of congenial compoſure (as we may term it) to the likeneſs of our late Soveraign and Maſter of ever bleſſed memory; who taking him into his regard, taught him more and more to pleaſe himſelf, and moulded him. (as it were) Platonically to his own <hi>Idea;</hi> delighting firſt in the choice of the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, becauſe he found him ſuſceptible of good form; and afterward by degrees, as great Architects uſe to do, in the workmanſhip of his Regal hand: nor ſtaying here, after he had hardned and poliſhed him about ten years in the School of obſervance, (for ſo a Court is) and in the furnace of tryal about himſelf, (for he was a King could peruſe men as well as Books) he made him the aſſociate of his Heir apparent, together with the new Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> (as an adjunct of ſingular experience and truſt) in forraign travels, and in a buſineſs of love, and of no equal hazard (if the tenderneſs of our zeal did not then deceive us) enough (the world muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) to kindle affection even betwixt the diſtanteſt conditions; ſo as by the various and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation abroad, (beſides that before and after at home) with the moſt conſtant and beſt-natured Prince, <hi>Bona ſi ſua norint,</hi> as ever <hi>England</hi> enjoyed, this Duke becomes now ſecondly ſeized of favour, as it were by deſcent, (though the condition of that eſtate be no more then a Tenancy at Will, or at moſt for the life of the firſt Lord) and rarely tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which I have briefly ſet down, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the vail of the Temple, I mean into the ſecret of high inclinations; ſince even Satyrical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, (who are otherwiſe of ſo licentious fancy) are in this point modeſt enough to confeſs their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

               </p>
               <p>And theſe were both their Springings and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, as I may call them.</p>
               <p>In the profluence or proceedings of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I obſerve likewiſe not onely much difference between them, but in the Earl not a little from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Firſt, all his hopes of advancement had like to be ſtrangled almoſt in the very Cradle, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into the Portugal Voyage without the Queens conſent, or ſo much as her knowledge; whereby he left his Friends and Dependents near ſix months in deſperate ſuſpenſe what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him. And to ſpeak truth, not without good reaſon: For firſt, they might well conſider, That he was himſelf not well plumed in favour for ſuch a flight: beſides, that now he wanted a Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> at home (for he was dead the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to ſmooth his abſence, and to quench the practices at Court. But above all, it lay open to every mans diſcourſe, that though the bare offence to his Soveraign and Miſtriſs was too great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, yet much more when ſhe might (as in this caſe) have fairly diſcharged her diſpleaſure upon her Laws. Notwithſtanding, a noble report co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home before him, at his return all was clear, and this excurſion was eſteemed but a Sally of youth. Nay, he grew every day more and more in her gracious conceit: whether ſuch intermiſſions as theſe do ſometimes foment affection; or that having committed a fault, he became the more obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious and plyant to redeem it; or that ſhe had not
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:29485:238"/>
received into her Royal Breaſt any ſhadows of his popularity.</p>
               <p>There was another time long after, when Sir <hi>Fulke Grevil,</hi> (late Lord <hi>Brooke)</hi> a man in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance intrinſecal with him, or at the leaſt admitted to his Melancholy hours, either belike eſpying ſome wearineſs in the Queen; or perhaps, with little change of the word, though more in the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome marks towards him, and working upon the preſent matter, (as ſhe was dexterous and cloſe) had almoſt ſuper-induced into favour the Earl of <hi>Southampton;</hi> which yet being timely diſcovered, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> choſe to evaporate his thoughts in a Sonnet (being his common way) to be ſung before the Queen, (as it was) by one <hi>Hales,</hi> in whoſe voyce ſhe took ſome pleaſure; whereof the complot me thinks had as much of the Hermit as of the Poet:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And if thou ſhould'ſt by Her be now forſaken,</l>
                  <l>She made thy Heart too ſtrong for to be ſhaken.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>As if he had been caſting one eye back at the leaſt to his former retiredneſs. But all this likewiſe quickly vaniſhed, and there was a good while after fair weather over-head. Yet ſtill, I know not how, like a gathering of Clouds, till towards his latter time, when his humours grew tart, as being now in the <hi>Lees</hi> of favour, it brake forth into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuddain receſſes; ſometimes from the Court to <hi>Wanſteed,</hi> otherwhiles unto <hi>Greenwich,</hi> often to his own Chamber, Doors ſhut, Viſits forbidden; and which was worſe, divers conteſtations (between) with the Queen her ſelf, (all preambles of ruine)
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:29485:238"/>
wherewith though now and then he did wring out of her Majeſty ſome petty contentments, (as a man would preſs ſowre Grapes) yet in the mean time was forgotten the counſel of a wiſe, and then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Friend, who told him, that ſuch courſes as thoſe were like hot Waters, which help at a pang, but if they be too often uſed, will ſpoil the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</p>
               <p>On the Dukes part, we have no ſuch abrupt ſtrains and precipees as theſe, but a fair, fluent and uniform courſe under both Kings: And ſurely, as there was in his natural Conſtitution a marvellous equality, whereof I ſhall ſpeak more afterwards; ſo there was an image of it in his Fortune, running (if I may borrow an ancient compariſon) as ſmoothly as a numerous Verſe, till it met with certain Rubs in <hi>Parliament,</hi> whereof I am induced by the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which I handle, to ſay ſomewhat, ſo far as ſhall concern the difference between their times.</p>
               <p>WHen my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſtood in favour, the Parliaments were calm: nay, I find it a true obſervation, that there was no impeachment of any Nobleman by the Commons from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, until the eighteenth of King <hi>James,</hi> nor any intervenient precedent of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not that ſomething or other could be wanting to be ſaid, while men are men: For not to go high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we are taught eaſily ſo much by the very Ballads and Libels of <hi>Leiceſtrian</hi> time.</p>
               <p>But about the aforeſaid year, many young ones being choſen into the Houſe of Commons more then had been uſual in great Councils, (who though of the weakeſt wings, are the higheſt Flyers) there
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:29485:239"/>
aroſe a certain unfortunate and unfruitful Spirit in ſome places; not ſowing, but picking at every ſtone in the field, rather then tending to the general har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. And thus far the conſideration of the Nature of the Time hath tranſported me, and the occaſion of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Now on the other ſide, I muſt with the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty obſerve two weighty and watchful ollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, (as I may call them) which kept the Earl in extream and continual Caution, like a bow ſtill bent, whereof the Dukes thoughts were abſolutely free.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he was to wreſtle with a Queens declining, or rather with her very ſetting Age, (as we may term it) which, beſides other reſpects, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even of it ſelf the more umbratious and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, as for the moſt part all Horizons are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with certain Vapour towards their Evening.</p>
               <p>The other was a matter of more Circumſtance, ſtanding thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Princes, eſpecially thoſe whom God hath not bleſſed with natural iſſue, are (by wiſdome of State) ſomewhat ſhie of their Succeſſors; and to ſpeak with due Reverence, there may be reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Queens Regnant, a little proportion of tenderneſs that way, more then in Kings. Now there were in Court two names of <hi>Power,</hi> and almoſt of <hi>Affection,</hi> the <hi>Eſſexian</hi> and the <hi>Cecilian,</hi> with their adherents, both well enough enjoying the preſent, and yet both looking to the future; and therefore both holding correſpondency with ſome of the principal in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements and inſtructions, either from them, or immediately from the King as induciat Heir of this Imperial Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:29485:239"/>
But leſt they might detect one another, this was myſteriouſly carried by ſeveral inſtruments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, and on the <hi>Eſſexian</hi> ſide, in truth, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite hazard: for Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> who (as Secretary of State) did diſpoſe the publick Addreſſes, had prompter and ſafer conveyance; whereupon I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but relate a memorable paſſage on either part, as the ſtory following ſhall declare.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had accommodated Maſter <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Bacon</hi> in partition of his Houſe, and had aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a noble entertainment. This was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of impotent feet, but a nimble head; and through his hand run all the intelligences with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> who being of a provident nature, (contrary to his brother the Lord Viſcount Saint <hi>Albans)</hi> and well knowing the advantage of a dangerous Secret, would many times cunningly let fall ſome words, as if he could amend his Fortunes under the <hi>Cecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (to whom he was near of alliance, and in blood alſo) and who had made (as he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing ſhould be believed) ſome great profers to win him away: which once or twice he preſſed ſo far, and with ſuch tokens and ſignes of apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to my Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> (who was of the party, and ſtood himſelf in much Umbrage with the Queen) that he flees preſently to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (with whom he was commonly <hi>prima admiſſiones)</hi> by his bed-ſide in the morning, and tells him, that unleſs that Gentleman were preſently ſatisfied with ſome round ſum, all would be vented.</p>
               <p>This took the Earl at that time ill provided, (as indeed oftentimes his Coffers were low) whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was fain ſuddenly to give him <hi>Eſſex-</hi>houſe;

which the good old Lady <hi>Walſingham</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſ-engage out of her own ſtore with 2500 pound; and before, he had diſtilled 1500 pound at another time by the ſame skill. So as we rate this one ſecret, as it was finely carried, at 4000 pounds in preſent money, beſides at the leaſt 1000 pound of annual penſion to a private and bed-rid Gentleman: What would he have gotten if he could have gone about his own buſineſs?</p>
               <p>There was another accident of the ſame nature on the <hi>Cecilian</hi> ſide, much more pleaſant, but leſs chargeable, for it coſt nothing but wit. The Queen having for a good while not heard any thing from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and being thirſty of news, it fell out that her Majeſty going to take the air towards the heath, (the Court being then at <hi>Greenwich)</hi> and Maſter Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> then attending her, a Poſt came croſſing by, and blew his Horn: The Queen out of curioſity asked him from whence the Diſpatch came; and being anſwered, From <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſhe ſtops her Coach, and calleth for the Packet. The Secretary, though he knew there were ſome Letters in it from his Correſpondents, which to diſcover, were as ſo many Serpents; yet made more ſhew of diligence then of doubt to obey; and asks ſome that ſtood by (forſooth in great haſte) for a Knife to cut up the Packet, (for otherwiſe he might perhaps awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a little apprehenſion) but in the mean time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching with the Packet in his hand, at a pretty diſtance from the Queen, he telleth her it looked and ſmelt ill-favouredly coming out of a filthy Budget, and that it ſhould be fit firſt to open and air it, becauſe he knew ſhe was averſe from ill Scents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:29485:240"/>
And ſo being diſmiſſed home, he got leiſure by this ſeaſonable ſhift, to ſever what he would not have ſeen.</p>
               <p>Theſe two accidents preciſely true, and known to few, I have reported as not altogether extravagant from my purpoſe, to ſhew how the Earl ſtood in certain perplexities, wherewith the Dukes days were not diſtracted. And this hath been the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part (as it were) touching the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the riſing and flowing of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>I will now conſider their ſeveral Endowments both of <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Minde,</hi> and then a little of their <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl was a pretty deal the taller, and much the ſtronger, and of the abler body: but the Duke had the neater limbs, and free delivery; he was alſo the uprighter, and of the more comely moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the Earl did bend a little in the neck, though rather forwards then downwards: and he was ſo far from being a good Dancer, that he was no graceful Goer. If we touch particulars, the Duke exceeded in the daintineſs of his leg and foot, and the Earl in the incomparable fairneſs and fine ſhape of his hands; which (though it be but femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine praiſe) he took from his Father: for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Air, the Earl had the cloſer and more reſerved Countenance, being by nature ſomewhat more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative, and (which was ſtrange) never more then at Meals, when others are leaſt: Inſomuch, as he was wont to make his obſervation of himſelf, that to ſolve any knotty buſineſs which cumbred his
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:29485:241"/>
mind, his ableſt hours were when he had checked his firſt appetite with two or three morſels, after which he ſate uſually for a good while ſilent: yet he would play well and willingly at ſome games of greateſt attention; which ſhewed, that when he liſted he could licence his thoughts.</p>
               <p>The Duke on the other ſide, even in the midſt of ſo many diverſions, had continually a very pleaſant and vacant face, (as I may well call it) proceeding no doubt from a ſingular aſſurance in his temper. And yet I muſt here give him a rarer Elogie, which the maligneſt eye cannot deny him, That certainly never man in his place and power, did entertain greatneſs more familiarly, nor whoſe looks were leſs tainted with his felicity; wherein I inſiſt the rather, becauſe this in my judgement was one of his greateſt Vertues and Victories of himſelf.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: in the attiring and ornament of their bodies, the Duke had a fine and unaffected politeneſs, and upon occaſion coſtly, as in his Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Earl as he grew more and more attentive to buſineſs and matter, ſo leſs and leſs curious of cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: inſomuch, as I do remember, thoſe about him had a conceit that poſſibly ſometimes when he went up to the Queen, he might ſcant know what he had on: for this was his manner: His Chamber being commonly ſtived with Friends or Suiters of one kinde or other, when he gave his legs, arms, and breaſt to his ordinary ſervants to button and dreſs him with little heed, his head and face to his Barbour, his eyes to his letters, and ears to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and many times all at once, then the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Robes throwing a cloak over his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:29485:241"/>
he would make a ſtep into his Cloſet, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort prayer, he was gone: only in his Baths, he was ſomewhat delicate. For point of diet and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, they were both inordinate in their appetites, eſpecially the Earl, who was by nature of ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a taſte, that I muſt tell a rare thing of him (though it be but a homely note) that he would ſtop in the midſt of any phyſical Potion, and after he had licked his lips, he would drink off the reſt; but I am wearie of ſuch ſlight Animadverſions.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the inward furniture of their minds, I will thus much declare.</p>
               <p>The Earl was of good Erudition, having been placed at ſtudy in <hi>Cambridge</hi> very young by the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> his Guardian, with affectionate and deliberate care, under the overſight of Doctor <hi>Whitgift,</hi> then Maſter of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi> and after Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> A man (by the way) ſurely of a moſt reverend and ſacred memory, and (as I may well ſay) even of the Primitive temper, when the Church in lowlineſs of temper did flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in high examples, which I have inſerted as a due recordation of his vertues, having been much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him for many favours in my younger time.</p>
               <p>About ſixteen years of his age (for thither he came at twelve) he took the formality of Maſter of Arts, and kept his publick Acts. And here I muſt not ſmother what I have received by conſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that his own Father dyed with a very cold conceit of him, ſome ſay through the affection to his ſecond ſon <hi>Walter Devereux,</hi> who was indeed a diamond of the time, and both of an hardy and delicate temper and mixture,: But it ſeemes, this Earl, like certain vegetables, did bud and open ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:29485:242"/>
Nature ſometimes delighting to play an after-game as well as Fortune, which had both their turnes and tides in courſe.</p>
               <p>The Duke was Illiterate, yet had learned at Court, firſt to ſift and queſtion well, and to ſupply his own defects by the drawing or flowing unto him of the beſt Inſtruments of experience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, from whom he had a ſweet and attractive manner, to ſuck what might be for the publike or his own proper uſe; ſo as the leſs he was favoured by the Muſes, he was the more by the Graces.</p>
               <p>To conſider them in their pure Naturals, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Earls Intellectuall faculties to have been his ſtronger part, and in the Duke his Practical.</p>
               <p>Yet all know, that he likewiſe at the firſt was much under the expectation of his after-proof; ſuch a ſudden influence therein had the Soveraign aſpect. For their Abilities of diſcourſe or pen, the Earl was a very acute and ſound ſpeaker when he would intend it; and for his Writings, they are beyond example, eſpecially in his familiar Letters and things of delight at Court, when he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his ſerious habits, as may be yet ſeen in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes and inventions of entertainment; and above all, in his darling piece of love, and ſelf-love; his Stile was an elegant perſpicuity, rich of phraſe, but ſeldome any bold Metaphors, and ſo far from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, that it rather wanted a little Elevation.</p>
               <p>The Dukes delivery of his mind I conceive not to be ſo ſharpe as ſolid and grave, not ſo ſolid and deep as pertinent, and appoſite to the times and occaſions.</p>
               <p>The Earl I account the more liberal, and the Duke the more magnificent; for I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:29485:242"/>
that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in all his life-time did build or adorne any houſe, the Queene perchance ſpending his time, and himſelf his meanes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inclining to popular ways; for we know the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are apter to applaud houſ-keepers, then houſ-rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. They were both great cheriſhers of Scholars and Divines; but it ſeems, the Earl had obtained of himſelf one ſingular point, that he could depart his affection between two extremes: for though he bare always a kinde of filial reverence towards Dr <hi>Whitgift,</hi> both before and after he was Archbiſhop; yet on the other ſide, he did not a little love and tender Maſter <hi>Cartwright,</hi> though I think truly, with large diſtinction between the perſons and the Cauſes, howſoever he was taxed with other ends in reſpecting that party.</p>
               <p>They were both fair-ſpoken Gentlemem, not prone and eager to detract openly from any man; in this the Earl hath been moſt falſly blemiſhed in our vulgar Story: only againſt one man he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn all patience, namely <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and would call him <hi>(per Excellentiam)</hi> the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant (as if it had been an Emblem of his name) even to the Queen her ſelf, though of no ſmall inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation with her; and one Lady likewiſe (that I may civilly ſpare to no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inate, for her ſex ſake) whom he uſed to terme the Spyder of the Court: yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the ſenſitive part of their Natures the Earl was the worſe Philoſopher, being a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter and a weak Diſſembler of the leaſt diſgrace: And herein likewiſe, as in the reſt, no Good Pupill to my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who was wont to put all his paſſions in his pocket.</p>
               <p>In the growth of their Fortunes, the Duke was a
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:29485:243"/>
little the ſwifter, and much the greater; for from a younger brothers meane eſtate, he roſe to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree whereof a Subject was capable either in Title or Truſt. Therein I muſt confeſſe much more conſortable to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> under <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> who was equall to him in both.</p>
               <p>For matter of Donative and addition of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I do not believe that the Duke did much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, all conſidered, under both Kings.</p>
               <p>For that which the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had received from her Majeſty, beſides the Fees of his Offices, and the diſpoſition of great Summes of money in her Armies, was (about the time of his Arraignment, when faults uſe to be aggravated with precedent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits) valued at three hundred thouſand pounds ſterling in pure gift for his onely uſe, to the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> then Lord Treaſurer; who was a wiſe man, and a ſtrict Computiſt, and not ill affected towards him. And yet it is worthy of note in the Margent of both Times, that the one was proſecuted with ſilence, and the other with murmur; ſo undoing a meaſure is popular judgment.</p>
               <p>I cannot here omit between them a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in eſtabliſhing of both their Fortunes and Fames.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the Duke had a care to introduce into neer place at the Court divers of his confident Servants, and into high places very ſound and grave Perſonages. Whereas, except a Penſioner or two, we can ſcant name any one man advanced of the Earls breeding, but Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> having been his Secretary, who yet came never further (though married into a noble Houſe) then to the
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:29485:243"/>
Clerk of the Councell, and Regiſter of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: not that the Earl meant to ſtand alone like a Subſtantive (for he was not ſo ill a <hi>Grammarian</hi> in Court;) but the Truth is, in this point the <hi>Cecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> kept him back, as very well knowing that upon every little abſence or diſaſſiduity, he ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to take cold at his back.</p>
               <p>For the Other, in managing of their Fames, I note between them a direct contrary wiſdome; For the Earl proceeded by way of Apology, which he wrote and diſperſed with his own hands at large, though till his going to <hi>Ireland</hi> they were but aiery objections. But of the Duke this I know, that one having offered for his eaſe to do him that kinde of Service; He refuſed it with a pretty kinde of thankfull ſcorn, ſaying, that he would truſt his own good intentions which God knew, and leave to him the pardoning of his Errours; and that he ſaw no fruit of Apologies, but the multiplying of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: which ſurely was a well-ſetled Maxime. And for my own particular (though I am not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to his memory) in the expreſſion of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Neque injuria, neque beneficia,</hi> ſaving that he ſhewed me an ordinary good Countenance: And if I were, yet I would diſtinguiſh between Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Truth. I muſt bear him this Teſtimony, that in a Commiſſion laid upon me by Soveraign Command to examine a Lady about a certain fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy accuſation grounded upon nothing but a few ſingle names taken up by a Footman in a kennel, and ſtraight baptized, A liſt of ſuch as the Duke had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be poyſoned at home, himſelf being then in <hi>Spain:</hi> I found it to be the moſt malicious and frantick ſurmiſe, and the moſt contrary to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29485:244"/>
that I think had ever been brewed from the beginning of the World, howſoever countenanced by a Libellous Pamphlet of a fugitive Phyſician e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Print; and yet of this would not the Duke ſuffer any anſwer to be made on his behalf, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he was to his own principles.</p>
               <p>In their Military Services the Characters of the Earls imployments were theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His forwardeſt was that of <hi>Portugal,</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>The ſaddeſt, that of <hi>Roan,</hi> where he loſt his brave Brother.</p>
               <p>His fortunateſt peece I eſteem the taking of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz Malez,</hi> and no leſs modeſt; for there he wrote with his own hands a cenſure of his Omiſſions.</p>
               <p>His jealouſeſt imployment was to the relief of <hi>Calais</hi> beſieged by the Cardinall Arch-duke: about which, there paſſed then between the Queen and the French King much Art.</p>
               <p>His Voiage to the <hi>Azores</hi> was the beſt, for the diſcovery of the Spaniſh weakneſs, and otherwiſe almoſt a ſaving Voiage.</p>
               <p>His blackeſt was that to <hi>Ireland,</hi> ordained to be the Sepulchre of his Father, and the Gulph of his own Fortunes.</p>
               <p>But the firſt in 88, at <hi>Tilbury-camp,</hi> was in my judgement the very poyſon of all that followed; for there whileſt the Queen ſtood in ſome doubt of a <hi>Spaniſh Invaſion</hi> (though it proved but a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice-dance upon our Waves) ſhe made him in Field Commander of the Cavalry (as he was before in Court) and much graced him openly in view of the Souldiers and people, even above my Lord of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter:</hi>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:29485:244"/>
the truth is, from thenceforth he fed too faſt.</p>
               <p>The Dukes employment abroad in this nature, was onely in the Action of the <hi>Iſle of Reez,</hi> of which I muſt note ſomewhat for the honour of our Country, and of his Majeſties times, and of them that periſhed and ſurvived, and to redeem it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from miſ-underſtanding. Therefore after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry amongſt the wiſeſt and moſt indifferent men; of that Action I dare pronounce, that all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances pondered, A tumultuary banding on our part, with one thouſand in the whole on theirs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive us with two hundred horſe, with neer two thouſand foot, and watching their beſt time of advantage none of their foot diſcovered by us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor ſo much as ſuſpected, and onely ſome of their Horſe deſcried ſtragling, but not in any bulk or body: their Cavalry not a Troop of <hi>Baſcoigners</hi> mounted in haſte, but the Greater part Gentlemen of Family, and of pickt Reſolution, and ſuch as charged home both in Front and on both Flanks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Sea; about <hi>ſixſcore</hi> of their two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe ſtrewed upon the Sand, and none of them but one killed with a great ſhot; and after this their foot likewiſe coming on to charge, till not liking the buſineſs they fell to flinging of ſtones, and ſo walked away:</p>
               <p>I ſay, theſe things conſidered and laid together, we have great reaſon to repute it a great impreſſion upon an unknowne place, and a noble argument that upon occaſion we have not loſt our ancient vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Only I could wiſh that the Duke, who then in the animating of the ſouldiers ſhewed them very eminent aſſurance of his valour, had afterwards
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:29485:245"/>
remembred that rule of <hi>Apelles, Manum de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula.</hi> But he was greedy of honour, and hot upon the publique ends, and too confident in the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of beginnings, as ſomewhere <hi>Polybius, that great Critique</hi> of war, obſerveth of young Leaders whom fortune hath not before deceived. In this their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary care and diſpenſation of reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was very few remarkable occaſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke, ſaving his continuall vigilancie and voluntary hazard of his perſon, and kindneſſes to the Souldiers, both from his own table and purſe; for there could be few diſorders within an Iland where the troops had no ſcope to disband, and the Inferior Commanders were ſtill in ſight.</p>
               <p>In the Earl we have two examples of his ſeverity, the one in the Iſland Voyage, where he threw a Souldier with his own hands out of a Ship; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he decimated certain troops that ran away, renewing a peece of the Roman Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, we have many of his Lenitie, and one of his Facility, when he did connive at the bold treſpaſs of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who before his arrival at <hi>Fyall,</hi> had banded there againſt his preciſe Commandment; at which time he let fall a Noble word, being preſſed by one, (whoſe name I need not remember) that at the leaſt he would put him upon a Martial Court: That I would do (ſaid he) if he were not my friend.</p>
               <p>And now I am drawing towards the laſt Act, which was written in the Book of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>At the Earls end I was abroad, but when I came
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:29485:245"/>
home (though little was left for Writers to gleane after Judges) yet, I ſpent ſome curioſity to ſearch what it might be that could precipitate him into ſuch a prodigious Cataſtrophe; and I muſt, according to my profeſſed freedome, deliver a circumſtance or two of ſome weight in the truth of that ſtory, which was neither diſcovered at his arraignment, nor after in any of his private confeſſions.</p>
               <p>There was amongſt his neareſt attendants one <hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> a man of ſecret ambitious ends of his own, and of proportionate Counſels ſmothered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the habit of a Scholar, and ſlubbered over with 2 certain rude and clowniſh faſhion, that had the ſemblance of iutegrity.</p>
               <p>This Perſon not above five or ſix weeks before my Lords fatall irruption into the City, was by the Earls ſpecial Command ſuddainly diſcharged from all further attendance, or acceſſe unto him, out of an inward diſpleaſure then taken againſt his ſharp and importune infuſions, and out of a glimmering overſight, that he would prove the very inſtrument of his Ruine.</p>
               <p>I muſt adde hereunto, that about the ſame time my Lord had received from the Counteſſe of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> (a Lady powerfull in the Court, and indeed a vertuous uſer of her power) the beſt advice that I think was ever given from either ſex; That when he was free from reſtraint, he ſhould cloſely take any out-lodging at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and ſometimes when the Queene went abroad in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, (whereof ſhe would give him notice) he ſhould come forth, and humble himſelf before her in the field.</p>
               <p>This Counſell ſunk much into him, and for ſome
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:29485:246"/>
days he reſolved it: but in the meane time, through the interceſſion of the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> whom <hi>Cuffe</hi> had gained, he was reſtored to my Lords ear, and ſo working advantage upon his diſgraces, and upon the vaine foundation of Vulgar breath, which hurts many good men, ſpun out the final deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Maſter and himſelf, and almoſt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer, if his pardon had not been won by inches.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the Earl in <hi>Weſt minſter-ball</hi> did in generall diſcloſe the evill perſwaſions of this man; but the particulars which I have related by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reſtitution, he buried in his owne breſt for ſome reaſons apparent enough; Indeed (as I conjecture) not to exaſperate the Caſe of my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> though he might therewith a little peradventure have mollified his own. The whole and true Report I had by infallible meanes from the perſon himſelf that both brought the advice from the aforeſaid excellent Lady, and carried the diſcharge to <hi>Cuffe,</hi> who in a private Chamber was ſtrucken therewith into a Sound almoſt dead to the Earth, as if he had fallen from ſome high ſteeple; ſuch Terrets of hope he had built in his own fancy.</p>
               <p>Touching the Dukes ſuddain period, how others have repreſented it unto their Fancies, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: for my part, I muſt confeſſe from my Soul that I never recall it to minde without a deep and double aſtoniſhment of my diſcourſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of the very horrour and atrocity of the Fact in a Chriſtian Court, under ſo moderate a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but much more at the impudencie of the pretence, whereby a deſperate diſcontented Aſſaſſinate would after the perpetration have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſted
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:29485:246"/>
a meere private revenge (as by precedent Circumſtances is evident enough) with I know not what publick reſpects, and would fain have given it a Parliamentary cover howſoever. Thus theſe two great Peers were diſ-roabed of their Glory, the one by judgment, the other by violence, which was the ſmall diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Now after this ſhort contemplation of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, (for much more might have been ſpoken, but that I was fitter for Rhapſody then commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary) I am laſtly deſirous to take a Summary view of their Conformities, which I verily believe will be found as many, though perchance heeded by few, as are extant in any of the ancient Parallel.</p>
               <p>They both ſlept long in the arms of Fortune: They were both of ancient blood, and of Forraign extraction: They were both of ſtrait and goodly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of able and active bodies: They were both induſtrious &amp; aſſiduous, and attentive to their ends: They were both early Privie Counſellours, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at home in the ſecreteſt and weightieſt affairs in Court and State: They were both likewiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders abroad in Chief, as well by Sen as by Land: both Maſters of the Horſe at home, both choſen Chancellours of the ſame Univerſity, namely, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:</hi> They were both indubitable ſtrong, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded men; yet of ſweet and accoſtable nature, almoſt equally delighting in the preſs and affluence of Dependants and Suiters, which are always the Burres, and ſometimes the Briers of Favourites. They were both married to very vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſole Heirs, and left iſſue of either Sex; and both their Wives converted to contrary Religions. They were both in themſelves rare and excellent

               </head>
               <p>SIr <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was well deſcended, and of good Alliance, but poor in his beginning. He was one ſo toſſed by fortune to and fro, that he was ſometimes high, ſometimes low, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a middle condition. He was brought up in the Univerſity and Innes of Court, but he ſtayed not long in a place: and being the youngeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Houſe diminiſhed in Patrimony, he foreſaw his own deſtiny, that he was firſt to roul (through want and diſability) before he could come to a repoſe. He firſt expoſed himſelf to the Land-ſervice of <hi>Ireland</hi> (a Militia) which then did not yield him food and raiment; nor had he pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſtay there, (though ſhortly after he came thither again) under the command of the Lord <hi>Grey.</hi> As for his Native parts, and thoſe of his own acquiring, he had in the outward man a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, in a handſom and well-compacted perſon, a ſtrong natural wit, and a better judgement, with a bold and plauſible tongue, whereby he could ſet out his parts to the beſt advantage; and to theſe he had the adjuncts of ſome general learning, which by diligence he enforced to a great Augmentation, and Perfection; for he was an indefatigable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether by Sea or Land, and none of the leaſt obſervers both of Men and the Times. Falling from that ſudden grace, which he by his parts had
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:29485:252"/>
gained of the Queen, he went aſide for a while, but at his return he came in with the greater ſtrength, and ſo continued to her laſt, great in her favour, and Captain of the Guard. His prudence <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi> his capacity, and his induſtry <hi>ſerved</hi> it; raiſing his fortune as high as his parts, and his parts as high as his mind. His Motto was, <hi>Either dye</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or <hi>live</hi> honorably. Never man proſpered, but the reſolute, and he that hath awaked an eaſie, ſoft, ſleepy, or indifferent temper, to the noble adventure of being <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or being none: a diſpoſition meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large and capacious ſoul in this Gentleman, taught him the exact diſcipline of War in <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Low Countries, the great skill of a Sea-man between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and a patience as ſevere in enduring hardſhip, as his neceſſity in requiring it. Five hours he ſlept, four he read, two he diſcourſed; allowing the reſt to his buſineſs and his neceſſities: no Soldier fared or lay harder, none ventured further: what is not <hi>extraordinary</hi> (he would ſay) is <hi>nothing:</hi> It being the end of all Arts and Sciences to direct men by certain rules unto <q>the moſt compendious way in their knowledge and practice: thoſe things of which in our ſelves we have onely ſome imperfect confuſed notions, being herein fully and clearly repreſented to our view from the diſcoveries that other men have made, after much ſtudy and long experience; and there is nothing of greater conſequence for the advancement of Learning, than to finde out thoſe particular advantages which there are for the ſhorteſt way of knowing and teaching things in every profeſſion.</q> There was not an expert Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier or Sea-man, but he conſulted; not a printed
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:29485:252"/>
or manuſcript diſcourſe of Navigation or War but he peruſed; nor were there exacter rules or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for both ſervices, than he drew: ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative he was, that you would think he was not active; ſo active that you would ſay he was not prudent—A great Soldier, and yet an excellent Courtier: an accompliſhed Gallant, and yet a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh man; a man that ſeemed born for any thing he undertook: his wit brought him to Court, and kept him there; for there happening a difference between him and my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> under whom he ſerved in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was heard before the Council-Table, <hi>Rawleigh</hi> ſtated his caſe with that clearneſſe, urged his arguments with that evidence and reaſon, offered his Apologies with thoſe <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> allegations, and his Replies with that ſmartneſſe; expreſſed himſelf with that fluency and eloquence, and managed his carriage and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with that diſcretion, that he was firſt the States-mens obſervation, next her Majeſties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and at laſt her Oracle; as who was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in his comprehenſive diſcourſes to her of her private intereſt in every part of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in his effectual Speeches to her Subjects in Parliament touching theirs in every part of their duty.</p>
               <p>Two things he obſerved in his Miſtriſs;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That ſhe was penurious in her Largeſſes.</item>
                  <item>2. That ſhe was choice in her Favourites.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Whence he concluded, that there was no good to be done unleſſe he got an eſtate firſt, and then a reputation.</p>
               <p>To the firſt, we owe his Sea-voyages, when his whole fortune was often put up in one ſhip;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:29485:253"/>
And to the laſt, his Land-ſervices, when all his expectation depended on one action. Two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals he obſerved, <hi>Eſſex</hi> for action, <hi>Cecil</hi> for counſel: The one he went under abroad, to outvy him; the other he complyed with at home, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine him: but wanting ſtrength, though not parts to be both their Corrivals, he periſhed, becauſe not thought to own humility enough to be their ſervants. <hi>Cecill</hi> indeed was his friend, becauſe <hi>Eſſex</hi> was his enemy: but he taught him, <hi>That it was more ſafe at Court to have many enemies of equall power, than one falſe and ambitious friend, that hath attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the abſoluteneſſe of command:</hi> But this he was often heard to ſay, he did not apprehend, before his Genius had dictated it to him, as he came in a Boat from the execution of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which was done at the Tower.—Yet two wayes I finde him getting up: 1. By uncouth projects in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond expectation; which (though they might oblige his Miſtriſs) together with an opinion of his irreligion, loſt him with the People. 2. By extraordinary undertakings in Warre beyond his Commiſſion; which (though performed to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do his Generals) had forfeited his head to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and juſtice, had not his wit complyed with their eafineſſe and goodneſſe. It's a queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Curioſoes,</hi> whether his often abſence from Court was his <hi>prudence,</hi> or his <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> it being a <hi>quodlibet,</hi> whether that diſtance was a greater al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to his <hi>enemies malice,</hi> or his <hi>Soveraigns love;</hi> while his forreign actions were not ſo cloſe at her ear to his advantage, as his Adverſaries applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his diſparagement.</p>
               <p>Two things I muſt needs ſay are wonderful in

               <p>Touching the firſt, he that ſhall conſider his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious way of ſtudy, immers'd in almoſt infinite reading and obſervation, to which the running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of innumerable books, and a vaſt multitude of men was neceſſary: His Obligations to read not onely common Authors, but all Records, Schemes, and Papers that he could come by: His correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with Friends and Strangers; his review of his own Papers (which he fate cloſe to by Sea and Land) that never paſſed him without three tranſcriptions; his reception of viſits, whether of civility, or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or diſcourſe, which were numerous, and great devourers of his time; his agency for all ſorts of perſons (his intereſt with his thrifty Miſtriſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt part of his penſion) in which capacity he ſet up a kinde of Office of Addreſs—his Letters, which coſt him one day in the week: The time loſt upon his misfortunes, which made it neceſſary for him often to break his great ſeries and method of undertaking. He, I ſay, that ſhall compute, and ſum up this, the particulars whereof are nakedly told without any ſtraining of the truth, or flouriſh of expreſſion, muſt be <hi>much</hi> to ſeek how a man of ſo many actions ſhould write any thing, and one of ſo many writings ſhould do any thing; and <hi>more,</hi> how one of ſo many fatall diverſions could keep up a ſteady minde for thoſe great, but exact arguments that it hath left in the world; eſpecially when there was one very difficult particular in all his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, <hi>viz.</hi> that none of his Diſcourſes with which his Hiſtory or other Books are embelliſhed, paſſed his exact hand before the moſt knowing and moſt

learned men in that faculty to which thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes belonged, had debated them before him; who after their departure ſummed up all into thoſe excellent pieces now abroad under his name, which I blame not King <hi>James</hi> for envying, being the neareſt his own: though I think not that learned Prince of ſo low a ſpirit, as <q>out of an impertinent emulation to affect Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> the leſſe, for the great repute that followed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his pen; which being more dangerous than his Sword, I wonder that wiſe Prince indulged him, eſpecially ſince that Maſter <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> a little before the Wars was at the charge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p n="2">2 To the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the weakneſſe of the laſt part of his life: 1.

Fortune did him not ſo much wrong in his mean Birth, as he did himſelf right by <hi>great merit,</hi> ſo worthy a Prince's ſervice, and a <hi>Courts</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: He read and ſaw what others did, but not with others apprehenſions; <hi>his</hi> judgement of things being not common, nor his obſervations low, flat, or vulgar, but ſuch as became a breaſt now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing it ſelf for buſineſſe and for government.</p>
               <p>There was an ancient cuſtome to celebrate the Anniverſary of the King's Coronation with all the Shews of Magnificence and joy which the Art or Affections of the People could invent; and becauſe we are eſteemed the Warlik'ſt Nation in the whole world, to continue that juſt regulation, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all thoſe effeminacies which are ſo predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in other Courts, and abſolutely addicted our

selves to ſuch Martial exerciſes as are nothing leſſe pleaſing and delightful than the other, and yet fit and prepare men more for the real uſe of Arms, and acquiſition of glory. Here our Knight's praiſe came to my Lord of <hi>Carliſle's</hi> notice, who firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him a Commander; but finding his <hi>Genius</hi> more courtly than <hi>Martial,</hi> more learned than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, recommended him to his Majeſties ſofter ſervices, where none more obliging to the People by his induſtry and intereſt Court, none more ſerviceable to his Majeſty by the good name he gained in the Countrey: So careful was he of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick content, that from five to nine his Chamber was open to all <hi>Comers;</hi> where you would finde him with the one hand making himſelf ready, with the other receiving Letters; and in all this hurry of Buſineſſe, giving the moſt orderly, clear, and ſatisfactory diſpatches of any Stateſman at that time. From nine to one he attended his Maſter, to whom he had as eaſie acceſs as he gave to his People. Two things ſet him up; 1. A fair reſpect from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon all occaſions, and as fair a treatment of the People: He had his diſtinct Claſſis of Affairs, and his diſtinct Officers for thoſe Claſſis: The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and method whereof incredibly advanced his diſpatch, and eaſed his burden; which took up his day ſo, that there remained but ſome hours he ſtole from night and ſleep, for his beloved and dear Studies; and King <hi>James</hi> ſaid, he was the hardeſt Student in <hi>White-Hall—</hi>and therefore he did not always trouble his Maſter with buſineſſe, but ſometimes pleaſe him with diſcourſe. If For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had been as kinde to him as Nature, greater Employments had been at once his honour and his
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:29485:260"/>
buſineſs: But from all his ſervices and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he derived no other advantage than the acting of them; and at his death he leſt no other wealth behind him, but that of a high reputation: never arriving at thoſe enjoyments that enhance our Cares, nor having time to withdraw himſelf from thoſe cares that take away the reliſh of our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> ſince Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> was the heir of the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi>'s prudence, the inheritour of his favour, and by degrees a ſucceſſor to his places, though not to his Lands, for he was a younger Brother. He was firſt Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of State, then Maſter of the Wards, and in the laſt of her Reign came to be Lord Treaſurer; all which were the ſteps of his Fathers greatneſſe, and of the honour he left to his houſe. For his perſon, he was not much beholding to Nature, though ſomewhat for his face, which was the beſt part of his outſide: but for his inſide, it may be ſaid he was his Father's own ſon, and a pregnant Proficient in all diſcipline of State. He was a Courtier from his Cradle, yet at the age of twenty and upwards, he was much ſhort of his after-proof; but expoſed, and by change of climate he ſhewed what he was, and what he would be: He lived in thoſe times, wherein the Queen had moſt need and uſe of men of weight; and amongſt able ones, this was a chief, as having his ſufficiency from his inſtructions that begat him the Tutorſhip of the Times and Court, <hi>then</hi> the Academy of Art and Cunning, when Engliſh prudence and Counſel was at the higheſt, as moſt exerciſed with Foreign dangers, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick practices.

               </p>
               <p>This noble perſon was of greater experience than knowledg, and more beholding to his years than to his <hi>Education,</hi> whence K. <hi>James</hi> took great pleaſure in his diſcourſe, that was not moroſe, obſtinate, narrow, unactive or formal, like a Students ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues; but free, active, and ingenuous, like a Stateſ-man's Maximes—Whereof one was this; That never did Commander a noble Act that was Commiſſion-bound; it being a queſtion, whether the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Spanyards</hi> loſt more at Sea and in the Netherlands before they diſcovered that Error, or gained more ſince.

               <p>Great content did he give by his preſence in the <hi>French</hi> Court 1605. and greater in his carriage at the Prince Elector's <note n="a" place="margin">Where he was Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</note> marriage, 1612.

All King <hi>James</hi> his Favourites were of his own education, and ſo imbued with his principles, and engaged to his intereſt.

<pb n="519" facs="tcp:29485:268"/>
knew as little how to miſtruſt, as how to do any thing for which he ſhould be miſtruſted. This is the Leſſon he was ſhort in, <hi>That civilities ſhould be common, but favours choice.</hi> The Whale is ſteered at Sea by a far ſmaller Fiſh, and this States-man at Court by far meaner men than himſelf. <q>I my ſelf <hi>(ſaith an ingenious man)</hi> have known many ſo far ſtrangers to what was convenient, as they would ſcarce concede or deny any thing out of the preſence of their Secretary: and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not ſeldome from a diſtruſt there was no cauſe for; manifeſt in the Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who though himſelf owner of a competent ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was ſo enchanted with an opinion of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi>'s parts, that he preferred him from a Servant to ſuch an intimate friendſhip, as he could think nothing well educated for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in his Office, that had not paſſed his correction, nor ſecret laid up but in his boſome; which ſwelled him (ſaith he) to ſuch a monſtroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in pride, that I have heard (not being my ſelf then neer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court) how he offered to rant at his ſervants, and did once beat his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for putting his commands under an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our expoſtulation to his Maſter; and through this intolerable arrogance in him, and remiſneſs in the Earl, the ſparks firſt flew, that kindled the ruine of them both: Friendſhip being no more able to maintain its intereſt againſt a feminine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than ſo great a pride was to confine it ſelf within the tedder of moderation.</q> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt are not free, <hi>but led in triumph by the affections of others, through the mediation of their own.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> would do what was moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:29485:269"/>
and the Earl muſt peform what was leſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular. The King truſted <hi>Carr</hi> with his Diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and <hi>Carr</hi> truſts <hi>Overbury</hi> a month together without examination, who had full Commiſſion to receive and anſwer any Letters or other Expreſſes that came to his hands: Great opportunities offered themſelves to Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> and a great Soul he had to obſerve them (Fortune being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an attentive obſervation of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Affairs, and the occaſions reſulting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from:) obſervant he was of his <q>Maſter, who rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him not to eclipſe others, but like a brave Prince to eaſe himſelf. For Princes (to uſe my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s words) being at too great a diſtance from their Subjects, to eaſe themſelves into their boſomes, raiſe ſome perſons to be as it were <hi>participes curam,</hi> or their Companions:</q> but this Favourite underſtood as well the humour of the People, as he did the diſpoſition of his Prince, obliging the one no leſſe, than he pleaſed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Gay he was, as a Courtier, grave as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour: to Scholars none more civill, to Soldiers none more liberal; of States-men none more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective: He had his extraordinary great Vertues upon occaſions to ſhew, and his ordinary little ones always to oblige; a compleatneſſe in all turnes, and upon all occaſions was his nature. Familiar he was, yet not cheap; ſociable upon regard, and not upon facility: His behaviour was his ſoul, free for any exerciſe or motion; finding many, and making more opportunities to endear himſelf: He broke his minde to ſmall obſervations, yet he comprehended great matters: His carriage was ſo exact, as if affected; and yet ſo graceful, as if
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:29485:269"/>
natural. That which overthrew the firſt, bewitched the wiſeſt, and tyred the moſt patient man, undid this noble perſon: yet ſo regular were his affections, that he did nothing publickly in the Counteſſe of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suffolk's</hi> Daughters caſe, but by due courſe of Law, the approbation of the graveſt and wiſeſt Divines and Counſellors, and the <note n="a" place="margin">Witneſſe his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of <hi>England:</hi> his failings were the faults of his years, rather than of his perſon; of his ſodain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than of his conſtant temper: his counſels were ſafe and moderate; his publick actions honeſt and plain; his firſt years of favour induſtrious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; his minde noble and liberal. His ſoul capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inquiſitive; his temper yielding and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. In a word, Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> deſerved to be a Favourite, if he had not been one.—He fell becauſe he medled too little with the Secretaries place while in it, and too much when out of it; giving <hi>Overbury</hi> too much ſcope on the one hand to mate him, and Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> too much offence to undermine him; who finding that new Earls occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons growing with his advancements (I ſay his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, becauſe I think his miſcarriages were not his nature, but his neceſſity) apt to encroach upon his and other Court-Offices, gave ear to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> that might ruine him, and ſet free himſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt Intimation of his guilt was his earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for a general Pardon; and the firſt argument of it was my Lord Chancellor's ſcruples in ſealing it: whence I date his firſt declining, attended with as much pity as his firſt advancement was with <hi>envy.</hi> We and the Troglodites curſe not the Sun-riſing more heartily, than we worſhip it when it <hi>ſets.</hi>

The Gentleman was as to his ſtature rather well compacted than tall; as to his features and favour, comely, rather than beautiful.—The hair of his head was flaxen, and that of his face yellow: His nature was gentle, his diſpoſition affable, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections publick, untill a particular perſon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt engroſſed them: and the good Gentleman being ſenſible of failers that might ruine him, was wholly intent upon a <hi>treaſure</hi> that might preſerve him:—His defect was, that he underſtood onely his own age; and that the experience of man's life cannot furniſh <hi>examples and preſidents for the events of one mans life.</hi>

He did firſt creep, <q>then run, then flye into Preferment, or rather Preferment did flie upon him without his expectation. He was never Incumbent on any Living with cure of Souls, but was mounted from a Lecturer to a Dignitary; ſo that he knew the Stipend and Benevolence of the one, and the Dividend of the other, but was utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the taking of Tithes, with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles attending it, together with the

               <p>Firſt, That in his houſe he reſpected his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry above his Chaplains; and out of it, alwayes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Cloaks above Caſſocks, Lay above Clergy-men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he connived at the ſpreading of Nonconformity, inſomuch that a Modern Author ſaid,

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Arch-Biſhop was much humbled with a caſual Homicide of a Keeper of the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi>'s in <hi>Bramel-Parke,</hi> though ſoon after he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly quitted from any irregularity thereby. In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> he was ſequeſter'd from his Juriſdictions, ſay ſome, on the old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Homicide, though others ſay, for refuſing to Licenſe a Sermon of Doctor <hi>Sirptborps.</hi> Yet there is not an Expreſſe of either in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:29485:271"/>
of Sequeſtration, the Commiſſion onely ſaying in the general, That the Arch-Biſhop could not at that preſent in his own Perſon attend thoſe Services which were otherwiſe proper for his Cognizance and Juriſdiction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay the truth, he was a man of good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and knew much, but failed in what thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily do that are devoted to our modern ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, being extreamly obſtinate in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the King was more willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand than follow, becauſe moſt times he looked upon things according to the rigour of Eccleſiaſtick maximes, and was either too curious and irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute by variety of reading, or too peremptory and poſitive from the ſtrictneſſe of his Rules; or too zealous by reaſon of the ſeriouſneſſe of his Study; or wide from the matter, by reaſon of his <hi>inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and aptneſſe to require in the times he lived, the regularity of the times <q>he read <hi>of;</hi> heeding not the force of Circumſtances, the errours of Compariſon, or the cautions of Application.</q> I like his Apology for his ſeverity to the Clergy (that he was <hi>auſtere to prevent others being cruel)</hi> as well as his zeal for the Proteſtant Religion; onely his Principles betrayed his profeſſion, which he rendered too obnoxious, while he ſupported it by thoſe novel grounds which our Adverſaries could make us confeſſe were Heterodox, and by thoſe ſtreight-laced foundations which we ſaw our ſelves too narrow. As for inſtance, King <hi>James</hi> his vaſt capacity took him up once for making the Scripture the onely rule of Civil Affairs; owning the piety, but obſerving to his face the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that aſſertion. Imprudence, I ſay, as for
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:29485:271"/>
many reaſons, ſo for this, becauſe to aſſert a truth upon a weak principle, is to tempt the world to doubt of the ſtrength of the firſt, when they ſee the weakneſſe of the other. Whether he went off in diſcontent, and ſaid, <hi>He would not attend at the Councel-Table, becauſe he ſhould not wait at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:</hi> Whether he had ſuch malignant followers as called themſelves <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> or Night-Diſciples: Whether he turned noon-day into mid-night, and mid-night into noon-day, having a candle always burning in his Chamber; or if ſo, for what reaſon, I would not have one of my years determine, but rather refer the preſent age to his Contemporaries pen, which deſcribes him thus;</p>
               <p>A very learned man he was; his Erudition all of the old ſtamp, fitly principled in the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> pious, grave, and exemplary in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: But ſome think him a better man than Arch-Biſhop, and that he was better qualified with merit for the Dignity, than with a ſpirit anſwering the Function; in the exerciſe whereof he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived too facile and yielding: his extraordinary remiſneſs in not exacting ſtrict Conformity to the preſcribed Orders of the Church in point of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſeemed to reſolve thoſe legal Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their firſt Principle of Indifference, and led in ſuch an habit of Inconformity, as the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe tender-conſcienced men to long diſcontinued obedience, was interpreted an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</p>

He removed afterwards to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> to view thoſe parts, and thence came into <hi>England,</hi> and obtained of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt (who had as great an eſteem of, and affection for him, as King <hi>James)</hi> a Patent to him and his heirs for <hi>Mary-Land</hi> on the North of <hi>Virginia,</hi> with the ſame Title and Royalties conferred on him, as in <hi>Avalon</hi> aforeſaid, now a hopeful Plantation, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with eight thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souls; which in proceſs of time may prove more advantageous to our Nation.</p>
               <p>Judge <hi>Popham</hi> and Sir <hi>George Calvert</hi> agreed not more unanimouſly in the publick deſign of Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than they differed in the private way of it: the firſt was for extirpating Heathens, the ſecond for converting them.—He ſent away the lewdeſt, <hi>this</hi> the ſobereſt people: the one was for preſent profit,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:29485:273"/>
the other for a reaſonable expectation (it being in the caſe of planting Countreys, as in that of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Woods; you muſt account to loſe almoſt twenty years profit, and expect your recompence in the end; it being neceſſary the Province ſhould firſt finde her ſelf, and then enrich you.) The Judge was for many Governors, the Secretary for few, and thoſe not concerned Merchants, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned Gentlemen: The one granted Liberties without any reſtraint, the other with great cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The firſt ſet up a common Stock, out of which the Iſland ſhould be provided for by proportions; the ſecond left every one to provide for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Two things are eminent in this man:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That though he was a Catholick, yet kept he himſelf ſincere and diſingaged from all Intereſts; and though a man of great judgement, yet not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in his ſentiments, but taking as great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hearing others opinions, as in delivering his own, which he heard moderated and cenſured with more patience, than applauded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he carried a digeſted and exact account of Affairs to his Maſter every night, and took to himſelf the pains to examine the Letters which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to any Intereſt that might be any ways conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. He was the onely States-man, that being engaged to a decryed party, yet managed his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with that huge reſpect for all ſides, that all who knew him, applauded him; and none that had any thing to do with him, complained of him.</p>

                  <q>SIr <hi>Arthur Chicheſter</hi> ſpent his youth, firſt in the Univerſity, then in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> Wars, where by his valour he was effectually aſſiſtant, Firſt, to plough and break up that barbarous Nation by Conqueſt, and then to ſow it with ſeeds of civility, when by King <hi>James</hi> mad Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed good Laws &amp; Proviſions had been made by his Predeceſſors to that purpoſe: but alas, they were like good Leſſons ſet for a Lute out of tune, uſeleſſe, until the Inſtrument was fitted for them. Wherefore in order to the civilizing of the <hi>Iriſhry,</hi> in the firſt year of his government, he eſtabliſhed two new Circuits for Juſtices of Aſſize, the one in <hi>Connaught,</hi> the other in <hi>Munſter.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Circuits in former times onely encompaſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale (as the <hi>Cynoſura</hi> doth the Pole) hence forwards like good Planets in their ſeveral Spheres, they carried the influence of Juſtice round about the Kingdome. Yea, in ſhort time <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſo cleared of Thieves and capital Offenders, that ſo many Malefactors have not been found in the 32 Shires of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shires in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Circuits. He reduced the Mountains and Glinnes on the South of <hi>Dublin</hi> (formerly thorns in the ſide of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale) into the County of <hi>Wicklow;</hi> and in conformity to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> cuſtome, many <hi>Iriſh</hi> began to cut their Mantles
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:29485:274"/>
into Cloaks. So obſervant was his eye over the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſuſpected perſons, that <hi>Tyrone</hi> was heard to complain, <hi>That he could not drinke a full carouſe of Sack, but the State within few hours was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had been continued many years in his Deputyſhip, and deſervedly made a Lord, King <hi>James</hi> recalled him home, and (loth to leave his Abilities unemployed) ſent him Embaſſador to the Emperour and other <hi>German</hi> Princes. Being beſieged in the City of <hi>Mainchine</hi> (a place much indebted to his prudence for ſeaſonable victualling it) by Count <hi>Tilley,</hi> he ſent him word, that it was againſt the Law of Nations to beſiege an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor: <hi>Tilley</hi> returned that he took no notice that he was an Embaſſador. The Lord <hi>Chicheſter</hi> replyed to the Meſſenger, <hi>Had my Maſter ſent me with as many hundred men, as he hath ſent me on fruitleſs Meſſages, your Generall ſhould have known, that I had been a Soldier, as well as an Embaſſador.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> at his return entertained him with great commendations, for ſo well diſcharging his Truſt; and he died in as great honour as any <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man</hi> of our Age. Thus farre the Hiſtorians. Whence I obſerve him ſtout in his nature above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſorder upon Emergencies, <note n="a" place="margin">Doman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da aſſai, che non Manchera poi calare.

There is a memorable obſervation of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> called <hi>El prudente;</hi> That when he had
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:29485:274"/>
                  <q>deſigned one for Embaſſador, the man came faintly and coldly to him to propoſe ſome things for the accommodation of his Embaſſie; and he ſaid,</q> 
                  <hi>How can I expect that this man can promote and effectuate my buſineſſe, when he is ſo faint and fearful in the ſolicitation of his own?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet was not my Lord <hi>Chicheſter</hi> more reſolute in <hi>Germany,</hi> than wary in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where his opinion was, that time muſt open and facilitate things for Reformation of Religion, by the Proteſtant Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; by the care of good Biſhops and Divines, the amplification of the Colledge, the education of Wards, an inſenſible ſeiſure of Popiſh liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the Council there was ſo numerous (fifty or ſixty at leaſt) that the authority of it was debated, and its buſineſſe divulged.

               <p>

                  <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> reporteth, that the Emperour of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> at the Audience of Ambaſſadors, ſendeth for the graveſt and ſeemlieſt men in <hi>Moſco</hi> and the Vicinage, whom he apparelleth in rich Veſts; and placing them in his preſence, pretendeth to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners, that theſe are of his Privy-Council; who cannot but be much affected with ſo many reverent Aſpects. But ſurely all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> afforded not a perſon which carried more gravity in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and behaviour than Sir <hi>Thomas Egerton,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that many have gone to the Chancery on purpoſe onely to ſee his venerable Garb (happy they who had no other buſineſſe) and were highly pleaſed at ſo acceptable a ſpectacle. Yet was his outward Caſe nothing in compariſon of his inward Abilities, quick Wit, ſolid Judgement, ready Utterance. I confeſs Maſter <hi>Cambden</hi> ſaith, he entred his Office <hi>Magna expectatione &amp; integritatis opinione,</hi> with a great expectation and opinion of Integrity: But no doubt, had he reviſed his work in a ſecond Edition, he would have afforded him a full-faced commendation, when this Lord had turned his expectation to performance. In the firſt of King <hi>James,</hi> of Lord Keeper he was made Lord Chancellor, which is alſo another name for the ſame Office: and on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> 1616. of Lord <hi>Eliſmer</hi> he was created Viſcount <hi>Brackley.</hi> It is given to Courts whoſe Juriſdictions do border, to fall out about their bounds; and the conteſt betwixt them is the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the higher the ſpirits and parts of the reſpective Judges. Great was the contention for many years together betwixt this Lord of Equity, and Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> the Oracle of Juſtice at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:29485:275"/>
I know not which of them got the better; ſure I am, ſuch another Conteſt would (if this did not) have undone the Conqueror.</p>
               <p>He was attended on with ſervants of moſt able parts, and was the ſole Chancellor ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, who had a Chaplain, which (though not immediately) ſucceeded him in his place. He gave over his Office which he held ful twenty years, ſome few dayes before his death; and by his own appointment, his body was brought down and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>Duddleſton</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> leaving a fair eſtate to his Son, who was afterwards created Earl of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> as he did to his excellent Son now living.</p>
               <p>When he ſaw King <hi>James</hi> his munificence to ſome Courtiers, with the grave Fidelity of a Stateſ-man, he ſticked not often to tell him, That as he held it neceſſary for his Majeſty amply to remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all thoſe his Countrey-men, ſo he deſired him carefully to preſe ve his Crown-lands for his own ſupport, ſeeing he or his Succeſſors might meet with Parliaments which would not ſupply his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but on ſuch conditions as would not be very acceptable unto him. It was an ordinary ſpeech in his mouth to ſay, <hi>Froſt and Fraud both end in Foul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His plain, but honeſt advice to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to truſt himſelf, becauſe they that ſtand by, ſee more than they that play the game.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To yield to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> and not do that for his Enemies, which they could never do for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To have a careful eye upon thoſe actions on
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:29485:276"/>
which he knew there were many envious ones. And for himſelf, his ſupplication to King <hi>James</hi> was, That ſince his conceit and ſenſe was grown ſo heavy, his Memory decay'd, his Judgement weak, his Hearing imperfect, and his Voice faltering, he might <hi>deſinere potius quam deficere,</hi> and retire from his Buſineſſe to his Meditation, as he did; while li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, imparting many myſteries of the Chancery; and when dying, bequeathing as many choice Books and Directions to his then Chaplain, and his after-Succeſſor Doctor <hi>Williams.</hi>—Secretary <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> having received the Seal, and left this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meſſage with this good man, that his Majeſty would be his Under-keeper, and not diſpoſe of it while he lived to bear the name of Chancellor: nor did any receive the Seal out of the Kings fight, while he lived to bear the name of Chancellor.</p>
               <p>A company of Citizens got a Cauſe paſſed by keeping a Witneſſe away in this manner; one of them gets him to the Tavern, and there leaves him with a quart of Sack before him, and the glaſs at his mouth, and ſwears in open Court, that he left him in a condition, wherein if he continueth but <hi>two hours, he is a dead man.</hi> The other Party finde out the cheat, and have their remedy in Chancery: Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> brings the matter to the Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and threatneth the Chancellor with a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire.</hi> The buſineſs is debated, and ſentence paſſed for my Lord Chancellor; with the comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Kings and Princes Letter to him upon his Death-bed, he went <hi>to his Grave.</hi>

               <p>SIr <hi>John Popham</hi> in his youthful dayes was a ſtout and skilful man at Sword and Buckler as any in that Age, and wilde enough in his Recreations. But oh! ſaith my Author, if Quick-ſilver could be really fixed, to what a treaſure would it amount? Such is wilde youth ſeriouſly reduced to gravity, as by this young man did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, who applyed himſelf to a more profitable Fencing, the ſtudy of the Lawes; therein attaining to ſuch eminency, that he became the Queens Attorney, afterwards Lord Chief-Juſtice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Being ſent <hi>Anno</hi> 1600. by the Queen with ſome others to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to know the cauſe of the confluence of ſo many Military men unto his houſe, the Soldiers therein detained him for a time, which ſome made tantamount to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.

               <p>In the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> his juſtice was exemplary on Theeves and Robbers. The Land then ſwarmed with people which had been Soldiers, who had never gotten (or elſe quite forgotten) any other Vocation. Hard it was for Peace to feed all the idle mouths which a former War did breed, being too proud to beg, too lazy

In a word, the deſerved death of ſome ſcores, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the lives and livelihoocs of ſome thouſands: Travellers owing their ſafety to this Judges ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many years after his death. Neither did he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh Malefactors, but provide for them; for obſerving that ſo many ſuffered and <hi>died</hi> for none other reaſon but becauſe they could not <hi>live</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> now grown too populous for it's ſelf, and <hi>breeding</hi> more Inhabitants toan it could <hi>keep,</hi> he firſt ſet up the diſcovery of <hi>New-England,</hi> to maintain and employ thoſe that could not live honeſtly in the old; being of opinion, that baniſhment thither would be as well a more lawful, as a more effectual remedy againſt thoſe extravagancies; the Authors whereof judge it more eligible to <hi>hang,</hi> than to work; to end their days in a moment, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in pains:—onely a great Judgement obſerves, it is a ſhameful and an unbleſſed thing, to take the ſcum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom to plant: And not onely ſo, but it ſpoyleth the Plantation, for they will ever live like Rogues, and not fall to work, and do miſchief, and ſpend Victuals, and be quickly weary, and then certifie over to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to the diſgrace of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>

               <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> was bred a Scholar under <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> a States-man under Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> at Court, where ſuch his dexterity and diſpatch, that he would indite, write, and diſcourſe at the ſame time, more exactly than moſt men could ſeverally perform them, being then called the <hi>Swift-ſure;</hi> ſuch his celerity and ſolidity in all Affairs! From the Secretaries <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuenſis,</hi> he was promoted the Queens Clerk of the Signet, to whom he read <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> to her dying day; for he was reading to her, when the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> told him <hi>that the Queen was departed.</hi> In which Tongues ſhe often ſaid he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed her Secretaries.

               </head>
               <p>SIr <hi>Lyonel</hi> was born in <hi>Baſinghal ſtreet,</hi> a Citizen, bred in the Cuſtome-houſe, a Merchant-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer; his own Tutor, and his own Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though his Family was ancient in <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and his Arms in the Heralds Office. King <hi>James</hi> was taken with hm for his brief, clear, ſtrong and pertinent diſcourſes: The Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was diſpleaſed becauſe he would ſtand without him, yea in ſome things againſt him: many were as active as this ſtirring Lord, none more exact; his preſence was comely, his countenance cheerful and grave, his ſoul witty and wiſe, his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion quick and ſolid, his thoughts ſetled and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. When one asked him how a man might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent death, he ſaid, <hi>Get to be Lord-Treaſurer, for none died in that Office.</hi> Though no Scholar, yet was he bountiful to Scholars; though a Courtier, yet was he hoſpitable in the Countrey; though he ſuffered much, yet was he contented; and though he loſt much, yet was he charitable. Very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable he was to the State in the buſineſs of Trade in general, but moſt in that of the Cuſtom-houſe in particular: His firſt preferment was the cuſtody of the Wardrobe, his ſecond was the Maſterſhip of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and his third the Treaſurer-ſhip of <hi>England.</hi> In the laſt whereof, his improvement of the Revenue, gained him not more honour with the King, than it did him envy
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:29485:286"/>
from the Courtiers; While to piece out the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the expence, he husbanded the one ſo thriſtily, and retrenched the other ſo rigidly, that malice it ſelf after many attempts to that purpoſe, could finde no fault with his exact account in <hi>the boundleſſe</hi> truſt of the <hi>tempting Treaſury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Prince was in <hi>Spain,</hi> he was the Stateſ-man of the Council-Table, and the chief Miniſter of the Cabal, managing all the Diſpatches, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking all the Expences: In the laſt of which ſervices he ran counter to the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s inclination, and his own Intereſt; which was to keep himſelf up by that noble Perſon's <hi>favour,</hi> as he roſe by his <hi>alliance.</hi> The occaſion of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment might be ſome ſaving ſecrets of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome-houſe-men to improve the Revenue; the reaſon of his decline, was ſome thriſty ſuggeſtion touching the Courtiers to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>This is certain, he was a man fit for government, who quickly apprehended where any evil was, and had capacity enough to apply the remedy; onely he had a little too ſtiffe a nature that would not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily yield, when he found on which ſide there was moſt reaſon; and too much of the City in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, which pretended to attain to that in a ſhort time, which Politicians think not proper to arrive at but by a leaſurely ſucceſſion of Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

returns home to inherit his lands and honours; but not one jot changed in diſpoſition from the <hi>traiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> wayes of his <hi>Predeceſſors:</hi> For not long after he falls into this <hi>Conſpiracy;</hi> which is not ſo <hi>ancient,</hi> but that many then and now living can, and my ſelf have heard the <hi>repetition.</hi>

               <p>He anticipated his age with his worth, and died at fourſcore in merit, when not fifty in yeares; filling his time not with dayes but with vertues ſo early, as ſeemed rather innate than acquired: For which he was ſo <hi>popular</hi> in the Countrey, as well as favoured at Court; that a <hi>corpulent</hi> Officer of <hi>Bath-</hi>Church being appointed on the day of his Burial to keep the doors, entred on his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the morning, but was buried himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, and before the Biſhop's body was put in the ground; becauſe being bruiſed to death by the <hi>preſſing</hi> in of <hi>people,</hi> his Corps requsred ſpeedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment.—In thoſe days the <hi>Plebs concurred</hi> with with the King in their affections <hi>to,</hi> becauſe they <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to him <hi>in</hi> their choice of perſons; for then wiſdome was thought to dwell in the <hi>Head,</hi> and good Folks thought their Soveraign wiſer than <hi>themſelves.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I Was born at <hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> March 2. 1544. deſcended both by Father and Mother of worſhipful Parents. My Father, in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> being noted and known to be an enemy to Popery, was ſo cruelly threatned, and ſo narrowly obſerved, by thoſe that maliced his Religion, that for the ſafeguard of himſelf and my Mother, who was wholly affected as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he knew no way ſo ſecure as to flye into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:29485:298"/>
2. My Father fixed his abode in the City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva;</hi> where, as far as I remember, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church conſiſted of ſome hundred perſons. I was at that time of twelve years of age, but through my Fathers coſt and care, ſufficiently inſtructed to become an Auditor of <hi>Chevallerius</hi> in Hebrew, of <hi>Beroaldus</hi> in Greek, of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of ſome other Profeſſors in that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (which was newly then erected) beſides my domeſtick Teachers in the houſe of <hi>Philibertus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racenus,</hi> a famous Phyſitian in that City, with whom I was boarded, where <hi>Robertus Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that made the <hi>Greek Lexicon,</hi> read <hi>Homer</hi> to me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> my Father returned, and ſetled his dwelling in the City of <hi>London.</hi> It was not long after, that I was ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thence to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the teaching and tuition of Doctor <hi>Humphrey.</hi> In the year 1563, I took the degree of <hi>Batchellor of Arts;</hi> within which year I was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>Probationer</hi> of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, and the next year enſuing admitted <hi>Fellow.</hi> Afterwards, in the year 1565, by ſpecial perſwaſion of ſome of my Fellows, and for my private exerciſe, I undertook the publick reading of a Greek Lecture in the ſame Colledge-Hall, without requiring or expecting any ſtipend for it: Nevertheleſſe it pleaſed the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of their own accord to allow me ſoon after four marks by the year, and ever ſince to continue the Lecture to that Colledge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the year 1566, I proceeded <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> and read for that year in the School-ſtreets natural Philoſophy. After which time, within leſſe than
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:29485:299"/>
three years ſpace, I was won by intreaty of my beſt affected friends to ſtand for the Proctorſhip, to which I and my Colleague were quietly elected in the year 1569, without any competition or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſuit of any other. After this for a long time, I ſupplied the Office of Univerſity-Oratour, and beſtowed my time in the ſtudy of ſundry faculties, without any inclination to profeſſe any one above the reſt; inſomuch as at laſt I waxed deſirous to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel beyond the Seas, for attaining to the knowledg of ſome ſpecial modern Tongues, and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of my experience in the managing of affairs; being wholly then addicted to employ my ſelf and all my cares in the publick ſervice of the State.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After my return, in the year 1585, I was employed by the Queen to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to the <hi>German</hi> Princes: Next, to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>France:</hi> After this, in 88, for the better conduct of her Highneſſe Affairs in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces United, I was thought a fit perſon to reſide in thoſe parts, and was ſent thereupon to the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> where, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that had formerly paſs'd between her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the States, I was admitted for one of their Council of Eſtate, taking place in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies next to Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and yielding my ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>age in all that was propoſed. During all that time, what approbation was given of my painful endeavours by the Queen, by the Lords in <hi>England,</hi> by the States of the Countrey there, and by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiery, I refer it to be notified by ſome others Relation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I received from her Majeſty many comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Letters of her gracious acceptance of my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:29485:299"/>
and care: and among the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had no man more to friend, then was the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh.</hi> For when occaſion had been offered of declaring his conceit as touching my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he would always tell the Queen (which I received from her ſelf and ſome other Ear-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) that there was not any man in <hi>England</hi> ſo meet as my ſelf to undergo the Office of the Secretary. And ſithence his ſon, the preſent Lord Treaſurer, hath ſignified unto me in private conference, that when his Father firſt intended to advance him to that place, his purpoſe was withal to make me his Colleague: But that the daily provocations of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> were ſo bitter and ſharp againſt him, and his compariſons ſo odious when he put us in a balance, as he thought thereupon he had very great reaſon to uſe his beſt means, to put any man out of hope of raiſing his fortune, whom the Earl with ſuch violence, to his extream prejudice, had endeavoured to dignifie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When I had well conſidered, how ill it did concur with my natural diſpoſition, to become or to be counted either a ſtickler or partaker in any publick faction; how well I was able, by Gods good bleſſing, to live of my ſelf, if I could be contented with a competent livelihood; I reſolved thereupon to poſſeſs my ſoul in peace all the reſidue of my days, to take my farewel of State-employments, and ſo to retire me from the Court.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now although after this, by her Majeſties direction, I was often called to the Court, by the now Lord Treaſurer, then Secretary, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, and alſo divers times ſince, by order from the King, to ſerve as Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:29485:300"/>
and to negotiate in other very honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet I would not be removed from my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer final reſolution; but have continued at home my retired courſe of life, which is now methinks to me as the greateſt preferment the State can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This I muſt confeſſe of my ſelf, that though I did never repent me yet of my often refuſals of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable offers, in reſpect of enriching my private Eſtate; yet ſomewhat more of late I have blamed my ſelf and my nicety that way, for the love that I bear to my Reverend Mother the Univerſity of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and to the advancement of her good by ſuch kinde of means as I have ſince undertaken.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Having examined what courſe I might take, I concluded at the laſt to ſet up my ſtaffe at the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary door; being throughly perſwaded, that in my ſolitude and ſurceaſe from the Common-wealth affairs, I could not buſie my ſelf to better purpoſe then by reducing that place (which then in every part lay ruined and waſte) to the publick uſe of Students.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For the effecting whereof, I found my ſelf furniſhed in a competent proportion, of ſuch four kinds of aids, as unleſſe I had them all, there was no hope of good ſucceſſe. For without ſome kinde of knowledge, as well in the learned modern Tongues, as in ſundry other ſorts of Scholaſtical literature; without ſome purſe-ability to go through with the charge; without very great ſtore of honourable friends to further the deſign, and without ſpecial good leiſure to follow ſuch a work, it could but have proved a vain attempt, and inconſiderate.</p>

One of an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; it being true of him what is ſaid of the <hi>Caſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea, that it doth never ebb nor flow; obſerving a conſtant tenor; neither elated nor depreſſed with ſucceſs.

Now to compare them together (ſuch their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, that they would hardly be parallel'd by any but themſelves:) Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was the elder Brother, Sir <hi>Horace</hi> lived to be the elder man. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was more feared, Sir <hi>Horace</hi> more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Soldiery: The former in Martial Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was oftentimes <hi>Rigidus ad ruinam,</hi> the latter ſeldome exceeded <hi>ad terrorem.</hi> Sir <hi>Francis</hi> left none, Sir <hi>Horace</hi> no Male-Iſſue, whoſe four Co-Heirs are ſince Matched into honourable Families. Both lived in War, much honoured; dyed in peace, much lamented.</p>
               <p>What is a great queſtion among all Martial men, was ſo between theſe Brethren; whether to repair a reputation ruined by ſome infamous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, <q>and the honour abuſed by ſome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loſſe, the General ought to oppoſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that oppreſſeth him,</q> and hazard what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, to recover what is loſt? Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was of opinion, <hi>That though it's not the intereſt of a ſupream Prince, yet it is the concern of a ſubordinate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to ſupport his credit at the rate of his Army.</hi> But Sir <hi>Horace</hi> was never for ſacrificing the whole for the advancing of any part, or of many, for the humouring of one; but choſe rather to break the impetuoſity of his misfortunes by yielding to them, and rather recover both himſelf and his ſucceſſe by a prudent retreat, than loſe both in an obſtinate miſadventure.—It being far more eligible to ſuffer in the imaginary intereſt of repute, than that real one of ſtrength; though appearances are yet ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that dexterouſly to manage the reputation of Affairs, is to imprint in men a great opinion of vertue and fortune, to enhance ſucceſſes, and

               <p>Neither were they leſſe obſervant of their time, that Mother of Action, than their place; neither haſty nor ſlow to manage an opportunity that is neither often nor long the ſame;—or of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Army than both, whereof each part aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the other at <hi>Newport</hi> and elſewhere ſo readily, that their ſhouts and charges equally amazed their Friends and Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Reliefs of <hi>Rhingbergh</hi> were actions of great reſolution, ready diſpatch, a watchful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and good purſuit: The ſuccour of <hi>Lithen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooven</hi> was a performance of great and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; the ſurprize of <hi>Zutphen</hi> by young Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in womens apparel, was a piece of ſervice of

After four years Univerſity-ſtudy, firſt in <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Inne, and then in the Inner Temple. The firſt occaſion of his Riſe was his ſtating of the Cooks Caſe of the Temple ſo exactly, that all the Houſe who were puzzled with it admired him; and his pleading it ſo, that the whole Bench took notice of him. Such his proficiency, that at the end of ſix years (exceeding early in that ſtrict age) he was call'd to the Bar, and ſoon after for three years choſen Reader in <hi>Lyons</hi> Inne. Here his learned Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſo ſpread forth his fame, that crouds of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſued to him for his Counſel; and his own ſuit was the ſooner granted, when tendering his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in order to Marriage, unto <hi>Bridget</hi> daughter and Coheir of <hi>John Paſton</hi> Eſquire, whoſe portion moderately eſtimated, <hi>Viis &amp; modis,</hi> amounted unto thirty thouſand pounds, her vertues not fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under valuation, and ſhe enriched her Husband with ten Children.</p>

Thus beginning on a good bottom left him by his Father, marrying a Wife of extraordinary wealth; having at the firſt great and gainful practice, afterwards many and profitable Offices, being provident to chooſe good pennyworths in Purchaſes, leading a thrifty life, living to a great age during flouriſhing and peaceable times (born as much after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution under Qu: <hi>Mary,</hi> as dying before our Civil Wars) no wonder if he advanced to a fair eſtate, ſo that all his ſons might ſeem elder brethren, by the large poſſeſſions left unto them.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>Francis</hi> was born where we are made men, bred where we are made States-men; being equally happy in the quickneſſe of the City, and politeneſs of the Court: He had a large minde from his Father, and great abilities from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; his parts improved more than his years: his great, fixed, and methodical memory, his ſolid judgement, his quick fancy, his ready expreſſion, gave high aſſurance of that profound and univerſal
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:29485:309"/>
knowledge and comprehenſion of things which then rendered him the obſervation of great and wiſe men, and afterwards the wonder of all. The great Queen was as much taken with his witty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes when a School boy, as with his grave O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles when her Counſel <hi>learned.</hi> He was a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier from his Cradle to his Grave, ſucking in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with his milke, being inured to policy as early as to his Grammar: Royal Maximes were his <hi>Sententia Puerilis;</hi> and he never ſaw any thing that was not noble and becoming. The Queen called him her young <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> for his grave ingenuity at ſeven years of age; and he could tell her <hi>Majeſty be was two years younger for her happy Reigne.</hi> At twelve, his induſtry was above the capacity, and his minde above the reach of his Contemporaries: A prodigy of parts he muſt be, who was begot by wiſe Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> born of the accompliſhed Mrs. <hi>Anne Cook,</hi> and bred under the wiſe, learned, and pious Doctor <hi>Whitgift.</hi> His ſtrong obſervations at Court, his ſteady courſe of ſtudy in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt be improved by a well contrived Travell abroad: where his converſation was ſo obliging, his <hi>way</hi> ſo inquiſitive, his prudence ſo eminent, that he was Sir <hi>Amie Paulet</hi>'s Agent between the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto of <hi>France</hi> and the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed the ſolidity of <hi>England</hi> with the Ayre of <hi>France,</hi> untill his own Affairs and the Kingdomes ſervice called him home at his Fathers death to enjoy a younger Brothers eſtate, and act his part: Policy was his buſineſs, the Law was onely his lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; yet he was ſo great a States-man, that you would think he only ſtudied men: ſo great a Scholar, that you would ſay, he onely ſtudied Books.

inſight he had in the Law, that he was at thirty her Majeſties Advocate; ſuch his judgement, that he was the Student of <hi>Grayes-Inn's</hi> Oracle; ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and affable his diſpoſition, that he was all mens love and wonder: He inſtilled wholſome precepts of Prudence and Honour to Noble-men (particularly the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to whom he was more faithful, than he to himſelf:) Great principles of Arts and Sciences to the learned; noble Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of Government to Princes, excellent rules of Life to the Populacy.

in point of Honour. In the Houſe of Commons none more popular, none more zealous, none ſo knowing a Patriot: In the houſe of Lords, none more ſucceſsfully ſerviceable to the Crown: the eaſie way of Subſidies was his deſign in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> time; the union with <hi>Scotland</hi> was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance in King <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>

His axiome was; <hi>Words</hi> ſhould wait on <hi>things,</hi> rather than <hi>things</hi> on <hi>words;</hi> and his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was, <hi>That all affected elegance was below the gravity and majeſty of a publick diſcourſe:</hi> He rather <hi>judged Books</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> than either read or talked with them.</p>
               <p>His Exerciſes were man-like and healthful; his Meditations cohaerent; his Table temperate and learned, where his great Diſcourſes were the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,

and he himſelf the treat; reſolving Caſes moſt ſatisfactorily, ſtating Queſtions moſt exactly, relating Hiſtories moſt prudently, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Secrets moſt clearly, anſwering Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and replying moſt familiarly, and ſpeaking what he had thorowly weighed and conſidered moſt effectually.—All matters and ſpeeches came from him with advantage; ſo acute and ready his wit, ſo faithful his memory, ſo penetrating his judgement, ſo ſearching his head, ſo large and rational his ſoul.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſaid, he had the cleareſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of things of any man in his age; and K. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he knew the method of handling Matters after a milde and gentle manner.</hi> His Religion was rational and ſober, his ſpirit publick, his love to Relations tender, to Friends faithful; to the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful liberal, to men univerſal, to his very Enemies civil. He left the beſt pattern of Government in his actions under one King, and the beſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in the Life of the other.

When he was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Embaſſador in <hi>Germany,</hi> upon his return by <hi>Heydelbergh,</hi> obſerving that Count <hi>Mansfield's</hi> Army, upon whom depended the fortune of the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> was like to disband for want of money, he pawned all his Plate and Jewels to buoy up that ſinking Cauſe for that time. That his ſpirit was thus great abroad, was his honour; but that it was too great at home, was his unhappineſs: for he enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a fatal Contraſt with the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that hazarded both their ſafeties, had not
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:29485:313"/>
this Lord feared the Duke's power (as the Duke this Lord's policy) and ſo at laſt it became a drawn Battle betwixt them; yet ſo, that this Earl loſt the love of King <hi>Charles,</hi> living many years in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour: But ſuch as are in a Court-cloud, have commonly the Countreys Sun-ſhine; and this Peer during his Eclipſe, was very popular with moſt of the Nation. It is ſeldome ſeen, if a Favourite once broken at Court, ſets up again for himſelf; the hap (rather than happineſs) of this Lord, the King graciouſly reflecting on him at the beginning of the Long <hi>Parliament,</hi> as one beſt able to give him the ſafeſt Counſel in thoſe dangerous times. But how he incenſed the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo far, as to be exceped pardon, I neither do know, nor dare enquire. Sure I am, that after the ſurrender of <hi>Exeter,</hi> he went over into <hi>France,</hi> where he met with that due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in Foreign, which he miſſed in his Native Countrey. The worſt I wiſh ſuch, who cauſeleſly ſuſpect him of Popiſh inclinations (ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) is, that I may hear from them but half ſo many ſtrong Arguments for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as I heard from him, who was to his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a cordial Champion for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This Family hath been much talked of this laſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; though all that I can ſay of it is this, that great ſpirits, large parts, high honours, penned within narrow Eſtates, ſeldome bleſſe their owners with <hi>moderation,</hi> or the places they live in with <hi>peace.</hi>

                  <body>
                     <p>Sir, In the firſt place, I ſhall be bold to put you <note place="margin">Compleat Inſtructions for a States-man, given by L. <hi>B.</hi> to D. <hi>B.</hi>
                        </note> in minde of the preſent condition you are in; You are not onely a Courtier, but a Bed-chamber-man,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:29485:317"/>
and ſo are in the eye and eare of your Maſter; but you are alſo a Favourite; The Fourite of the time, and ſo are in his boſome alſo; The world hath ſo voted you, and doth ſo eſteem of you, (for Kings and great Princes, even the wiſeſt of them, have had their Friends, their Favourites, their Privadoes, in all ages; for they have their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as well as other men) of theſe they make ſeveral uſes: ſometimes to communicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their thoughts with them, and to ripen their judgements thereby; ſometimes to eaſe their cares by imparting them; and ſometimes to interpoſe them between themſelves and the envy or malice of their People (for Kings cannot erre, that muſt muſt be diſcharged upon the ſhoulders of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; and they who are neareſt unto them muſt be content to bear the greateſt load.) Truly Sir, I do not believe or ſuſpect that you are choſen to this eminency, out of the laſt of theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for you ſerve ſuch a Maſter, who by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe, is as free from the malice or envy of his Subjects, as, I think I may ſay truly, ever any King was, who hath ſate upon his Throne before him: But I am confident, his Majeſty hath caſt his eyes upon you, as finding you to be ſuch as you ſhould be, or hoping to make you to be ſuch as he would have you to be; for this I may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery, your outſide promiſeth as much as can be expected from a Gentleman. But be it in the one reſpect, or other, it belongeth to you to take care of your ſelf, and to know well what the name of a Favourite ſignifies: If you be choſen upon the former reſpects; you have reaſon to take care of your actions and deportment, out of your grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:29485:317"/>
for the King's ſake; but if out of the later, you ought to take the greater care, for your own ſake.</p>
                     <p>You are as a new riſen Star, and the eyes of all men are upon you; let not your own negligence make you fall like a Meteor.</p>
                     <p>The contemplation then of your preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt neceſſarily prepare you for action; what time can be well ſpar'd from your attendance on your Maſter, will be taken up by ſuitors, whom you cannot avoid, nor decline, without reproach; for if you do not already, you will ſoon finde the throng of ſuitors attend you; for no man, almoſt, who hath to do with the King, will think himſelf ſafe, unleſſe you be his good Angel, and guide him, or, or leaſt, that you be not a <hi>Malus Genius</hi> againſt him; ſo that, in reſpect of the King your Maſter, you muſt be very wary, that you give him true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and if the matter concern him in his Government, that you do not flatter him; if you do, you are as great a Traytor to him in the Court of Heaven, as he that draws his ſword againſt him: and in reſpect of the Suitors which ſhall attend you, there is nothing will bring you more honour and more eaſe, then to do them what right in juſtice you may, and with as much ſpeed as you may; for believe it, Sir, next to the obtaining of the ſuit, a ſpeedy and a gentle denyal (when the caſe will not bear it) is the moſt acceptable to ſuitors; they will gain by their diſpatch, whereas elſe they ſhall ſpend their time and money in attending; and you will gain in the eaſe you will finde in being rid of their importunity. But if they obtain what they reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably deſired, they will be doubly bound to you
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:29485:318"/>
for your favour: <hi>Bis dat qui cito dat;</hi> it multiplis the courteſie, to do it with good words, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
                     <p>That you may be able to do this with the beſt advantage, my humble advice is this; when ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors come unto you, ſet apart a certain hour in; day to give them audience: If the buſineſſe be light and eaſie, it may by word onely be delivered, and in a word be anſwered; but if it be either of weight, or of difficulty, direct the ſuitor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to writing, (if it be not ſo already) and then direct him to attend for his anſwer at a ſet time to be appointed, which would conſtantly be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſſe ſome matter of great moment do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it: when you have received the Petitions (and it will pleaſe the Petitioners well, to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto you to deliver them into your own hand) let your Secretary firſt read them, and draw lines under the material parts thereof (for the matter, for the moſt part, lies in a narrow room.) The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions being thus prepared, do you conſtantly ſet apart an hour in a day to peruſe thoſe Petitions; and after you have ranked them into ſeveral files, according to the ſubject matter, make choice of two or three friends, whoſe judgements and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities you believe you may truſt in a buſineſs of that nature, and recommend it to one or more of them, to inform you of their opinions, and of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for, or againſt the granting of it; and if the matter be of great weight indeed, then it would not be amiſſe to ſend ſeveral Copies of the ſame Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to ſeveral of your friends, the one not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the other doth, and deſire them to return their anſwers to you by a certain time, to be prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:29485:318"/>
in writing; ſo ſhall you receive an impartial anſwer, and by comparing the one with the other, you ſhall both diſcern the abilities and faithfulneſſe of your friends, and be able to give a judgement thereupon, as an Oracle. But by no means truſt not to your own judgement alone, for no man is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>For the facilitating of your diſpatches, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is further, that you divide all the Petitions, and the matters therein contained, under ſeveral heads; which, I conceive, may be fitly ranked into theſe eight ſorts.</p>

                        <item>1. Matters that concern Religion, and the Church and Church-men.</item>

                        <item>8. The Court, and Curiality.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And whatſoever will not fall naturally under one of theſe heads, believe me, Sir, will not be worthy of your thoughts, in this capacity we now ſpeak of. And of theſe ſorts, I warrant you, you will finde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep you in buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="620" facs="tcp:29485:319"/>
I begin with the firſt, which concerns Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, be you your ſelf rightly perſwaded and ſetled in the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, profeſſed by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which doubtleſſe is as ſound and orthodox in the doctrine thereof, as any Chriſtian Church in the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In this you need not be a Monitor to your gracious Maſter the King; the chiefeſt of his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Titles, is to be <hi>The Defender of the Faith;</hi> and his learning is eminent, not onely above other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but above other men; be but his ſcholar, and you are ſafe in that.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not poſitively ſay, as ſome do, that it's <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> but this I ſay, and think, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> animo, that it is the neereſt to Apoſtolical truth; and confidently I ſhall ſay, it is fitteſt for Monarchy of all others: I will uſe no other authority to you, than that excellent Proclamation ſet out by the King himſelf in the firſt year of his Reign, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed before the Book of Common Prayer; which I deſire you to read; and if at any time there ſhall be the leaſt motion made for Innovation, to put the King in minde to read it himſelf: It is moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a State to give ear to the leaſt alterations in Government.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Take heed, I beſeech you, that you be not an inſtrument to countenance the <hi>Romiſh Catholicks:</hi> I cannot flatter; the world believes that ſome near in blood to you are too much of that perſwaſion; you muſt uſe them with fit reſpects, according to the bonds of nature; but you are of kin, and ſo a friend to their perſons, not to their errors.</p>

                        <pb n="621" facs="tcp:29485:319"/>
5. The Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, next under the King, have the government of the Church and Eccleſaſtical affairs; be not you the mean to prefer any to thoſe places, for any by-reſpects, but onely for their learning, gravity and worth; their lives and Doctrine ought to be exemplary.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. For Deans, and Canons or Prebends of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches: In their firſt inſtitution they were of great uſe in the Church; they were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be of Council with the Biſhop for his revenue, but chiefly for his Government in cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; uſe your beſt means to prefer ſuch to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who are fit for that purpoſe, men eminent for their learning, piety, and diſcretion, and put the King often in minde thereof; and let them be reduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to their firſt inſtitution.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. You will be often ſollicited, and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned to prefer Scholars to Church-Livings; you may further your friends in that way, <hi>caeteris peribus;</hi> otherwiſe, remember, I pray, that theſe are not places meerly of favour, the charge of ſouls lies upon them; the greateſt account whereof will be required at their own hands; but they will ſhare deeply in their faults who are the inſtruments of their preferment.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Beſides the <hi>Romiſh Catholicks,</hi> there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Sectaries, the <hi>Anabaptiſts, Browniſts,</hi> and others, of their kinds; they have been ſeveral times very buſie in this Kingdom, under the colour of zeal for reformation of Religion: The King your Mr. knows their diſpoſition very well; a ſmall touch will put him in minde of them; he had experience of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I hope he will beware of them in <hi>England;</hi> a little countenance or connivance ſets them on fire.</p>

There is great uſe of the ſervice of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in their Circuits, which are twice in the year held throughout the Kingdome; the tryal of a few cauſes between party and party, or delivering of the Gaols in ſeveral Counties, are of great uſe for the expedition of juſtice; yet they are of much more uſe for the government of the Counties through which they paſs, if that were well thought upon.</p>

17.

                     <p n="18">18. There are many Courts (as you ſee) ſome ſuperiour, ſome provincial, and ſome of a lower orb; It were to be wiſhed, and is fit to be ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every of them keep themſelves within their proper ſpheres. The harmony of juſtice is then the ſweeteſt, when there is no jarring about the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Courts; which me-thinks wiſdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not much differ upon, their true bounds being for the moſt part ſo clearly known.</p>

Having ſaid thus much of the Judges, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what will be fit to put you in minde concerning the principal Miniſters of Juſtice: and in the firſt, of the High Sheriffs of the Counties, which have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient in this Kingdome, I am ſure before the Conqueſt; The choice of them I commend to your care, and that at fit times you put the King in minde thereof; That as neer as may be they be ſuch as are fit for thoſe places, for they are of great truſt and power: The <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> the power of the whole County, being legally commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Therefore it is agreeable with the intention of the Law, that the choice of them ſhould be by the commendation of the great Officers of the Kingdom, and by the advice of the Judges, who
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:29485:323"/>
are preſumed to be well read in the condition of the Gentry of the whole Kingdom: And although the King may do it of himſelf, yet the old way is the good way.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. But I utterly condemn the practice of the latter times, which hath lately crept into the Court (at the back-ſtairs) That ſome who are prick'd for Sheriffs, and were fit, ſhould get out of the Bill; and others who were neither thought upon, nor worthy to be, ſhould be nominated, and both for money.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. I muſt not omit to put you in minde of the Lords Lieutenants, and Deputy-Lieutenants of the Counties: their proper uſe is for ordering the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary affairs, in order to an invaſion from abroad, or a rebellion or ſedition at home; good choice ſhould be made of them, and prudent inſtructions given to them, and as little of the Arbitrary power as may be left unto them; and that the Muſter-Maſters, and their Officers under them, incroach not upon the Subject; that will detract much from the King's ſervice.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The Juſtices of Peace are of great uſe; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently there were Conſervators of the peace, theſe are the ſame, ſaving that ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have altered their denomination, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their juriſdiction in many particulars; The fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are for the peace of the Kingdome, the more heed ought to be taken in the choice of them.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. But negatively, this I ſhall be bold to ſay, that none ſhould be put into either of thoſe Commiſſions with an eye of favour to their perſons, to give them countenance or reputation in the places where they
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:29485:323"/>
live, but for the King's ſervice ſake; nor any put out for the disfavour of any great man: It hath been too often uſed, and hath been no good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the King.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. A word more, if you pleaſe to give me leave, for the true rules of the moderation of Juſtice on the Kings part. The execution of juſtice is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Judges, which ſeemeth to be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer part: but the milder part, which is mercy, is wholly left in the King's immediate hand: And Juſtice and Mercy are the true ſupporters of his Royal Throne.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. If the King ſhall be wholly intent upon Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it may appear with an over-rigid aſpect; but if he ſhall be over-remiſs and eaſie, it draweth upon him contempt. Examples of Juſtice muſt be made ſometimes for terrour to ſome; Examples of Mercy, ſometimes, for comfort to others: the one procures fear, and the other love. A King muſt be both feared and loved, elſe he is loſt.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. The ordinary Courts of Juſtice I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and of their Judges and judicature; I ſhall put you in minde of ſome things touching the High Court of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> which is ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and therefore it will behove me to ſpeak the more warily thereof.</p>

For the inſtitution of it, it is very antient in this Kingdom: It conſiſteth of the two Houſes, of Peers and Commons, as the Members; and of the King's Majeſty, as the head of that great body: By the King's authority alone, and by his Writs, they are aſſembled, and by him alone they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued and diſſolved; but each Houſe may adjourn it ſelf.</p>

29. They being thus Aſſembled, are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Council to the King, the Councel of the Kingdome, to adviſe his Majeſty in thoſe things of weight and difficulty, which concern both the King and People, then a Court.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. No new Laws can be made, nor old Laws abrogated or altered, but by common conſent in Parliament, where Bills are prepared and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the two Houſes, and then delivered: but nothing is concluded but by the King's Royal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; They are but Embroys, 'tis he giveth life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Yet the Houſe of Peers hath a power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in ſome caſes; properly, to examine, and then to affirm, or if there be cauſe, to reverſe the judgements which have been given in the Court of King's Bench, (which is the Court of higheſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in the Kingdome, for ordinary Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) but in theſe caſes it muſt be done by Writ of Error <hi>in Parliamento:</hi> And thus the rule of their proceedings is not <hi>abſoluta poteſtas,</hi> as in making new Laws (in that conjuncture as before) but <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitata poteſt as,</hi> according to the known Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. But the Houſe of Commons have only pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cenſure the Members of their own Houſe, in point of election or miſdemeauors, in or towards that Houſe; and have not, nor ever had power, ſo much as to adminiſter an Oath to prepare a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. The true uſe of Parliaments in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is very excellent; and they would be often called, as the affairs of the Kingdom ſhall require; and continued ſo long as is neceſſary, and no longer,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:29485:324"/>
for then they be but burthens to the people, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the priviledges juſtly due to the Members of the two Houſes and their Attendants; which their juſt rights and priviledges are religiouſly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and maintained; but if they ſhould be unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly enlarged beyond their true bounds, they might leſſen the juſt power of the Crown, it borders ſo near upon popularity.</p>

for they are naturally born to be Councellors to the KING, to learn the art of Governing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But the ordinary ſort of Councellors are ſuch as the King, out of a due conſideration of their worth and abilities, and withal, of their fidelities to his Perſon and to his Crown, calleth to be of Councel with him in his ordinary Government. And the Council-Table is ſo called, from the place where they ordinarily aſſemble and ſit together; and their Oath is the onely ceremony uſed, to make them ſuch, which is ſolemnly given unto them, at their firſt admiſſion: Theſe honourable perſons are from thenceforth of that Board and Body: They cannot come untill they be thus called, and the King at his pleaſure may ſpare their attendance; and he may diſpenſe with their preſence there, which at their own pleaſure they may not do.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This being the quality of their ſervice, you will eaſily judge what care the King ſhould uſe, in his choice of them; It behoveth that they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great truſt and fidelity, and alſo of wiſdome and judgement, who ſhall thus aſſiſt in bearing up the King's Throne; and of known experience in publick affairs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Yet it may not be unfit to call ſome of young years, to train them up in that Trade, and ſo fit them for thoſe weighty affairs, againſt the time of greater maturity; and ſome alſo for the honour of their perſons: But theſe two ſorts not to be tyed to ſo ſtrict attendance, as the others from whom the preſent diſpatch of buſineſs is expected.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I could wiſh that their number might not be ſo over-great, the perſons of the Councellors
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:29485:325"/>
would be the more venerable. And I know that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whoſe time I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be born, and to live many years, was not ſo much obſerved, for having a numerous, as a wiſe, Councel</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The duty of a Privy-Councellor to a King, I conceive, is, not onely to attend the Councel-board, at the times appointed, and there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of what ſhall be propounded; But alſo to ſtudy thoſe things which may advance the King's honour and ſafety, and the good of the Kingdome, and to communicate the ſame to the King, or to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Councellors, as there ſhall be occaſion. And this, Sir, will concern you more then others, by how much you have a larger ſhare in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And one thing I ſhall be bold to deſire you to recommend to his Majeſty: That when any new thing ſhall be propounded to be taken into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that no Counſellor ſhould ſuddenly deliver any poſitive opinion thereof; it is not ſo eaſie with all men to retract their opinions, although there ſhall be cauſe for it: But onely to hear it, and at the moſt but to break it, at firſt, that it may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood againſt the next meeting.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. When any matter of weight hath been deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſeemeth to be ready for a reſolution; I wiſh it may not be at that ſitting concluded (unleſs the neceſſity of the time preſs it) leſt upon ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations there ſhould be cauſe to alter, which is not for the gravity and honour of that Board.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. I wiſh alſo that the King would be pleaſed ſometimes to be preſent at that Board, it adds a Majeſty to it: And yet not to be too frequently
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:29485:326"/>
there, that would render it leſſe eſteemed when it is become common; Beſides, it may ſometimes make the Councellors not to be ſo free in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in his preſence, as they would be in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Beſides the giving of Counſel, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors are bound by their Duties <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> as well as by their Oaths, to keep counſel; therefore are they called <hi>de Privato Conſilio Regis, &amp; à ſeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioribus conſili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> Regis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. One thing I add, in the negative, which is not fit for that Board, the entertaining of private cauſes, of <hi>meum &amp; tuum;</hi> thoſe ſhould be left to the ordinary courſe and Courts of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. As there is great care to be uſed for the Councellors themſelves to be choſen, ſo there is of the Clerks of the Council alſo, for the ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Couſultations; and methinks, it were fit that his Majeſty be ſpeedily moved, to give a ſtrict charge, and to binde it with a ſolemn order (if it be not already ſo done) that no copies of the orders of that Table be delivered out by the Clerks of the Councel, but by the order of the Board; nor any not being a Councellor, or a Clerk of the Councel, or his Clerk, to have acceſſe to the Councel-Books: and to that purpoſe, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants attending the Clerks of the Councel be bound to ſecrecy, as well as their Maſters.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. For the great Offices and Officers of the Kingdome, I ſhall ſay little; for the moſt of them are ſuch, as cannot well be ſevered from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorſhip; and therefore the ſame rule is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeved for both, in the choice of them: In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, onely, I adviſe this, let them be ſet in
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:29485:326"/>
thoſe places for which they are probably the moſt fit.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. But in the quality of the perſons, I conceive it will be moſt convenient to have ſome of every ſort, (as in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was) one Biſhop at the leaſt, in reſpect of queſtions touching Religion, or Church-Government; one or more skilled in the Laws; ſome for Martial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and ſome for Foreign affairs: By this mixture one will help another, in all things that ſhall there happen to be moved: But if that would fail, it will be a ſafe way, to conſult with ſome other able perſons well verſed in that point which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Conſultation, which yet may be done ſo warily, as may not diſcover the main end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. In the next place, I ſhall put you in minde of the Foreign Negotiations and Embaſſies, to or with Foreign Princes or States, wherein I ſhall be little able to ſerve you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Onely I will tell you what was the courſe in the happy dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom it will be no diſ-reputation to follow: She did vary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the employment, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſons ſhe employed; which is a good rule to go by.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If it were an Embaſſy of Gratulation or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony (which muſt not be neglected) choice was made of ſome noble perſon, eminent in place, and able in purſe, and he would take it as a mark offavour, and diſcharge it without any great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Queen's Coffers, for his owne honours ſake.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="636" facs="tcp:29485:327"/>
3. But if it were an Embaſſie of weight, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affairs of State, choice was made of ſome ſad perſon of known judgement, wiſdome and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not of a young man, not wayed in State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters; nor of a meer formal man, whatſoever his title or outſide were.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Yet in company of ſuch, ſome young to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Noblemen or Gentlemen were uſually ſent alſo, as Aſſiſtants or Attendants, according to the quality of the perſons, who might be thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and fitted for the like employment, by this means, at another turn.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In their company were alwayes ſent ſome grave and ſad men, skilful in the Civil Laws, and ſome in the Languages, and ſome who had been formerly converſant in the Courts of thoſe Princes, and knew their wayes; theſe were Aſſiſtants in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but not truſted to manage the Affairs in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; that would detract from the honour of the principal Embaſſador.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If the Negotiation were about Merchants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, then were the perſons employed for the moſt part Doctors of the Civil Law, aſſiſted with ſome other diſcreet men; and in ſuch the charge was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily defrayed by the Company or Society of Merchants, whom the Negotiation concerned.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If Legier Embaſſadors or Agents were ſent to remain in or neer the Courts of thoſe Princes or States (as it was ever held fit, to obſerve the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to hold correſpondency with them, upon all occaſions) ſuch were made choice of, as were preſumed to be vigilant, induſtrious, and diſcreet men, and had the language of the place whither they were ſent; and with theſe were ſent ſuch as
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:29485:327"/>
were hopeful to be worthy of the like employment at another time.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Their care was, to give true and timely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all Occurrences, either to the Queen her ſelf, or the Secretaries of State, unto whom they had their immediate relation.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Their charge was always born by the Queen, duly paid out of the Exchequer, in ſuch proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as, according to their qualities and places might give them an honourable ſubſiſtence there: But for thereward of their ſervice, they were to expect it upon their return, by ſome ſuch preferment as might be worthy of them, and yet be little bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Queens Coffers or Revenues.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. At their going forth, they had their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtructions in writing, which might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Miniſters of that State whither they were ſent; and they had alſo private Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon particular occaſions; and at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, they did always render an account of ſome things to the Queen her ſelf, of ſome things to the body of the Council, and of ſome others to the Secretaries of State, who made uſe of them, or communicated them, as there was cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In thoſe days there was a conſtant courſe held, that by the advice of the Secretaries, or ſome principal Councellors, there were always ſent forth into ſeveral parts beyond the Seas ſome young men, of whom good hopes were conceived of their towardlineſſe, to be trained up, and made fit for ſuch publick Employments, and to learn the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. This was at the charge of the Queen, which was not much, for they travelled but as private Gentlemen; and as by their induſtry their
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:29485:328"/>
deſerts did appear, ſo far were they further em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed or rewarded. This courſe I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you, to breed up a Nurſery of ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Plants.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. For Peace and War, and thoſe things which appertain to either; I in my own diſpoſition and profeſſion am wholly for peace, if pleaſe God to bleſſe the Kingdom therewith, as for many years paſt he hath done: and,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I preſume I ſhall not need to perſwade you to the advancing of it; nor ſhall you need to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King your Maſter therein, for that he hath hither to been another <hi>Solomon</hi> in this our <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> and the Motto which he hath choſen <hi>(Beati Pacifici)</hi> ſhews his own judgement: But he muſt uſe the means to preſerve it, elſe ſuch a jewel may be loſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God is the God of Peace (it is one of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes) therefore by him alone we muſt pray, and hope to continue it: there is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And the King muſt not neglect the juſt ways for it; Juſtice is the beſt Protector of it at home, and providence for War is the beſt prevention of it from abroad.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Wars are either Foreign or Civil; for the Foreign War by the King upon ſome neigbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I hope we are ſecure; the King, in his juſt and pious diſpoſition, is not inclinable thereunto; his Empire is long enough, bounded with the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as if the very ſituation thereof had taught the King and People to ſet up their reſts, and ſay, <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="639" facs="tcp:29485:328"/>
5. And for a war of invaſion from abroad; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt not be over-ſecure, that's the way to invite it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But if we be always prepared to receive an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, if the ambition or malice of any ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him, we may be very confident we ſhall long live in peace and quietneſſe, without any attempt upon us.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. To make the preparations hereunto the more aſſured: In the firſt place, I will recommend unto you the care of our out-work, the Navy Royal and Shipping of our Kingdome, which are the walls thereof; and every great Ship is as an impregnable ſort; and our many ſafe and commodious Ports and Havens in every of theſe Kingdomes, are as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts to ſecure them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For the body of the Ships, no Nation of the world doth equal <hi>England,</hi> for the Oaken Timber where with to build them; and we need not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of any other, iron for Spikes, or Nails to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them together: but there muſt be a great deal of providence uſed, that our Ship-Timber be not unneceſſarily waſted.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But for Tackling, as Sails and Cordage, we are beholden to our neighbours for them, and do buy them for our money; that muſt be foreſeen and layd up in ſtore againſt a time of need, and not ſought for when we are to uſe them: But we are much too blame, that we make them not at home, onely Pitch and Tar we have not of our own.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. For the true Art of building of Ships, for burthen and ſervice both, no Nation in the world exceeds us: Ship-wrights and all other Artizans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Trade muſt be cheriſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="640" facs="tcp:29485:329"/>
11. Powder and Ammunition of all ſorts we can have at home, and in exchange for other home commodities we may be plentifully ſupplied from our Neighbours, which muſt not be neglected.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. With Mariners and Seamen this Kingdom is plentifully furniſhed, the conſtant Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing will furniſh us at a need; and navigable Rivers will repair the ſtore, both to the Navy Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and to the Merchants, if they be ſet on work, and well payed for their labour.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Sea-Captains and Commanders, and other Officers muſt be encouraged, and riſe by degrees, as their fidelity and induſtry deſerve it.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Our ſtrict League of amity and alliance with our neere Neighbours the <hi>Hollanders</hi> is a mutual ſtrength to both; the ſhipping of both, in conjuncture, being ſo powerful, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as no Foreigners will venture upon; This League and Friendſhip muſt inviolably be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 From <hi>Scotland</hi> we have had in former times ſome Alarms and Inrodes into the Northern parts of this Kingdome; but that happy union of both Kingdomes under one Soveraign, our gracious King, I hope, hath taken away all occaſions of breach between the two Nations; let not the cauſe ariſe from <hi>England,</hi> and I hope the <hi>Scots</hi> will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it; or if they do, I hope they will finde, that although to our King they were his firſt-born Subjects, yet to <hi>England</hi> belongs the birth-right: But this ſhould not be any cauſe to offer any injury to them, nor to ſuffer any from them.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. There remains then no danger, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, but a Civil War, from which God of
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:29485:329"/>
his mercy defend us, as that which is moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of all others. The Kings wiſdome and juſtice muſt prevent it, if it may be; or if it ſhould happen, <hi>quod abſit,</hi> he muſt quench that wilde-fire with all the diligence that poſſible can be.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Competition to the Crown, there is none, nor can be; therefore it muſt be a fire within the bowels, or nothing, the cures whereof are theſe; <hi>Remedium praeveniens,</hi> which is the beſt phyſick either to a natural bod, or to a State, by juſt and equal Government to take away the occaſion; and <hi>Remedium puniens,</hi> if the other prevail not: The ſervice and vigilance of the Deputy-Lieutenants in every County, and of the high-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="18">18. But if that ſhould not prevail, by a wiſe and timous inquiſition, the peccant humours and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſts muſt be diſcovered, and purged, or cut off; mercy in ſuch a caſe, in a King, is truly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Yet if the Heads of the Tribes can be taken off, and the miſ-led multitude will ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and return to their obedience, ſuch an extent of mercy is both honourable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. A King, againſt a ſtorm, muſt fore-ſee, to have a convenient ſtock of treaſure: and neither be without money, which is the ſinews of War, nor to depend upon the courteſie of others, which may fail at a pinch.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. He muſt alſo have a Magazine of all ſorts, which muſt be had from Foreign parts, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at home; and to commit them to ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, under the cuſtody of truſty and faithfull
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:29485:330"/>
Miniſters and Officers, if it be poſſible.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. He muſt make choice of expert and able Commanders to conduct and manage the War, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt a foreign invaſion, or a home-rebellion; which muſt not be young and giddy, which dare, not onely to fight, but to ſwear, and drink, and curſe; neither fit to govern others, nor able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Let not ſuch be diſcouraged, if they deſerve well, by miſ-information, or for the ſatisfying the humours or ambition of others, perhaps out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, perhaps out of treachery, or other ſiniſter ends: A ſteady hand in governing of Military Affairs, is more requiſite then in times of peace, becauſe an errour committed in war, may perhaps prove ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. If God ſhall bleſſe theſe endeavours, and the King return to his own houſe in peace, when a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War ſhall be at an end, thoſe who have been found faithful in the Land muſt be regarded, yea, and rewarded alſo; the traiterous, or treacherous, who have miſled others, ſeverely puniſh'd; and the neutrals, and falſe-hearted friends and followers, who have ſtarted afide like a broken bow, be noted, <hi>Carbone nigro;</hi> and ſo I ſhall leave them, and this part of the work.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. I come now to the ſixth part, which is Trade, and that is either at home, or abroad. And I begin with that which is at home; which enableth the Subjects of the Kingdom to live, and layeth a foundation to a foreign Trade by traffique with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which enableth them to live plentifully and happily.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Home-trade, I firſt commend unto
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:29485:330"/>
your conſideration the encouragement of Tillage, which will enable the Kingdom for Corn for the Natives, and to ſpare for exportation: And I my ſelf have known, more than once, when in times of dearth, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days, it drained much coin of the Kingdom, to furniſh us with Corn from foreign parts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Good Husbands will finde the means by good husbandry, to improve their lands by Lime, Chalk, Marl, or Sea-ſand, where it can be had: But it will not be amiſs, that they be put in minde thereof, and encouraged in their induſtries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Planting of Orchards in a ſoil and air fit for them, is very profitable, as well as pleaſureable; Sider and Perry are notable Beverage in Sea-voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Gardens are alſo very profitable, if planted with Artichokes, roots, and ſuch other things as are fit for food; whence they are called Kitchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardens, and that very properly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The planting of Hop-yards, ſowing of Woad, and Rape-ſeed, are found very profitable for the Planters, in places apt for them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable for the Kingdome, which for divers years was furniſhed with them from beyond the Seas.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The planting and preſerving of Woods, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Timber, is not onely profitable, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, therewith to furniſh poſterity, both for building and ſhipping.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Kingdom would be much improved, by draining of drowned lands, and gaining that in from the over-flowing of ſalt waters and the ſea, and from freſh waters alſo.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d are exceeding commodious.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Much good land might be gained from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Chaſes, more remote from the King's acceſs, and from other commonable places; ſo as always there be a due care taken, that the poor Commoners have no injury by ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The making of navigable Rivers would be very profitable; they would be as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draughts of wealth, by conveying of commodities with eaſe from place to place.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The planting of Hemp and Flax would be an unknown advantage to the Kingdome, many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therein being as apt for it, as any Forreign parts.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But add hereunto, that it be converted into Linen-cloath, or Cordage, the commodity thereof will be multiplied.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. So it is of the Wools and Leather of the Kingdome, if they be converted into Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dames are much given to the wearing of coſtly Laces; and, if they be brought from <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> they are in great eſteem; whereas, if the like Laces were made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo much threed as would make a yard of Lace, being put into that Manufacture, would be five times, or perhaps ten, or twenty times the value.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The breeding of Cattel is of much profit, eſpecially the breed of Horſes, in many places, not onely for travel, but for the great ſaddle; the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
                        <pb n="645" facs="tcp:29485:331"/>
Horſe, for ſtrength, and courage, and ſwiftneſſe together, not being inferiour to the horſes of any other Kingdome.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Minerals of the Kingdom, of Lead, T<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Copper, and Tynn eſpecially, are of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and ſet many able-bodied ſubjects on work; it were great pity they ſhould not be induſtriouſly followed.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. But of all Minerals, there is none like to that of Fiſhing upon the coaſts of theſe Kingdomes, and the ſeas belonging to them: our Neighbors within half a days ſail of us, with a good winde, can ſhew us the uſe and value thereof; and, doubtleſſe there is ſea-room enough for both Nations, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending one another; and it would exceedingly ſupport the Navy.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. This Realm is much enriched, of late years, by the Trade of Merchandize which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drive in Foreign parts; and, if it be wiſely managed, it muſt of neceſſity very much increaſe the wealth thereof; care being taken, that the exportation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in value the importation, for then the balance of Trade muſt of neceſſity be returned in Coin, or Bullion.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. This would eaſily be effected, if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants were perſwaded, or compelled to make their returns in ſolid commodities, and not too much thereof in vanity, tending to exceſs.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. But eſpecially care muſt be taken, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, which are the Cankers of all trading, be not admitted, under ſpecious colours of publick good.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. To put all theſe into a regulation, if a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Commiſſion to men of honeſty and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:29485:332"/>
were granted, and well purſued, to give order for the managing of theſe things both at home and abroad, to the beſt advantage; and that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion were ſubordinate to the Councel-board, it is conceived it would produce notable effects.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The next thing is that of Colonies and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Plantations, which are very neceſſary, as out-lets to a populous Nation, and may be profitable alſo, if they be managed in a diſcreet way.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, in the choice of the place; which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many circumſtances, as the ſituation neer the Sea, for the commodiouſneſs of an intercourſe with <hi>England,</hi> the temper of the Air and climate, as may beſt agree with the bodies of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to cold, than heat; that it be ſtored with Woods, Mines, and Fruits, which are naturally in the place; that the ſoil be ſuch as will probably be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Corn, and other conveniencies, &amp; for breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cattel; that it hath Rivers, both for paſſage between place and place, and for fiſhing alſo, if it may be; that the Natives be not ſo many, but that there may be elbow-room enough for them, and for the Adventives alſo: All which are likely to be found in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It would be alſo ſuch as is not already planted by the Subjects of any Chriſtian Prince, or State, nor over-neerly neighbouring to their Plantation. And it would be more convenient, to be choſen by ſome of thoſe Gentlemen or Merchants which move firſt in the work, than to be deſigned unto them from the King; for it muſt proceed from the option of the people, elſe it ſounds like an Exile: ſo the Colonies muſt be raiſed by the leave of the King, and not by his command.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="647" facs="tcp:29485:332"/>
3. After the place is made choice of, the firſt ſtep muſt be, to make choice of a fit Governour, who although he have not the name, yet he muſt have the power of a <hi>Vice-Roy;</hi> and if the perſon who principally moved in the work be not fit for that truſt, yet he muſt not be excluded from command; but then his defect in the Governing part muſt be ſupplied by ſuch Aſſiſtants as ſhall be joyned with him, or as he ſhall very well approve of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As at their ſetting out they muſt have their Commiſſion, or Letters Patents from the King, that ſo they may acknowledge their dependency upon the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and under his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo they muſt receive ſome general inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how to diſpoſe of themſelves when they come there, which muſt be in nature of Lawes unto them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But the general Law, by which they muſt be guided and governed, muſt be the Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> and to that end it will be fit, that ſome man, reaſonably ſtudied in the Law, and otherwiſe qualified for ſuch a purpoſe, be perſwaded (if not thereunto inclined of himſelf, which were the beſt) to go thither as a Chancellor amongſt them, at firſt; and when the Plantation were more ſetled, then to have Courts of Juſtice there, as in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. At the firſt planting, or as ſoon after as they can, they muſt make themſelves defenſible both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Natives, and againſt Strangers; and to that purpoſe, they muſt have the aſſiſtance of ſome able Military man, and convenient Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for their defence.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. For the Diſcipline of the Church in thoſe parts, it will be neceſſary, that it agree with that
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:29485:333"/>
which is ſetled in <hi>England;</hi> elſe it will make a Schiſm, and a rent in Chriſts Coat, which muſt be ſeamleſs: and, to that purpoſe, it will be fit, that by the King's ſupream power in. Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, within all his Dominions, they be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate under ſome Biſhop and Biſhoprick of this Realm.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For the better defence againſt a common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, I think it would be beſt, that Foreign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſhould be placed in one Continent, and neer together; whereas, if they be too remote the one from the other, they will be diſ-united, and ſo the weaker.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They muſt provide themſelves of houſes, ſuch as for the preſent, they can, and, at more leiſure, ſuch as may be better; and they firſt muſt plant for Corn and Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for food, and neceſſary ſuſtenance; and after, they may enlarge themſelves for thoſe things which may be for profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to traffique withal alſo.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Woods for ſhipping in the firſt place, may doubtleſſe be there had, and Minerals there found, perhaps, of the richeſt; howſoever, the Mines out of the fruits of the earth, and ſeas, and waters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, may be found in abundance.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In a ſhort time they may build Veſſels and Ships alſo for Traffique with the parts neer adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with <hi>England</hi> alſo, from whence they may be furniſhed with ſuch things as they may want, and in exchange, or barter, ſend from thence other things, with which quickly, either by Nature, or Art, they may abound.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But theſe things would, by all means be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; That no known Bankrupt, for ſhelter; nor
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:29485:333"/>
known Murderer, or other wicked perſon, to avoid the Law; nor known Heretick, or Schiſmatick, be ſuffered to go into thoſe Countreys; or, if they do creep in there, not to be harboured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or continued: elſe, the place would receive them naught, and return them into <hi>England,</hi> upon all occaſions, worſe.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. That no Merchant, under colour of driving a Trade thither, or from thence, be ſuffered to work upon their neceſſities.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And that to regulate all theſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which will inſenſibly grow upon them, that the King be pleaſed to erect a ſubordinate Council in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe care and charge ſhall be, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and put in execution, all things which ſhall be found fit for the good of thoſe new Plantations; who, upon all occaſions, ſhall give an account of their proceedings to the King, or to the Councel-board, and from them receive ſuch directions as may beſt agree with the Government of that place.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. That the King's reaſonable profit be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, partly, upon reſervation of moderate rents and ſervices; and partly upon Cuſtoms; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon importation and exportation of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize; which, for a convenient time after the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation begin, would be very eaſie, to encourage the work; but, after it is well ſetled, may be raiſed to a conſiderable proportion, worthy the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. I come to the laſt of thoſe things which I propounded, which is, the Court, and Curia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>The other did properly concern the King, in his
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:29485:334"/>
Royal capacity, as <hi>Pater patriae;</hi> this more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Paterfamilias:</hi> And herein,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſhall, in a word, and but in a word onely, put you in minde, That the King in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both in reſpect of his Houſhold, or Court, and in reſpect of his whole Kingdom; (for a little Kingdom is but as a great Houſhold, and a great Houſhold, as a little Kingdom) muſt be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Regis ad exemplum, &amp;c.</hi> But for this, God be praiſed, our charge is eaſie; for your gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for his Learning and Piety, Juſtice and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be, and is, not onely a preſident to his own Subjects, but to foreign Princes alſo; yet he is ſtill but a man, and ſeaſonable <hi>Memento's</hi> may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and being diſcreetly uſed, cannot but take well with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But your greateſt care muſt be, that the great men of his Court (for you muſt give me leave to be plain with you, for ſo is your injunction laid upon me) your ſelf in the firſt place, who is firſt in the eye of all men, give no juſt cauſe of ſcandal, either by light, or vaine, or by oppreſſive car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The great Officers of the King's Houſhold had need be both diſcreet and provident perſons, both for his Honour, and for his Thrift: they muſt look both ways, elſe they are but half-ſighted: Yet in the choice of them, there is more latitude left to affection, than in the choice of Councellors, and of the great Officers of State, before touched, which muſt always be made choice of meerly out of judgement, for in them the Publick hath a great intereſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="651" facs="tcp:29485:334"/>
4. For the other Miniſterial Officers in Court (as, for diſtinction ſake, they may be termed) there muſt be alſo an eye unto them, and upon them; they have uſually riſen in the Houſhold by degrees, and it is a noble way, to encourage faithful ſervice: But the King muſt not binde himſelf to a neceſſity herein, for then it will be held <hi>ex debito;</hi> neither muſt he alter it, without an apparent cauſe for it: but to diſplace any who are in, upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, which for the moſt part happeneth upon the information of ſome great man, is, by all means to be avoided, unleſſe there be a manifeſt cauſe for it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In theſe things you may ſometimes interpoſe, to do juſt and good offices: but for the general, I ſhould rather adviſe, meddle little, but leave the ordering of thoſe Houſhold-affairs to the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, which are thoſe honourable perſons, to whom it properly belongeth, to be anſwerable to the King for it; and to thoſe other Officers of the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, who are ſubordinate to them, as a kinde of Councel, and a Court of Juſtice alſo.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Yet for the Green-cloath Law, (take it in the largeſt ſenſe) I have no opinion of it, farther then it is regulated by the juſt Rules of the Common-Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Towards the ſupport of his Majeſties own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of the Princes, and of his neceſſary Officers, his Majeſty hath a good help by Purveyance, which juſtly is due unto him; and, if juſtly uſed, is no great burthen to the Subject; but by the Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and other under-Officers, is many times abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. In many parts of the Kingdome, I think it is already reduced to a certainty in money; and if it
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:29485:335"/>
be indifferently and diſcreetly managed, it would be no hard matter to ſettle it ſo throughout the whole Kingdom; yet to be renewed from time to time, for that will be the beſt, and ſafeſt, both for the King, and People.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The King muſt be put in minde, to preſerve the Revenues of his Crown both certain, and caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, without diminution, and to lay up treaſure in ſtore againſt a time of extreamity; empty Coffers give an ill found, and make the people many time forget their Duty; thinking that the King muſt be beholden to them for his ſupplies.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. I ſhall by no means think it fit, that he reward any of his ſervants with the benefit of forfeitures, either by Fines in the Court of Star-Chamber, or High-Commiſſion Courts, or other Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; or that they ſhould be farmed out, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon any, ſo much as by promiſe, before judgement given; it would neither be profitable, nor honourable.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Beſides matters of ſerious conſideration, in the Courts of Princes, there muſt be times for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes and diſports: When there is a Queen, and Ladies of Honour attending her, there muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be Maſques, and Revels, and Enterludes; and when there is no Queen, or Princeſs, as now, yet at Feſtivals, and for entertainment of Strangers, or upon ſuch occaſions, they may be fit alſo: Yet care would be taken, that in ſuch caſes, they be ſet off more with wit and activity, then with coſtly and waſteful expences.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But for the King and Prince, and the Lords and Chivalry of the Court, I rather commend, in their turns and ſeaſons, the riding of the great
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:29485:335"/>
Horſe, the Tilts, Barriers, Tennis, and Hunting, which are more for the health and ſtrength of thoſe who exerciſe them, than in an effeminate way to leaſe themſelves and others.</p>
                     <p>And now the Prince groweth up faſt to be a man, and is of a ſweet and excellent diſpoſition; it would he an irreparable ſtain and diſhonour upon you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that acceſſe unto him, if you ſhould miſ-led him, or ſuffer him to be miſ-lead by any flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paraſites: The whole Kingdom hath a deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his virtuous education; and if you, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that diſtance which is moſt fit, do humbly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelf, in ſuch a caſe, he will one day give you thanks for it.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Yet Dice and Cards may ſometimes be uſed for recreation, when field-ſports cannot be had; but not to uſe it as a mean to ſpend the time, much leſs to miſ-pend the thrift of the Gameſters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SIR,</hi> I ſhall trouble you no longer; I have run <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THeſe were his Rules, and this his practice: My Lord of <hi>Nottingham</hi> he bought nobly from the Admiralty; his Aſſiſtant, Vice-Admiral <hi>Maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> he entertained civilly, and procured that place for life, which he had onely during pleaſure. The Warden of the Cinque-ports reſigned his place ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably; the Maſter of the Horſe gave up his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his life opportunely.—He advanced his Relations prudently, gratifying them, and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf: He made an excellent choice of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Confederates; entertained the ableſt and moſt faithful Aſſiſtants: Doctor <hi>Williams</hi> and Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> were of his Council for the Church, Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> for the State. From the firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived frequent Schedules of Perſons and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; from the other conſtant Tranſcripts of Rules and Intelligence: Never any man more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his approved friend, never any more fatal to his known Enemies: He was the inſtrument of all the Subjects ſervices to his Soveraign, and of his Sovereign's favours to his Subjects: no place was

                  <q>The Duke's Anſwers to his Appeachments, in number thirteen, I finde very diligently and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy couched: and though his heart was big, yet they all ſavour of an humble ſpirit one way, and an equitable conſideration another, which could not but poſſeſſe every vulgar conceit, and ſomewhat allay the whole matter; that in the bolting and fifting of near fourteen years of ſuch power and favour, all that came out could not be expected to be pure, and white, and fine Meal, but muſt needs have withal among it a certain mixture of Padar and Bran in this lower age of humane fragility.

               <p>His defence againſt danger was noble, but his contempt of it nobler; for when Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> adviſed him onely to turn out of the ordinary road, <q>He reſolved not to wave his way upon this reaſon, perhaps more generous then provident; That if, as he ſaid, he ſhould but once by ſuch a diverſion

                     <hi>He would not</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>accept of ſuch an offer in that caſe from a Nephew, whoſe life be tendered as much as himſelf:</hi>
                  </q> But after ſome ſhort direction to his company, he rode on without perturbation of minde, though a drunken fellow laid hold of his Bridle under pretence of begging, to begin a tumult.</p>

That he propoſed a partial Reformation of our Church to the Parliament, to prevent an utter extirpation by it. 4. That he expoſed others to the cenſure of the Parliament 1625. to ſave himſelf. 5. That he anſwered to ſeveral Examinations without any the leaſt advantage taken by his Antagoniſt. This character of his I think very exact. That his head
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:29485:346"/>
was a well-fitted treaſury, and his tongue the fair key to unlock it: That he had as great a memory as could be reconciled with ſo good a judgement: That ſo quick his parts, that others ſtudy went not beyond his nature; and their deſigned and forelayd performances, went not beyond his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ready accommodations: Onely he was very open, and too free in diſcourſe, diſdaining to lye at a cloſe guard, as confident of the length and ſtrength of his weapon.</p>

Some, that of <hi>confidence;</hi> others, that of <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>caution,</hi> &amp;c. when indeed the main buſineſſe is, to <hi>ſuit our ſelves</hi> with our own times; which this Lord did, and no man better, untill looking into the depths of the late Faction, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at the Council-Table, 1639. that <hi>they aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ruine of Church and State.</hi> And viewing the ſtate of the Kingdome, he adviſed; <hi>That Leagues might be made abroad;</hi> and, <hi>that in this inevitable neceſſity, all wayes to raiſe money ſhould be uſed that were lawful.</hi> Wherefore he was one of thoſe few excluded the Indempnity by the Faction, and had the honour to dye baniſhed for the beſt Cauſe and Maſter, in thoſe foreign Countries; where he ſuffered as nobly for the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in his later dayes, as he had acted honourably for it in his former. When he never came off better than in ſatisfying the <hi>Spanyards</hi> about toleration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the whole of that affair to theſe two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Conſciences were not to be forced, but to be won and reduced by the evidence of Truth, with the aid of Reaſon, and in the uſe of all good means of Inſtruction and perſwaſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the cauſes of Conſcience, wherein they exceed their bounds, and grow to matter of faction, loſe their nature: and that Soveraign Princes ought diſtinctly to puniſh thoſe foul practices, though overlaid with the fairer pretences of Conſcience and Religion.</p>
               <p>One of his Maximes for Treaty I think remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz. That Kingdomes are more ſubject to fear than hope:</hi> And that it's ſafer working upon them by a power that may awe the one, than by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:29485:348"/>
that may excite the other.—Since it's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule, that States have no affections but inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and that all kindneſſe and civility in thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are but <hi>overſights</hi> and <hi>weakneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another of his rules for Life I judge uſeful, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince no man is abſolute in all points, and ſince men are more naturally enclined out of <hi>envy</hi> to obſerve mens <hi>infirmities,</hi> than out of <hi>ingenuity</hi> to acknowledge their <hi>merit;</hi>—He diſcovereth his abilities <hi>moſt,</hi> that <hi>leaſt</hi> diſcovereth <hi>himſelf.</hi> To which I may add another, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our known duty, but our viſible advantage, to aſcribe our moſt eminent performances to provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſince it not onely takes off the edge of envy, but improves the reaſon of admiration. None be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſſe maliced, or more applauded than he, who is thought rather happy than able; bleſſed, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; and fortunate, than cunning.</p>
               <p>Though yet all the caution of his life could not avoid the envy of his advancement from ſo mean a beginning to ſo great honours,—notwithſtanding that it is no diſparagement to any to give place to freſh Nobility, who aſcend the ſame ſteps with thoſe before them. <hi>New</hi> being onely a terme, ſaith one, onely reſpecting us, not the world; for what is, was before us, and will be when we are no more: And indeed this Perſonage conſidering the vanity and inconſtancy of common applauſe or affronts, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the one, and checked the other, by a conſtant neglect of both.</p>

He was cenſured for that fatall errour of following the King to</hi> London, <hi>and to the Parliament, after the Pacification at</hi> York: <hi>And it was thought, that if he bad gone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to his Charge in</hi> Ireland, <hi>he might have ſecured both himſelf and that Kingdome for his Majeſties ſervice: But ſome attribute this Counſel to a neceſſity of fate, whoſe firſt ſtroke is at the Drain of thoſe whom it deſigns to ruine, and brought him to feel the effects of popular rage, which himſelf in former Parliaments bad uſed againſt Government, and to finde the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his own devices upon the Duke of</hi> Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. <hi>Providence teacheth</hi> us to abhor over-fine Councels, by the miſchiefs they often bring upon their Authors.</p>

                  <q>A Gentleman he was of rare, choice, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Endowments, I mean, of ſuch as modelled, faſhioned, and accompliſhed him for State-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments; of a ſearching and penetrating judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nimble apprehenſion, ready and fluence in all reſults of Councel. Moſt happy in the veins of ſpeech, which was always round, perſpicuous, and expreſſe, much to the advantage of his fenſe
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:29485:387"/>
and ſo full ſtocked with reaſon, that he might be rather ſaid to demonſtrate, than to argue. As theſe abilities raiſed him to State-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo his Addreſſing, his applying choſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſo faithfully in promotion of the Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſoon rendered him a Favourite of the firſt admiſſion: So that never King had a more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and withal a firmer ſervant than he was to his Maſter. But theſe qualities which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him ſo amiable to his Majeſty, repreſented him formidable to the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo that ſome who were not well perſwaded of the juſtneſſe of his ſentence, thought he ſuffered not ſo much for what he had done already, as for what he was like to have done, had he lived, to the diſſervice of that Nation: And that he was not ſacrificed ſo much to the <hi>Scots revenge,</hi> as to their <hi>fear.</hi> And certainly his fall was as the firſt, ſo the moſt fatal wound the King's Intereſt ever received: His three Kingdomes hardly affording another <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that is, one man his peer in parts and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his Majeſty. He had a ſingular paſſion for the Government and Patrimony of the Church, both which he was ſtudious to preſerve ſafe and ſound; either opining them to be of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred extraction, or at leaſt prudent conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, relating to holy performances. And had he wanted theſe poſitive graces, yet in ſo great a Perſon it may be commendable, that he was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for privative and negative Excellencies, being not taxable with any Vice; thoſe petty pleaſures being beneath the ſatisfaction of a ſoul ſo large as his. In ſhort, ſaith the ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he was a man who might have paſſed

               <p>This laſt period is a queſtion, ſince this great States-man, and his good Maſter's goodneſſe was ſo over-ſhadowed with their greatneſſe, and their vertues ſo loſt in their power, as the Sun (the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parallel of their luſtre and beneficence) is hid in his own light, that they owe their great, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſame to their misfortunes, and their renown to their ruine, that levelled their worth, otherwiſe as much out of their reach as their place, to vulgar apprehenſions.

               <p>So faithful he was, and the Arch-Biſhop, that in the Juncto conſiſting of them two and Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> they voted a Parliament, though they knew themſelves the firſt ſufferers by it: and ſo confident of his integrity, that when he had treaſon enough diſcovered at the late tranſactions in <hi>Yorke</hi> (touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Scots</hi> conſpiracy) to charge his enemies with, he waved the advantage; and ſecure in his own innocence, fell an inſtance of that Maxime; <hi>That there is no danger ſmall, but what is thought ſo.</hi> This was his great principle; <hi>

He found that where Papiſts were ſilenced and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the more grand and pregnant Diſputes (that they are Novel, partial, and unconform to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Churches in ancient times) then he found they recovered ſpirits, and conteſted afreſh again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Antipathy to Papiſts. Poſſibly the Arch-Biſhop and ſome other Biſhops of his minde did rightly judge, That the giving an Enemy fair play by juſt, ſafe, and honourable conceſſions, was not to yield the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to him, but the moſt ready way to convince him of his weakneſſe; when no honeſt yieldings could help him any more, then they did endanger the true cauſe or courage of his Antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>For my part, I think the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> was neither <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> nor <hi>Lutheran,</hi> nor <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as to any ſide or party; but all, ſo far as he ſaw, they agreed with the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> either in Fundamentals, or innocent and decent Superſtructures: Yet I believe he was ſo far a Proteſtant, and of the Reformed Religion, as he ſaw the Church of <hi>England</hi> did proteſt againſt the Errors, Corruptions, Uſurpations, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or againſt the novel opinions and practices of any party whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And certainly he did with as much honour as juſtice ſo far own the Authentick Authority, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Majeſty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (in it's reforming and ſetling of it's Religion) that he did not think fit any private new Maſters whatſoever, ſhould obtrude any Foreign or Domeſtick Dictates to her, or force her to take her copy of Religion from ſo petty a place as <hi>Geneva</hi> was, or <hi>Frankefort,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> or <hi>Edenborough;</hi> no nor from <hi>Augsburg,</hi> or <hi>Arnheim,</hi> nor any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign City or Town, any more than from <hi>Trent</hi> or <hi>Rome;</hi> none of which had any Dictatorian Authority over this great and famous Nation or Church of <hi>England,</hi> further than they offered ſober Counſels, or ſuggeſted good Reaſons, or cleared true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

by Scripture, and confirmed it by good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as the beſt interpreter and decider of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure places, and dubious caſes.</p>
               <p>Which high value, it is probable, as to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was ſo potent in the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that, as he thought it not fit to ſubject her to the inſolency of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo nor to the impertinencies of any other Church or Doctor, of far leſſe repute in the Chriſtian world.

I having occaſion to ſpeak with him, he upon a time was pleaſed to grant me acceſs, &amp; ſome freedom of ſpeech with him; and withal asked me the opinion of the people of him: I told him they reported his Lordſhip endeavoured to betray the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> correſpondency and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. He at length very calmly and gravely thus reylyed; proteſting with a ſerious atteſtation of his integrity before God's Omniſcience, that however he might miſtake in the mean and method, yet he never had other deſign than the glory of God, the ſervice of his Majeſty, the good order, peace and decency of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> that he was ſo far from complying with Papiſts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to confirm them in their Errors, that he rather choſe ſuch Methods to advance the honour of the
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:29485:394"/>
reformed Religion in <hi>England,</hi> as he believed might ſoon ſilence the cavils of fiercer Papiſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the more moderate Recuſants to come in to us, as having leſſe viſible occaſion given them by needleſſe Diſtances and Diſputes to ſeparate from us; which he thought aroſe much from that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Variety, Inconſtancy, Eaſineſſe, Irreverence and Uncomelineſs, which might eaſily grow among us in the outward profeſſion of Religion, for want of obſerving ſuch uniformity and decency in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as were required by the Laws and Canons of this Church and State. He added, that he had (further) a deſire, as much as he could to relieve the poor and depreſſed condition of many Miniſters, which he had to his grief obſerved in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> where their Diſcouragements were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, by reaſon of the tenuity and incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of their Livings; that in his Viſitations he had ſometime ſeen it with grief, among twenty Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, not one man had ſo much as a decent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on, nor did he believe their other treatment of Life was better; that he found the ſordid and ſhameful Aſpect of Religion and the Clergy, gave great Advantages to thoſe that were Popiſhly inclined, who would hardly ever think it beſt for them to joyn with that Church which did not maintain either it's own Honour, or it's Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to ſome competency and comelineſs.</p>
               <p>Much more diſcourſes his Lordſhip was pleaſed to uſe at ſeveral times to this purpoſe, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my charity to clear him, as far as I can judge, of any tincture of Popery truly ſo called; or of any ſuperſtition, which placeth a Religion in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and uſe of that thing which God hath not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

His two great Actions, the one at <hi>Liſcard,</hi> the other at <hi>Stratton,</hi> cannot be better deſcribed than by an Eye-witneſſe, whoſe are theſe: as he ſaith, out of a Manuſcript corrected with Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>'s own hand, communicated to him by his Secretary Mr. <hi>Tredus.</hi>

               <p>On the King's ſide, order was given to force the paſſage to the top of the Hill by four ſeveral Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues: the aſcent was ſteep and difficult; reſolutely did his Majeſties Forces get up, and obſtinately did the Enemy keep them down.

Betwixt three and four of the Clock the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the King's Forces, who embraced thoſe four ſeveral wayes of aſcent, met to their mutual joy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the top of the hill, which the routed enemy <hi>confuſedly</hi> forſook. In this ſervice, though they were Aſſailants, they loſt very few men, and no conſiderable Officer, killing of the Enemy about three hundred, and taking ſeventeen hundred pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, all their Cannon (being thirteen pieces of braſſe Ordnance) and Ammunition (ſeventy barrels of powder) with a Magazine of Bisket and other proviſion proportionable. For this victory publick Prayer and Thankſgiving was made on the hill; then the Army was diſpoſed of to improve their ſucceſſe to the beſt advantage.—Nothing had ſunk this great ſpirit, but the fate of Kingdomes, with whoſe ruine onely he was contented to fall, and disband his brave Soldiers upon honourable terms.

His youth was prepared for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſtudy, <q>without which even the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts of Noble-men ſeem rough and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:29485:402"/>
ſant, in deſpight of the ſplendor of their fortune: But his riper years endured not thoſe retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</q> and therefore brake out into manlike exerciſes at home, and travel abroad. None more noble, yet none more modeſt; none more valiant, yet none more patient.—A Phyſician at his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law's Table gave him the Lye; which put the company to admire on the one hand the man's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and on the other my Lord's mildeneſſe, until he ſaid, <hi>I'll take the Lye</hi> from <hi>him, but I'll never take Phyſick</hi> of <hi>him.—He may ſpeak what doth not become him, I'll not do what is unworthy of me.</hi>—A vertue this! not uſual in Noble-men, to whom the limits of Equity ſeem a reſtraint, and therefore are more reſtleſſe in Injuries. In the middeſt of horrour and tumults his ſoul was ſerene and calm. As humble he was as patient. Honour and nobility, <q>to which nothing can be added, hath no better way to increaſe,</q> than when ſecured of its own greatneſſe, it humbleth it ſelf, and ſo at once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth love, and avoideth envy. His carriage was as condeſcending as heroick, and his ſpeech as weighty as free. He was too <hi>great</hi> to envy any mans parts and vertues, and too good not to encourage them. Many a time would he ſtoop with his own ſpirit, to raiſe other mens.—He neglected the minute and little circumſtances of compliance with vulgar hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, aiming at what was more ſolid and more weighty: Moderate men are applauded, but the <hi>Heroick are never underſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſtant he was in all that was good: this was his heroick expreſſion when ſolicited by his Wives Father to deſiſt from his engagement with the King,
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:29485:403"/>
                  <hi>Leave me to my Honour and Allegiance.</hi> No ſecurity to him worth a breach of Truſt; no intereſt worth being unworthy. His conduct was as eminent in War, as his carriage in Peace; many did he oblige by the generoſity of his minde, more did he awe with the hardineſſe of his body; which was no more ſoftned to ſloath by the dalliances of a Court, than the other was debauched to a careleſneſſe by the greatneſſe of his <hi>Fortune.</hi> His prudence was equal to his valour, and he could entertain dangers as well as deſpiſe them; for he not onely undeceived his enemies ſurmiſes, but exceeded his own friends opinion in the conduct of his ſoldiers, of whom he had two cares: the one to diſcipline, the other to preſerve them. Therefore they were as compleatly armed without, as they were well appointed within; that ſurviving their firſt dangers, they might attain that experience &amp; reſolution w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in vain expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from young and raw ſoldiers. To this conduct of a General, he added the induſtry of a <hi>Soldier,</hi> doing much by his performances, more by his example, that went as an active ſoul to enliven each part, and the whole of his brave <hi>Squadron.</hi> 
                  <q>But there is no doubt but perſonal and private ſins may oft-times over-balance the juſtice of publick engagements.

For his Abilities, he was ſucceſſively preferred by King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and for ſome years Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England:</hi> wherein he had Religion to be honeſt, and no ſelf-intereſt to be corrupt. A troubleſome place in thoſe times, being expected he ſhould make much Brick (though not altogether without, yet) with very little ſtraw allowed unto him: Large then the Expences, low the Revenues of the Exchequer. Yet thoſe Coffers he found empty, he left filling, and had left full, had Peace been preſerved in the Land, and he continued in his Place. Such the mildeneſſe of his temper, that Petitioners for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (when it was not to be had) departed well pleaſed with his Denials, they were ſo civilly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guaged. It may juſtly ſeem a wonder, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as few ſpake well of Biſhops at that time, and Lord Treaſurers at all Times are liable to the complaints
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:29485:414"/>
of diſcontented people; though both Offices met in this man, yet with <hi>Demetrius</hi> he was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of all men, and of the truth it ſelf.

               <p>Nor was it the leaſt part of this Prelat's honour, that amongſt the many worthy Biſhops of our Land, King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt ſelected him for his Confeſſor at his Martyrdome, when he honoured him with this teſtimony; <hi>That good man.</hi> He formerly had had experience [in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford]</hi> that this Biſhop's Conſcience was bottom'd on piety, not policy, the reaſon that from him he received the Sacrament, good comfort and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell juſt before he was murthered.

by oppoſition, languiſh and moulder away by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence: In his duty, this good man went along with <hi>Conſcience.</hi> in Government, with Time and Law.

They need not keep ſtate, they had ſo much real power; nor extort, they had ſo much allowed advantage. His care was his ſervants, and their care his buſineſſe: His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments were his burthen rather than his honour; advanced by him, rather than advancing him—and therefore he was more ready to lay them down, than others to take them up: Witneſſe his Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Place; which when he parted with (like thoſe that ſcatter their Jewels in the way, that they may debar the violence of greedy purſuers) no leſſe than four durſt undertake; when his ſingle ſelf ſufficed for the two greateſt troubles of this Nation, the Treaſurer-ſhip of <hi>England,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Religion was the inclination and compoſure as well as care of his ſoul; which he uſed not as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of pretence or power, but as the ornament and comfort of a private breaſt, never affecting a pompous piety, nor a magnificent vertue, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:29485:415"/>
himſelf in ſecret to that God who would reward him openly. His devotion was as much above other mens, as his Calling; his meditations equall with his cares; and his thoughts <hi>even</hi> and free between his Affairs and his Contemplations, which were his pleaſures, as well as his duty, the uniform temper and pulſe of his Chriſtian ſoul.

be powerful at diſturbances: but to forme Peace, requires much wiſdome and great vertues) and his obſervations upon the diviſion of the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to two parties, <hi>Independent,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> His care and watchfulneſs; none of their claſhes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping his reach, which was ready to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date as occaſion ſerved their reſpective Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, in their New models and alterations; making as good uſe of Fears and Jealouſies between them, as they had done between the King and his People. Theſe and other his ſervices recommended him to the attendance of his moſt excellent Majeſty when Prince, in the perfecting of the Weſtern Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it was thought fit to put the happineſs and hope of the Kingdom in two bottomes, with whom he continued with a conſtant fidelity in all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, performing ſeveral Embaſſies during their baniſhment with honour (particularly one to the Emperour, who had great reſpects for his Maſter, and an aweful regard of his Cauſe) till it pleaſed God to bring his Majeſty by his and others counſel to his Father's Throne; which he juſt ſaw, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Maſter of the Rolls, <hi>June</hi> 1660. From one of whoſe Relations I have theſe Notes and Poſtils, containing ſome of the policy of the late Times, from 1642. to 1659.—which I ſet down nakedly, as I finde them; not ſuppoſing they are his, but that they were among his Papers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is againſt the experience of the wiſeſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to leave their chief City in times of tumult;—yet it was neceſſary for the King to do ſo, as well to break the fury of the worſt people there by diſtance and time, as to diſ-abuſe the beſt abroad by his preſence and time:—and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:29485:418"/>
it had been a ſhame for him to have periſhed in a tumult.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was urged, that the King ſhould not delay any longer the War,—but beſides that nothing could perſwade his gracious Majeſty to a War, but pure neceſſity; It's uſually obſerved, that if Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeus make not the feud irreconcileable by a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate action, Rebels cool, conſider, break, ſuſpect, fear, and fall off to nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The repulſe of <hi>Hotham</hi> did the King excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſervice, by alarming all the Loyal in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with their deſigned plot.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Eſpecially when the Country ſaw the King ſo unwilling to engage, that he diſcharged their guards ſeveral times.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It was thought unfit to ſend to the Faction from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> until it was rejoyned that men of underſtanding and fidelity are uſually employed to thoſe perſons againſt whom a War is to be managed, to diſcover their deſign, humour, forces, ſuccours, and what-ever might ſuccour or ſtrengthen them; which none but they who were ſecured with the priviledg of Agents might do; and none were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fitter than they that were beſt acquainted with the knowing Ladies, and the talkative Lords.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was offered that Intelligence ſhould be written to ſatisfie the people, and make the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar pretences ridiculous: But <hi>quaere,</hi> whether it is poſſible for the <hi>Areana Imperii</hi> to remain always under ſo exact a diſcipline as may admit a thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpection of the multitude without danger.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When it was urged as the fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple the King ſhould proceed upon, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was no Parliament, the King
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:29485:418"/>
being firme to his promiſe (as there was not a juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er man alive) not to diſſolve them without their leave—it was judged that ſelf-preſervation being the firſt principle in nature, that conceſſion which wiſdome ſaw then, and experience ſince, ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that principle, was rather to be repented of, than performed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is a very great advantage to the King's Cauſe, that his Meſſages of Peace were ſent alwayes after his Victories; and his Enemies after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats: And that his Declarations were natural, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as grounded upon obvious principles of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Law, and Reaſon; and theirs harſh, forced, and wilde, as grounded onely upon Pretences and Fancies.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It's a probable opinion, that it is in vain to treat with the Rebels, who can never <hi>truſt</hi> the King with their guilty heads.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is in vain to yield them any thing, ſince all Conceſſions have no other iſſue than either or both of theſe two inconveniences. 1. That they make the Faction ſo inſolent, that the King ſhould not be able to deny nor grant them any thing. 2. That they juſtified former proceedings, and layd the blame upon the King for not granting that ſooner, which he thinks fit to grant now. Beſides, it's more fit Propoſitions come to the King, than from him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It may be wondered that the King doth not cut off the chief of the Rebels, as they fall into his hands, according to the uſual Maxime in that caſe; but that his inclination to clemency is inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—and that the principle he goeth upon is fure, though deep, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo much are Man-kinde
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:29485:419"/>
in general, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in particular obliged by fair uſages, that the generality of this Nation returned nine times in 1300 years after long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Uſurpation, out of gratitude as well as duty unto their Allegiance to the poſterity of <hi>good, pious, mercifull,</hi> but <hi>unhappy</hi> Princes.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When it was urged againſt the King's going to <hi>London</hi> upon the <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> that the City would pour out freſh men upon him, as at <hi>Brainford;</hi> It was replied, that the City &amp; Country were not under ſuch ſtrong deluſions as then, but were more ſenſible of the miſeries they had been trepanned into. Beſides, there was a more miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power of converſion went along with the King's preſence where ever he came, convincing all he converſed with.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Whether the King beng ſo wiſe and able, it were not convenient to contrive it ſo, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ſee how well he acted by himſelf,—provided he had ſufficient ſecurity?</p>
               <p n="14">14. Whether it being dangerous that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſhould ſeize (as God forbid they ſhould) on the whole Court at once, it were not convenient that his Majeſty and the Prince did part, that the Kingdome might know its <hi>hope</hi> as well as its <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and that their intereſt when ſeparated, might be more ſpreading than when together?</p>
               <p n="15">15. It was judged prudence to let the ſucceſſe wherein their ſouls were unequal, overthrow the Faction by mutual Jealouſies and Animoſities, till it diſſipated all pretences, and the people ſaw none oppreſſed them in their Eſtates, Liberties, Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, more than the pretended Patrons of them all. An Indempnity without regard to any Faction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:29485:419"/>
moſt likely to render the miſled as jealous for the King, as they had been againſt him.</p>
               <p n="16">16. It were to be wiſhed that the Parliament did draw into entire Propoſitions their deſign, that his Majeſty and his People might make a clearer judgement of it in order to an accommodation.</p>
               <p n="17">17. His Majeſty muſt be ſecured of the <hi>Militiae,</hi> and againſt tumults, and all perſons inveſted in their firſt right without any controverſie—As to other matters, a full debate may ſettle them, with ſuch explanations and qualifications as may ſatisfie all parties.</p>
               <p n="18">18. It's thought his Majeſty may concur with the Parliament about the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government for three years, the time allowed by themſelves; and that at the three years end the very Kingdome will throw it off as inconſiſtent with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> temper, and unſuitable with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:—And ſo likewiſe in other things which look plauſible in the general, but are unpracticable in the particular.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Though many things are neceſſary to avoid jealouſies, which are inconvenient, yet they may be allowed, upon the reſpect of the likelihood that all things will in time return to their proper chanel—onely a general Act of indemnity is the beſt bond of Peace, whereby the numerous diſcontents of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons and families otherwiſe expoſed to ruine, might not become Fuel to new diſorders, or Seeds to future troubles, with particular regards to the priviledges of the City, notwithſtanding <hi>non-uſer, miſ-uſer, abuſer,</hi> and the intereſt of the Army,—an indulgence that would help the world to ſee clearly the Kings intentions in matter of future govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="822" facs="tcp:29485:420"/>
20. No Act to paſſe till the Peace be concluded, leſt what his Majeſty <hi>grants,</hi> may be an argument to urge what he muſt <hi>deny;</hi> ſo that he cannot treat in <hi>Honour, Freedome,</hi> or <hi>Safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Time is the beſt cure of Faction.</p>
               <p n="22">22. When the Treaty is broken off, ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide could reaſſume it without a ſeeming yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it ſhould be renewed upon the Queens moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, provided always that her name was not uſed or intimated till the Rebels willingneſs to <hi>complyance were preaſſured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſtay, I am fallen upon mine own <hi>knowing</hi> time, wherein I am fitter to read others Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than to write my own: and it becomes me rather to be inſtructed, than to inſtruct.
