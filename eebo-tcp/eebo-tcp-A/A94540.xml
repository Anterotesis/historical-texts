            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All which evils are daily fomented, and made more formidable, by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties drawing together (as we conceive not according to Law) many Companies of the Trained Bands, and others both Horſe and Foot, of this County; and retaining multitudes of Commanders and Cavaleers from other parts; and by the daily reſort of Recuſants, and perſons diſaffected in Religion, to your Majeſties Court at Yorke; and by the great preparation of Armes, and other warlike proviſions, which begets in us fears of Warres, to the great ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And laſtly, that ſince your Majeſty hath called in this County to attend your Maieſty this day, your Petitioners doe moſt humbly ſupplicate, that none either Cavaliers, or others, (who in truth have not preſent fortunes in this County) may bee admitted into any meeting this day, concerning the publique buſineſſe thereof, or hereafter into any preſent Vote, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, when any further meeting may be, to prepare and conſider of ſome fit anſwer to what your Majeſty ſhall propound; we humbly conceiving it neither juſt nor equall (but a thing to be proteſted againſt) that any whoſoever ſhould be thruſt upon us, as men of this County, that are not either by their fortune or reſidence any part of us.</p>
            <p>And now your Petitioners doe even heartily pray, that the God of Heaven (in whoſe hand are the hearts of Kings) would this day incline your Majeſties heart ſeriouſly to conſider theſe preſent and imminent miſeries that this your Kingdome now groanes under; in the peace whereof (viſibly under God) conſiſts the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, the redemption of our Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the eſtabliſhment of that Kingdome to your Majeſty and Poſterity, from thoſe deſperate and unparaleld Rebels; that ſo your Majeſty might graciouſly grant theſe your Petitioners humble deſires; which (whatſoever will be ſaid to the contrary) your Petitioners are well aſſured would abundantly redound to the glory of God, the honour and ſafety of your Majeſty the good of your Poſterity, and the only probable meanes, under God, with peace and plenty to make this your Kingdome happy; beſides the acquiſition of your peoples hearts, the greateſt treaſure of Princes: all which will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly repreſent your Majeſty a lively portraiture of him, who is the fountaine of Wiſdome and Piety: To whom wee ſhall ever pray for your Majeſties long and proſperous Reigne.</p>
