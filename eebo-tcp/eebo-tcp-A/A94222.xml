            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The thing mainly toucht in the ſaid Epiſtle is <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> whereof they make repreſentation not of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>illegality</hi> onely, but of the <hi>ill effects</hi> too; as namely, how <hi>the Biſhops in all ages ſince the Conqueſt have ſharply perſecuted all that threw off Popery, where Kings have not curbed the violence of them.</hi> An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of that nature as ſtrong for Epiſcopacy as could have been produced, if we conſider what good thoſe men would have done in the Church, had they lived under the Reformation, by reflexion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, who having been before his Converſion a grievous Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, became after it a zealous Promoter of the Goſpel.

               </gap> confeſſed that the <hi>confuſions that have enſued upon that Epiſcopall rigour</hi> have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the objects thereof, (but to the great ſcandall of themſelves and the Goſpel) guilty of Rebellion againſt Kings, a thing often practiced, but never profeſſed by any but the Diſciples of <hi>Junius Brutus.</hi> And of this ſpirit were the <hi>furious Zealots</hi> in the time of <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> mentioned in the Epiſtle, which they pretend to have been <hi>fomented and not moderated, but countenanced by that pious King:</hi> who was ſo far from it, that he not onely cauſed one book of Common-Prayer to be compoſed and enjoyned inſtead of the ſeverall formes <hi>ſecundum uſum Sarum,</hi> &amp;c. in practice before, whence men took occaſion to uſe what formes they pleaſed; but alſo prohibited by Proclamation all preaching
<pb facs="tcp:168956:4"/>
whatſoever, till he and his Parliament had taken order for the ſettlement of Religion; and ſetting of bounds to all, but eſpecially to the Anabaptiſtical Spirits, out of which Divine Circle they were not to paſs in their praedications. And what I have ſpoken in defence of former Popiſh Biſhops, the ſame may be ſaid of thoſe in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. Laſtly, it's pretended that the <hi>noble King</hi> James <hi>was perſwaded by the Biſhops, by whom he was continually plyed, to leave the Liturgy unreformed, to compell all to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the ſame, and to enforce the obſervation of Canons that were illegall: whereby ſome were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, others under Canonical admonition, the next door to deprivation;</hi> and all this clean contrary to that influence which the <hi>Conference at Hampton-Court</hi> would have had upon him. But whoſoever looks upon the Proclamation prefixed to the Book of Common Prayer, ſhall finde it <hi>de facto</hi> to be nothing ſo: and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſiders the deep Learning and profound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Renowned Prince, will never believe it to be ſo; He being able to cope with any Prince or Prelate in the world in matters of that nature. And here one thing is not to be omitted before I put a period to my obſervations upon the Epiſtle; That they alleadge <hi>the Liturgy to have remained uureformed in greateſt part, or moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall points; notwithſtanding much complained of, in the Conference at Hampton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Court.</hi> Whence I obſerve that ſomethings, even at their owne inſtance, were added or amended in the Liturgy, and with thoſe additions or emendations was it warranted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of King <hi>JAMES.</hi> If ſo, why do they, of all men, except againſt it, as a thing not eſtabliſhed by LAW? I intend not to contend with the punctilles
<pb facs="tcp:168956:5"/>
of LAW; wherein the more a man flutters, the worſe he may be entangled: Onely thus much I ſay, that Conſcience will not abſolve any man who hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the obſervation of the ſame, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in Queſtion, ſo long as they are either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or adiaphora, which we are in our enſuing work to defend.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning this; the main thing inſiſted upon, is the Articles, with the Kings Declaration prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to them: wherein it is commanded not to affix any other ſenſe to the Articles beſides the literal; &amp; <hi>this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>tyes us up from all liberty of interpreting any Article,</hi> whereof they give us ſeveral inſtances, and that all this was done <hi>by the procurement of the then Biſhops.</hi> But ſurely if this be any matter of Record, the K. had ſome body elſe to pen it: and if it be reaſonable, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops need not be aſhamed of being the Authors of it. But ſo reaſonable it is, that there's nothing in it that may enforce thoſe conſequences that they would infer upon it: inaſmuch as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing of no other ſenſe beſides the literall, does not, I hope, take away the liberty of explaining the Articles, or ſhewing what is, and what is not their literall ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The next exception is at the Homilies wherein <hi>it is falſely ſaid,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that plurality of Wives was permitted to the Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they every one hoped and begged that Chriſt might come of</hi>

Whereunto I anſwer, that plurality of Wives began before that prophecy, that Chriſt ſhould come of the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> and therefore before this time all did not know ſo much; nor could every man fiſh ſo much afterwards out of ſo myſterious a prophecy.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Whereunto I anſwer, that the ſame Exception may lye againſt the confeſſions of any Reformed Church; but theſe that are, ſuffice to ſhew their Harmony with thoſe of other Churches: and what is wanting in the Articles, is made out in the reſt of the Catechiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereunto may be added their exception of</hi> not enumerating the Books of the New Teſtament, <hi>as</hi> well as thoſe of the old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Canonicall books of the Old Teſtament are enumerated to diſtinguiſh them from the Apocryphal: but in the N. T.

how the reſt of the holy Scripture (beſides the Pſalter) is appointed to be read; <hi>which begins thus:</hi> The Old Testament is appointed for the firſt Leſſon at Morning and Evening prayer, and ſhall be read through every year once, except certain Books and Chapters, which be leaſt edifying, and might be ſpared, and therefore are left unread.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. EXception is, that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> is called <hi>Prieſt.</hi> I anſwer, That the word <hi>Prieſt</hi> is the beſt and propereſt word that can be uſed even in the ſenſe of the Authors of this Exception themſelves, in as much as it is nothing elſe but an abbreviation of the French word <hi>Preſtre,</hi> which is <hi>Presbyter:</hi> in all words that are French and that end in <hi>E</hi> feminine, as <hi>Preſtre</hi> does, the Engliſh cannot pronounce the <hi>E</hi> feminine but by a kinde of ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling of it; which in time degenerateth into an <hi>E quieſcent,</hi> which at laſt gives occaſion to the leaving of it quite out of the Orthography of the word as unneceſſary. As in <hi>Alarme, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Catechiſme, &amp; Preſtre</hi> (with a number of other words) which are now written <hi>Alarm, Baptiſm, Catechiſm, Preſt;</hi> and to lengthen the word to the French manner of pronunciation, the letter <hi>I</hi> is put in, as a <hi>Metheg,</hi> to bridle the over-haſty prolation of the ſame. And as for the word, <hi>Miniſter,</hi> it is taken either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, &amp; ſo it comprehends the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> themſelves: (for they and we are all Miniſters of the Goſpel:) or elſe ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the thing here intended) and ſo 'tis <hi>Diaconus,</hi> a <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and contradiſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> So that upon the whole, the Authors would have us ſay <hi>Deacon</hi> inſtead of <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Now as for the Scotiſh Liturgy; if it hath hit upon a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known name then Prieſt is, we do well to retein this which is better known.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2. Except. is a meer miſtake: For the Rubrick prefixed to the Epiſtles and Goſpels runs thus.</hi> The Collects, Epiſtles &amp; Goſpels, to be uſed at the celebration of the Lords Supper and holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion throughout the year. <hi>Whence they falſely infer, that they were</hi> never intended to be read but when there is the celebration of the Lords Supper: <hi>Whereas the Rubrick at the end of the Communion ſayes, that</hi> when there is no Communion ſhall be ſaid all that is appointed at the Communion untill the end of the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, concluding with the prayer for the whole eſtate of Chriſts Church militant here on earth, with ſome other Collect: <hi>But that the Communion is not celebrated throughout the whole yeare, is occaſioned for want of a competent number of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</hi>

                        <hi>3. Exception is, That the Rubrick before the generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at the Communion runs thus:</hi> Then ſhall this general Confeſſion be made in the name of all thoſe that are to receive the holy Communion either by one of them, or elſe by one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. What is this, <hi>ſay they,</hi> but to admit a private perſon to aſsiſt and bear a ſhare in the adminiſtring of the Lords Supper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>17.</hi> Article of Religion?</p>
                     <p>I anſw. That the <hi>confeſsion</hi> to be made <hi>by one of them, or by one of the Miniſters,</hi> preſuppoſeth the Prieſts ſpeaking firſt: the which confeſſion made by one of them, is as much as if it were made by the Clerk who does not alwayes communicate, and conſequently in that caſe is to abſent himſelf. Or were it made without the Prieſts leading them; yet it concludes not a liberty to Lay-men to adminiſter the Sacrament; in as much as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and to conſecrate are two diſtinct things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4th.

As if every one of the ſeven were the ſame with the firſt, and what was done the firſt day were done every day following.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer; That the <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe dayes is the <hi>Originall,</hi> the reſt are all <hi>Copies</hi> thereof: the Feaſt continuing, the reſt are the ſame in Eccleſiaſticall account, though the firſt be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5th. Exception is, That every</hi> Pariſhioner ſhall communicate three times in a year, of which Eaſter ſhall be one: <hi>yet</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is required every Aſſembly day to invite them to come to the Lords Table: <hi>Therefore ſay they, the foreſaid</hi> Rubrick ſeems to diſpenſe with Gods invitation: How rightly, <hi>ſay they,</hi> let all ſober men conſider.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer; That whether that be a Diſpenſation with Gods invitation, let all ſober men judge too? and of theſe three, <hi>Eaſter</hi> is to be one; becauſe, though every Lords day be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in memory of our Lords Reſurrection; yet <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, (according to the judgement of the Church,) comes neareſt the day of his Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But 6ly. where it is added in that Rubrick.</hi> He ſhall receive the Sacraments and other Rites, &amp;c. This, <hi>ſay they,</hi> is no other
<pb facs="tcp:168956:9"/>
but non-ſenſe or worſe: for what other Sacraments are then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? or what other Rites?</p>
                     <p>I anſw. 1. That by Sacraments are underſtood the two ſignes <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which being <hi>partes integrales ſimilares,</hi> receive the denomination of the whole: as every part of water is water, becauſe 'tis a ſimilar part. So that were there nothing more then this piece of Phyloſophy in it; it were not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted non-ſenſe: But there's Divinity too, to make it good. For firſt, you muſt grant the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and the holy Communion to be in ſubſtance the ſame: but now, ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>The bread that we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt? The cup of bleſsing that we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> Wherein you ſee that both the integrall parts of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion receive the denomination of the whole.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For other Rites, the party to communicate may need and deſire abſolution in caſe of ſcandalous and Conſcience-waſting ſins. He may receive confirmation, in caſe he hath never received that, or the Communion before: And are not theſe rites? or can theſe be done without rites?</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <hi>7. Exception is this:</hi> The laſt Rubrick before the Catechiſme in order to Confirmation concludeth thus: It is certain that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized have all things neceſſary to ſalvation, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved. Is this a truth, <hi>ſay they?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it is a great truth, inaſmuch as no other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is required on our parts; and the promiſe of God makes it ſure on his part: wherefore, if they caſt not themſelves into doubtings, charity binds us not to doubt of their ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <hi>8. Exception is; That</hi> the Rubrick after Matrimony ſays that the new married perſons the ſame day of their Marriage, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communion; and yet no man is bound to receive it above three times a year.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why may not this day be one? 2. They are not ordinarily to receive above three times a year, but in this extraordinary caſe they are: and many do deſire to do it; but there is not alwayes a ſufficient number to communicate; a thing required by the Rubrick.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <hi>9. Exception is, That in</hi> the laſt Rubrick for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168956:10"/>
of the ſicke in the time of Plague or any other contagious diſeaſe, when none of the Pariſh can be gotten to communicate with the ſicke for fear of infection, the Miniſter may onely communicate with him.

                        <hi>THe firſt Exception is; That the firſt words of it are theſe:</hi> At what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent, &amp;c. This, in the Rubrick before it, is called a ſentence of Scripture: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>ſay they,</hi> 'tis not onely no ſentence of Scripture, but it is alſo diſſonant from another <hi>[To day if ye will hear his voice, &amp;c.] and beſides</hi> it implies that a man may repent when he will.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer; That 'tis a ſentence of Scripture rendred according to the ſenſe of the place: for the [If] is indefinitely taken, it is not if to day onely, or if to morrow onely; if at this time only, or if at that timeonely: but if at all, if at any time: that is to ſay, at what time ſoever. God often in mercy calls us to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168956:10"/>
if at any time, at what time ſoever we anſwer his call, he will receive us graciouſly: yet this does not argue that it is in our power to repent when we will, after our refuſall of Gods ſeverall gracious invitations. But this is not all; for after our regeneration and firſt converſion unto God, we fall into ſin, we go aſtray, and that every day, yea ſeven times a day, which makes vs every day confeſſe and pray to God to forgive us our treſpaſſes according as we are taught by our Saviour. And therefore the <hi>[If]</hi> ſignifies not onely <hi>At what</hi> particular <hi>time ſoever;</hi> but as often as a ſinner ſhall repent, &amp;c. ſo often will God forgive. Now nothing that hath been ſaid is diſſonant to that place [To day if ye will hear his voice, &amp;c.] For though it be the ſureſt way to hear Gods voice <hi>to day,</hi> that is at preſent, leſt any ſhould be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin: Yet God was grieved forty years with his people in the wilderneſſe, before he ſware in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> That by that Act of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> is intended the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> only, as I humbly conceive: If, as I have heard Lawyers ſay, preambles to Acts are the beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Acts themſelves: For the preamble to that Act wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth the abuſes of the Authority given to the high Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by that Act of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to be the grouud of the Act it ſelfe of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.
