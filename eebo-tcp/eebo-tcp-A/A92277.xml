            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly offered, why the Sale of the LANDS, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STATES, belonging to the late Biſhop of DURHAM, ſhould not be confirmed.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y long uſage and courſe of time, the Tenants of thoſe Lands and their Anceſtors, have enjoyed the ſame in Nature of a Cuſtomary Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Tenant-Right. Afterwards by taking Leaſes, never exceeding three yeers Fine, doing Border-ſervice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When a Tenants Leaſe did expire, it was uſual for the ſaid Tenant to ſell his Intereſt in the Premiſes for ſeven yeers purchaſe and ſomtimes more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Parliament in the yeer 1647. did paſs an Ordinance for the ſale of Biſhops Lands, they did provide in the ſaid Ordinance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all matter of Right, both in Law and Equity, ſhould be ſaved to the ſaid Tenants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the ſaid Ordinance ſhould be ſent to the reſpective Sheriffs in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be publiſhed in every Market-Town, whereby all ſuch Perſons who claimed any Right in thoſe Eſtates, might have the knowledge, to put in their Claims to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors. But the Sheriff of that County, never had the Ordinance ſent unto him, or if he had, yet was the ſame never publiſhed in any of the Market-Towns in that County, whereby the Tenants might have timely and due notice to make out their Reſpective Claims before the Surveyors.</p>
            <p>Whereupon not any one Tenant that held by Leaſe of the ſaid Biſhop and did uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally renue their Leaſes, as aforeſaid, did make known to the Surveyors their Uſual and Equitable Right.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Ordinance was the firſt Ordinance for ſale, that ever came forth in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the ſaid Tenants living eleven ſcore miles off <hi>London,</hi> were kept the more in ignorance, by reaſon they never had any Member of Parliament to ſerve for them, as all the reſt of the Counties in <hi>England</hi> had, to give them notice what they had to do to preſerve their Rights.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this concerns the being and ſubſiſtance of many hundred Families, who with their Anceſtors for many hundreds of yeers enjoyed their Reſpective Eſtates, never paying to the Biſhops above 50 <hi>s. per. An.</hi> Rent for the beſt Farm.</p>
            <p>All whoſe Eſtates are now purchaſed by five, or ſix Perſons at moſt, ſome of whom, have turned the Tenants out of Doors, their Wives and Children going a Begging, without regard to their Ancient and Equitable Right: and others kept in Priſon after poſſeſſion of their Farms were obtained by the Purchaſors.</p>
