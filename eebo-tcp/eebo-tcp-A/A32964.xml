         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to my imployment (Renowned Champions) I found
waves more Tempestuous a great deal on the <hi>English</hi>
Shore than I left in the <hi>Britannick</hi> Ocean. By and by, when
I had pressed farther into <hi>England,</hi> I saw nothing more
common than unaccustomed Tortures, nothing more certain
than unexpected Dangers: I recollected my self as well
as I could, mindful of the Justice of my cause, and not
forgetful of the times; and lest I should by chance be
taken up before I was heard, I reduced the intentions of
my mind into writing; I thought fit to declare to the World
what I came for, what I zealously endeavour'd for, what
kind of War I wag'd, and against whom I Proclaimed it;
I had the Original Copy with me, which I was resolv'd
should be taken with me if I was taken: I intrusted a
friend with a Copy of it, who, contrary to my knowledge,
communicated it to a great many more; my Adversaries
Rudely seized the Book as soon as it was Published,
passing their most malicious Censures upon it: That one
man should Challenge them all in matters of Religion,
although I should not stand alone in the Field in case I
<pb facs="tcp:48239:3"/>
was ingaged for the Publick Faith. <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Charke</hi>
answered my Challenges, and what then? disingenously
all; for they made no material answer, but one which
will never be approved of: We embrace your Proposals,
the Queen Espouses them, make your application to her.
In the interim they cry our your Society, your Seditions,
your Arrogance, a Traytor, without doubt a Traytor. O
Ridiculous! Why do Wise Men thus lose their labour
and credit? But of these two, one for his fancies sake
made Incursions into my Book, the last did more malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
weigh the whole cause: The Book was published
lately, being very plain, treating of our Society, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
we sustained, and of the Province we now undertake;
what remains therefore (since our Adversaries prepare
Torments for me and not the Schools) but to prove the
matter of Fact to you which Created so much Confidence
in me, as to demonstratively show the sources of things.
I would also exhort you, whom it concerns above all men,
to take that care which Christ, the Church, your Country
and Salvation requires of you; had I trusted in my Parts,
Learning, Subtilty, Reading, Memory, and Challeng'd
such a croud of Adversaries, I had been Vain and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
but I never regarded my self nor them, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the cause, I deem'd my self sufficient to uncloud the
Sun at Noon Day; therefore pardon those heats of Zeal,
which the honour of Christ, my King, and the invincible
Truth have occasioned. Ye know <hi>M. Tullius,</hi> when
<hi>Roscius</hi> did promise him a Victory, in case he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="tcp:48239:3"/>
by dint of Argument, that Seven Hundred Miles could
not be run in two days, did not only not fear the force
and efficacy of <hi>Hortensius</hi> his Arguments, but even of
those that were his betters, the <hi>Philippi,</hi> the <hi>Cottae,
Antonii,</hi> and <hi>Crassi,</hi> who gain'd to themselves great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in Rhetorick. Indeed there is some Truth so Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent,
that no Sophistry in words, nor Jugling
in things can Eclipse: Moreover, that is more manifest
which we undertake, than that supposition of <hi>Roscius,</hi>
for if I can prove that there is a Heaven, that there are
Saints, that there is one true Faith, that there is a
Christ, the Victory is mine. May I not be then Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
here? They may Martyr me, but they can never
Baffle me, for I insist on those Doctrines which the Spirit
hath Taught, which is never deceived nor overthrown. I
beseech you that you would use the means whereby you
might obtain Salvation, as for the rest I am not at all in
suspence, but that I shall receive from those I Petition it
of; if they will apply themselves to study, call upon
Christ and be diligent, they will certainly find out the
Truth, to the Confusion of its Adversaries: in the mean
while it behoves us, who are so firmly grounded, to take
the Field with a magnanimous Courage. I draw the
Curtain here, because the rest which I have to say is
Dedicated to you.</p>

            <p>ALthough there are Innumerable Arguments,<note place="margin">First Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Holy Scripture.</note> to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
our Adversaries Diffidence in their Cause, yet
not any one so Material as their Violation of the Divine
Majesty of the Holy Bible, which is the Authority I
draw my Sword for, against Those, who after they have
contemned the Votes and Suffrages of all other Witnesses, yet
are reduced to that Non-plus, that they cannot subsist, unless
they seize on SCRIPTURE, and deprive Her of her
Stings. Indeed they do by their Actions insinuate unto the
World, as though they were driven into very dangerous
Streights, and were resolv'd in this so imminent danger of
Shipwrack,<note place="margin">Aug. b. 28. against Faust. and de c. 2. uti. cre. cap. 3. Mat. 1. Act. 1.</note> to make their most Audacious Efforts for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
and their last. What induced the <hi>Manichees</hi> to reject
the Gospel of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles?</hi>
Distrust in their Cause. For at these Volumes they were
Thunder-struck, who denied Christ Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
and who feigned that the Spirit descended from Heaven upon
Christians; when their <hi>Paracletus,</hi> a Diabolical <hi>Persian,</hi> started up.
Why did the <hi>Ebionites</hi> divorce the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul?</hi>

in their Cause: for these retaining their pristin Grandeur,
their Ancient, though Polite Imbellishments were antiquated;
which they, forsooth, had newly reformed. What Instigated
<hi>Luther,</hi> that cursed Apostate, to Censure the Epistle of
St. <hi>James</hi> as Contentious, bigg with Pride and Arrogance
insipid, empty, and unworthy of an Apostolical Spirit
Distrust in his Cause: For with this Particle of Scripture the
Fiend was Wounded and Stabbed to the Heart, when he took
up the Gauntlet for Justification by Faith only. What made
<hi>Luther</hi>'s Hell-hounds strike out of the Authentick Canon <hi>Tobias,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48239:5"/>
Ecclesiasticus, Maccabees,</hi> and many others, with the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust?
Distrust in their Cause. For with these Oracles they
were most Eloquently reprimanded as often as they disputed of
Guardian Angels, of the Liberty of free will, of the Faithful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this Life, and the Intercession of the Saints. But is it so?
Is there so great Infidelity, so great Confidence? when the
Foot-steps of Antiquity and Authority are imprinted in the
Church, Councils, Popes, Fathers, Martyrs, Empires, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Laws. Universities, Histories; by Scripture, they are
resolved to put an end to Controversies, and lmbowel its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body their only Buoy to Posterity, exenterating its most
goodly and specious parts. For the seven Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(to connive at small things) were spew'd out by the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
and the Epistle of St. <hi>James,</hi> and five others by the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi>

               </note> about which there
was one while a Controversie. To these our Modern <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
add the Book of <hi>Hester,</hi> and in a manner, the Three
Chapters of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> their contemporaries,
long since Hiss'd out and derided. How modestly did
St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who concluding his Holy Catalogue, did not lay
down the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet for a Rule as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, nor a
private Spirit, as the Sectaries did, but, that Spirit which Christ
infused into his Church, which Church indeed is the Trustee
of this Legacy; not the Testatrix as some Hereticks do object:
This Trust the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> embraced, and was challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by more Ancient Councils. The same St. <hi>Augustine</hi> could not
draw into the Scheme of his knowledge why the Book of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which is now, and was then in force as Authentick and
Canonical, both by the Suffrages of the Church, Succession
of Ages, by the Testimony of the Ancients, and Inspirations
of the Faithful, should be struck out of the Canon with a Rash
and Unadvised Censure. What would he say now, if he should
have survived so many <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Artificers of
the Bible, who with their Polite and Elegant File have extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the Old and New Testament; neither have they excluded
the Book of Wisdom only, but many others out of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Predicament. That whatsoever came not from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48239:5"/>
that by a Phrensical Decree was spew'd out as Monstrous
and Abortive. To this so Dire and Unconsecrated a Sanctuary,
who have recourse to, they indeed, although they are extolled
in the mouths of their Scullions, do make Sale of their Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Declaim against Catholicks in their Sermons, prepare Axes,
Racks, Tormentilio's, and Crosses, yet they have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
abject, disgrac'd, vanquish'd, and defeated; forasmuch
as having passed their Sentences as Authoriz'd Judges, they
obliterate Scripture it self, if any part agrees not with their
Stomach; who is there even ordinarily Learned would fear such
Rabbet-like Enemies? Which Enemies, when they are besieg'd
by a Ring of such Learned men as we are, will run to their
old wiles, as it were to Familiar Devils, and should not be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with Victorious Hummings, but Disgraceful Hissings.
I ask of them, for instance, By what Right they Maim and
Rend the Body of the Bible? They answer, They do not cut
out the true Scriptures, but cull out the Supposititious. Who
is their Judge? The Holy Spirit. For this answer is prescribed
by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he might escape the Sentence of the Church,
by which Spirits are tryed: Why therefore do you torment one
another, when all glory in the same Spirit? The Spirit of
the <hi>Calvinists</hi> receive Six Epistles, which do not please the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> yet both trusted in the Holy Spirit. The
<hi>Anabaptists</hi> term the History of <hi>Job</hi> a Fable,<note place="margin">Hist. Sen. <hi>l.</hi> 7.</note> interwoven with
Comical and Tragical Laws: How do they know? The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

Mystical Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which the Catholicks admire as the
Paradice of the Soul, as the hidden Manna, as Rich delights in
Christ, no more than a Song on his Mistriss, a Love-colloquie,
with the Ladies of the Court. Whence did he draw it? From
the Spirit. In the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> where every point
doth express something Magnificent and Lofty,<note place="margin">Ep. to <hi>Paul</hi> Pref. on the <hi>Apo.</hi>
               </note> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi>
says; yet <hi>Luther, Brentius,</hi> and <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> curious Criticks,
desire it should be Authoriz'd: Who would they ask? The
Spirit. <hi>Luther,</hi> with a Preposterous Zeal, places the Four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
by themselves, and preferring them before the Three Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth moreover Decree that the Gospel of St.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48239:6"/>
               <hi>John</hi> should be denominated True and Singular;<note place="margin">Pref. on the New Test.</note> and good Reason
for it, because in it he made the Apostles partakers of his Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
who teach'd him so to do? the Spirit. But yet that Frier did
not scruple to touch the Gospel of S. <hi>Luke</hi> with a petulant stile;
because the good Works of Vertue are too often commended in
it. Who told him so? The Spirit. <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> dared to Traduce
that Mystical Expression out of the Twenty Second Chapter of
St. <hi>Luke: This is the Cup,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 22. cap.</note> 
               <hi>the New Testament in my Blood, which
(Cup) shall be poured out for you,</hi> as Corrupted and Depraved,
because these Sentences admit of no other Exposition than of the
Wine of the Cup, being chang'd into the real Blood of Christ:
who told him so? the Spirit. Lastly, when every one intrusts
all things to his Spirit, they do asperse the Holy Spirit with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Blasphemy; whoever doth these things, do not they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
themselves? are they not easily Confuted? are they not
bridled and restrained without difficulty by a Consistory of such
Learned Men as you are, O! ye <hi>Academians?</hi> May I fear to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with those who have not only with the most Treacherous
Infidelity laid hands on Humane Writings, but Divine? I pass
by those things which they have misconstrued, although I can
accuse them of things inexcusable. I submit that to my Friend
<hi>Gregory Martin,</hi> who is Skilful of Languages, who will perform
it more Learnedly and Accurately than I; and to others (who
as I am inform'd) have it on the Anvil: I Prosecute Crimes
more heinous and of a worse nature: I have found out Learned
Banterers, who with rash Incursions have Invaded Gods Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and in many places have inveighed against it as Corrupt,
Imperfect, False and Surreptitious: Some parts they have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
some they have Carped at, and some they have Rooted
out quite: Hence all the Turrets which they were Fortified
with were chang'd into <hi>Lutheran</hi> Spirits, as it were into Castles
of Phantasms, that they should not be Gravell'd when they
should Quote the Scriptures, infested with their Errours, which
indeed they can no more clear themselves of, than Sup the
Sparks, or Eat the Stones.</p>
            <p>For this Cause my first Reason was Vehement and Just, that
when it had delineated our Adversaries party, despersed and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48239:6"/>

            <p>ANother thing which hath inflamed me to a Combat,<note place="margin">The Sense of Holy Scripture.</note> and
to bring such Ammunition, Musquets, and Blunderbusses
with me, is our Adversaries policy (big with Fraud, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
of Prudence) in explaining the Scriptures; presently ye
will touch at this (ye Philosophers) and therefore I sought out
you for my Auditors. We ask of our Adversaries, for instance,
who they follow? what new Sect they entered into, that they
exclude Christ out of the Mystical Supper? If they Quote the
Gospel, we appeal to it; the words with us are, <hi>This is my Body,
this is my Blood,</hi> which expression seem'd so prevalent with
<hi>Luther,</hi> that he desired to be a <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> because in that point
he could be prejudicial to the Pope, yet being taken and bound,
in the conclusion did yield, and acknowledged Christ to be really
present in the Holy Sacrament, not less against his will, than
the Devils heretofore being overcome with Miracles, called upon
the Name of God. Let it be so, we treated of the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Controversie now is on the Sense of Scripture; we will
search out this from the following words, <hi>My Body which is given
for you, my Blood which shall be shed for you,</hi> as yet <hi>Calvin</hi>'s side is
the hardest, ours is easie and plain; what would ye have more?
Search the Scriptures; ye say well, the Scriptures agree; St.
<hi>Paul</hi> is for us: The Words, Clauses and whole Connexion do
reverently repeat the Bread and Wine, a singular Miracle, Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Food, Flesh, Body and Blood. There is nothing enigmatical,
nothing overclouded with obscurity of words, yet our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
persist, neither do they make an end of Bantering; what
do we do? Antiquity may be heard I think, and Antiquity of
time may bring forth that which we cannot see betwixt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48239:7"/>
other, they do not bring it, they say they are betrayed, they
call the Scripture pure, they are averse to mens Comments on it
as treacherous and disingenious; we urge the Word of God,
they obscure it; we call Saints to witness, as Interpreters, they
withstand them; in fine, so they order it, that unless you will
side with the guilty, you must not give your judgment at all;
and so they behave themselves in every Controversie they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
of infused Grace, of inherent Justice, of the visibility
of the Church, of necessity of Baptism, of the Sacraments and
Sacrifice of the Mass, of the merits of the Just, of Hope and
Fear, of the disparity of Sins according to their aggravations,
of the Authority of <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Keys, of Prayers, of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Mysteries, and so of other things: And we Catholicks have
cited a great many weighty Texts of Scripture, and discussed
them in Books, Colloquies, Churches, they have eluded them;
we have hinted on the Commentaries of Greek and Latin Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they have winked at them; what then? Dr. <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
or certainly <hi>Phillippus,</hi> or to be sure <hi>Zuinglius</hi> hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

flourished in Ages before? Yes. Let us then survey Nations,
Countrys and Times, in our mind.—To what? To the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Faithful, of whom their Names are not
known, but 'tis evident there are a great many; how is it
evident? by God. Who promulgated it? We who are divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>A Weighty Query there was in the Infancy of the Church
concerning Lawful Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Councils.</note> which has distracted the
minds of a great many, which now by the Congregated

Fathers, the Sheep their Pastors, commanding them in these

Councils which were of so great Authority, that before a
Thousand years a singular Honour was paid to them as to the
Scriptures, were followed for the rooting out of Heresie, which
in divers places sprung up in those ages. I will not wander any
farther, for even at home, the same Councils have their respect

when occasion serves, I will prove it. Being fortified therefore
with the strong and exquisite safeguard of Councils, why should
not I enter the Field, when I see where my adversary will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode

that cannot be wrested, and axiomes that cannot

full Council rightly and duely Summoned, abrogates any thing
of weight or moment, seems to me to be a man of no Conduct
no Wit, and not only unskilful in Divinity but Policy: If ever the
Spirit of God illuminated the Church, that was the time of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Deity, when the Religion, Maturity, Knowledge,
Wisdom and Dignity, of all the Churches in the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred
in that City: and all means used, both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
to search out the truth, when they might implore the
Spirit to Establish it wholesomely and prudently. But now

man perfidious and turbulent, recalled from banishment, which
<hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperour published an Edict for, when he was
condemned to dye, but the Articles being violated he lost all
hopes of his pardon: Head-long Malice deceived <hi>Huss,</hi> for
being commanded when he had dispersed his Tragedy in

My time will fail me if I should number the Epistles, Sermons,

when they apply'd themselves to write either the Chronology,
or History of the Church, unless they could collect the actions
of us, or our Enemies, let slip five hundred years without one
Argument. With these revolve the peculiar Historians of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

nicely and censoriously; these having got what they aim'd at,
endeavour'd by all means to improve it, and who are not silent

any thing in Religion chang'd or degenerated from its first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
there would certainly some one of them Commemorate
it: But no one at all either of a good or bad genius towards
us hath discover'd the thing, or so much as signify'd it. For
instance, our Adversaries grant, (neither can they do otherwise)
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was sometime Holy, Catholick and
Apostolick; moreover it deserv'd this Encomium from St. <hi>Paul,
Your Faith is Preached in the whole World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. v. 8. Rom. 1. v. 9. Ro. 15. v. 29 Rom. 16. v. 19. Act. 28. 1 Pet. 5. v. 13. Hieron. in ca. scrip. Eccl. &amp; Papias apud Ens. 2. hist. 15. Phil. 4 v. 3. Ire. lib. 3. ca. 3.</note>

in the abundance of the blessing of Christ; they salute you all of the

'twas then when <hi>Paul</hi> had the liberty of the Prison and did sow
the Gospel, Then when <hi>Peter</hi> did govern the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi>
Then when <hi>Clemens,</hi> very commendable in the sight of the
Apostle, did fill the Chair, Then when the profane <hi>Caesars,
Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Antonine,</hi> did torment the Popes of
<hi>Rome;</hi> then also, as <hi>Calvin</hi> witnesseth, when <hi>Damasus, Syricius,
Anastasius, Innocentius,</hi> did fill the Apostolick Chair, for in this
Age they grant none but <hi>Rome</hi> hath deviated from the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Doctrine. When therefore <hi>Rome</hi> had corrupted its Faith
so earnestly celebrated, when it ceas'd to be what it was before.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48239:13"/>
At what time, under what Pope, after what manner, by what
force, with what encrease did another Religion invade the City
and the World? What Votes, what Ryots, what Lamentations
did it beget? All the rest of the World were asleep while <hi>Rome,
Rome,</hi> I say, had new Sacraments, a new Sacrifice, and a new
Model of Religion on the Anvil. Is there no Historian either
Latin or Greek, far nor near, would lay this unto his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries?
Therefore this certainly is evident; if we do believe
any thing, much History and various, the Messenger of Truth,
the life of memory would fluently speak and repeat it, those
things which they do obtrude, no Modern relation can
authorize in the Church: The Historians are for me,

than the Souls of the Damned unless that they were restored by
him. For even as corporal Death profits nothing, so the Soul
also ought to struggle with everlasting death, and after this manner
weigh our wickedness and punishment, and lest any one should

by chance think that this crept into <hi>Calvin</hi> through neligence,
the same <hi>Calvin</hi> calls all them, if any of them revolv'd that
Doctrine of Comfort, damn'd Knaves. O the times you have
nourish'd this Monster; that delicate and Royal Blood which
Sprung out of the torn, and cleft Body of the Lamb, every drop
of whose Blood, by means of the Dignity of the Host, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
a 1000 Worlds, profited nothing to manking unless the
Mediator of God and Man, Christ Jesus had made also the
second Death, the Death of the Soul, the Death of Grace; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of Sin alone: Execrable Blasphemy. <hi>Bucer</hi> will seem modest
in respect of this madness, altho he is impudent, who accounts,
the Grave Hell in a symbol, by a vain preposterous repetition,
and Tautology rather: The <hi>English Calvinists</hi> have recourse to
<hi>Calvin</hi> their Idol, part to <hi>Bucer</hi> their great master, part also have
murmured against this article lest it should cause any more
trouble, since that 'twas exempted from the Symbol with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
noise, that also was attempted in a Conventicle at <hi>London.</hi>
I remember <hi>Rich. Cheney</hi> who was there, told me so, a very
Old Man, who had been injuriously Fin'd by the Plunderers
abroad, and could not enter into his Fathers House. So far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ, what concerning Man? The Image of God
was quite raz'd out in man, no spark of good was quick in
him, his whole nature as to all the parts of his Soul was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
rever'd, that truly he was not at all Holy, there is nothing
else within him but coruption and contagion: To what purpose are
are these things? That they who got Glory by Faith only, wallow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
in the Dunghil of their filthiness may accuse nature, despair of
virtue, and disburthen Precepts. Hither <hi>Illyricus</hi> the chief of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgenses,</hi>
added his direful opinion of Original Sin, which he
would have to be the inward substances of the Soul, for those since
<hi>Adams</hi> Fall the Devil procreates and makes like himself. This also
is trivial, in this case all sins are alike, so (lest the <hi>Stoicks</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive)
they are weighed by God the Judge, altho God that just Judge
should add a heap to our Burthen rather than an easement, and
should heap up that which is not in the thing, when he is just:
The Cook who killed a Dunghil Cock when there was no need
of him, did no less offend against God, the righteous Judge,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48239:15"/>
than that Assassinator, who <hi>Beza</hi> like, being disguis'd in Drink,
killed the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> a Prince of great worth, with
his Hand Gun, than which Exploit the world never saw any
thing in our Age more Dolorous and Lamentable. But, perhaps
they which are in this state of Sin,<note place="margin">Degratia. Luth. in Resp. corta Louan. Bucer. in Joan. 1. Wald. in nat. Christi. Brent. ho. 12. in Joan Cent. li. 1. cap. 4.</note> being bad, do much Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize
of Divine Grace, which can heal and succour this Sin:
But Graces do assign those famous parts, which they report nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

but are placed without us in the favour of God alone, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

them, nor enrich them, but the old Sink, as yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and waxing rank, that it should not seem stinking and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
God winking at it they conceal. With this their
Sophism they are so delighted, that with them indeed Christ
cannot be said to be full of Grace and Truth, than that God the
Father hath favoured him in a wonderful manner.—What then

concerning future Perseverance, which whosoever wants makes
an unhappy Exit, although for a time he worships Justice
purely and piously? Yea truly, this is thy Faith, <hi>Calvin</hi> says
so, unless he firmly foretels thy Perseverance to thee, as thou
canst not be deceiv'd, thou wouldest be despis'd as empty
and faint. And again <hi>Luther.</hi> A Christian also says he,
cannot willingly lose Salvation unless he will not believe. I
hasten to the Sacraments, none, none, not two, not one,
O Christ, have they left, for their Bread is Poyson. Baptism,
although it be yet true, yet in their judgment 'tis nothing, 'tis
not the Water of Health, nor the Channel of Grace, it doth
not derive Christs Merits unto us, but it is only a signification
of Health; therefore they make no more of the Baptism of
Christ, according to the nature of the thing, than the ceremony
of <hi>John.</hi> If you have it, well, if you want it, no loss; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

any thing to the Sacrament of Baptism, say the <hi>Magdeburgici,</hi> we
grant that there is Faith in Infants by which they may be saved;
they understand some hidden impulsions of Faith; that they
live, and do not as yet understand, is hard: If this be so hard,
hearken to the Physick of <hi>Luther; It is better to omit it, since
that unless an Infant believes, he cannot be wash'd.</hi> These things,
they say; being doubtful in mind, they affirm any thing cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically:
Therefore <hi>Baltasar Pacimentanus</hi> the parter of strife,
intervenes; who being the Parent of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> could not
feign the motion of Faith in Infants, approv'd of <hi>Luthers</hi> cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and casting Paedo-baptism out of the Churches; he decreed
that no body should be wash'd in the Holy Font, unless ripe of
age. That which appertains to the rest of the Sacraments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the many-headed Beast may cast out horrid Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
yet because they are daily buzz'd in their Ears, I pass it by
here. The most Nocent fragments of the Lives and Manners
of Heriticks, which <hi>Luther</hi> has spew'd out in his writings, that
with one impure Gale of his Breath he would breath the Plague
into his Readers; hear patiently and blush, and pardon me
which recites them, if a Wife will not, or cannot let the Maid
come, for to have to do with a Wife, is as necessary as Meat,
Drink, Sleep. Matrimony is much more excellent than Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath disswaded Christians from it. But these

Will you have any more? What else? By how much the more

Witnesses are all the Coasts and Climates of the world, to
whom the Evangelical Trumpet hath Sounded since Christs
Birth. Are these small things to take away all pretence for
Idols, to imply a Kingdom of God on Earth? <hi>Luther</hi> Preaches
Christ;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> we Catholicks Preach Christ. Is Christ divided?
No: Either his Christ is false or ours. What then? I say,
he is their Christ who is an Enemy to <hi>Baal;</hi> ours, who by his
means banishes <hi>Jupiter, Mercury, Diana, Phaebus, Erebus,</hi> out
of the minds of men. My time fails me, I must presently draw
the Curtain, only take a view of some things near home: <hi>viz.</hi>
Of the <hi>Irish</hi> from St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> from <hi>Pelagius,</hi> the <hi>English</hi>
from St. <hi>Augustin, Roman</hi> Devota's, <hi>Roman</hi> Missioners, either
they embraced no Religion, or certainly ours, <hi>viz.</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
The thing is plain, I acquiesce.</p>
            <p>Witnesses are the Universities, witnesses are the Records,
witnesses the Inauguration of <hi>Caesars,</hi> and the Ceremonies
and Coronation of Kings: Witnesses are the Orders of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and Chivalry: Witnesses the Windows, Moneys and City
Gates: That no Religion but ours was ever establish'd from the
beginning. VVhich things revolving, and considering I had to
do with men in a desperate and damnable state, I was anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(I do not deny) and inflam'd to a Combat, in which unless
the Saints are driven from Heaven, and proud <hi>Lucifer</hi> recovers
his Empire, I shall never be overthrown. How much better is
<hi>Chark</hi> than I, who hath so bitterly rail'd at me? If I had rather
intrust this sinful Soul to the safe way, to the sure way, than
expose it to the Quick-sands and Rocks of <hi>Calvin.</hi>

            <head>The Conclusion.</head>
            <p>YE have of me now (most flourishing Academicks) the
context of my work, perform'd at leisure in my
Journey. I had a mind to clear my self of arrogance, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you of my confidence, and in the mean while, you being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
with me unto the Schools, to propose some wholsome
things to be chew'd upon. If you do think it just, if safe, if honest,
to account of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Canons of Scripture, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Spirit as the rule of the Church, instructer of Councils,
and Fathers, there is nothing I can hope for, you being Readers
and Hearers. But if you are those whom I have drawn in the
Scheme of my mind, Philosophers, lovers of Truth, Sincerity,
Modesty: Enemies of Rashness, Sophistry, and Babbling;
you will easily see the open day, who now see it Glimmering.
I speak boldy, because my love towards you, your danger, and the
weightiness of the Province requires it. The Devil knows that
if you will open your Eyes, you will behold the light of Truth.
For is it not an object of amazement, that <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Charke,</hi>
should be preferred before Christian Antiquity; but there are
some <hi>Lutheran</hi> Baits, by which he propagates his Kingdom, and
Inveigles many in your Sphear. What are they? Gold,
Glory, Delights, Pleasures: contemn them. For what else are
they than the Scum of the Earth, a Hoarse air, a Feast for the
Worms, Specious Dunghils? despise them. Christ is full, he
will feed us: He is King who will honour us: He is Rich,
who will endow us with all Felicity: Recommend your selves
to him in the Field, that with him ye truly Learned, and truly
Famous, may return Triumphant.</p>
