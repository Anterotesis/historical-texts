            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A great transporter of corne he hath béene from time to time: for which cause the people hate him in their hearts, and doe now and then openly cry out against him with such clamors, that he hath béene glad to stop their mouthes. The onely good that he doth, and indéede the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause for which the kingdome loues him, is that when hee leads men on in any hot péece of seruice, they get such stomacks by séeing how brauely he laies about him, that they neuer come off till they be satisfied, victory béeing as good to them as meate and drinke.</p>

In deare yeeres, when the Land had béene ready to sterue, hath he reléeued it, and turned dearth into plenty: his head is euer full of cares, not for himselfe so much as for the people, whom hee loues and tenders as déerely as if they were his kindred: yet stand they not so well affected to him, because he compelles them to take paines, when tis their naturall inclination (like Drones) to liue basely, and to féede vpon the bread that the sweat of other mens browes doe earne.

            <p>This mercilesse tyrant therefore <hi>(Pouerty)</hi> could not kindle such fires of vprores, and ciuill mischiefes, but that the flames (like burning beacons) armed her enemies with safetie, euen as they put them into feare.

Then, euen then, in the full sea of all these iollities, pompes, and whorish ceremonies, the onely bewitchers of mankinde, came sayling in, the newes of a suddaine insurrection, and an vnexpected inuasion, by that common, fatall, and barbarous spoiler of so many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, infamous amongst al nations by that beggerly name of <hi>Pouerty.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:5538:14"/>
But her councell being prouident, carefull, and iealous of their owne estates, wisely considering the dangers that a weake enemy (being desperate, and hauing little to loose) <note place="margin">Riches make men cowards,</note> may put the best fortefied kingdome to, &amp; the most valiant nation did in the end, with one consent fall on their knées, most humbly intreating thier Soueraigne Mistresse to giue ouer her reuellings, maskes, and other Court-pleasures for a time, and that aswell for the safety of her owne royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (to take héede of them: for many plots were now, and had oftentimes bin laid) as also for themselues, whose liues and liberties wholly depended on her, either to leuy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent forces, which should méete this beggerly Monarch in the field, and so vtterly to driue her out of the kingdome, or else to giue the rich men of her Empire leaue to make strict and seuere lawes to take away the liues of that wretched &amp; scattered people that follow <hi>Pouerty</hi> in these commotions, wheresoeuer or whensoeuer they take them medling in any of her wealthy dominions.</p>
            <p>These words brake forth with such lighning, that <hi>Money</hi> stampd for very anger, that so base an enemy should put her subiects into feare.

He neuer pared his nailes, and being often asked the reason why, he alwaies answered, that he saued them for his heire, for béeing cut off, after hée himselfe was dead, they might be put to sundry good thrifty purposes, as to make hornes (being thinly scraped) for a <hi>Scriueners</hi> lanthorne to write by a nights, or to nocke arrowes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hée kept not so much as a Barber, but shaued his owne head and beard himselfe, and when it came to wey a pound, hée sold it to a <hi>Frenchman</hi> to stuffe tennis balles. <hi>Money</hi> (his Soueraigne) cared not so much for him, as he did for her, she could make him do any vile office how base soeuer; but because he was <note place="margin">Couetous men are slaues to that which is a slaue to them.</note> saucy, and would often checke her for taking her pleasures, séeking to restraine her of her liberties, she hated him, and was neuer more merry then when one brought her newes once that <hi>Couetousnesse</hi> lay a dying.

               <p>The <hi>Inuader</hi> vnderstanding that the quarrell would be decided in a pitcht field, and that crackt crownes would be both giuen and taken on either side, grew exceeding ioyfull: and therefore calling for <hi>Sharker</hi> (one of her boldest &amp; witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Heralds) him she sent to <hi>Money,</hi> to know where the <hi>Rendeuous</hi> should be made for both armies to meete in, and what péece of ground should be best famous to posterities by their battaile. <hi>Money</hi> tooke aduice vpon this, most of her old beaten Captaines, laboured earnestly to haue it at <hi>Bagshot,</hi> but all the gallants cryed <hi>baw waw</hi> at him that named <hi>Bagshot,</hi> so that for a quarter of an hower, none could be heard to speake, there was such a <hi>Baw wawing.</hi> The Herald <hi>Sharker,</hi> in name of his Mistresse, who sent him, requested it might be at beggers bush. But euery sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier swore that was a lowzy place, and so for a day or two, it rested vncertaine and vndetermined.</p>
               <p>In which <hi>Interim,</hi> a murmuring went vp and downe that not onely <hi>Pouorty</hi> had maintained this terrible Siege <note place="margin">Famine and the plague come along with Pouerty to besiege the City.</note> against the City, but that <hi>Dearth</hi> also, <hi>Famine</hi> and the <hi>Plague,</hi> were lately ioyned with the same Army, besides many strange and incurable diseases were crept into the camp, that followed <hi>Money:</hi> for <hi>Ryot</hi> her minion, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most spent, and lay in a consumption. A hundred in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were drowned in one night in French bowles: fiue tunes as many more were tormented with a terrible gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about their consciences. All the Usurers in the Army had hung themselues in chaines, within lesse then three howers, and all the Brokers, being their Bastards, went crying vp and downe, <hi>The Diuell, the Diuell,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon because they should not disquiet the rest of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they were fetched away.

               <p>And as these stormes of misery fell vpon <hi>Money</hi> and her troopes, so was the army of <hi>Pouerty</hi> plagued as much, or more on the other side: nothing could be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Souldiers but cries, complaints, cursings, blasphemies, Oathes, and ten thousand other blacke and damned spirits, which euer hawnted them and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall herselfe. <hi>Want</hi> pinched them in the day, and wildnesse and rage kept them waking and raueing all the night. Their soules were desperate, their bodies consumed, they were weary of their liues, yet compelled to liue for furder miseries, and nothing did comfort them but a foolish hope they had to be reuenged vpon <hi>Money.</hi> So that so many plagues, so many diseases, so many troubles and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies following both the armies (by meanes of the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Siege) a perpetuall truce, league and confederacy was <note place="margin">A Truee.</note> confirmed by <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Pouerty,</hi> and the councellors on either part: that in euery Kingdome, euery Shire, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City, the one should haue as much to doe as the other: that <hi>Pouerties</hi> subiects should be euer in a redinesse (as the <hi>Switzers</hi> are for pay) to fight for <hi>Money,</hi> if she craued their aid, &amp; that <hi>Money</hi> againe should help them whensoeuer they did néede: and that sithence they were two Nations so mighty and so mingled together, and so dispersed into all parts of the world, that it was impossible to seuer them.
