            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe ſumme of all the blood, treaſures. Victories, and loſſes after theſe troubles, is to be beſtowed on that moſt royall and precious Jewell, called, <hi>A Perſonall Treaty;</hi> And its no marvell; for the vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſo rare and ſingular, that it is as well an excellent ſalve to cure all ſores, as a ſoveraign remedy for all diſeaſes, whether it be, <hi>The Kings Evill,</hi> or the Parliaments Evill, or the Houſe of Lords evill, the Cities, or the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or the Clergies, or the Cavaliers: ſo that only <hi>the peoples Evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> reſteth to be cured, by the Scots glorious Reformation, according to their forced Covenant, which cometh to paſſe (they ſay) when neither Papiſts, nor Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts, nor Sectaties ſhall be any more mentioned.</p>
            <p>All theſe mighty States being thus ſo eaſily cured, and the people of their freedoms, Eſtates, and Livelihoods ſo pittifully cheated, it is like to follow in the next place, that not only the <hi>King,</hi> (whom they have conquered and impriſoned) being again to his Throne advanced, but all his race, will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe theſe 3. main points of Government, (without any more mention of a Parliament) which may be thus diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Vindicative;</hi> For by the ſcope of all his practices, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſince this Parliament, (tending alwayes to tyranny blood, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) he and all his papiſts and Cavaliers. Prince <hi>Rupert, Maurice, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and the reſt, will endeavour to be ſully revenged on all whom either he or they know to be his or their enemies, begining at the Scots who firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him in his wicked practices, and next on the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and their adherents, for following their example, and laſt on the Army, by dozens and halfe dozens at Aſſiſes and Seſsions, if he cannot do it ſpeedily by another Army upon their refuſing to disband, and not regarding to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed (as they were once declared) Rebels and Traytors.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Reſtaurative,</hi> becauſe he and his Cavaliers will endeavour by force of Arms in City, and Troops of horſes in Countrey, not onely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their former greatneſſe, but other his adherents (who were never great) to be advanced on the peoples ruines.</p>
            <p>And the third is <hi>Preſervative,</hi> for he will make his little finger heavier then all the Parliaments loynes, by laying ſuch heavy loads of taxations, ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aſſeſments, exciſes and other oppreſſions, that both nations and this wealthy City, ſhall be made ſo poore and miſerable, that they ſhall never be able againe to riſe in Armes againſt him or his forces, but rather to be weary of their lives, wive<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and families for want of ſubſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus in brief, ye have here a Warning of the bitter fruits of a perſonall treaty, though there were no wofull examples of France, Naples and other places, by ſuch perſonall treaties, with their Kings, to terrify you from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in ſuch deſperate deſignes, left ye be guilty of all the bloods that may</hi>
