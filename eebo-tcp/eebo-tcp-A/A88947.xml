            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of a Church, ſo all manner of power of juriſdiction, either
to determine,—, or any way oblige ſuch as they ſhall any
way repreſent. <hi>pag.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Unleſſe it could be proved that in Scripture the
name of a Church is given to a Synod, we are not
to blamed, though we give not a Synod that
name, ſith we are commanded to hold faſt the paterne of the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
words of Scripture, as ſufficient, 2 Tim. 1. 13. though for this
we will not contend. But for power to determine, viz. dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
or by way of doctrine, this we deny not to a Synod: For
that Synod, Act. 15. did put forth ſuch power, and we acknowledge
other Synods may doe the like upon like occaſion, and their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
being according to the Scripture, ought to bind all
thoſe whom they repreſent.</p>
               <p>They acknowledge that neighbour Churches may meet and conſult, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
each other,—and withdraw all fellowſhip from any one that ſhall grow
pertinaciouſly ſcandalous. <hi>pag.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:112228:4"/>
And you may adde further, that by their meſſengers being
met in a Synod they may determine by the Scriptures any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of controverſie that may ariſe.</p>
               <p>But for matter of juriſdiction or power of the Keyes in excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ordination, or whatever Cenſure, they hold it is entirely and onely in
every ſingle Congregation, though but of 2 or 3 beleevers. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>If any hold ſo ſmall a number as 2 or 3 to be a Church ſo
compleat, as to have power of excommunication, ordination and
whatever Cenſure, they may if they ſee cauſe declare their
grounds for ſo holding. But for our parts for ought we yet ſee,
a Church that hath ſuch power as is here ſpoken of, had need to
be a greater number then two or three, even ſo many as ſhall be
neceſſary and requiſite for the carrying on of Church-worke, in
admonition and reprehenſion of one another, as there ſhall be
cauſe, and therfore they had need to be ſeaven or more. For a
Brother that ſinneth muſt ſo be dealt withall for his recovery,
that if he remain impenitent, the proceeding againſt him is ſtill
to goe on by degrees, till at laſt the matter be brought unto the
Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16 17. But in all the degrees of proceeding
againſt him, the perſons before whom he is called, are in every
latter ſtep and degree more in number, then they were in the
former, and ſo the Church being the laſt is the greateſt number
of all. And yet there are three at the leaſt that muſt be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the matter, before it muſt be brought unto the Church,
<hi>viz.</hi> the brother offending, the brother offended, and one
witneſſe at the leaſt; ſo that the Church conſiſting of thoſe three
or foure that deal in the matter before it come into the Church,
and of another number greater then they, and diſtinct from
them to whom the matter is brought in the laſt place muſt needs
conſiſt of ſeaven perſons, or more. As for that ſpeech of our
Sauiour, where he ſpeaks of 2 or 3 gathered together in his
Name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. He doth not thereby acknowledge ſuch a
ſmall number to be a Church; but fetcheth an argument from
thence as from the leſſer or leſſe probable, to prove the firm and
inviolable authority of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and her Cenſures, of which
he had ſpoken before v. 18. As if he ſhould ſay, if two agreeing
together upon earth ſhalbe heard in whatſoever they ſhall aske,
and if I be preſent with two or three gathered in my name, then
much more ſhall the whole Church, who is a greater number,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112228:4"/>
and a more ſolemne aſſembly be heard in their prayers, and
have Chriſts preſence in the midſt of them, to bind and looſe in
heaven what they ſhall bind or looſe in earth. But the former is
true, verſ. 19. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore the latter is true alſo verſ. 18.</p>
               <p>And for excommunication, ordination and cenſures, there is
nothing in Scripture nor proved in this diſcourſe of yours, that
theſe matters belong onely to a Synod, and not to a particular
congreation; yea wee conceive it will not bee eaſie for any man
whatſoever to prove, that Synods, and they onely have power to
ordain officers, and to excommunicate offenders; and till this
be proved, the Independants (as you call them) need not to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
their judgement and practice in theſe particulars. Sure it
is, that Synod in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. did neither meddle with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
nor excommunication, but onely determined the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
about circumciſion, and gave rules for practice to be
obſerved of the beleeving Gentiles, for avoiding of offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jewes.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge that where there is no conſociation or neighbourhood of
congregations or ſingle Churches whereby they may with conveniency be
aiding to each other—and whereto the particulars may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe—there
a ſingle congregation muſt not be denied entireneſſe of
juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>If you acknowledge thus much, (which yet is no more then
truth requires to be acknowledged, and wherin we for our parts,
fully concurre with you) then we ſuppoſe a man may improve
this grant of yours to a confirmation of that independencie of
Churches which you plead againſt and to a diſproving of a good
part of that authority of Synods which you would eſtabliſh. For
if a Church that hath no neighbourhood of other Churches;
have power of juriſdiction entirely within it ſelfe (as here you
doe acknowledge) then firſt let it be conſidered whence ſuch a
Church hath ſuch power, and ſee if that ground will not reach
to prove the like power in other Churches alſo. Now we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
none will deny, but ſuch a Church hath this authority or
power by the gift of Chriſt, and the liberty which he hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to every Church as it is a Church, which we had rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
in Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> his words, then in our own. The power
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112228:5"/>
it ſelfe (namely, in reproving ſcandals, and purging out the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked)
of right, or in reſpect of the firſt act, cannot be ſeparated
from a true Church: Becauſe it flows immediately and neceſſarily
from its very eſſence; For it is contained in that Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
beleevers are gathered into a Church. <hi>Caſ. Conſ. lib. 4. cap. 24.
Q.</hi> 4. Now if this be ſo, that power of Juriſdiction doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and neceſſarily flow from the very eſſence of a Church, and
ſo belongs to a Church, as it is a Church, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that this power muſt not be granted to be in ſuch a Church
as hath no neighbour Churches, and be denied unto one that
hath: becauſe a Church that hath neighbours is a Church,
and hath the eſſence of a Church, as truly as that which hath
none. Power of Juriſdiction flowing immediately from the eſſence
of a Church belongs indifferently to all Churches, to one as much
as to another, without reſpect of what neighbours they have, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many, or few, whether any or none. Secondly, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
alſo what is the end and uſe of the conſociation and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of Churches, and the ſame truth will thence appeare
alſo; which neighbourhood where it is affoorded is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Churches, but not for their hindrance and loſſe; And
therefore it may be helpfull by caſting in more light, but cannot
abridge them of any power which they had before. When Doctor
<hi>Ames (Medul. Theol. l. 1. c. 39. Sect.</hi> 27.) had ſaid that the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Churches into Claſſes and Synods, doth neither conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a new forme of the Church, nor ought by any means to take
away or impaire that libertie and power, which Chriſt hath left
unto his Churches, ſith it ſerveth onely for the directing and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of the ſame, what ſaith Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> hereunto? This, ſaith he,
we willingly grant (<hi>Paget. Defence. pa.</hi> 107.) Now if this muſt be
granted, then that dependencie of Churches, and that power of
Synods which you plead for muſt not be granted; For let a Church
have entireneſſe of Juriſdiction before ſhe have any neighbouring
Churches, and be deprived of the power when God ſends ſuch
neighbours, and by this meanes ſhe ſuſtaines loſſe by having
neighbours, and comes to be in this reſpect in worſe condition,
then when ſhe had none; which is againſt the true intent and uſe
of the conſociation of Churches.</p>

Moreover, if this grant of yours ſtand good, then what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of that which is intimated, pag. 6. and pa. 10. as a reaſon
againſt the Independency of Congregations? where, you ſay, <hi>that
it is againſt the very light of nature, that the adverſe party be the ſole Judge,
and party too in the cauſe; and that it is againſt all equity that the offended
party (meaning the Congregation) ſhould be the ſole and finall Judge of the
offence?</hi> Sure we cannot think that there can be ſuch a caſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
wherein you would grant it lawfull for a ſingle Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do that which is againſt all equity and the very light of
nature. And yet you grant that the caſe may be ſuch that a ſingle
Congregation may have entireneſſe of juriſdiction within it ſelf;
which ſeems to us plainly to prove, that for a Congregation to
be ſo independent, as to be the finall Judge of offences within it
ſelf, is not againſt all equity, nor againſt the light of nature, as is
intimated by you in the pages afore-mentioned. But ſith in
one place you grant that in ſome caſe a Congregation may have
entireneſſe of Juriſdiction within it ſelf, and in another place do
ſeem to imply that it is againſt all equity, and the light of nature,
that they ſhould be granted, we for our parts are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
how theſe things do ſtand together.</p>
               <p>But that too much may not be made of the grant of yours, you
do qualifie it in your ſubſequent words; wherein you ſay, that
<hi>this is a caſe extraordinarie, and falls not within the compaſſe of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which is about the ordinarie rule of Church-government;</hi> Whereunto
we anſwer two things. 1 That for a Chriſtian Congregation to
want neighbour Congregations, to whom they may with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
have recourſe, is not ſo unuſuall, as ſome may imagine:
ſpecially if the ſtate of things, in times and places of generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
of generall prophaneneſſe, and of new plantations in
heathen Countreys be conſidered. For at thoſe times, and in thoſe
places, it is well, if there be any ſuch Congregations at all to be
found (as there was one in London, in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>)
but it is not like there ſhould be ſo many of them, that any one
may have many neighbour ones, to have recourſe unto. And your
ſelf do intimate in page 43 of your book, that in the remoter part
of Wales, and of the North, ſuch Congregations even at this day,
would be ſo rare, that in all probability, ſcarce one could be made
up in twentie or thirty miles compaſſe. 2 Suppoſe the caſe were
extraordinarie and rare, would you ſay that therefore they may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112228:6"/>
violate the ordinarie rules appointed by Chriſt for Church admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations,
and now lawfully exerciſe Juriſdiction entirely within
themſelves, which if they had neighbours were unlawfull for
them to do? We ſuppoſe it is good to take heed how farre we yeeld
it lawfull in ſuch extraordinarie caſes, to tranſgreſſe and violate
ordinarie rules; left ſome body do thereupon inferre that though
according to ordinarie rules Baptiſme and the Lords Supper muſt
be diſpenſed onely by men, and by Miniſters, yet in the want of
theſe, the one may be diſpenſed by a woman, (ſuppoſe the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
or ſome other) and both of them by ſuch as are no Miniſters.
For as you excuſe the lawfulneſſe of entireneſſe of Juriſdiction in a
ſingle Congregation, even ſo may they excuſe theſe diſpenſations
here mentioned, by ſaying that the caſe is extraordinarie, and fals
not within the compaſſe of the Queſtion, which is, what perſons
by ordinarie rule may diſpenſe Sacraments; Wherefore for ought
we yet ſee it is more ſafe to hold, that ſith the diſpenſation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
and the Lords Supper, by ordinarie rules belongs onely to
Miniſters, therefore there can be no ſuch extraordinarie caſe, in
theſe dayes, wherein the diſpenſing of them may lawfully be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by others whether women or men: And ſith entireneſſe of
Juriſdiction muſt not be denied to a Congregation that wants
neighbours, therefore the thing is agreeable unto ordinary rules;
and ſo may be allowed in other caſes alſo. Becauſe the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Sacraments, fore-mentioned, is not allowable by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
rules, therefore the extraordinarineſſe of the caſe will not
make it lawfull; And becauſe the independent Juriſdiction of a
Congregation is lawfull in the caſe afore-mentioned, which you
call extraordinarie; Therefore the ſame is allowable by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
rule.</p>
               <p>There ought to be Synods or Aſſemblies—with larger power of the
keyes to make Decrees, ordain Paſtors, excommunicate members, or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
pag. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there ought to be Synods when occaſion requires,
we freely grant; but the Queſtion is not about their being, but
about their power; Wherein, that they have power to ordain and
excommunicate any, we do not yet ſee it proved. But that they
ſhould excommunicate whole Congregations, as here is affirmed,
ſeemeth to us to be altogether impoſſible; For a Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Church, it hath communion within it ſelf, out of which it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112228:6"/>
cannot be caſt, no more then caſt out it ſelf. <hi>Ames. Caſ. Conſc. lib. 4.
cap. 29. &amp;</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Yet ſo as in every ſingle Congregation, there be left a power, of publick
reprehenſion, and if need be, of ſuſpenſion of its own members from the Lords
table; And in caſe upon ſuch appeal to the Synod, there appear no difficulty
in the matter, or partialitie in the carriage of it, it is (if between Members
of one Congregation) rather to be remitted to the Congregation it ſelf, to be
there cenſured and ended. pa. 2. &amp; 3.</p>
               <p>This is not much leſſe, then a clear granting of the whole Cauſe,
for here is expreſly left to the Congregation not onely power of
publick reprehenſion, but alſo power of ſuſpenſion from the Lords
table, yea, and in ſome caſe power of cenſuring and ending mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within themſelves, having firſt conſulted and adviſed with
the Synod: which courſe in matters of difficulty and weight, we
for our parts acknowledge very meet to be taken when Synods can
be had, and when they cannot, yet in ſuch caſes of weight, it is fit
to conſult with neighbour Churches.</p>

know no reaſon, but yours may be owned alſo.</p>
               <p>Above and beſides which (namely, the ſingle Congregation) there is no
miniſterially governing Church, by any means they ſay to be admitted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Presbytery of a Congregation may be called a
Church, then ſith they do admit the governing power of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie,
they do admit a governing Church, beſide the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
if by Congregation you mean the whole multitude of the
Members; And if a Synod may be called a Church, and if power
by diſputation and diſquiſition to clear up the rule, and then to
command obedience thereto, may be called government, then
they alſo admit a Synod to be a governing Church: For the power
here mentioned they do allow unto Synods. But it ſeems to us
that the power is not properly a power and exerciſe of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Juriſdiction, but a power of Doctrine, and ſo a Synod is
rather a teaching then a governing Church. But that any other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112228:7"/>
Church, be it Synod, or any other beſides the Congregation and
its Presbyterie, ſhould have ſuch a governing power above the
Congregation and the Presbyterie thereof, as that neither the
Congregation nor its Presbyterie may ordain their own Officers,
nor excommunicate their own offendors, but both muſt be done
by that other governing Church; This we do not admit indeed,
becauſe hitherto, we have ſeen no convincing proofs for the ſame.</p>
               <p>All and every member hath (ſay they) a governing power, as of ordaining
their Paſtors and Officers, ſo of depoſing and excommunicating—. pa. 3.</p>
               <p>Governing properly ſo called, we acknowledge not in any, but
in the Elders alone. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. Rom. 12. 8. Hebr.</hi> 13. 17. If that
word be aſcribed to the people, it muſt be underſtood in a more
improper ſence, for that which in propriety of ſpeech were more
fitly called Liberty or Priviledge. And yet the liberty when it is
exerciſed about Ordination, Depoſition, Excommunication, is of
the whole body <hi>Communiter,</hi> or in generall, but not of all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
member in particular, as you conceive us to hold; for women
and children are members, and yet are not to act in ſuch matters,
the one being debarred by their ſex, and the other for want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
and diſcretion.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge that Paſtors and other Officers were anciently, and it is
to be wiſhed, thoy ſtill were choſen (at leaſt conſented to) by the members of
each reſpective Congregation. p. 3.</p>
               <p>By [<hi>anciently</hi>] we ſuppoſe you mean, in the Primitive, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
times; And if in theſe times they were choſen by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
what warrant can there be to take another courſe in
theſe dayes; ſith the ancient pattern of Scripture in matters of
this nature is a commandment that ought to be kept till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But they are to be ordoined in a Synod onely—.</p>
               <p>That a Synod hath the power, we would gladly ſee it proved
by the Word. But if theſe things may be done by a Synod onely
and not elſewhere, then how will that ſtand which you granted
in the page afore, that in ſome caſe a ſingle Congregation may
have entireneſſe of Juriſdiction within it ſelf? To be done by a
Synod onely, and to be done by a ſingle Congregation entirely
within it ſelf, are not eaſie for us to reconcile. Further, if Synods
conſiſt, as you ſay, of Presbyteries and other Commiſſioners, then
there muſt be Presbyters afore there can be Synods; and thence it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112228:7"/>
muſt follow that all Presbyters are not ordained by Synods, but
ſome by other men. If it be ſaid though the Presbyters, whereof
the particular Synod conſiſteth, were not ordained by the Synod,
but were Presbyters before this Synod had any being, yet they
might be ordained by a former Synod; The anſwer is that this
doth not remove the difficultie. For ſtill it would be enquired how
the Presbyters of that former Synod, and ſo of the firſt Synod that
ever was, how they came to be Presbyters: Sure if the firſt Synod
conſiſted of Presbyters, then there were Presbyters before there
was any Synod, and ſo Presbyters have been lawfully ordained,
and not by a Synod.</p>
               <p>In a Synod where all the ultimate power of Decrees and Cenſures reſides—.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By power of Decrees, we underſtand Power to clear up
the truth dogmatically, for the word tranſlated decrees is <hi>dogmata</hi>
in the originall, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. And this power we confeſſe is in a Synod,
though not all in the Synod alone, but alſo in the Presbyterie of
a ſingle Congregation. But for power of Cenſures, this we do not
ſee to be in the Synod at all; much leſſe, that it doth all reſide in
the Synod, and not elſewhere. But when you ſay, all the ultimate
power of theſe things doth reſide in a Synod (though you do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
by the word ultimate that matters ought not to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
depending, but in ſome Judicatory or other be brought unto
their ultimate or laſt period, and concluſion, wherein we concurre
with you, yet nevertheleſſe) your meaning is not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
what Synod this ſhould be that ſhould have this ultimate
power. For you know there are divers ſorts of Synods, ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
which are called Claſſes, ſome Provinciall, ſome Nationall,
and ſome generall, or Oecumenicall Synods; And we ſhould be
glad to know, which of all theſe it is in whom the ultimate power
of theſe things doth reſide, and why it may not reſide in any of
the reſt; yea and why the ultimate power of cenſures may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in the Congregation, as well as in any of them.</p>
               <p>Whether it be neceſſarie to the well being of a ſingle Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

pag. 3. and pag. 2. where you ſay that Paſtors are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,

Synods have a larger power of the keyes to make Decrees, ordain
Paſtors, and excommunicate Members, or Congregations; So that
the Queſtion is: Whether it be neceſſarie to the well-being of a

government of Synods, as that a Synod onely and not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
muſt ordain their Paſtors, and excommunicate offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:

we will not ſtand long to enquire, ſuch of them as are yet alive,
may anſwer for themſelves, if they ſee cauſe: But it ſhall ſuffice us,
to conſider the weight of the Argument it ſelf, which we ſuppoſe
being put into form muſt run thus, or to the like purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As the Congregations in Iſrael were dependent, ſo muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
be in theſe dayes.</p>
               <p>But Congregations in Iſrael were dependent on the Miniſteriall
government of a Synod:</p>
               <p>Therefore Congregations in theſe dayes muſt be dependent on
the Miniſteriall government of a Synod.</p>
               <p>Indeed in your proſecution of the Argument, you do not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention any Miniſteriall government of a Synod in Iſrael, upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112228:8"/>
which their congregations did depend: Yet we conceive that muſt
needs be your meaning; becauſe otherwiſe the Argument which
you bring, doth not reach to conclude the thing in queſtion, even
as the queſtion is ſtated by your ſelfe. For in the words immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preceding this firſt Argument, you thus ſumme up and conclude
your ſtating the queſtion, viz. <hi>Whether it be neceſſary—that a ſingle
Congregation, where it ſtands in neighbourhood with other Churches, ſhould
be co-ordinated with the reſt in a dependency on the Miniſteriall government
of a Synod.</hi> And having anſwered affirmatively, you then bring in
this for your firſt Argument, taken from the manner of government
in the Jewiſh Church, laid down in the Texts above mentioned.
Now if that be the queſtion, as you lay it down, and this the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the affirmative part, then ſith the queſtion is about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on the government of a Synod, the Argument muſt
needs be of the ſame, or elſe nothing in queſtion is concluded. And
if the Argument muſt conclude the queſtion, then it muſt be laid
down to the like purpoſe as we have done; and being ſo formed,
our anſwer is by denying both parts thereof. For neither is it clear
from thoſe texts, that the congregations in Iſrael did depend on
the miniſteriall government of a Synod; nor will it follow that
ours muſt be dependant as theirs were.</p>
               <p>Touching the former of theſe, (to ſpeak firſt of the minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition)
ſuppoſe it were true that the Congregations in Iſrael did
depend upon the government of the Judicatories or Aſſemblies
mentioned in thoſe texts, yet that doth not prove they depended
upon a Synod: And the reaſon is, becauſe the Judicatories there
mentioned, were not any Synods at all, but Aſſemblies of another
nature. For firſt, Synods (as your ſelves deſcribe them pag, 2.) are
Aſſemblies, conſiſting of the ſeverall Paſtors, whom together with
ſuch other members as ſhould be thought fit, the ſeveral congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are reſpectively to chuſe &amp; ſend therto. But thoſe Judicatories
in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and the other Scriptures, did not conſiſt of any Paſtors
or members, whom the ſeverall congregations did chuſe, and ſend
thereto; but of the Prieſts and Levites, of the Judges and chiefe of
the Fathers of Iſrael, which were conſtantly reſident at Jeruſalem,
the place which the Lord had choſen. And the ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had nothing to do either to chuſe them, or ſend them.
Secondly, theſe Jndicatories at Jeruſalem were ſtanding Courts,
and were conſtantly to continue, and therefore they were not Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112228:9"/>
for Synods are not wont to ſtand and continue, but onely
till they have ended the buſineſſe which was the occaſion of calling
them, and then to be diſſolved and ended. Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Page</hi> (out
of whom it ſeems this argument, and much of the diſcourſe about
it, is taken) doth confeſſe, pag. 3. that the authority of Claſſes and
Synods, is not civill, neither have they power to inflict civill pnniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they onely judge of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and that in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
manner, uſing no other then ſpirituall cenſures, in pag.
29. of his <hi>Defence.</hi> But the Judicatories in theſe texts (as Mr. <hi>Paget</hi>
alſo confeſſeth pag. 34. 35.) were for civill cauſes as well as Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall;
and ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 5. that by the word of the Prieſts
and Levites every controverſie and every ſtroke maſt be tried even
in civill cauſes, as that of trying out an uncertain murther, which
is the cauſe ſpoken of in that place. By all which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
that thoſe ſuperior Judicatories in Iſrael were not Synods;
and then ſuppoſe their congregations did depend upou thoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories,
and that ours muſt depend as theirs did, yet it will not
follow that ours muſt depend upon Synods.</p>
               <p>And thus your Minor failing, this might be enough to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the whole ſtrength of your Argument. Nevertheleſſe, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anſwer, we may alſo deny the conſequence of your Major
propoſition: For though it were yeelded, that the congregations
in Iſrael did depend upon a ſuperiour Judicatory, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that it muſt be ſo in theſe dayes: And our reaſon is, becauſe
the particular congregations in Iſrael (viz. their Synagogues) were
not compleat Churches, as the Congregations in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
are. That they were not entire and compleat Churches,
may appear by this, becauſe the people could not lawfully in them
have the uſe of the moſt ſolemne ordinances of God, and par<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of
his worſhip, though ſuch as were of ordinary and continuall uſe,
but they muſt goe upto Jeruſalem for the performing and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof; and therefore they wete ſtrightly commanded, as
not to keep the Paſſover, ſo not to offer any Offerings or Sacrifices
(which yet were of very frequent uſe) in any place within any of
their gates, but onely in Jeruſalem, the place which God did chuſe
to put his name there, as we read at large <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. and 16. 5, 6.
Neither was it lawfull for the chiefe Miniſters of the Church to
execute the chiefe parts of their office in thoſe Synagognes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at Jeruſalem. But now with congregations in theſe dayes it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112228:9"/>
farre otherwiſe; there is none of the ſolemne Ordinances of God,
which are of ordinarie and continuall uſe, but in theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
they may be enjoyed, nor any ordinarie duties of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
but in them they may be performed, as preaching, prayer,
Sacraments, Diſcipline, &amp;c. which ſhews they are entire Churches
within themſelves. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> hath the ſaying. <hi>The Synagogues were
not compleat Churches, becauſe the whole worſhip of God, and all the ſacred
communion preſcribed at that time, could not be exerciſed in them. Med.
Theol. lib. 1. ca. 38. Theſ.</hi> 37. And again, <hi>There is nothing read in all the
New Teſtament, of the inſtitution of any greater Church, on which the leſſer
ſhould depend: Nor any worſhip or ſacred ordinance preſcribed, which is not
to be obſerved in every Congregation: Nor any ordinary Miniſter appointed
who is not given to ſome one Aſſembly of this kind. Lib. 1. cap. 39. Theſ.</hi> 26.
Now if their Congregations could not enjoy all the Ordinances,
as not being compleat Churches, there might be reaſon why they
ſhould be dependent upon Jeruſalem, and the Synedrion and
Temple there, where the Ordinances might be enjoyed; and yet
ours being compleat, and enjoying al the Ordinances within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
need not to be ſo dependent.</p>
               <p>And another reaſon why their Congregations might be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and ours not ſo, may be this. They had a ſuperiour Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to appeal unto which had the <hi>ſupremum</hi> of Church power
within it ſelf, and from whoſe ſentence there was no appeal to any
further Judge upon earth; for ſo it is ſaid of that Synedrion at
Jeruſalem. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. And Reaſon requires that ſome ſuch ſupream
Judicatory there ſhould be; for controverſies &amp; caſes of doubt muſt
not be drawn out in <hi>Infinitum,</hi> but of neceſſity <hi>ſtandum eſt in aliquo
ſupremo,</hi> we muſt reſt in ſome ſupreame, and proceed no further. But
now in the New Teſtament, if we once depart from a particular
Congregation or Church, where or when ſhall we find ſuch a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premum?</hi>
Surely not before we come to an Oecumenicall or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councell: For as for Claſſicall, Provinciall, and Nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
there is none of theſe, but thoſe Caſes which you put of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
and poſſibility of partiality may befall the beſt of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore if for theſe cauſes the ſingle Congregations, muſt not
be Independent, but there muſt be appeals from them, the Synods
being ſubject to the like, there muſt be liberty of appeals from
them alſo. For like as you do alledge that Congregations may
be partiall, and erre, ſo we ſuppoſe it will not be denied but the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112228:10"/>
Claſſis may erre, the Provinciall Synod may erre, the Nationall
may erre: And therefore by this Reaſon entireneſſe of Juriſdiction
muſt be granted to none of theſe. And then whither ſhall we go
but to a Generall Councill, which as it hath not been ſeen for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by paſt generations, ſo God knows whether ever there ſhall be
any ſo long as this world ſhall endure. But how if the Generall
Councill do erre alſo? Sure learned Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
clear it, that ſuch a thing is not impoſſible. <hi>Theſ. 2. Sect.</hi> 15.
And ſo by this reaſon entireneſſe of Juriſdiction muſt not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Generall Councils, but there muſt be liberty of appeals from
them alſo. Such conſequences do inevitably follow upon that
which you ſuggeſt as a ground of appealing from particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.
And by all this it appeareth, that particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
have no ſuch ſuperiour Judicatory above them, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your grounds, there may be liberty of appeals from the
ſame; And thence it followeth that there is not the like Reaſon,
againſt their Independency, as againſt the Independency of the
Synagogues in Iſrael: becauſe thoſe Synagogues had a Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
above them, from which there was no appeal. Thoſe may be
Dependent which have others above them, which are ſupreame;
Whereas they which have no ſuch above them may be ſupreame
themſelves, and conſequently be independent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If any ſhall here ask whether we think it not poſſible for
particular Congregations to erre in their judgement of cauſes?</p>
               <p>We anſwer, That we confeſſe they may; But in our Judgement
that needs not to hinder, but they may have entireneſſe of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
within themſelves, and not be under the power of any
other. For that ſupreame Synedrion at Jeruſalem did many times
erre, and gave corrupt Judgement in cauſes, and yet was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of any other Judicatory. When we are enquiring
in what Judicatory, the <hi>ſupremum</hi> of Church-power doth lye, it is
not our beſt courſe to look for ſuch an one as cannot erre: for ſuch
an one we ſhall never find, but to look out where God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it to lie, and therewith to reſt contented: Now in the
old Teſtament this <hi>ſupremum</hi> by Gods appointment, was in that
Synedrion at Jeruſalem. But in the new Teſtament we know of no
appointment of God, that the like <hi>ſupremum</hi> muſt be in a Synod;
but for ought we know a particular Congregation may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to that Synedrion, as well as any Claſſis or Synod; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112228:10"/>
ſo much the rather, becauſe the power in a particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is conſtant, and alwayes ready to be had, as it was in that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrion;
whereas Claſſes and Synods are more ſeldome and rare,
and cannot be gathered ſo often as there may be need of the uſe of
Church power, in regard of ordaining of Officers, or cenſuring of
offenders, and the like.</p>
               <p>Therefore briefly to wind up all, ſith Congregations in the New
Teſtament, are compleat Churches, which the Jewiſh Synagogues
were not; and ſith the Synagogues had a ſupreame judicatory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them, from which there was no appeale, which our congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
have not: Therefore we conclude, That the dependencie
of the Synagogues upon that ſuperiour Judicatory, doth not prove
that our congregations muſt depend upon the government of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
eſpecially this being conſidered withall, that the Judicatory
upon which the Synagogues did depend, was not any Synod, but
an Aſſembly of another nature: And though the Supremacie muſt
be ſome where, even where God hath appointed it to be, yet
the particular congregations may ſhew as much for that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Synod.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for anſwer to this firſt Argument: Onely
we will adde ſome obſervations upon ſome few paſſages in that
which you write for removall of three exceptions which you ſay
are given by ſome againſt this argument of yours.</p>
               <p>1. That that government was ccremoniall and typicall. 2. That Papiſts
alledge it againſt us for their Hierarchy and appeales to—the Pope. 3. That
the Prieſts and Levites were then Judges in civill cauſes, wherin it was that
the government was then appealative and dependent, <hi>pag.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>If any doe make ſuch exceptions, we leave it to them that make
them, to undertake the defence of them, or to cleare them as they
ſhall ſee cauſe. But for us, the anſwer we have given to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is that wherein we do reſt.</p>
               <p>That there ought to be one High-Prieſt, in whom all appeales and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were to determine. <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Though there was to be one High-Prieſt among the Jewes, yet
that all appeals and judgements were to determine in him, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is more then can be proved. Sure Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> pag. 35, 36.
(whom you ſeem in your diſcourſe much to follow) doth ſay, that
the judgement ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. was not given by the High-Prieſt
alone, but by a Colledge or Senate of Prieſts, noted in the text, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112228:11"/>
approveth the judgement of Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> and Doctor <hi>Whitaker,</hi>
giving this anſwer as a juſt refutation of the Papiſts, arguing from
this Text to prove there ſhould bee one ſupreme Judge of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
cauſes.</p>
               <p>That there ought to be graduall Judicatories wherein the aggrieved party
may appeale from the leſſer to the higher—There can be no ceremony or type
in this—This was taught by the light of nature to Jethro—Appeals (ſaith
Doctor Whitaker) are of divine and naturall right. <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>If this bee meant in civill cauſes, where more is left to the
light of nature and civill prudence, according to the general rules
of the Word, the Word not determining all particulars ſo fully, as
it doth in Eccleſiaſticall matters; then we for our parts doe fully
conſent thereto. And though it were extended to Eccleſiaſticall
cauſes alſo, yet this we ſuppoſe is cleare likewiſe by the ſame light
of nature, that both for civill cauſes and Eccleſiaſticall, there muſt
be ſome finall and ſupreame judgement, that controverſies may
not by appeales after appeals be ſpun out in <hi>infinitum.</hi> Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be determined where that ſupremacie doth lie (which is the
very thing in queſtion) the uſefulneſſe and neceſſity of appeals may
be granted, and yet we ſhall be ſtill at uncertainty about the thing
in queſtion, and as much to ſeek as before. That there ought to be
appeals till you come to the higheſt, is one thing, and that a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
(and not a particular congregation) is the higheſt, is another;
and they are ſo farre different, that though the firſt were granted,
yet the latter is not thereby proved.</p>
               <p>That renowned Martyr Cranmer, the forme of his appeale to a Councell,
three times by him urged—we have recorded by Mr <hi>Fox</hi> at large <hi>pag.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>But how this example doth ſuit the preſent queſtion, we
doe not underſtand: for his appeal was not from a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
but from the Pope; nor was it to a Synod, but to the
next generall Councell, which from that day to this, hath not yet
aſſembled, nor been called. If we muſt hold a neceſſity of appeales
to ſuch a Judicatory as <hi>Cranmer</hi> appealed unto, then the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of Synods, Provinciall or Nationall, is utterly taken away.</p>
               <p>Generally all that write againſt appeals to the Pope, acknowledge yet their
neceſſary uſefulneſſe to a Synod; So did that reverend Martyr <hi>Cranmer,</hi>—So
(beſides the whole ſtream of Antiquity) <hi>Urſin, Zepperus,</hi> and to
come neerer, <hi>Cartwright, Fenner,</hi> nay <hi>Barrow, Ainſworth, Johnſon,
pag.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:112228:11"/>
We doubt it is a ſpeech a good deale too large, to ſay, That all
theſe doe acknowledge the neceſſary uſefulneſſe of appeales to a
Synod, eſpecially if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you mean of ſuch appeales as you muſt needs
mean, or elſe you ſpeak not to the queſtion in hand; viz. of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
from a particular congregation. We have looked upon ſome
of the places, and doe perſwade our ſelves that if you doe look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them alſo, you will finde this ſpeech of yours to be too exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
As for Mr. <hi>Paget,</hi> who (pag. 39. 40.) alledgeth all theſe very
places that you doe alledge, he doth not ſay that thoſe Authours
doe all acknowledge ſuch neceſſary uſefulneſſe of appeals to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
as you doe report them to acknowledge; nor doth alledge
them for that end, but for another purpoſe, viz. to ſhew, that in
theſe dayes we may alledge and argue from texts out of the Law
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other places of the old Teſtament, which if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, we for our parts ſee no reaſon to diſallow. But that all
theſe Authors, even <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Ainſworth</hi> doe acknowledge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
uſefulneſſe of appeales from particular congregations to
the government of Synods, is ſo large an expreſſion, as wee know
not upon what grounds to think it credible; ſith it is well knowne
to them that have read their writings, that they acknowledge no
Eccleſiaſticall Judicatory ſuperiour to that of a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>If the benefit of appeals and conſociation of Churches, to their mutuall
help in government, ſhould not be as free to us as to the Jewes, how much more
defective and improvident were the Goſpel, then the Law? <hi>pag.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Conſociation of Churches for mutuall help, we willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
ſo that this conſociation may neither conſtitute a
new form of a Church, nor take away or impair the liberty and
power which Chriſt hath given to Churches; but ſerve onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the true uſe thereof, for the directing and guiding of the
ſame: which proviſo (as we ſaid before) Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> doth willingly
grant.</p>
               <p>And for appeals, we do willingly acknowledge any benefit that
may come thereby: But for making the Goſpel more defective
then the Law; we conceive if things be well conſidered, it is not
our way, but yours, that will be found juſtly culpable, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
For firſt, as the Jews had a ſupreame Judicatory for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ending of Cauſes, ſo we hold the ſame in a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Whereas according to your opinion and grounds, we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112228:12"/>
know not where or when to find ſuch a Judicatory, but there muſt
be appeals upon appeals, from the Congregation to the Claſſis,
from a Claſſis to a Provinciall Synod, and from them to a Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and from that to an Oecumenicall; and by this means cauſes
may be ſo protracted, as not to receive any determination for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
generations, yea it may be never while this world doth endure.
Secondly, as with them there was a ſtanding Judicatorie alwaies
in readineſſe for the hearing of cauſes, ſo we hold the like in the
particular Congregation: Whereas Synods are not alwaies in
readineſſe, but ſo ſeldome, that if they had ſupreme power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
yet cauſes ma<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be long depending, before a Synod can
be called for the determining of them. Thirdly, whereas the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Judicatorie at Jeruſalem, being but one in all the world,
was verie farre remote from all proſelites, that lived in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
(as the Eunuch of Ethiopia, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.) yea farre remote from
thoſe Jews, that dwelt in the furtheſt parts of the Holy Land; God
hath provided better for us in regard that Congregations wherein
we place the ſupreame Church power being many in number, a
Chriſtian may have the uſe of that power with much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie,
then was affoarded to moſt Jews and Proſelites in thoſe
daies; But as for Synods, as they are for time more ſeldome, then
that Synedrion, ſo they are to many perſons no leſſer remote in
place. By all which it doth appear, that the doctrine of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
(as you call them) doth in ſome things make us equall
to the Jews, and in other things, doth make our condition more
excellent then theirs; Whereas according to your way, that are
againſt Independencie, in many things our condition is made
more defective then theirs.</p>
               <p>How were our Saviour King of peace and righteouſneſſe, ſhould he have
ordained now under the Goſpel, ſuch a government as—were neither
righteous nor peaceable? pa. 7.</p>
               <p>That our bleſſed Saviour is King of righteouſneſſe and peace,
and the Church government which he hath ordained both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and peaceable, is ſuch a certain and divine truth, that it
were blaſphemous wickedneſſe to doubt of it; But when the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is, what government Chriſt hath ordained, it is better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſay, This government the Scripture doth witneſſe to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of Chriſt, and therefore it is righteous and peaceable, then
to ſay, this government is not righteous nor peaceable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112228:12"/>
not ordained of Chriſt. We meane plainly thus, that it is more
agreeable to religious ſobrietie and humilitie, to ſearch out by
Scripture-grounds, what government Chriſt hath ordained, and
when that is once found, then to conclude from thence, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and peaceableneſſe of the ſame; rather then on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, to think with our ſelves what government to naturall
reaſon ſeems righteous and peaceable, and thence to gather what
is ordained or not ordained of Chriſt, your ſelf have a ſaying p. 9.
that laws meerly poſitive are therefore Laws becauſe commanded.
And why may not we ſay in like ſort, this or that form of Church
government, is therefore peaceable and righteous, becauſe ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſith this or that form is by the poſitive law of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But (ſay you) how can that government be peaceable and righteous,
where parties are made ſole Judges? Suppoſe the greater number of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in a Congregation be againſt the Paſtor and Elders. pag. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not unrighteous nor unpeaceable in it ſelf that they
ſhould be Judges, whom the God of all righteouſneſſe and peace
hath appointed ſo to be. Nor is it reaſonable, that they ſhould be
thruſt out of the office, whereto God hath appointed them, under
this pretence, that they are parties; For if good care be not taken
how farre we give way to ſuch alledgements, we may lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for weakning, if not utterly evacuating, the authoritie of
all ſupreame Judicatories whatſoever. For as you alledge againſt
the Congregation, that they may be divided amongſt themſelves,
and then if matters be ended there, parties are made Judges, (<hi>viz.</hi>
the major part againſt the minor) ſo the very ſame may be ſaid of
a Synod, where controverſies may ariſe, as well as in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And if Congregations muſt not determine matters ariſing
within themſelves, becauſe parties muſt not be Judges; then by the
ſame reaſon matters ariſing in a Synod, muſt not be determined
by a Synod; and ſo the Synod unto whom, you would have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
carried from the Congregation, muſt be no more Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
then the Congregation it ſelf, from whom they are carried.
Yea, by this Reaſon, that ſupreame Synedrion among the Jews,
muſt have been dependent alſo. For it is plain, that ſometimes
that Synedrion was divided into parts among themſelves, as in
that famous inſtance, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. where the diviſion of the Councill
was the means of <hi>Paul's</hi> eſcape.</p>
               <p>Finally, there is not any ſupreme Judicatory upon earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112228:13"/>
Civill nor Eccleſiaſticall, but if they conſiſt of many perſons,
and be not abſolute and meere Monarchies conſiſting of one alone,
the members thereof may be divided among themſelves, and yet
they muſt be the finall Judges to determine matters within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
if the matters muſt be determined at all: ſo that this which
you ſeeme to reject as an abſurditie, that parties ſhould be Judges,
is in ſome caſes (and namely when the ſupreme Judicatory is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into parts about matters ariſing among themſelves) a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of unavoidable neceſſity, and cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>This communion and mutuall aſſiſtance in government,—God as by his
Word, ſo by the very light of Nature, teacheth all ſocieties whatever, whether
Common-wealths, or Armies, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities or Navies, <hi>pag.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Either this paſſage means that all Common-wealths, &amp;c.
are taught ſuch communion and aſſiſtance in government with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Common-wealths, &amp;c. as that none of them have entireneſſe
and ſupremacie of juriſdiction within themſelves, but are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on other the like ſocieties for the ſame; or elſe that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and parts of a Common-wealth, &amp;c. are taught ſuch commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and aſſiſtance in government, as not to be entire of themſelves,
but to depend upon the whole ſociety of which they are members
and parts. If it be taken in the latter ſenſe, then the thing is moſt
true, but no prejudice to our cauſe at all, for we grant the ſame of
the parts and members of a Congregationall Church, &amp;c. But it
muſt be taken in the former ſenſe, if it make any thing againſt us;
and in this ſenſe it will not hold true: for it is well known, that
Common-wealths and Univerſities, as the Common-wealth of
England for example, and the Univerſity of Oxford, have no ſuch
communion and aſſiſtance in government, with other Common-wealths
and other Univerſities, but that they have entireneſſe of
juriſdiction within themſelves; and the ſame may be ſaid of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and Navies. The members of all theſe ſocieties doe depend
on the ſocietie of which they are members: But that is nothing
againſt us. If the Societies did depend upon other the like Societies,
this indeed were againſt us. But this cannot be proved ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Not that therefore this government of Churches ſhould as thoſe end in a
Monarchy on earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſuppoſe it is a clear miſtake, to ſay that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all thoſe ſocieties, doth end in a Monarchy: For whatever
may be ſaid of the reſt, Common-wealths you know there are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112228:13"/>
ſundry, whoſe government is either Democraticall or Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and doth not end in any Monarchy at all; witneſſe for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Low Countreys.</p>
               <p>But if Churches muſt be dependent upon the government of
Synods, becauſe the very light of Nature teacheth a communion
and aſſiſtance in government to all Societies whatever; then we
ſee not how it will be avoyded, but by the ſame reaſon Churches
muſt end in a Monarchy upon earth, if it were once proved, that
the light of Nature doth teach all ſocieties whatever ſo to end:
For there is as good reaſon for this as for the other. And the old
plea for Biſhops and Popes, <hi>ut capite conſtituto ſchiſmatis occaſio tollere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
will not be eaſily avoyded. If we yeeld thus much that what the
light of nature teacheth other Societies, the ſame muſt be obſerved
in the government of Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſay indeed that this will not follow,</hi> Becauſe the Churches
Monarch or Head is in Heaven, and ſuch an one, as though in Heaven, yet
ſtill preſent by his Word and Spirit here on earth too, to all the offices of a
Monarch. pag. 7.</p>
               <p>But this we conceive doth not remove the difficultie, partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the objection is for a viſible Head, and not an inviſible; and
partly becauſe the time hath been when there was one High-Prieſt
upon earth, in whom you ſay (pag. 6.) that all appeals and
judgements were to determine: And yet at that time the Monarch
or Head of the Church was in Heaven, and preſent on earth too
by his Word and Spirit, to all the offices of a Monarch, as truly
then as now.</p>
               <p>Whereby we may ſee, that if you will goe by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is not the preſence of Chriſt in Heaven, and his ſpirituall
and inviſible preſence with his Church on earth, that will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the neceſſity of a viſible Head upon earth. A ſurer anſwer to
this plea, is to flye to the inſtitution and appointment of God,
whoſe wiſedome and will it was to appoint one High Prieſt upon
earth in former times, but hath not done the like in theſe dayes.</p>

we are willing to conſider what ſtrength there may be in the
Argument, and to that purpoſe we muſt enquire into your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this phraſe of <hi>Reference to the Jewiſh Church-government,</hi>
whereby we conceive you intend one of theſe two, either that the
word <hi>Church</hi> in our Saviours rule, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> doth ſignifie the
Elders and Governours alone, as ſometimes the like word is uſed in
the old Teſtament; or elſe that no new rule is preſcribed hereby
our Saviour, but the very ſame that was formerly given to the
Jews. Mr. <hi>Paget,</hi> who alſo takes his ſecond argument from this place
of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. doth underſtand our Saviours words in this later ſenſe.
But whether way ſoever you intend, our anſwer is briefly thus:
Firſt, that though we will not now deny the minor Propoſition, yet
this we may ſay, That it is not ſo evident of it ſelf, but that it needs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112228:14"/>
ſome better proof then by you is given for the confirmation of it;
for of it ſelf it is not clear, that by <hi>Church</hi> is meant onely the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church, nor that all the ſteps of ſuch graduall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as our Saviour doth preſcribe, were formerly commanded
to the Jews. And your ſelf profeſſing in your Epiſtle to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
prefixed before your book, that you like D. <hi>Moulins</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
rather to bring one Argument then ten Authors, if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
you had confirmed this minor propoſition with ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof then onely the names of Authors, it could have given
better ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>But what ever become of the minor, the conſequence of the
major may juſtly be denied. For though it were granted that our
Saviours words, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> were ſpoken with reference to the
Jewiſh Church-government in this ſence, that this graduall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in all the ſteps of it was formerly commanded to the
Jews, yet this is nothing to prove the neceſſitie of the dependance
of Congregations upon the government of Synods, (which is our
queſtion) becauſe there may be ſuch graduall proceedings to the
fulfilling of our Saviours rule, without any uſe of a Synod at all.
If it were not ſo, Synods had need to be more frequent then they
are, or ever were, or are ever like to be, for this rule of our Saviour
is of very frequent uſe.</p>
               <p>And though it were granted alſo, that by <hi>Church,</hi> our Saviour
meant the Elders (which is the other ſenſe of your words of refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Jewiſh Church-government) yet neither would this
prove the dependence of Congregations upon the Government of
Synods, becauſe there may be and ought to be Elders, and an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip
or Presbyterie in every particular Congregation, and by
telling thoſe Elders that rule may be obſerved, if our Saviours
words were taken in that ſence. And indeed it ſeems your ſelf do
ſo underſtand them, as appears in pag. 17. of your book, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in this place now in hand, becauſe one of thoſe Authors
whom you alledge for the meaning of our Saviours words, is Mr.
<hi>Johnſon,</hi> who in his latter times, did ſo underſtand them, of whom
you ſay, <hi>Even Mr.</hi> Johnſon <hi>himſelf though a Paſtor of Separatiſts in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Treatiſe reduceth himſelf from his former error in the contrary opinion,
to this judgement too.</hi> Wherby it ſeems, that for the meaning of this
text, you concurre in opinion or judgement with Mr. <hi>Johnſon.</hi> And
if ſo, then though you may by <hi>Church</hi> underſtand the Elders as he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112228:15"/>
did, yet then you muſt alſo acknowledge the Independency of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations and the Paſtors thereof; for it is certain
and plain that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> was of that opinion and judgement
too, notwithſtanding that his Expoſition of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and did
never reduce himſelf to this opinion, that Congregations muſt be
dependent upon the Government of Synods, which is your plea.
For which purpoſe you may conſider what is to be ſeen in his
<hi>Chriſtian Plea,</hi> which was one of the laſt books that ever he wrote.
Now in pag. 250, 251. of that book are theſe words, <hi>viz. Seeing
now every particular conſtituted Church hath right and power within it ſelf
to celebrate the Lords Supper, which is anſwerable to the Paſſeover that was
kept at Jeruſalem, this ſheweth that now every particular Church is to be
eſteemed as Jeruſalem, and ſo to ſtand immediately under Jeſus Chriſt the
Arch-Paſtor of his ſheep, and high Prieſt of our profeſſion.</hi> And again, <hi>All
particular Churches with their Paſtors do ſtand immediately under Jeſus
Chriſt the Arch-Paſtor without any ſtrange Eccleſiaſticall power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
interpoſed between, whether it be of the Prelates, or of their unlawfull
uſurping Synods, or any ſuch like</hi>—. And in the words following,
ſpeaking how all Churches, and the Miniſters of them, ſhould be
readie and willing to help and adviſe one another, he addeth thus:
<hi>viz. And ſo to this end, and in this manner, may be had a lawfull and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
uſe of Synods, Claſſes, &amp;c. for mutuall help and adviſe, ſo as alwaies
it be provided that they do not challenge or uſurp any unlawfull Juriſdiction
or power over the particular Churches, or their Paſtors and Governours.</hi>
By which words it plainly appeareth, that though Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> by
<hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. did underſtand the Elders, yet he never held
that particular Churches, and the Elders thereof, ſhould depend
upon the government of Synods, but be immediately under the
government and authoritie of Jeſus Chriſt, and depend no other
way upon Synods but onely for their adviſe and counſell: and
therefore his Expoſition of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. will ſtand you in no ſtead to
prove the dependance of particular Churches upon Synods.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to wind up our Anſwer to this Argument. Though
it were granted that when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> he
means <hi>tell the Elders,</hi> and though it were granted alſo that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a graduall proceeding, he preſcribeth no new rule, but
the ſame that had been given before unto the Jews, yet neither of
theſe do prove that Congregations muſt depend upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of Synods; and the reaſon is, becauſe both theſe may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112228:15"/>
in a particular Congregation; for therein a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by ſuch ſteps and degrees as our Saviour enjoyneth, and may
alſo tell his matter to the Elders of that particular Church. And
ſo the conſequence of your major propoſition failing, the whole
Argument muſt fail alſo, though the minor were never ſo ſtrongly
proved: and how much more when the minor is left ſo weak, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe particulars being ſufficiently cleared and made good
by you, that by <hi>Church</hi> is meant the Elders, nor that all that our
Saviour in that place preſcribeth, was before commanded to the
Jews.</p>
               <p>But inaſmuch as your words are, that this of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by our Saviour Chriſt in reference to the Jewiſh Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
before urged, therefore we may give a further Anſwer
to this Argument, out of that which before hath been anſwered
when the Argument from the Jewiſh Church-government was
urged. For though it were granted that Chriſt ſpeaks in reference
to that government, yea though it were granted (which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
none will affirm) that all that was uſed among the Jews is
here preſcribed by Chriſt, yet all this were too ſhort to prove that
our Congregations muſt depend upon the government of Synods,
unleſſe it could be proved that the Jewiſh Congregations did ſo
depend, which we have formerly ſhewed to be otherwiſe, the great
Synedrion at Jeruſalem upon which their leſſer Congregations did
depend, if they were dependent at all, being not any Synod, but
an Aſſembly of another nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will improve this Text further; and therefore after ſome
ſpeech of an Indefinite propoſition in Logick, and an Indefinite
command in Divinitie, and of five graduall</hi> Iffs <hi>in our Saviours
words,</hi> If he ſhall offend, &amp;c. <hi>you come thus to argue,</hi> viz. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of complaint or Appeal muſt be as large as the malady offence, otherwiſe
Chriſts ſalve were not equall to the ſore: but offences may ariſe as well between
divers Congregations in the ſame Church, as between divers members in the
ſame Congregation, and therefore particular Congregations as well as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
have hereby liberty to complain and appeal to a more generall Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for redreſſe. <hi>And a little after:</hi> That ſuch offences may ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Churches as well as members, appears by that between the Graecians and
Hebrews about the neglect of their widows, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1. and that in ſuch caſes
they may complain and implead each other, appears by that of the Prophet
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 2. even the daughter Church with the mother. <hi>pag. 10. To all
which we thus anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:112228:16"/>
Firſt, though we deny not but offences may ariſe betweene
Churches as well as members, yet we do not ſee that thoſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
alledged by you from <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. do ſufficiently prove
the ſame; becauſe thoſe Graecians and Hebrews, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. might be
all of one and the ſame Church and Congregation which was at
Jeruſalem, and not two Congregations or Churches, the Graecians
one and the Hebrews another, as it ſeems you do conceive of them.
For when the Apoſtles upon occaſion of this murmuring of the
Graecians for the neglect of their widows, did take courſe for the
appointing of Deacons for the remedying thereof, the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of the buſineſſe was tranſacted and done in one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
alone; for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>they called the multitude of Diſciples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
verſ. 2. they appointed them to look out ſeven men duely
qualified whom they might appoint over that buſineſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and
the ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, who thereupon did chuſe
ſeven whom they preſented unto the Apoſtles, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. and the
Apoſtles impoſed hands on them, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. In all this there is no
hint of two congregations, one of Graecians and another of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
but the Text ſeemeth plain enough, that the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Diſciples whether Graecians or Hebrews were all gathered
together into one Congregation about the choice and ordaining
of theſe Deacons.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Hoſ. 2. 2. Plead with your mother, plead,</hi> ſith there is no
mention in that Scripture of any daughter Church, nor of any two
Churches at all; and ſith at that time there was only one Church
upon the face of the earth, even the Nationall Church of the
Jewes, therefore we cannot ſee how this Text can be any proofe of
Churches complaining and impleading one another. If any man
think otherwiſe, and that the daughter-Churches did plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the mother-Church of Iſrael that is here ſpoken of, then we
would demand what or where was that ſuperiour Judicatory, be
it Synod or any other, before which they did plead, and before
whom the mother-Church of Iſrael muſt anſwer for herſelfe, when
the daughter-Churches did complain againſt her. We ſuppoſe
none will affirme there was any ſuch: and therefore this text can
be no ground for Churches impleading one another. But the true
meaning of the place is thus much, not that one Church muſt plead
againſt another, but that the godly members of the Church of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
muſt plead againſt the corruptions of that very Church,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112228:16"/>
though in reſpect of them ſhe were as a mother, and they as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And before whom muſt they plead? Not before any other
Judge upon earth, but before the Lord of heaven, and unto her
own face, laying open her abominations, and ſhewing unto her,
her ſins: And we acknowledge the members of any other Church
may doe the like, if there be the like occaſion, ſo that they keep
themſelves within the bounds of ſobriety, and their owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>But if it were granted (though theſe allegations doe not prove
it) that offences may ariſe between Congregations, how doth this
prove the thing in queſtion, viz. That Congregations muſt depend
upon the government of Synods? Yes, ſay you; <q>Becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
muſt be as large as the malady; and otherwiſe Chriſts
ſalve were not equall to the ſore.</q> But if this reaſon be ſufficient
againſt the Independency of Churches; then by the like reaſon a
man may prove, that the Church of a Nation muſt not be Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
neither: For as you alledge, that offences may ariſe as well
between divers congregations, as between divers members in the
ſame congregation; ſo a man may alledge, that offences may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
between divers Nationall Churches. And as you demand,
<hi>What if a brother offend not a particular brother, but the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation?
What if ten brethren offend the whole, or part; ſhall we think
the offence falls not within our Saviours remedy?</hi> So in like ſort a man
may demand, What if the Congregation offend not a particular
Congregation, but the whole Church of a Nation? What if ten,
twenty, fourty congregations, offend the whole Nation, or part?
Yea, we may adde, What if the Nationall Church offend the
Church of another Nation? Would you now ſay, that all theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
muſt fal within our <hi>Saviours</hi> rule of <hi>telling the Church;</hi> and that
this were a ſufficient reaſon againſt the independencie of Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Churches and Nationall Synods? We ſuppoſe you would not
ſay ſo: And yet we doe not ſee how it can be avoided by your
reaſon and ground, ſith that ground is appliable to the one caſe as
well as to the other. If the reaſon doe overthrow the Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of particular Congregations, then of a Nationall Church alſo.
If not of a Nationall Church, then how doth it make any more
againſt the other? Of neceſſity for ought wee can diſcern, you
muſt owne the reaſon as ſtrong in both caſes, or elſe refuſe it as
weak in both. Yea, and further, by the like reaſon a man might
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112228:17"/>
prove that Indians and Turkes muſt be complained of unto the
Church, and that the offences of them, or of other Heathen, muſt
fall within the compaſſe of our Saviours remedy. For as offences
may ariſe between members and members, between Churches and
Churches: ſo it is apparent that offences may ariſe between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and Pagans; and if this ground that you lay be ſound, that
the <hi>remedy complaint, or oppeale muſt be as large as the malady offence:</hi> and
conſequently there muſt be a Church above Congregations; then
if an Indian or other Pagan ſhall commit an offence, the remedy
muſt be to complain of the Indian to the Church. And ſith (as you
ſay, pag. 11.) <hi>There muſt be power of judgement to redreſſe there where the
complaint is to be made;</hi> would it not thence follow, that there muſt
be power of judgement in the Church to redreſſe the offences of
Indians? Which were directly contrary to the plain words of the
Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 12. What have I to doe to judge them that are without?</hi>
But this inconvenience of the Churches judging them that are
without, doth unavoidably follow upon this which you lay as a
ground againſt the independencie of Congregations, viz. that
where an offence may be committed, there Chriſts rule, <hi>Tell the
Church,</hi> may be applied for redreſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay then? If Indians and other Heathens, if
Congregationall and Nationall Churches of Chriſtians, be not
under the power of that rule of Chriſt, ſhall we ſay then there is
no ſalve for all their ſores, but ſo many ſinners muſt be left law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and their offences remedileſſe? God forbid! The Lord hath
provided good ſtore of help for all theſe: but every ſalve is not for
every ſore. Such perſons as are in the Church, all they are ſubject
to the diſcipline of the Church, and to the power of Chriſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
therein, ſo that if need ſo require, they may be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
and caſt out. Whole Churches are ſubject to the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
advice and counſell of other Churches; and ſo farre as the
ſame ſhall be according to God, they ought to hearken thereunto:
And if they doe not, they may lawfully be renounced by other
Churches, from all Church-communion with them. And as for
Indians, or others, that are no Churches, nor members of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
though our Saviours Rule of Telling the Church, was not
intended for them, yet both they and Chriſtian Churches like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and the members of them, are all of them to be ſubject to the
Magiſtrates, and the authority of the higher Powers, whoſe duty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112228:17"/>
it is to be keepers of both Tables of the Law of God, and to do
their endeavour that all the Subjects may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
life in all godlineſſe and honeſtie. <hi>Rom. 13. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>But, ſay you, an offence may be ſo generall as to defile and make guilty a
whole Land, and why not then the remedie as large as it, Tell the Church?
<hi>pag.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In ſuch caſe of generall and nationall defilements, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
is generall and Nationall repentance, whereto all the people
muſt be provoked, and exhorted by the Miniſters of the Word in
their ſeverall Congregations. And when the higher powers do
give example thereof in their own perſons, and by ſome act of their
Authoritie do call upon all the people for the ſame, this is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
remedie, through the mercy of God, againſt the defilement of
Nationall ſins, and the danger that may come thereby. Which as
it was the practiſe of <hi>Aſa, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and the States of <hi>Judah</hi>
in their times, ſo we have cauſe with all humble thankfulneſſe to
bleſſe the Lord that put the like care into the hearts of the <hi>Lords</hi>
and <hi>Commons</hi> aſſembled in Parliament in our deare native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
who by an Ordinance of both Houſes thought it meet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
all the Subjects of England and Wales to the duty of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
both for perſonall and Nationall ſins.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate be an Enemy to Religion, and the Land or
whole Church therein have occaſion to make a ſolemne renewall of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, ſhall not this whole Church or number in their collective body
have power to enjoyn it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the ſupreame Magiſtrate be an enemie to Religion, it is
not like but moſt or many of the people will be of the ſame mind;
<hi>Regis ad exemplum totus</hi>—as it is at this day in France and
Spaine, and was in England in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and other
Popiſh Princes; and then the beleevers in the Land will not be ſo
many as to bear the name of the Land or Nation, but of a ſmall
part thereof, and ſo at that time it will not be required of them
to make any Nationall Covenant, or to enjoyn the ſame. Nor can
it well be conceived how they ſhould aſſemble in a Nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
for that or any other purpoſe, when the Magiſtrate is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
enemie to their Religion. At ſuch times it is more like their
meetings in ſmall congregations will be full of danger, rather then
that they ſhould have libertie ſafely and freely to meet in ſuch
great Aſſemblies as Nationall Synods. And though for lack of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112228:18"/>
ſuch a Nationall Covenant, the remedie be not equall to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or need, yet at ſuch time that remedie being not in the power
of ſuch beleevers as are in the Land, it is not required at their
hands.</p>
               <p>If a whole Congregation, great or ſmall, play the Foxes, and ſpoil the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
why may it not be taken and reſtrained? <hi>pa.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt but it may, but ever in the way, and by the
means which Chriſt hath appointed. If thoſe Foxes be particular
members of the Church, they may be reſtrained by doctrine, by
diſcipline, and by the Magiſtrates Authoritie. If they be whole
Churches, they may be reſtrained by Doctrine, and by the adviſe
and counſell of other Churches, and alſo by the Magiſtrates. But
if they be not members of the Church, they can not be reſtrained
by Church diſcipline, but onely by the Authoritie of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and by the preaching of the Word.</p>
               <p>To this Argument the Independent party reply or rather labour to obtain
out of the Text three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that our Saviour ſpeaks here of a ſingle Church or Congregation—
Secondly, to this ſingle Church, and to all this Church entirely, not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
between Elders and Members, he gives the keyes of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Abſolution—Thirdly, over this Church to aſſume a Church power
of Judicature is a Lording it over Chriſts heritage—</p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe exceptions we anſwer, that it no way appears that our
Saviour in this place or that, the Scripture elſewhere, uſually means a ſingle
congregation by the word <hi>Church,</hi> but that the contrary rather is eaſily
evincible.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he here ſpake in reference to the Jewiſh Church, which way no
ſingle congregation hath above ſufficiently appeared. <hi>pag.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But how in reference? If you mean in this ſence, that what
ever was uſed in that Church muſt be uſed in the Chriſtian, or that
as that Church was Nationall, ſo Chriſtian Churches muſt be the
like, then we may ſay, no ſuch things hath appeared at all, nor
hath been ſo much as undertaken to be proved. If you mean onely
thus, that there were ſuch graduall proceedings in that Church as
Chriſt in this place requireth, or that the word <hi>Church</hi> may ſignifie
the Elders or Rulers, then we may ſay neither of theſe have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
appeared by any proof that you have brought; and if they
were both granted, they are nothing to the matter now in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>viz.</hi> that the word <hi>Church</hi> doth not ſignifie one ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112228:18"/>
for both theſe particulars may be found and made uſe of
in ſuch a Church as is of no larger extent.</p>
               <p>Next, that he hath reference herein to that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 15. appears by his
citation of the very words of that text, that in the mouth of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
every word may be eſtabliſhed: Now there the witneſſes and offenders
were by way of further Appeal to ſtand before the Lord, before the Prieſts for
judgement, <hi>verſ. 17. pag.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words are not as you cite them, <hi>before the Prieſts for
judgement;</hi> but before the Prieſts and Judges which ſhall be in thoſe
dayes. And it appeareth by the puniſhment which theſe Judges
muſt inflict upon the guiltie perſon there ſpoken of, life for life,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 21. that if our Saviour refer his
Church to do like unto that Judicatory which you ſay he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto, then the Church muſt have power to inflict corporall
puniſhment, even to the taking away of life it ſelf, becauſe that
Judicatory had ſuch power.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, no other place can be ſhewed, where our Saviour uſed the word
<hi>Church</hi> for a ſingle congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Nor can any other place be ſhewed where he uſed the word
<hi>Church</hi> for a Synod, nor that he ever uſed the word at all, but onely
here, and in <hi>Matth. 16. Vpon this rock will I build my Church:</hi> in which
place he means a Synod no more then a ſingle congregation.</p>
               <p>But for the Scripture language, nothing is more manifeſt, then as it never
any where uſeth the word <hi>Church</hi> for a ſingle congregation, unleſſe happily
in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.—ſo nothing is more frequent therein then to call many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in a Province or City, by the name of a Church. <hi>pag.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are willing to conſider of both theſe particulars; and
firſt of the former, wherein you do acknowledge (though a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
or happily) that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken for a
ſingle congregation: but you may acknowledge it undoubtedly,
and without any perhaps at all, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. of that
Chapter, that the whole Church cometh together in one place.
And in other verſes of the ſame Chapter he ſpeaks, how he that
prophecieth edifieth the Church, how interpreting is that the
Church may receive edifying, how it is a ſhame for women to
ſpeak in the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 35. Yea in <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27, 28. he gives
them this direction, that when they come together, and every one
hath a Pſalme, a Doctrine, &amp;c. that he that ſpeaks in a ſtrange
tongue, if there be no Interpreter, muſt keep ſilence in the Church.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112228:19"/>
By all which he plainly ſheweth, that the name <hi>Church</hi> is given to
the company that did aſſemble and come together, for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of ſpirituall duties, and for the exerciſe of ſpirituall gifts.
Now a company coming together is a congregation, and therefore
the name of Church is here given to a congregation. But beſides
this Chapter, there are many other places where the word <hi>Church</hi>
is alſo uſed in the ſame ſence: for inſtance, take theſe amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
<hi>Act.</hi> 14. 27. and 11. 26. and 15. 4, 22, 30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18, 20, 22, 33.
3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. in which places there is mention of aſſembling with the
Church, of gathering the Church together, of being received by
the Church, of bearing witneſſe before the Church, of coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Church, of coming together into one place, of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the multitude together, and the like. Which places do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſhew, that a company that are gathered together into one
place (which is nothing elſe but a congregation) are called by the
name of a Church. And the Chriſtians of Cenchrea which was but
a little village, and therefore not like to be many congregations,
yet they are ſtiled by the name of a Church. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1. And though
Cenchrea were but the port of Corinth, and not farre from it, like
Radcliffe or Lymehouſe to London, as ſome have obſerved, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a congregation of it ſelf, it is a diſtinct Church of it ſelf, as well
as Corinth was.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſaid to make it manifeſt, that a ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
is called by the name of a Church in many places of
Scripture; and how then can that ſtand which is here affirmed by
you, that the word is never ſo uſed, unleſſe happily in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and
that nothing is more manifeſt.</p>
               <p>But whereas you ſay, <hi>That nothing is more frequent then to call many
congregations in a Province or Citie, by the name of a Church;</hi> we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay, that this is ſo far from being ſo frequent, as nothing more,
that on the contrary it is very queſtionable, whether it be ever ſo
uſed at all in all the New Teſtament: Sure it is more frequent to
call many Congregations in a Province or Nation, by the name
of Churches in the plural number, and not by the name of Church
in the ſingular; which doth ſtrongly imply, that if they be many
congregations, then they are not one Church, but many. For this
purpoſe it is to be conſidered, how the Scripture mentions not the
Church, but the Churches of Galatia, Gal. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 16. 1. of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,
2 Cor. 8. 1. of Judea, 1 Theſſ. 2. 14. Gal. 1. 21. of Galilee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112228:19"/>
and of Samaria, Acts 9. 31. of Syria and Cilitia, Acts 15. 41. and
of Aſia, 1 Cor. 16. 19. In which one Province there were ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Churches at once, mentioned Revel. 1. 4. beſides others that
are mentioned elſe-where. Now as all theſe inſtances doe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhew, that ſomething is more frequent in Scripture, then to
call many Congregations by the name of a Church, ſo it is worth
our conſideration, what ſhould be the reaſon of this diffrent ſpeech
in Scripture, that when it ſpeaks of the Chriſtians of one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
it ſhould frequently give them the name of a Church, as
we heard before; and when it ſpeakes of the Chriſtians in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
or Countrey, where were many congregations, it ſhould call
them ſo uſually by the name of Churches in the plurall number.
Sure it ſeemes to us to be ſtrongly implyed thereby, that one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Chriſtians may be a Church; but if they be many
Congregations, then they are many Churches, and not one
onely.</p>
               <p>But you will give foure inſtances, where the name of a Church is given to
many congregations, Jeruſalem, Rome, Corinth, and Epheſus. And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Jeruſalem, the number of Diſciples that were there, being 8120, Acts 1.
15. with 2. 41. and 4. 4. and afterward abundantly larger, it was impoſſible
all the members ſhould meet but by way of diſtribution into ſeverall congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.
<hi>pag.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How large ſoever that Church was in thoſe places you
alledge, yet if the Scripture ſay they did meet together in one
place, then we muſt beleeve it was poſſible for them ſo to doe; and
that as they were but one Church, ſo they were but one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
Now the text is plain, firſt of all, that when they were but
120. they all met together in one place; for otherwiſe how could
<hi>Peter</hi> ſtand up in the midſt of them, and make a ſpeech to them all,
about the election of another Apoſtle in the room of <hi>Iudas,</hi> as he is
recorded to have done, Acts 115. Next of all, when 3000 were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them, Acts 2. yet all that multitude before they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
did all come together in one place, verſ. 6. and <hi>Peter ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, lift up his voyce and ſpake unto them all,</hi> verſ. 14. And when they
were converted, both they and the reſt of the beleevers were not yet
ſo many, but the multitude of them were all together, verſ. 44. and
continued daily with one accord in the Temple, verſ. 46. And when
after this, (the Lord adding daily to the Church ſuch as ſhould be
ſaved) the number of the men was about 5000. Acts 4. 4. yet all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112228:20"/>
this company did ſtil meet together in one place: for it is ſaid, that
when the Apoſtles were diſmiſſed from the Councill with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
they went unto their own company and reported what the
chiefe Prieſts and Elders had ſaid unto them, verſ. 23. And when
they heard that, they lifted up their voyce in prayer to God with
one accord, verſ. 24. And when they had prayed, the place was
ſhaken where they were aſſembled together, verſ. 31. By which it
is plain, that all this company, whether they were in all 5000. or
(if you will have it ſo) 5000. beſides the former number, and ſo in
all 8120. yet ſtill they were all aſſembled in one place.</p>
               <p>And when after this, beleevers were more added to the Lord,
multitudes both of men and women, Acts 5. 14. yet all that time
they were all with one accord in <hi>Salomons</hi> Porch, verſ. 12. which
ſhewes they were not yet ſo many, but all did meet together in one
Congregation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, when after this, the number of Diſciples in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
was more multiplied, Acts 6. 1. yet the Apoſtle called the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of them together, to propoſe unto them the choyce of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
verſ. 2. and the matter being commended to them by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
it is ſaid, the ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, and they
choſe ſeven who are there named, verſ. 5. which ſhewes that the
whole multitude was not ſo many, but they might aſſemble and
come together in one place, to heare matters propoſed, and to
make election of Officers.</p>
               <p>After this indeed, this Church at Jeruſalem were all ſcattered by
perſecution, except the Apoſtles, Acts 8. 1. But when a Church
was gathered again by the Apoſtles Miniſtery, that Church, even
all the multitude of them, as well as the Apoſtles and Elders, did
all aſſemble and meet together with one accord in one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
about the buſineſſe of the controverſie that aroſe at Antioch;
ſo it is plainly ſaid, Acts 15. That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> comming
from Antioch, were received of the Church at Jeruſalem, and of
the Apoſtles and Elders, verſ. 4. And it pleaſed the Apoſtles and
Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend meſſengers to Antioch,
verſ. 22. and to that Church letters are written from the Apoſtles
and Elders, and Brethren, verſ. 23. being all aſſembled with one
accord, verſe 25. which plainly ſhewes that the Church at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
at this time, did not conſiſt of Apoſtles and Elders alone, as a
repreſentative Church, but of others alſo, who are expreſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112228:20"/>
from thoſe officers: and yet all this Church did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with one accord in one place. Laſtly, for that place, 21. where
you ſay;</p>
               <p>It is plain, that when the Church met collectively, it was in the Presbyters
and Elders. And that in this Church at Jeruſalem the collective meetings were
repreſentative in their Elders.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, That wee deny not but Elders may meet apart
from the multitude if there be occaſion, and ſo much may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from verſe 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>Paul</hi> went in unto <hi>James,</hi> and all
the Elders were preſent; but this is nothing to the point in hand,
That the Church at Jeruſalem was ſo numerous, that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
could not meet in one, but in ſeverall congregations: Nay,
that very place (though it ſpeak of many thouſand Jewes that did
beleeve, verſe 20.) yet as it doth not ſay, that all theſe were of
that one Church at Jeruſalem; ſo there are good Divines that doe
think they were not: but if they were, it nothing prejudiceth our
cauſe in this matter; for when <hi>James</hi> and the Elders ſpeaking to
<hi>Paul</hi> of the Jewes, doe tell him, the multitude muſt needs come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for they will heare that thou art come, verſe 22. It appeares
thereby, that their multitude was not ſuch, but they might all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
and come together.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, How can theſe things be, that ſo many thouſands
as were members of the Church at Jeruſalem, ſhould all yet be but
one Congregation, beſides what hath been ſaid to ſhew that thus
it was; ſuch an one may conſider further, that many thouſands,
yea Miriads, were gathered together, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 12. and Chriſt ſpake
unto them all, though unto his Diſciples firſt, verſe 1, 14, 15, 54. and
that Pariſhes in England in or about London, and elſe-where, as
<hi>Stepney, Giles, Sepulchres,</hi> and others, have many thouſand inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
in them, all members of one Pariſhionall Church, and yet all
but one Congregation. And that of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. who
as Mr. <hi>Bayn</hi> reports, <hi>Dioe. Triall, pag.</hi> 16. did eſteem the company
that heard his voice in one congregation, to be about 5000. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and that by means of Scaffolds and Galleries, a man lifting
up his voyce, may ſo ſpeak, as to be heard of thouſands at a time.</p>
               <p>All which being conſidered, doe make it leſſe incredible, that
the Church at Jeruſalem, conſiſting of ſuch a great multitude,
yet for all that might bee no more but one ordinarie Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:112228:21"/>
Next, for the Church at Rome in the Apoſtles time, ſtiled every where in that
Epiſtle, by the name of Church, not Churches. pag. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſuppoſe it is a plain miſtake, that the Church at
Rome is every where in that Epiſtle ſtiled by the name of a <hi>Church.</hi>
For ought we remember in that Epiſtle, it is never ſo ſtiled at all;
and yet we deny not but it was a Church, and one Church.</p>
               <p>But (ſay you) can it be thought that the faith and obedience of a Church
in ſuch a citie, could be famous throughout all the world, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. &amp; 16. 19. and yet but one ſingle independent congregation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know nothing to the contrary but it might be ſo:
For the Church at Theſſalonica was but one congregation, and
yet from them ſounded out the word of the Lord, not only in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia
and Achaia, but alſo in every place, their faith to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
was ſpread abroad, 1 Theſſ. 1. 8. And there might be other
means to make their faith famous, as well as plurality of congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;
as the reſort and confluence of people of all ſorts and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the place where this Church dwelt, Rome being the Seat
of the Empire, and the Lady of Kingdomes at that time: Alſo the
good will of the godly, the malice of the wicked, the newfangled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of moſt, would open the mouthes of many to talke of the
faith and profeſſion of the Chriſtian Romans, though they were no
more but one congregation.</p>
               <p>Thoſe very perſons and families named in the Apoſtles ſalutations of
that Church, even thoſe choycer families were able to fill ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We dare not ſay ſo: for there is not named above 30. in
all. Sure if 30. families fill ſeverall congregations, then thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
muſt be very ſmall ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that in his time the citie was at leaſt halfe <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:</hi>
And <hi>Cornelius</hi> tells us, that beſides himſelfe, there were in that
Church 45. Presbyters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the queſtion being, whether many Congregations be
frequently called in Scripture by the name of a Church, theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
being not from Scripture doe not ſuit the queſtion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we will not inſiſt upon them, but onely ſay this much; that as
they are both alledged by Doctor <hi>Downam,</hi> and them of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy
that plead for Dioceſan Churches againſt Congregational,
ſo they are both ſufficiently anſwered by Mr. <hi>Bain,</hi> in his <hi>Dioceſan
triall,</hi> p. 19, 20. and by the refuter of D. <hi>Downams</hi> Sermon at Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.
p. 65.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:112228:21"/>
Next, the Church at Corinth every where ſtiled a Church, not Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we grant: But why might it not be one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as one Church; The onely reaſon you bring to the
contrary is, becauſe <hi>They had ſo many Inſtructers,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>and Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
1 Cor. 3. 12. <hi>So many Prophets (ſay you) and Teachers, ſpeakers with
Tongues,—could not queſtionleſſe have their ordinary locall meetings, but
by way of diſtribution into ſeverall congregations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This arguing about the Church of Corinth, doth not
very well agree with that which went before, p. 12. where you ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to grant, that though no other place in Scripture, yet that
place, 1 Corinth. 14. doth give the name of Church to one ſingle
Congregation; whereas now you give Corinth alſo as one inſtance
where many congregations are called a Church. It is ſtrange to
us, how Corinth ſhould be an example of both theſe, viz. of the
name of Church given to one ſingle congregation, as you doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
pag. 12. and of many congregations called by the
name of one Church, as now you would have it. But the place,
1. Cor. 14. 23. that ſpeakes of the whole Church commiug together
into one place, doth unavoidably prove (for ought we can diſcern)
that Corinth had their meetings, and not by way of diſtribution
into ſeverall Congregations, but altogether in one congregation:
and doth alſo anſwer your reaſon drawn from the variety of Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Prophets in that Church: For it is plain from that very
Chapter, that the Church of Corinth had many Prophets; <hi>Let the
Prophets ſpeake two or three, and let the reſt judge,</hi> verſ. 39. and many
that ſpake with Tongues, who muſt ſpeake by courſe two or three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and one interpret, verſe 27. yea every one generally had a Pſalme,
or a Doctrine, or a Revelation, or an Interpretation, verſe 26. as
indeed they came behind in no gift, 1 Cor. 1. &amp; yet for all their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of gifts, and gifted men, Prophets, Interpreters, ſpeakers with
Tongues, and the like, both they and the whole Church alſo,
even women and all, uſed to come together into one place.</p>
               <p>But it is with much inſtance urged generally by all the Separatiſts, that
thoſe among whom the Corinthian fornicatou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was—they were all to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, and all to deliver him to Satan; therefore the power of the
keye is alike in all the members,—and not in the Elders alone. <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This and all that follows for two whole pages may be
ſomething pertaining to the ſecond of your three exceptions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112228:22"/>
but nothing concerns the Queſtion now in hand. For
whether the Church of Corinth, that muſt excommunicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
man, were the Elders alone, as you hold; or all the people
alſo, as others: This is nothing to the preſent point of the ſence of
the word <hi>Church,</hi> which is, whether is be taken in Scripture, for
many Congregations or one onely: and therefore we marvell why
you would here bring it in. Neither indeed is it any thing to the
maine Queſtion, of the Dependencie of Congregations upon the
government of Synods; For if all were granted, that here is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church that muſt excommunicate the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Corinthian was not the common people, but the Elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
yet the authoritie of Synods is not a whit holpen thereby;
unleſſe it could be proved that the Church of Corinth had no El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their own; which we are perſwaded you will not affirm,
becauſe you grant pag. 13. that they had many Inſtructors, many
builders, many leaders, many Prophets and Teachers. Wherefore
this Diſpute being beſides the Queſtion, we will not ſpend time in
anſwering of it, becauſe we would haſten to go forward with the
reſt, that pertains to the Queſtion, as you have ſtated it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your laſt inſtance of many Congregations, called by the name
of</hi> Church, <hi>is Epheſus, where you argue,</hi> There muſt needs be many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
becauſe there was a great doore, and effectuall opened unto <hi>Paul,</hi>
ſo mightily there grew the Word of God and prevailed, the greatneſſe of the
price of the conjuring books burnt publickly, and God himſelf teſtifies, he had
many people in that Citie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the Lord ſaith to <hi>Paul, I have much people in the City,</hi>
it is a plain miſtake to underſtand this of Epheſus, for it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Corinth, and not of Epheſus. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 10. But if it had been
ſpoken of Epheſus, as we deny not, but that there were many
Chriſtians there, how doth this prove the point, that they were
not one Congregation, but many? We do not think they were
more in number, then in Corinth and Jeruſalem, where the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
as we have ſhewed, did uſually meet in one place; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at Epheſus, they might do the like, though there were a great
number of Chriſtians there.</p>
               <p>As for that which you ſay, that as this Church could not poſſibly ordinarily
in all its members meet but diſtributively; ſo that it did meet collectively in
its Presbytery and Elderſhip; that which ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> (there by the
Apoſtles own teſtimony) appears in the 17. 28. and 26. verſes of the 20.
Chapter, beyond all exception.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:112228:22"/>
We anſwer thereto, it is not beyond all exception, that at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
was one Church conſiſting of many Congregations, which is
our Queſtion. It may be granted that the Elders of that Church
upon <hi>Paul's</hi> ſending for them did meet at Miletum apart from the
people, as was noted before out of <hi>Act.</hi> 21. Of the Elders of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;
but this is nothing to our Queſtion, whether a Church be
many Congregations, or one onely.</p>
               <p>As much might he ſaid of the other of the ſeven Churches of Aſia, with
that at Antioch, Philippi and Theſſalonica.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And if as much were ſaid of theſe as of the other, as much
might alſo be anſwered. And though Philippi and Theſſalonica
had many Biſhops, Deacons, Overſeers, yet all this is too ſhort to
prove they were many Congregations; for what ſhould hinder but
one Congregation may have many Officers?</p>
               <p>That which followeth in this ſixteenth page, and ſo forward to
the middle of pag. 19. is ſpent in anſwering the other two excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which you formerly propoſed pag. 11. Concerning which
we need not to ſpend much time; the one of them, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is altogether beſides the purpoſe, and on which ſide ſoever
the truth doth lie in that matter, the preſent Queſtion is nothing
at all cleared thereby; and for the other, we leave it to them that
make it to undertake the defence of it. For us it is ſufficient to
have ſhewed that all that you have ſaid from <hi>Matth. 18. Tell the
Church,</hi> doth not prove that Congregations muſt depend upon the
government of Synods, nor that many Congregations are in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
uſually called by the name of a Church; and this being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie

Here's all that goes to the making up of a compleat Synod, Firſt, here's the
occaſion—Secondly, here's a deſignation both of the Commiſſioners and
place,—Thirdly, here's the matter of a Synod,—Fourthly, here's the
form of a Synod,—Fifthly, here's the end of a Synod,—Laſtly, here's the
proper effect of a Synod,—<hi>pag.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>If all this were granted, yet the thing in difference, as your ſelf
have ſtated the Queſtion, in pa. 2, 3, 4. of your book, is not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereby. For all this that is here ſaid, goeth no further, but
onely to ſhew that there ought to be Synods; whereas the queſtion
is about the power of Synods, and how far the ſame doth reach,
whether ſo far as that a Synod onely (and not a particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation)
ought to ordain officers, and excommunicate offenders:
and between theſe two is a wide difference; ſo that many a man
may acknowledge the former, which is all that is here concluded,
and yet not acknowledge the latter, which is the maine point,
which ſhould have been cleared. For our parts we deny not but
there ought to be Synods, and your Argument concludes no more:
yea your ſelf do teſtifie, pag. 2. that thoſe whom you deal againſt,
do acknowledge as much in effect as here by you is concluded; for
there you ſay that they acknowledge, that neighbour Churches
may meet, conſult and adviſe, &amp;c. and if they acknowledge all
this, then they acknowledge a uſe of Synods, becauſe theſe things
we ſuppoſe, cannot be done by many Churches at once, unleſſe it
be by their meſſengers, and Deputies aſſembled together, which
Aſſembly is no other then a Synod. Wherefore ſith no more is here
concluded, then is by the Independents parties (as you call them)
acknowledged, we need not inſiſt long, in giving anſwer to this
Argument. We will therefore onely briefly mention ſome grounds,
that incline us to think that this Aſſembly in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. was a Synod,
and then give ſome annotations upon ſome few paſſages in your
Diſcourſe about this place, and ſo proceed to the next Argument.
Touching the former, when we ſay this meeting in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. was a
Synod, we mean at leaſt ſuch an one as Mr. <hi>Parker Pol. Eccl. lib. 2. c.
23. Sect.</hi> 1. underſtands it to be, <hi>viz.</hi> a conſociation or combination
of more Churches then one, even of two at leaſt. Or as Doctor
<hi>Whitakar</hi> who counts it neither a generall Councill, nor yet a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
or Provinciall, but a particular Councill, as he cals it, leſſe
then either of the other. <hi>de Concil. Q. 1. c.</hi> 2. And that matters were
carried in it, in way of an ordinarie Synod, may appear by two
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:112228:23"/>
things. 1 The perſons imployed in it, which were not onely the
Apoſtles, thoſe extraordinarie Officers, but alſo the ordinarie El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and brethren of Jeruſalem. <hi>Ver.</hi> 6, 22, 23. And beſides <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> certain others that were ſent with them from Antioch,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. Secondly, the meanes uſed for clearing the controverſie, then
in hand, was not the Apoſtolicall Authoritie, nor any extra ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
revelation, vouchſafed to the Apoſtles and ſuch extra ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
perſons: there is not a word mentioned of any ſuch thing;
but the means they uſed, was the ſame, that is common to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Synods, <hi>viz.</hi> much diſputation, <hi>v. 7. Peter's</hi> experience of
Gods bleſſing upon his Miniſterie, to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his companie,
<hi>v.</hi> 7. And the like is done by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for their part, <hi>ver.</hi>
12. And as for <hi>James,</hi> he alledgeth the teſtimonie of the Prophet
<hi>Amos, v.</hi> 15, 16. and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> read and preached in the
Synagogues, everie Sabbath day, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Now all theſe means being
no other, but ſuch as may be uſed, in ordinarie Synods, therefore
we ſee no other, but this meeting might be ſuch an one.</p>
               <p>Here is a deſignation (ſay you) of the Commiſſioners and place. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But theſe Commiſſioners, and this place, were deſigned
onely by them of Antioch, <hi>v.</hi> 2. which ſhews that this meeting,
was not of any more, but two Churches, Antioch and Jeruſalem:
For if there had been more, how came it to paſſe, that onely they
of Antioch determine the place? Reaſon would have required, that
if there had been others, they alſo ſhould have had a voice in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the place of meeting.</p>
               <p>Here is the matter of a Synod, not onely Apoſtles but Elders, and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Churches. <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True: but theſe Churches are not mentioned, to be any
other, but onely Antioch and Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>Both thus meeting, to determine ſo great a matter, conſequently all matter
of juriſdiction, is not confined to one ſingle Congregation. <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The matter determined, was a matter of doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
whether Circumciſion was neceſſarie to ſalvation: <hi>v.</hi> 1. and there
fore no matter of juriſdiction, unleſſe juriſdiction, and Doctrine be
the ſame. And though they that taught this Doctrine, (if they
perfiſted pertinaciouſly therein,) deſerved to be cenſured, as you
do truly alledge, from <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. Reject an heretick, the diſpencing
of which cenſure, is a matter of juriſdiction. Yet (for ought that
doth appear to the contrary) both theſe Churches might concur,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112228:24"/>
to clear up the doctrine, and yet one onely, even that congregation
(whereof the offenders were properly members) might diſpence
the cenſure, that was due for their pertinacious defence of ſuch
Doctrine. The concurrence of both, to clear up the Doctrine, doth
argue want of light in the one; but nevertheleſſe there might be
entireneſſe, of juriſdiction in each.</p>
               <p>But if Churches had then been independent, Antioch had undertaken and
been able her ſelfe ſufficiently, and finally to have judged the cauſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Antioch did undertake to have ended the matter among
themſelves, and ſpent much time about it, before there was any
ſpeech of ſeeking out for help elſewhere, as appears, verſ. 2. and this
doth ſufficiently declare it, that they were not neceſſarily depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
upon any other Church, or Churches, but had right to have
ended the matter within themſelves, if ability had ſerved thereto,
or elſe this undertaking of theirs had been ſinfull, as being an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to doe that whereto they had no right. And though by
reaſon of much diſſention among themſelves, they were forced to
ſeek for help for ending the cauſe, this may argue want of ability
and light, but argues not any want at all of authority or right: In
which reſpect they might be independent, notwithſtanding their
imperfection in the other regard. Suppoſe a father of children, or
maſter of a family, through want of wiſdome, or courage, be not
able to rule his own children, and houſhold, as <hi>Eli,</hi> or ſuppoſe a
King that is a child, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaks, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.) or Princes that
are babes, (as the Prophet termeth them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.) be not able to
govern their own ſubjects, as <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> 2 King. 12. would you think
this want of ſufficient ability, a ſufficient argument to prove, that
ſuch a Father or Maſter, had no authority or right to rule his own
children, or houſhold; nor ſuch a Prince any right to rule his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
but that the families of the one muſt depend upon other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
and the common-wealth of the other upon other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths?
We ſuppoſe you would not ſay ſo? And yet you
may as well ſay it, as ſay as here you doe, that if Churches had
been independent, Antioch had been able her ſelfe ſufficiently to
have ended the cauſe. Antioch finding her ſelfe not able, may ſend
to Jerulem for help; and yet this ſending neither proves right of
juriſdiction in them of Jeruſalem, who are ſent unto, nor want of
juriſdiction in them of Antioch, who ſo doe ſend. Yes, ſay you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:112228:24"/>
An obliging the Churches by decrees, laid on them, as a burden, is a uſe of
the keyes, in which uſe of them, Epheſus is commended, Pergamus and Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyra
reproved, <hi>pag.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if this be a uſe of the Keyes, may it not be of the Key
of Doctrine, as well as the Key of Diſcipline, ſith the burdens laid
on them, were not burdens of penalty, but burdens of duty; not
puniſhments to be ſuffered for offence given; but rules of practice
to be obſerved, leſt offence ſhould be taken; as is plaine, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
be conſidered, pag. 29. And therefore it ſeems the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
theſe burdens, was not ſo properly an act of juriſdiction, and
diſcipline, as an act of Doctrine. As for Epheſus, the uſe of the
Keyes (for which they are commended) is not (as you affirme) for
impoſing decrees as burdens upon one another; nor is Pergamus or
Thyatyra reproved, for neglect of ſo doing, but trying and detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
counterfeit Apoſtles, which was a matter of doctrine, and not
bearing with them that were evil, which was matter of diſcipline,
are the things for which Epheſus is commended; and ſuffring them
which were evill (which was a neglect of Diſcipline) is that for
which the other are reproved, Rev. 2. 2. 14. 20. But neither is the one
commended for impoſing decrees, nor the other reproved for negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
ſo to doe. But you will prove that the Synod had juriſdiction
and power of the Keyes of diſcipline; becauſe, ſay you,</p>
               <p>This Decree is it ſelf a Rule given, wherein and whereby to uſe the keyes,
upon ſuch as ſhall prove ſtubborn, in defending the contrary of what is here
decreed—, and that authority which can give the rule, can (<hi>a fortiori</hi>)
back and puniſh its breach. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But is this certain and clear, that whoever hath authority
by way of doctrine, to impoſe a rule, hath alſo authoritie, by way
of diſcipline, to puniſh its breach? we propoſe to conſideration,
theſe inſtances for the contrarie. Firſt of all the Prophets in Iſrael,
<hi>Iſaiah, Joel, Amos,</hi> and the reſt, had authoritie by way of doctrine,
(as being ſent of God for that purpoſe) to deliver the wil of God, as
a rule to be obſerved, not onely by all the Princes, and people, but
even by the Prieſts and Levits alſo; for ſo we read they many times
did, and yet not being Prieſts themſelves, nor Levites, they had not
authority to puniſh, by way of Diſcipline, ſuch as diſobeyed their
doctrine, and thoſe holy rules which they delivered from the
Lord.</p>
               <p>Nextly, any one Miniſter, who is truely ſent of God, may in his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112228:25"/>
doctrine, deliver the rules of Gods word, to the people he is ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and impoſe thoſe rules as burthens, and neceſſary things to be
obſerved; and yet one Miniſter alone cannot puniſh the breach of
thoſe rules, in a way of diſcipline, becauſe Church-diſcipline is to
be diſpenced by a Church, Matth. 18. 17. and one man alone (we
are perſwaded) you will not ſay, can be a Church.</p>
               <p>Further, any Miniſter or Miniſters of one Church (be it Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
or Nationall) may upon occaſion being deſired thereto,
preach the word of God in another the like Church, and ſo impoſe
burdens of Chriſtian duties to be obſerved by them, that they thus
occaſionally preach unto; yet it would not follow they might
by diſcipline puniſh ſuch as ſhould walke contrary to thoſe rules,
becauſe the power of juriſdiction which they have when they are
at home in their owne Church, doth not reach ſo farre as unto that
other Church where now they are called to preach the doctrine of
the word. Laſtly, there is no doubt but any Miniſter, or Miniſters
of the Goſpel (if occaſion ſerved thereunto) might by way of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
deliver rules of faith and obedience, unto Pagans, and ſuch
as are no members of any Chriſtian Church at all, and might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them in the name of the Lord, to obſerve thoſe rules; and
yet it would not therefore follow, that they might puniſh thoſe
Pagans in a way of diſcipline, for the breach of thoſe rules; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, <hi>What have I to doe to judge them that
are without?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. Yea, there are ſundry good Writers in
reformed Churches, who do hold, that Doctors in the Church have
authority by their office, to deliver ſound wholſome doctrine, from
the Scriptures, and yet may not meddle, with diſpenſation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
nor Diſcipline; See among others for this, <hi>Calvines Inſtit.
lib. 4. Ch. 3. Sect.</hi> 4. And if this be ſo, this may be another inſtance
for the ſame purpoſe as the reſt, and by all this, we ſuppoſe it is
clear, that ſome men may have authoritie, by way of doctrine, to
impoſe rules, that muſt be obſerved, as neceſſary things, and yet
not have authoritie, by way of diſcipline, to puniſh thoſe that
ſhall diſobey thoſe rules. And therefore though the firſt of theſe
were granted, to be within the power of a Synod, yet that they have
power to do the other alſo, is not proved thereby.</p>

               <head type="sub">Containing an Anſwer to your fourth Argument, taken from 1 Tim. 4. 14.
laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</head>
               <p>HEnce I argue thus. Such as are for independency, admit of no other rule
in Church-government, but the Scripture practiſe or inſtitution, but
where in all the Scripture, read we of any ordination, of Paſtors, but by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters?
—<hi>Timothy</hi> was ordained by the laying on of the hands of the
Presbytery: <hi>Titus</hi> was for this very cauſe, left at Creet that he ſhould ordain
Elders in every City. <hi>pag.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All that is here ſaid is onely about ordination of Officers,
which (at the moſt) is but one part of the Eccleſiaſticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or juriſdiction. And therefore if it were granted, that this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
belongeth onely to a Synod, yet the Queſtion (being not
of one part, but of the whole juriſdiction) is not concluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
Nevertheleſſe we are willing to conſider what is ſaid about
this particular, and therefore our Anſwer is diſtinctly thus. 1 That
if a Congregation have Elders of it own, then when other Officers
are to be ordained, in that Church, ſuch ordination is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
by the impoſition of the hands of thoſe Elders. This we
never denied, and a good deale of your proofs, do conclude no
more. For what if the Presbyterie at Epheſus, did lay hands upon
<hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and the Presbyterie, at Antioch upon <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2. which are two of your proofs? this may
evince, that in Churches furniſhed with a Presbyterie, (as Epheſus
and Antioch were) that that Presbyterie is to perform impoſition
of hands, which is nothing againſt us, neither do willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the ſame.</p>
               <p>But it may be in this Argument you intend a further matter,
<hi>viz.</hi> that ordination cannot be performed lawfully, by any, but
onely by Elders.</p>
               <p>For where (ſay you) in all the Scripture do we read of any ordination of
Paſtors but by Presbyters?</p>
               <p>Whereto we anſwer three things. 1 That we do read of ſuch a
matter in the Scripture. 2 That if we did not, yet we read ſo much
as b<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> good conſequence doth infer the lawfulneſſe of the practiſe.
3 That which we do read, that may ſeeme, to make againſt this
practiſe, is not becauſe the thing, is in every caſe, unlawfull, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112228:26"/>
for other reaſons. 1 For the firſt of theſe, we alledge <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 10.
which place ſheweth, that though the Levites were Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and the Children of Iſrael were none, yet the Children of
Iſrael did lay their hands upon the Levites; by which Scripture,
thus much is manifeſt, that when a Church hath no Elders, but the
firſt Elders themſelves are to be ordained, and this at ſuch times,
and in ſuch places, where Elders can not conveniently be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from any other Church, in ſuch caſe impoſition of hands may
lawfully be performed, by ſome principall men of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
although they be not Elders by office; for ſith it was ſo in the
Church of Iſrael as this text doth witneſſe, what ſhould hinder
but in the like caſe, the like may be lawfully done in theſe dayes?
If any ſhall ask how was it poſſible, that the Children of Iſrael,
being 600000 ſhould all lay hands upon the Levites at once? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
It is not like that all did it, but ſome inſtead of the reſt:
and ſo when ſome do impoſe hands, in ſtead of all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that may be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>If it ſhall be ſaid, theſe Children of Iſrael, might be Elders, and
ſo their example will be no warrant for impoſition of hands by
non-elders: The anſwer is, it is like they were Elders, as being the
chief and principall members, of the Congregation; but yet their
example proveth the point if two things be conſidered. Firſt, that
they did not this as a work peculiar to them as Elders. Secondly,
that they did it not for themſelves onely, but for all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
the former of which may be thus manifeſted; If they did
it as Elders, then either as Elders and Governours Eccleſiaſticall, or
as Civill governours but not the firſt, for that charge was onely
belonging to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. and theſe Levites now
ordained, If the ſecond be ſaid, then it will follow, that Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
though no Church officers, may impoſe hands in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Church officers, and ſo the point is gained. For if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
may do it, then it will follow that a Church wanting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
may perform this action by other the fitteſt Inſtruments
ſhe hath. For this is not a work properly tied to the Magiſtrates
office; becauſe then the Church in the Apoſtles time, wanting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
could not have had Officers; the contrary whereof is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in the Scripture, <hi>Act. 14. 23. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. Secondly, as theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael (ſuppoſe they were the chief Fathers of families) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
hands on the Levites, not as Elders and governours Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112228:26"/>
or Civill but as principall members of the Church, ſo
what was herein performed by them, was not done by themſelves
onely, but for all the Congregation. And this appears, firſt becauſe
theſe Levites now to be ordained by impoſition of hands, were
taken in ſtead of all the firſt-born of Iſrael, and not in ſtead of the
firſt born of Elders onely: <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 40, 41. Secondly, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Lord, as an offering of the Children of Iſrael, <hi>Numb.</hi>
8. 11. and not of the Elders onely; and inaſmuch as all offerings
were to be preſented at the doore of the Tabernacle, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of his hands whoſe the offering was, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 3. 4. it is
therfore evident, that they that impoſed hands on the Levites, did
it in the name of all the people, whoſe offering theſe Levites were.
Thirdly, it was uſuall, that when all the multitude brought an
oblation, the Elders put their hands on the head of the ſacrifice.
<hi>Levit. 4. 14, 15. viz.</hi> in ſtead of all the multitude, whoſe the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was. And thus you ſee, we read in Scriptures of the impoſition
of hands, performed by them that were no Elders, by office, and
ſo this demand of yours, where in Scripture do we read of ſuch a
practiſe, is anſwered. But if we did not read of any ſuch thing, yet
it may ſuffice (which was our ſecond particular to be proved) that
we do read ſo much as by good conſequence, inferreth the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the practiſe. And for this purpoſe, firſt, we propound <hi>Act.</hi>
1. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 14. where we read of the peoples electing, and
chuſing officers, of which places, more may be ſpoken afterward;
Now if the people may elect Officers, then in ſome caſes, they may
ordain them alſo, becauſe ordination is leſſe then election, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon it as a neceſſarie antecedent; by vertue whereof it is
juſtly adminiſtred. Yea it is not onely leſſe then election, but leſſe
in the ſame kind, being nothing elſe, but the accompliſhment of
election, or the admiſſion of a perſon into the poſſeſſion of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
whereto he had right before by election. And hence it follows
by good conſequence, that if a ſingle congregation, may elect offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which is the greater, they may alſo in ſome caſe ordain them,
which is the leſſer. For your ſelf do grant that to argue affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
from the greater, to the leſſer in the ſame kind is good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and ſuch is this; Which kind of arguing is alſo uſed by
Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> concerning this very particular.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we read, Heb. 6. 2. that impoſition of hands is amongſt
the principles of religion, and joyned by the Apoſtle with baptiſme,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:112228:27"/>
reſurrection, and the eternall judgement; and therefore an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of ordinary and perpetuall uſe, as all principles are, and ſo
not to be omitted in the ordination of Officers. And if ſo, it will
therefore follow, that in ſome caſe it may be performed by ſuch as
are not in office; becauſe the caſe may ſo be, that otherwiſe it
cannot be performed at all, ſo that either no Officers muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
nor any impoſition of hands uſed at all; or elſe impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hands in ſome caſe may be performed by them that are
not in office. Now that it cannot alwayes be performed by Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
three inſtances make it manifeſt: Firſt, when there are no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of any other Church to be had, as at the firſt riſe of the firſt
Chriſtian Church in a Pagan Countrey, far remote from all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as here in America by the Engliſh; &amp; in the caſe which you put
of a company of Chriſtians by ſhipwrack caſt upon an Iland where
no Paſtors were. Secondly, when thoſe that may be had, are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
corrupt, and the Churches to whom they do belong, that
it could not be convenient to make uſe of them, but very dangerous
to fetch ordination onely from them, as at the firſt reformation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the times of Popery, when there were none to be had, but from
the Popiſh Biſhops and Prieſts; from whom to receive ordination,
were as much as to ſay, either that the Miniſters of Antichriſt may
ordain Miniſters to the Church of Chriſt, or elſe that Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
are true Miniſters of Chriſt: And ſure if Chriſtians might
not have any Miniſters, unleſſe ordained by the Popiſh Biſhops, the
caſe were as pittifull as if ſheep might have no Shepheards, but
ſuch are appointed to them by the Wolves. Thirdly, when thoſe
that are more deſireable, have no ſufficient calling to diſpence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
in another Church which is the caſe when they are not
requeſted thereto; For ſith ordinary Elders are not like Apoſtles,
to feed all flocks, but that flock of God, which dependeth upon
them, 1 Pet. 5. 2. that flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made
them over-ſeers, Acts 20. 28. Therefore wee doe not underſtand,
how they can aſſume authority and power unto themſelves, to
ordain Elders to other Churches, whereof themſelves are neither
Elders nor members, unleſſe they had a calling thereto, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of that Church where the Elders are to be ordained. So that
by theſe inſtances it appeareth, that ſometimes officers of other
Churches are not to be had, ſometimes thoſe that may be had, are
as ill as none, and not to be depended on, or deſired; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112228:27"/>
thoſe that are more deſireable, have no ſufficient calling to
ordain Miniſters in any other Church; and therefore in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as theſe, ſith Officers muſt not be admitted without impoſition
of hands, impoſition of hands muſt be performed by non-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, we read in ſundry places, where impoſition of
hands, was performed by Elders, and not one place in all the
new Teſtament, where it was performed by others. Whereto we
anſwer, That all this is true, but nothing againſt what we have
ſaid; becauſe (which was our third particular to be cleared) the
true reaſon of this, that is here alledged, was not, as if ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by non-Elders were in every caſe unlawfull: But becauſe in thoſe
times Elders were not wanting; for there were the Apoſtles and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicke
men, who were Elders in all Churches. And we do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
grant, that where a Church is furniſhed with Elders, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands is to be performed by the Elders, and ſo much the
examples in the New Teſtament doe evince. But we have alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. that if there be no Elders, as at the firſt, nor any
that can conveniently be gotten from other Churches, then impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of hands may lawfully be performed by others.</p>
               <p>But you will prove, that it doth not belong to the congregation with or
without a Paſtor, to ordain Elders; becauſe the rules of direction, how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in ordination, and the Epiſtles wherein thoſe rules are, are not written or
directed to the whole Churches of Epheſus or Creet, but to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
only, as their inſcriptions ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be a ſufficient reaſon, to prove that the people may
not in any caſe, meddle with ordination, then by as good a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
a man may prove that ordination belongs not to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
nor to the Synods, but onely to one man, as the Prelats would
have it: for a man may turn the reaſon againſt your ſelfe, and ſay,
The rules of direction how to proceed in ordination, and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
wherein thoſe rules are, are not directed to any Presbytery or
Synod at Epheſus or Creet, or any where elſe, but onely to <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were each of them but onely one man. But look how
you would anſwer this plea for Epiſcopall ordination, the ſame
anſwer may be given to yours. And for us, we cannot but approve
the anſwer given to this kind of reaſoning, by the refuter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Downhams</hi> Sermon at Lambeth, who in his <hi>Reply, part. 2. pag.</hi> 107.
doth ſhew, that the lawes of Church-government preſcribed in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:112228:28"/>
Epiſtles of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were not provided for Biſhops alone,
nor Elders alone, but for a mixt ſtate, wherein many Presbyters
under the guidance of one Paſtor or Preſident, doe adminiſter and
execute all matters with the peoples conſent and approbation. In
which affirmation he alledgeth the conſent of moſt &amp; beſt Divines
of later times, inſtancing in <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp; eſpecially the Apoſtles
own warrant in the cloſe of thoſes Epiſtles, with theſe words, <hi>Grace
be with you,</hi> or <hi>with you all, 2 Tim. 4. 22. Tit.</hi> 3. 15. And by this, ſaith he,
it appeareth, that what was written ſpecially by name to <hi>Timothy</hi>
&amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> was intended to be of common uſe, not only for other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
but alſo in ſome ſort to all the Saints that then converſed in
thoſe places. Now if what was written by name to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
was intended to be of common uſe to all the Saints, then there
is no reaſon that you ſhould appropriate thoſe rules onely to the
uſe of Presbyteries and Synods, no more then others only to the
uſe of Prelats; eſpecially this being conſidered withall, that if once
the Saints be excluded from being at all concerned in thoſe rules,
they that would appropriate them to one man, have a fairer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
for their plea, then they that would appropriate them to a
Presbyterie, or Synod, conſiſting of many; becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi>
to whom thoſe Epiſtles are by name directed, are not many perſons,
but either of them one onely.</p>
               <p>But it appeares, ſay you, that we read in Scripture, that this part of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
was diſpenſed by the Elderſhip onely, and that a conſociated El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip.
<hi>pag.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it was diſpenſed by the Elderſhip, we willingly
grant; but that it was diſpenſed by the Elderſhip onely, and that
the Elderſhip by which it was diſpenſed, was a conſociated Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
(that is to ſay, a Synod) neither of theſe doe appeare at all:
Nay, we ſuppoſe the contrary to both theſe may appeare. For as
for the former, we have ſhewed the contrary already; and for the
latter, we will onely inſtance in that Elderſhip at Antioch, Acts 13.
that laid hands on <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which Elderſhip was not any
Synod, but an Elderſhip of one Congregation: for it is plain out of
Acts 14. 27. that the Church of Antioch was no more then might
be gathered together in one place; yea, the whole multitude of
them were gathered together at the return of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
from the Synod at Jeruſalem, to heare the Epiſtle read which was
ſent from that Synod, Acts 15. 30. 31. And therefore this Church
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:112228:28"/>
being but one Congregation, that Elderſhip therein by whom <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ordained, could not be any Synod.</p>
               <p>But, ſay you, there muſt be triall of parties to be ordained, and hands muſt
not be laid on ſuddenly on any, and 'tis laid down what kind of men they
ought to be, before they be ordained. And that this triall and approbation of
the parties to be ordained, is in the hands of the Presbyterie, and conſociated
Elderſhip, not the whole. <hi>pa.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That they ought to be tried, before they be ordained,
yea and afore they be choſen, we freely grant; but that this triall
is in the Synod alone, hath not appeared, by the former texts, nor
by any of them. We cannot perceive how any of them, do in any
ſort, look towards ſuch a thing. And as for this which is here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
of the impoſſibilitie of diſcharging it by a ſingle congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with or without a Paſtor; We anſwer thereto; Firſt, that if a
Congregation that is without a Paſtor could not diſcharge it, yet
if they be furniſhed with an able and faithfull Paſtor, we know not
what ſhould hinder but they might be able thereto. An able and
faithfull Paſtor, one would think ſhould be able to try others, that
are to be ordained Paſtors; And therefore we marvell that you
ſhould denie this abilitie to this Congregation, as well as to the
other. Secondly, ſuppoſe they be without a Paſtor, yet if they be
beleevers, they are not altogether without abilitie of ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
to diſcern whether that which is taught be wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or otherwiſe. Witneſſe the words of our Saviour, who ſaith,
that his ſheep know his voice, but a ſtranger they will not follow,
but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of ſtrangers:
and though there had been many theeves and robbers, yet the
ſheep did not hear them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. Which plainly ſhews, that the
ſheep of Chriſt, have ſome abilitie, to trie and diſcern, whether the
doctrine that men teach, be the wholſome Doctrine of truth, or
otherwiſe. Which may be the more confirmed, by the promiſe,
they ſhall be all taught of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. and by that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. that
if any man will do Gods will, he ſhall know the doctrine, whether
it be of God, or men ſpeak it of themſelves. There muſt be ſome
abilitie to diſcern, whether men be qualified according to the rule,
afore they ought to be elected, and choſen into office; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God have ſo much abilitie, to diſcerne this fitneſſe, as that
they may lawfully, make this election; and what then ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but they may have ſo much abilitie, as is of neceſſitie required,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112228:29"/>
afore there be proceedings unto Ordination.</p>
               <p>As for that inſtance which you give about the union of the two natures in the
perſon of Chriſt, whether the nature aſſumed the nature, or the perſon the
perſon; or the nature the perſon, or the perſon the nature. And again, whether
this aſſumption was by way of compoſition, or conjunction, or converſion, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(we ſuppoſe it ſhould be union) wherein you think it would be hard for
theſe examiners in a congregation, to hit upon the right judgement, and of
four Preachers to ordain him that were orthodox in this matter.</p>
               <p>We ſay no more to this inſtance, but onely thus much, That as
he is the beſt Preacher who moſt teacheth the people knowledge,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. and who had rather ſpeake five words to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſo as he may teach others, and the hearers be ediſied, rather
then ten thouſand words in a ſtrange tongue, and uncoth termes,
that himſelfe might be admired, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 19. So we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the people of God in a Congregation: theſe terms being
explained unto them, might be able to diſcern which were the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
tenent of the four particulars, and accordingly pitch upon
him that holds it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, you ſpeak, pag.</hi> 29. of four things that are oppoſed about this
matter of Ordination.</p>
               <p>Where, though we will not take upon us to juſtifie all thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but leave them to the authors of them, to undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of them, if ſo be there be any that doe ſo argue; yet we may
ſpeak a word or two to ſome paſſages in your anſwer to theſe four
particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt of all, to the caſe of a</hi> Company of Beleevers caſt by ſhip-wrack
upon an Iſland, where are no Paſtors, your anſwer is, that the queſtion is about
the ordinary way of Scripture-inſtitution in this matter of ordination, not
what may be done in extraordinary caſes.</p>
               <p>Whereby it ſeems that in the caſe propoſed, you grant ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be performed by non-Elders. And if ſo, what then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of all you have ſaid before of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and of the
rules about Ordination in the Epiſtles to theſe two Evangeliſts, of
the Presbytery at Antioch, that laid hands upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>
of the inability of people to examine and try who were fit for
office, and the reſt? For granting what here you doe, you plainly
declare, that all your former reaſoning amounts but to this much,
That when Paſtors can be had, then impoſition of hands is beſt
performed by thoſe Paſtors, otherwiſe it may be done without
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:112228:29"/>
them; wherein we for our parts conſent with you. But by this
means the neceſſary dependance upon Synods for ordination of
officers, is utterly overthrowne.</p>
               <p>But, ſay you, Indepencie of every ſingle congregation, to bee the ordinary
way, herein is the claime of the independent party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What others claim, they may declare their grounds for
the ſame as they ſee cauſe; for our ſelves, that which we hold,
with the grounds thereof, is briefly this, in four Propoſitions; two
of them concerning what is to be done in caſe a Chhurch have El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of its own: and two concerning what is to be done in caſe it
have not. In reſpect of the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. If a Church have Elders of its own, impoſition of
hands in ordination is to be performed by thoſe Elders, and not by
the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. A Church that hath Elders of its own, needs not
to depend upon a Synod, or the Presbyteries of other Churches,
conſociat or ſingle, for the the ordaining of its Officers; but the
ſame may be performed lawfully and ſufficiently by its owne El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the latter: 1. In a Church that hath no Elders, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of hands in ordaining of officers, may lawfully be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by ſome principall members in the congregation.</p>
               <p>2. If the Church have Elders of its own, it may doe well to
crave the approbation of the Miniſters of neighbouring congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
if there be any ſuch.</p>
               <p>The grounds of the firſt and third of theſe Propoſitions hath been
declared already; and for the ſecond we thus argue:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If ſuch a Church may elect and chuſe Officers to it ſelf,
without any neceſſary dependance upon Synods; then they may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
them alſo, having ſo fit inſtruments as Elders of their own to
doe it by. But the firſt is true, as we have elſewhere ſhewed in this
Anſwer of ours: Therfore the ſecond is true alſo. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Major is cleare by this reaſon, That they which
can doe the greater, can doe the leſſer alſo, if it be of the ſame
kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If ſuch a Church as we here ſpeak of, may not ordaine
their Officers without dependance on a Synod, or a Claſſis; then
neither may they adminiſter Seals without ſuch dependance: For
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:112228:30"/>
the word makes ſuch dependance, no more requiſite in the one
caſe, then in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If it were not thus, it were not poſſible, there ſhould be
any Synod or Claſſis upon the face of the earth; for what is a Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
or a Synod? but a companie of Miniſters or Elders, of ſeverall
Congregations, aſſembled together to conſider of things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves, and the Churches of Chriſt, ſpecially ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
whereto they do peculiarly belong; Now this aſſembling of
Elders into a Claſſis or Synod, doth imply that there were Elders
before there was any Claſſis, or Synod; and if ſo, then certainly
there was no concurrence, of the Claſſis or Synod in the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe Elders; ſith they were Elders before that Synod had
any being; Which doth ſufficiently ſhew, that the concurrence of
a Synod, is not alwaies required in the ordaining of Elders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be ſaid the Synod did ordain <hi>Timothy,</hi> an Evangeliſt,
an Officer of many Churches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and therefore much more
muſt ordain Officers of one particular Church.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, firſt, that the conſequence is not ſtrong, becauſe a
particular Church might have authoritie ſufficient, to ordain by
their Elderſhip the Officers of their particular Church onely; and
not ſufficient to ordain ſuch as muſt be Officers in all Churches,
whatſoever. The help of a Claſſis or Synod, where is a combination
or conſociation of Elders, of many Churches, might be requiſite
for ordaining an Officer of many Churches, and yet the elderſhip
of our particular Church, might be ſufficient for ordaining ſuch a
one, as is to be officer, to no more but onely to that particular
Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ground hence is not certain. For though <hi>Timothy</hi>
was an Evangeliſt, and ſo to travell from one Church to another,
yet the Presbyterie 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. that laid hands on him, might be
the Presbyterie of one particular Church, and not any Synod or
Claſſis. For <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 4. and 14.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. and yet they were ordained, not by any Claſſis or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie
of many Churches, but by the Presbyterie of one Church,
the Church at Antioch. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Thoſe (ſay they) that can do the greater (that is to ſay) make a Church,
can do the leſſe, make Paſtors of that Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We would rather argue thus; thoſe that have power of
electing Officers, they have power of ordaining Officers; But the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:112228:30"/>
people that have no Officers, have the former. Therefore they have
power to do the latter. The conſequence is proved, becauſe electing
is greater then ordaining, and greater not in another kind, but in
the ſame; <hi>viz.</hi> about the placing of a Miniſter, or the deſigning of
a perſon to the office, of Miniſterie. Now an Argument from the
greater to the leſſe, in the ſame kind, you confeſſe will hold.</p>
               <p>Which viſible Miniſtery where it is, this propertie or proper power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
Officers, is a neceſſarie and immediate ordinarie concomitant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<hi>pag.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be ſo, then there may be Officers ordained, and
not by a Synod, even in a particular congregation; becauſe in ſuch
a one there may be a viſible Miniſterie.</p>
               <p>Although that which you have ſaid in this Argument, be not
expreſly againſt the Congregations, electing their Officers; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt their ordaining of them, by impoſition of hands; yet in
aſmuch as ſundrie paſſages in your book, and in this Argument
eſpecially, do ſeem to make as much againſt the one, as the other.
Therefore as we have alreadie ſpoken, to the point of ordination,
ſo we will alſo, for the Readers further direction, give ſome
grounds for confirmation of this poſition, about election, <hi>viz.</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ordinarie officers belongeth to the Church, whereof the
partie is to be an officer, ſo that they proceed in this election, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules of the Word; both chuſing a man fitted by
God for the office, unto which they chuſe him, and carrying their
choice, in an orderly manner. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1 It was thus in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
times, and therefore it ought to be ſo now. The antecedent is
clear from <hi>Act.</hi> 1. where in the very choice of an Apoſtle, the Church
are not wholly excluded; for though the office of an Apoſtle being
extraordinarie, the expreſſe deſigning of the particular perſon, is
determined by God by lot, yet the Church appoints two that one
of them may be ſingled out, <hi>v.</hi> 23. and when the lot had fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Matthias,</hi> it is ſaid he was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles,
<hi>v.</hi> 26. that is, he was by common ſuffrage of the Churchchoſen to
be of that number; for ſo doth the word ſignifie, that is uſed,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and therefore it is tranſlated by <hi>Scapula, Omnium cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis
allectus.</hi> And it is obſervable, that though the office was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie,
and though the Apoſtles (who were extraordinarie
officers, and had received their calling and extraordinarie autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
from Chriſt himſelf, immediately) were now preſent, yet for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:112228:31"/>
all this, the Church hath a ſtroke in this matter, both firſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two, and then approving by their common ſuffrage or conſent
him of the two, on whom the lot had fallen; to be for inſtruction
unto us in after times, that in the choice of ordinarie officers, it
ſhould be farre from any of the ſons of men, to exclude the people
of God, from their right and intereſt therein; For if they had a
ſtroke in the choice of an Apoſtle; how much more ſhould they have
the like, in the choice of ordinarie officers? And if the Apoſtles
themſelves being preſent, would not abridge the people of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
much leſſe may others do it; doubtleſſe they that engroſſe
the authoritie of chuſing Miniſters into their own hands, excluding
the people, they arrogate more unto themſelves then the Apoſtles
ever did. So likewiſe in <hi>Act.</hi> 6. when Deacons were to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Apoſtles do not take all the buſineſſe into their own hands,
as if election of ſuch officers appertained onely to themſelves, and
not at all unto the people: but they call the whole multitude unto
them, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and bid them chuſe out ſeven men, fitly qualified for
the office, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and accordingly the ſaying pleaſed the whole
multitude; and they choſe ſeven that are there named, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and
having ſo done, they ſet them before the Apoſtles that they might
ordain them by laying their hands on them, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And in <hi>Act.</hi> 14.
23. it is ſaid that the Apoſtles ordained Elders, by election, or lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of hands, (for ſo doth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifie) in every
Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The word ſignifieth nothing elſe, but laying on of hands,
which was the act of the Apoſtles alone, and not of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The word is never uſed for laying on of hands in all the
Scripture, but the word uſed for that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, betwixt which
and this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there is as much difference as betweene
holding up and laying down. If <hi>Luke</hi> the writer of the Acts had
intended the laying on of hands, it had been eaſie for him to have
uſed the other word, which is proper to expreſſe ſuch an action,
and frequently uſed by himſelf in that ſence in this book. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6.
and 8. 17. and 9. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But be it laying on, or lifting up, that was not the act of
the people, but of the Apoſtle alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Of the Apoſtles it is confeſſed: For who doubts, but as
they moderated the whole action, and laid on their hands in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination;
ſo they might alſo concurre in the election, by lifting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:112228:31"/>
up their hands? But it will not follow, that therefore that lifting
up of hands was performed by the Apoſtles onely; for elſewhere
the word is uſed to expreſſe the act of the whole Church, and is
tranſlated (<hi>was choſen,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>was
choſen of the Churches:</hi> Even as one place mentioneth a gift that was
in <hi>Timothy,</hi> by the laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. which muſt
not be underſtood of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands alone, becauſe another Scripture
mentioneth the hands of the Presbytery, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. By all which
it appeareth, that in the Apoſtles times, the people had one hand in
the election of their Officers. And if ſo, then it ought to be ſo alſo
in theſe dayes: for the practice of the Apoſtles recorded in the Acts
is preſidentiall for all Churches in all ages, in thoſe things that
were not of particular reaſon and reſpect; which for the peoples
chuſing their Miniſters, cannot be ſaid. Beſides, when the Apoſtles
were alive, the Churches were in the greateſt purity, and therefore
we may more ſafely tread in their ſteps. And further, if this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
had not been according to the mind of Chriſt, we may be ſure
the Apoſtles would not have countenanced it, nor have directed
the Churches to have uſed it, but would have left and preſcribed
ſome other courſe to be obſerved in the choyce of Miniſters, which
we ſee they have not done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if Miniſters muſt not be choſen by the Church, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they muſt be called of God immediatly, or Miniſters without
any calling at all, or be choſen and appointed by ſome other men:
But not the firſt, becauſe ſuch immediate calling is now ceaſed (as
being peculiar to the extraordinary function of Apoſtles, Prophets,
&amp;c.) which in theſe times are not to be expected; Nor the ſecond,
becauſe that is expreſly againſt the Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>No man
muſt take this honour to himſelfe, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron,
Heb.</hi> 5. 4. And therefore they that ran when God ſent them not, are
many times, and very ſharply reproved in the Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 21.
Nor the third: For 1. God hath not given any ſuch authority to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men that are not of the Church, to appoint Officers to the
Church: Nor 2. may ſome of the Church arrogate this power
onely to themſelves, excluding the reſt; becauſe that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
all (as this matter doth) ought to have approbation of all,
unleſſe it might appeare, that God had committed the thing only
to ſome, which for the chuſing of Officers cannot be ſaid. 3. It is
ſutable to right reaſon, that it ſhould be thus: For 1. by this means
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:112228:32"/>
the liberty of the Church is not infringed by thruſting officers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them without their conſent, and whom they never choſe. Alſo
2. this is a ſtrong engagement to the people, to yeeld due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
ſubjection and obedience to their Miniſters, becauſe they are
the men whom themſelves have choſen; whereas one thruſt upon
them againſt their wills, is not like to be much beloved, but rather
contemned and hated; and how then ſhall they profit by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
Finally, the people have a right originally to chuſe their civil
officers, as is alſo practiſed at this day in many places: And when
the Lord brings a ſword upon a land, the Scripture ſaith expreſly,
<hi>that the people of the land may take a man of their coaſts, and ſet him for their
watchman, Ezek.</hi> 33. 2. And if ſo, then they may well have liberty to
chuſe ſuch as muſt be watchmen for their ſouls: for it is much more
unreaſonable, that there ſhould be thruſt upon them ſuch watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and officers, upon whom the ſalvation or damnation of their
ſouls doth depend, then ſuch as upon whom dependeth no more
but their wealth, or commodity of this life. And this ſhall ſuffice
for anſwer to your fourth and laſt Argument.</p>
               <p>There are in your book two other general heads which are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inſiſted on, the one about clearing ſuch objections as are not
reducible to your former arguments; the other of appealing to the
judgement of the adverſe party: In both which, thopugh we might
obſerve ſundry things which were worth your ſecond review, yet in
as much as our <hi>intentions</hi> were chiefly to conſider the weight of your
arguments, but not to undertake the defence of every objection
which you propoſe; and conſidering withall, that thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the order, unity, peace, and ſtrength of government with
the reſt, are not intended by you (as we ſuppoſe) as convincing, but
onely as probable grounds againſt that way which you deale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
therfore for theſe and ſome other reaſons, having ſpoken to
that which we conceive to be the main ſubſtance of your book, we
will here for this time ſurceaſe, <hi>praying the Father of mercies for Chriſt
Jeſus his ſake, to poure out his rich bleſſings of truth &amp; peace upon our deare
native countrey, and to guide all his ſervants there &amp; here by a Spirit of truth,
into all truth. And to give us ſuch hearts and grace, that we may follow the
truth in love, till Antichriſtianiſme be utterly rooted out, and Sion be reſtored,
(eſpecially in England) to her former beiuty, and new Jeruſalem come down
from heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Husband, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. To
whom be all glory and praiſe for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
