         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlines

have they done? Let thy hand I pray thee, be againſt mee and my
fathers houſe, but not on the people that they ſhould be plagued.</hi> 2 Sam. 29. 17. 1 Chron. 21. 17. Anſwerable whereunto is that

rather then to deſtroy the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>under his charge for their ſin

This ſhould be a great example to mighty Kings, let them
be not aſhamed to learne manners from ſmall creatures, ſeeing the
minds of men ought to be more moderate, by how much the more
vehemently it may do harme: Security is to be gained by mutuall
ſecurity, &amp;c. Kings have one impregnable fortification, the love
of their ſubjects; which they ſhall then be ſure of, when they deeme
the Common-wealth not to be theirs, but they to be the Common-wealths.

1 of <hi>Samuel</hi> 14. 39. to 46. Where when King <hi>Saul</hi> had
made a Raſh vow, <hi>that whoſoever had taſted any thing that day,</hi>
(contrary to his command, whiles he purſued the <hi>Philiſtines)
he ſhould dye the death, though it were Jonathan his Sonne,</hi> who
procured that Victory <hi>and the Lot fell upon</hi> Jonathan, <hi>who did
but taſt a little Honey on the top of his Rod,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>and lo I
muſt dye for this; Saul</hi> anſwered, <hi>God do ſo, and more alſo, for thou
ſhalt ſurely dye</hi> Jonathan; <hi>the people thereupon ſaid to Saul</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
he were their King, and had made two ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Oaths) ſhall <hi>Jonathan</hi> die, who hath wrought this
great deliverance in <hi>Iſraell God forbid;</hi> as the Lord liveth, <hi>that
ſhall not one haire of his head fal to the ground, for he hath wrought
with God this day, ſo the people reſcued</hi> Ionathan, <hi>that he died not.</hi>
Here the people not only juſtly defend, but reſcue <hi>Jonathan,</hi>
being an Innocent from death, not onlie contrarie to the
reſolution, but vowes and Oaths of their owne King, to put
him to death, and ſo doubtleſſe they would have defended

ſaying. Thus ſaith the Lord, You ſhall not go up to fight againſt

the Rebells (now halfe ſubdued are like to regaine the

By what Law or Juſtice then hath his Majeſtie ſeiſed
lately upon his ſubjects Armes and Magazines in divers
Counties, bought with their own Moneys, for their own
private, and the publique defence of the Realme againſt
Theeves and Forraigne Enemies, and forceably taking
them away without paying for them, and now imployed
them in a Civill-warre, againſt <hi>Hull</hi> and his ſubjects?
Doubtleſſe the Parliament may with farre more juſtice
and equity, ſeize upon the publique Magazine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and <hi>Hull</hi> (a frontire Towne well fortified) for the
ſecurity of the Realme, and prevention of Civill-warres,

Act to be Treaſon, unleſſe it be clearely within the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
Letter of 25 <hi>E. 3, c.</hi> 3. Therefore his Majeſties own

the 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and his <hi>proclaiming of him to be a Traytour,</hi> muſt
neceſſarily be both void and illegall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Kings Judges and Juſtices, even in
Courts of Judicature, where they may finally determine
and reſolve what is law in all other caſes neither can may,
nor ought to declare and determine what is Treaſon, and
what is not, in any caſes out of the very Letter of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3.

If then the Judges are thus to be reſolved by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
onely, what is Treaſon and what not, then there is
no reaſon or ſence, why the Parliament ſhould be ſent to
the Judges to be adviſed and reſolved by them, what is
Treaſon: or why the Parliament ſhould be taxed for Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>Thirdly, both Houſes of Parliament upon the Kings
Appeale to them for juſtice againſt Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> as a
Traytour, for not admitting him into <hi>Hull,</hi> and upon Sir

by the command of both Houſes) not only to be no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

all he did was only in diſcharge of the truſt which the
Parliament had repoſed in him, for the ſafety and peace
of the whole Kingdome and prevention of a Civill-warre.
Since then the whole Parliament, the onely proper Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Treaſon, upon the <hi>Kings</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158240:15"/>
appeales to them, have both voted and reſolved Sir

               <p>Sir Iohn Hothams caſe and Pulls truly ſtated and debated.</p>
               <p>The onely, if not principall pretence of his Majeſties
late rayſing an Army in the <hi>North,</hi> and of a moſt ſad and
unſeaſonable Civill-warre (which if proceeded in, may
ſoone prove deſtructive to all his Majeſties three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes)
is Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> ſeiſing on the Towne of <hi>Hull,</hi>
and the Magazine there by Order from the Parliament,
for the peace and ſecurity of the Realme, and his denying
his Majeſtie entrance into the Towne, when he came to
take poſſeſſion of it: Which Acts his Majeſtie hath in
his <hi>Proclamations</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> declared and proclaimed
to all his ſubjects to be no leſſe then <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> and Sir

                     </gap>otham</hi> to be a notorious Traytour.</p>
               <p>The ſole queſtion then will be, <hi>Whether theſe Actions of
Sir</hi> John Hotham <hi>be Treaſon or not by the Laws of the Realm?</hi>
And under correction, I conceive it is as cleere as the
Noone-day Sunne, that they are no Treaſon.</p>
               <p>That his taking poſſeſſion of this Towne and Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine

               <p>

(for then this Law had beene idle and ſuperfluous, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

there can be no Treaſon at this day in Sir <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, That no detaining or with-holding of ſuch

<hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> detained <hi>Hull,</hi> and denyed his Majeſtie to
ſeize and enter it, not <hi>Maliciouſly</hi> and <hi>Rebelliouſly,</hi> but in
obedience to the Parliaments command, which intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
him to keepe it for the preſent both for the King and
Kingdomes uſe, for the prevention of Civill-warres and
danger to the Realme, and the excluding of forraigne
forces which might be landed there, neither did his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
make any Proclamation under his great Seale, or
give him ſix dayes ſpace to deliver it up. Therefore this
Act of his is and can be no Treaſon, neither within the
particular expired forecited Acts were they in force, much
leſſe within 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. which extends not to this caſe. And
ſo his Majeſtie was utterly miſtaken in the Law, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming
Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> Traytour, and declaring this act
of his to be Treaſon, of his owne head, without conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with his Judges or Councell learned in the Lawes,
who would queſtionleſſe have informed him; That this
Act of his is now neither Treaſon nor Felony by the
Law, had he done it of his owne voluntary accord much
leſſe ſeeing he did it onely by the Parliaments direction
and command, as their Servant for the common ſafety
of the Realme, excluſions of forraigne forces and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
and prevention of an intended Civill-warre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thought of the leaſt diſobedience or diſloyalty to
his Majeſtie into whoſe poſſeſſion he declared he was and
is ever ready to ſurrender up the Towne, as ſoone as the
Parliament ſhall command him. In a word the <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

ſeizing upon all his Majeſties Townes Caſtles in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and on <hi>New caſtle</hi> here, and detaining them againſt him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:158240:18"/>
after demands, hath by his Majeſtie and both Kingdomes
in Parliament beene tacitly if not expreſly reſolved and
declared to be no Treaſon, being done for the publique
peace and ſafety of the whole Realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Therefore much more muſt Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
but of <hi>Hull</hi> one ſingle Towne, and his detaining it
for a ſeaſon onely for his Majeſties and the Kingdomes
uſe, and the peace and ſafety of the whole Kingdome,
and that by the Parliaments expreſſe command as their
Inſtrument, be adjudged no Treaſon, Felony, no nor Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor.
And ſince both Houſes of Parliament the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proper Judges of Treaſon, to whom both the King &amp;
Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> appealed for juſtice, have upon full hearing and
debating of the cauſe, voted and adjudged it, <hi>to be no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or offence,</hi> and publiſhed theſe their Votes in print to all
the world, I cannot diſcerne, how by any Law, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
or his Malignant Counſellors, can poſſibly faſten
any charge of Treaſon, Felony, or Miſdemeanour, on Sir
<hi>Iohn;</hi> but muſt all conclude him to be an innocent Noble
and weldeſerving Gentleman, for ſo faithfully and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
diſcharging the truſt repoſed in him by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
for the whole Kingdomes peace and ſecurity, and
his Majeſties ſafety too. As for his late drowning of the
Country about <hi>Hull,</hi> to the ſpoile of much Graſle, Corne,
and great prejudice of particular men, with which his
Majeſtie chargeth him in his laſt Letter to the Houſes, it
is onely for the better preſervation and defence of <hi>Hull</hi>
for the common ſafety, and therefore he may by Law ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
this Act, even as men in times of Warre may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the burning or demoliſhing of a Suburb for the whole
Cities ſafety, and the making of Eorts and Trenches in
another mans ground, for to reſiſt an invading Enemy.
Which I have formerly proved Lawfull by our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes.
Moreover, this drowning was through his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
