            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BOOK-SELLER
TO THE
Courteous Reader and
Buyer of this Book.</head>
            <p>IT may seem strange
how this Book should
lie dormant all this time
that is elapsed since Sir
<hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s Death;
therefore I thought it
necessary to acquaint
<pb facs="tcp:55010:3"/>
you by what means it
came to my Hands.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman who
came in the Train of
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
when he was last in
<hi>England,</hi> brought this
<hi>Novel</hi> in an old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,
and presented
it to a Lady as a great
Rarity of that excellent
Authors Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
and suppos√®d he
wrote it when he was
Governor of <hi>Flushing;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55010:3"/>
for soon after his Death
it was found amongst
his Papers, and hath
been several times tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
for the <hi>English</hi>
Gentry there: But this
that I print it by, is the
Original Copy.</p>
            <p>I cannot suppose but
I shall do many Persons
a kindness in publishing
this <hi>Novel,</hi> by reason
that they may now buy
that for a Shilling, which
so many Persons have
<pb facs="tcp:55010:4"/>
given Twenty for, and
have thought it a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to have it at that
rate, esteeming any
thing of that excellent
Authors at what Price
soever it should be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
at.</p>
            <p>That this Book shall
have a good acceptance
in the World, I make
no doubt of; but if it
should be otherwise, I
shall not be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
because I have
<pb facs="tcp:55010:4"/>
in this considered your
Advantage more than
my own Profit.</p>
            <p>Now let me beg
your pardon for detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you thus long from
what is much better, I
mean the Book it self;
which if you receive
with a favourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
I will assure you,
you shall get this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by it, (which
is no very inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one) That for the

A
NOVEL.</head>
            <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Moroco</hi>
had for many years suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
under Tyrannical
Powers, when at last it began to
breathe, and receive new life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the just and peaceable Reign
of the Great <hi>Abdala,</hi> the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
of all Princes; who
having employed his younger
years in Arms, had thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
great fame, and assured a
peaceful and quiet Seat unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in the most renowned City
of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55010:6"/>It was there that in a Palace
whose Magnificence did surpass
even Imagination, the greatest
Beauties of the World spent their
days under some severity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
being deprived from the
sight of all Objects but their own
enterview, the presence of a
Prince past the flower of his age,
and some few young Slaves that
were but just stepp'd out of
Childhood.</p>
            <p>Of all <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Women, there
was but one absolute, the birth of
a Son had render'd her happy;
<hi>Roxana</hi> had the most absolute
Authority: yet <hi>Cleonisa</hi> did still
preserve such a deserved Power
over the Kings heart, as she estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
infinitely beyond that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Grandeur, which was the
Right of <hi>Roxana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst those Slaves apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the King &amp; Princesses,
that had the liberty of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55010:6"/>
Apartments, one onely had
attained to his twentieth year:
He had been presented to <hi>Abdala</hi>
in his Infancy, and some years
having given him the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to discover most exquisite
Parts of Mind and Body, <hi>Abdala</hi>
was taken with them so, that they
oblig'd him to bestow his Love
and Favours upon the Possessor of
them, and distinguished him from
the rest, by his tender Affections
towards him; and proceeded so
far, as to honour him with the
Magnificent Name of <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
so much in esteem with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Moroco,</hi> as having been that
of many of their most ancient
Kings. The onely Mark that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with him of his Bondage,
was a Chain of Diamonds: and
if his Apparel had any thing of
<hi>Abdala</hi>'s Liveries yet remaining
upon them, they were so obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
under a vast quantity of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55010:7"/>
as not to be discernable.</p>
            <p>In short, no Captive in the
World had a happier Fate; as
many as saw him, became his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers;
none amongst the most
considerable, but thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
highly favoured with his
Friendship; and to wish, was with
him the same thing as to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding all this
Happiness, he fell into such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
melancholy, as became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to all Persons; but in a more
particular manner, it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the chief and most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Eunuchs, unto
whose particular care had been
committed the Education of his
Childhood, of which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
divers great Advantages,
such as were sutable to <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s
brave Soul. The extreme
affection that this Eunuch had for
him, made him with the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
observe his Distemper;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55010:7"/>
and not being able to see him in
any discontent, it made him enter
one evening into <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s
Lodgings, where having found
him, he spoke to him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<q>I have deserved otherwise
from you, than that you should
hide your sorrows from me: I
cannot see that Person over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with sorrow, unto
whose Childhood I have given
all my Cares, and to whose Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
I have sacrisiced all my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and be ignorant of the
cause of his change. Must I have
the trouble to see you hide your
Sighs from me? Sir, your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
are too dear unto me, not
to reproch you this reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Almanzor,</hi> I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of your considence; and
you ought to believe, that I
loving you with that tenderness
as I do, I should not desire with
so much earnestness the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55010:8"/>
of what so much disturbs
your quiet, but to endeavour
the re-establimment of it, even
with the hazard of my Life:
Therefore I conjure you to
speak.</q> At this onset, <hi>Almanzor</hi>
stood for a while in suspense; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, casting an obliging
look upon the Eunuch, <q>
                  <hi>Aristan,</hi>
(said he) I should become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of your kindness, if I
was so ungrateful as to conceal
from your knowledge any thing
that concerns my Fortune. I do
not mistrust a Vertue so well
known, and so useful to me as
yours has always been: And if
I have hid from your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a trouble wholly contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the narrow limits of
my Heart, it was that I might
not involve the quiet of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to whom I owe a thousand
times more than my Life, in such
secret Misfortunes as must be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55010:8"/>
suffered by me alone.</q> 
               <q>Do you
believe (interrupted <hi>Aristan</hi>)
that I can quietly see you suffer,
hear your Sighs, and have your
troubled Eyes for continnal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and not be moved? Speak
your mind, <hi>Almanzor,</hi> with this
assurance, that of whatsoever
you can inform me, you will less
afflict me in the declaration of
it, than you do with your obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
silence; since there are no
such evils, though never so great,
but may find remedies: And if
there be a necessity of courting
you to it, let me conjure you
by all that love I have for you.
Well (replied the Slave, sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
you must be satisfied; <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>
I love; it is love that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
all my grief: the onely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
that I would have kept
from your knowledge, because
of its cruel circumstances</q>
               <q> Your
informing of me that you love,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55010:9"/>
is defective (replied the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch),
except you acquaint me
with the Object also.</q> 
               <q>Dear
<hi>Aristan</hi> (replied the amorous
Captive), if ever you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
me when near the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Almanzaida,</hi> you could not
but perceive it.</q> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Almanzaida,</hi>
(replied <hi>Aristan,</hi> with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
emotion) <hi>Roxana</hi>'s
Slave!</q> 
               <q>Yes (pursu'd <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor)</hi>
it is she that a thousand
Charms makes me adore.</q> 
               <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
(replied the Eunuch)
that she is destinated to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Servitude; and, if it be
possible, fix you heart on some
other Object.</q> 
               <q>Dear <hi>Aristan,</hi>
(replied <hi>Almanzor</hi>) can <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida</hi>'s
ill Fate make you
forget mine of the same nature?
Does the glittering of my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
so dazel your eyes, as that
you cannot see the Badge of my
Slavery on me? And does this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55010:9"/>
Chain, because of Jewels, alter
my Condition? It is, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that equality of Fortune,
that unites our Souls. Know, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi>
that my Griefs are not the
effects of <hi>Almanzaida's</hi> Rigours;
for we having been both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bred in this Palace, with
the liberty of seeing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with one another, have
kindled such Flames as have
grown more furious by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
they have encountered,
and which will prove eternal,
though of a Slave I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Master of the whole
World: For do not imagine,
that none but my single Heart
does justice unto <hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s
Beauty; the Prince <hi>Abdemar,</hi>

are not throughly informed of

the whole World there is not a

Thoughts, such an exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and a quaintness of Wit so

               <p>I was yet so young, and she so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55010:11"/>
innocent, when she was placed
with <hi>Roxana,</hi> that all our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
were limited within the
bounds of Childrens Sports; yet
then was I infinitely pleased with
them, when permitted me; and
Love was then interwoven with
them, in a manner proportionable
to our age. It was still my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to insinuate my self in all
places that were bless'd with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida</hi>'s
presence; and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of some few years, to those
I had pass'd already in that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Commerce, did give to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that an innocent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisancy,
and some childish en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endearments,
had been the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of a most violent Passion.
After that, I had no other
thoughts, but such as did abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
confirm me of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, and would languish in
all places that her presence did
not grace: I would be out of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55010:11"/>
when <hi>Abdala</hi> would defer
some moments in his custom of
sending me with an <hi>How do you</hi>
to <hi>Roxana;</hi> and I confess, that I
would grumble within my self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
when you detained me upon
some Lesson longer than my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
thought reasonable, of
which I could reap no benefit at
all, but what did happen by meer
chance, seeing that I could have
no other thoughts but of her:
all my Study was bent in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to please her, and that
took up my whole thoughts: she
could no sooner desire any thing,
but I would with all the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imaginable effect it: And
when at last she had learn'd from
her own Heart, and from my
Eyes, rather than from my Mouth,
part of my Intentions, she would
frequently blush at the receit of
any Services from my hands.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Abdemar</hi> went but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55010:12"/>
too frequently unto <hi>Roxana</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
not to see her, which
he could not do without Love;
and I had but too much Interest
in that Love, not to take notice
of it: and the Princes high birth,
and other Advantages, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
daily a thousand Evils in that
Concurrency, I suffered infinitely
by it. He was not so reserv'd as
I; he would speak of his Love
to <hi>Almanzaida</hi> in a most tender
manner, even in my presence,
without the least scruple, or any
thought that his Fathers Slave
durst raise his Pretensions to the
same object to which he address'd
his. The young Bond-maid would
always answer his Sute with such
reservedness as would charm me,
and conjuring the Prince to spare
her, gave him to understand, that
if she had heard him make his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to her, he was obliged for
it to nothing but his Rank, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55010:12"/>
                  <hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s evil Fortune. Some
moments after, he went out, and
I remained singly with her, with
an impatient desire to learn the
cause of a profound reasoning
within her self, in which she had
fallen immediately upon <hi>Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi>
departure. Her Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was altered, her Eyes were
troubled, and her Respiration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more violent than usual, gave
me to understand, that her Heart
had a great share in this disorder.
Good Gods, how heavy did my
doubts and my restlesness lie upon
me! I look'd upon her for some
time with silence; but at last,
taking the resolution to inform
my self of the very center of
this business, which till then I
durst not attempt, <hi>You are surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi>
Almanzaida, (said I) <hi>and
what is most sensible to me, is,
that I perceive with sorrow it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follows the Discourses
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55010:13"/>
with which</hi> Abdemar <hi>has enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
you. Abdemars</hi> Discourses
<hi>(replied she)</hi> have nothing in
them but what is a trouble to
me; and whether what he has
said to me be true or feign'd, I
think my self very unfortunate
in being obliged to hear him.
Abdemar <hi>is so great a Prince</hi> (I
replied) <hi>that he thinks he may say
any thing without caution; but
if he could be what</hi> Almanzor <hi>is,
then acting like a slave, he might,
'tis like, less displease the fair</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida
<hi>in his Addresses.</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar
<hi>(replied she)</hi> cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Slave without a wonder;
but though he is the Son of a
great Monarch, his Love is no
more pleasing to me, than if he
were in Chains, or of a mean
Rank: For my part <hi>(added she)</hi>
with the unhappiness of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Birth, I have that also of
being a Captive; but, <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55010:13"/>
I know and feel my Heart, and
all that it doth inspire me is so
great, that notwithstanding my
low condition, I feel within me a
certain natural adversness, which
makes me look upon all things
that carry any thing of mean and
low in them, with horror; which
flatters me in an opinion, that I
am not inferiour to <hi>Roxana. I
am not happy enough</hi> (said I) <hi>to
have any Intelligence with a Heart
whose Motions are so generous:
yet, fair</hi> Almanzaida, <hi>though I can
judge of it but by the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
it is long since I am
perswaded of the Truth you speak,
which makes me look upon you
with that respect as is due to a
Person whose bare Vertue would
prefer her to all the Queens of the
World. In a word,</hi> Almanzaida,
<hi>you are worthy to Reign in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and therefore it is that</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar
<hi>does you that justice.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55010:14"/>
(<hi>she replied, with some
discomposure, that seemed to me
as disadvantageous to</hi> Abdemar)
give me leisure to forget his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses
to me, I conjure you to
it; for I declare, I hate that Love
which he hath entertained me
with; and no doubt but I should
hate his Person likewise, should
he pursue it. <hi>Thus,</hi> (replied I,
in an accent that exprest some
disturbance) <hi>thus it is, that those
that love you must merit your
hate; and the Son of</hi> Abdala <hi>is‚Äî</hi>
Are you his Advocate <hi>(interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Almanzaida, <hi>looking fixtly on
me</hi>)? and is it in his behalf that
you design to employ that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
that your Bondage gives
you? <hi>Ah,</hi> Almanzaida, (I replied,
with such an agitation of mind as
she could not but discern) <hi>if my
better fortune should procure me
any with you, it should not be
in his, or any others behalf, but my
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55010:14"/>
own, that I should employ it. I
am not his Agent, Fair one, but his
Rival; and give me leave to say,
a more bold and more passionate
Lover than he, who desires all, but
dare not hope any thing.</hi> I did not
think <hi>(replied</hi> Almanzaida, <hi>with
much coldness)</hi> that <hi>Abdemar</hi> and
<hi>Almanzor</hi> should at the same time
make their amorous Addresses to
me; and I was in hopes that you
would have assisted me, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the thoughts of his
Courtship, and not thus add to
my troubles: And yet I am not
angry with you, though I should
resent it; that esteem which I
have for you, will not permit me;
which I promise to continue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
provided you repeat it
not, and that you confirm me by
your future silence of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Divers Persons which were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55010:15"/>
seeking for <hi>Roxana</hi> did interrupt
us; I was obliged to withdraw,
where making some Reflexions
upon <hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s reception of
my Declaration of Love, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
to find in it more of discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
than of anger. <hi>Hopes,
though small, do pleasingly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
I took enough to perswade
me, that I was more happy than
<hi>Abdemar,</hi> and that she had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
me silence for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than because she found in
her self more disposition to hear
and favourably answer me, than
she had a mind to discover. I
pass'd that night passably well,
and the next day having waited
on <hi>Abdala</hi> unto <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I had the happiness to see
<hi>Almanzaida:</hi> She appear'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cold nor disagreeing, but as
if her Eyes, which I observed to
be more languishing than fierce,
did take care to shun mine; which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55010:15"/>
I concluded to proceed from a
modest bashfulness, that cannot
be avoided, when one would
hide the motions of the Heart,
not being absolutely Master of
those of the Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleonisa</hi> being some few days
after at <hi>Roxana</hi>'s Apartment, did
tell her so many fine things in the
praise of the Weather, that she
set her in a humour of going into
the Garden: <hi>Almanzaida</hi> took
up her Train, and <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> who
ever had an obliging goodness
for me, seeing me in <hi>Roxana</hi>'s
Chamber, and having observed
by my assiduous waiting on <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida,</hi>
that her presence was
most dear unto me, made me take
an <hi>Umbrella,</hi> to give me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
opportunity of making one in
the Walk. It served onely to
cross a Plat of Ground that led
to the covered Walks, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got, <hi>Roxana</hi> having made sign
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55010:16"/>
to <hi>Almanzaida</hi> to let go her
Train, we followed at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
under pretence of respect,
and so I had the means of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
her with liberty.</p>
               <p>Almanzaida (said I) <hi>those that
interrupted us at</hi> Roxana<hi>'s the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, prevented my answering
you, on that severe silence that
you would have imposed upon me,
and of letting you know, that it
is impossible to be silent, and love
so passionately as I do.</hi> You would
not have me have an esteem for
you then, <hi>(replied she)</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of your silence? since you
so wilfully relapse into a fault
that I was willing to forget? I
was going to reply, but <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>
continued, saying, You a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
my Indulgence, <hi>Almanzor;</hi>
I was too little mov'd: but if
you knew how dangerous an
Enemy I can be, you would
doubtless fear, me more than you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55010:16"/>
do. <hi>There is no resisting of that
Power which makes me speak,</hi> (I
replied) <hi>and I am confident that
you would pardon <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>, if were
sensible of it: But am I so crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
onely for loving you? and if
it be an offence, are not you more
guilty of it than my self? Could
my Eyes be pardonable, should they
see you without admiration? and
would that admiration be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as you deserve it, if it were
not followed with all that Passion
which I have for you? No, fair</hi>
Almanzaida, <hi>none can behold you
with quiet thoughts; and I confess,
that I shall ever remain a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
towards you, if I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
innocent without ceasing to
love you.</hi> I should be very sorry
<hi>(replied she)</hi> that you should
cease being my Friend; and to
shew you, that it is nor Hatred,
nor so little as Indifferency that I
require of you, I do protest to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55010:17"/>
You, <hi>Almanzor,</hi> that I wish you
were my Brother. <hi>This is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
way of wishing me dead</hi> (I
replied); <hi>for if the amorous</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor
<hi>were Brother to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
Almanzaida, <hi>he would not
long out-live that fatal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Iudge by these tender resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether it were easie, or
rather possible for me to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
‚ÄîWell, (<hi>interrupted</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida)
since you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
your self to it, see me no
more; shun the occasions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in those places where I shall
be, and I shall take care to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
those of meeting you. <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
one</hi> (said I) <hi>were you so unjust
as to execute what you mention,
you would have much to do to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it; and in vain would you
endeavour to hide your self from
such Eyes as seek after no other
Object but you.</hi> How obstinate
you are, (<hi>replied</hi> Almanzaida)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55010:17"/>
and what pains must I take to
convince you? <hi>Never hope it</hi> (said
I) <hi>since 't is easier for me to die, than
not to love you, and let you know
it.</hi> I must hear you then, it
seems, (<hi>replied</hi> Almanzaida, <hi>blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in such a manner as added
luster to her Charms</hi>) since that I
esteem you Life more than what
I required from you. There
needed no more to make me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
my Happiness: <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>
being vanquish'd, did from
that time no more oppose with
fierceness what I would say to
her; and I was made sensible of
all the Joys that the assurance of
being beloved could inspire.</p>
               <p>Some short space of time did
so confirm me in it, that there was
no cause left me to doubt. I am
certain, that my Resentments did
answer all <hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and I neglected no means to
make her sensible of it. <hi>Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55010:18"/>
mar</hi> had too much Love not to
take notice of mine, and of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida's</hi>
tenderness also: He
did openly reproch her of it, and
came to such threatning terms
with me about it, as made her to
tremble, and to advise me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
my self for my Lifes secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>From that very time forward
the Prince did treat me with so
much contempt, that no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
could have made me bear,
had not <hi>Almanzaida</hi> forced me
to it, by such Orders as I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
submit unto: He never more
employ'd me on his Messages to
<hi>Roxana;</hi> and when I was sent by
the King into her Apartment in
his presence, he would take that
Office upon himself: by which,
depriving me of my Happiness,
he would bring me almost to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.
Yet I still found some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
means to see and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55010:18"/>
                  <hi>Almanzaida,</hi> whose Bounties
were onely capable of making
me happy.</p>
               <p>I was one day alone with her,
charm'd with the assurance which
she had given me, against some
fears that troubled me: too much
joy was to be perceiv'd in my
Eyes, when <hi>Abdemar</hi> came in:
He perceiv'd it; and that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
which I could not dissemble,
raising a most violent Passion in
him, he forgot the Respect which
is due to <hi>Almanzaida's</hi> Sex, from
which no Rule nor Greatness can
ever dispense a gallant Man. I
was concern'd at it in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as would have made me run
into some extreme, if <hi>Almanzai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi>
looks had not restrain'd me
<hi>Retire</hi> (said he to me, in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful manner), <hi>shun with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
not onely the speaking to this
Slave, but the sight of her also;
think on those Consequences that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55010:19"/>
may follow your disobedience, and
believe, that it is not in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of your self, that I have
spared you till this time.</hi> Ending
this word, he went into his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Closet. <hi>Almanzaida</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to obey, but not
without so much concern for my
safety, as forc'd me to sacrifice all
my resentments to her pleasure.
My grief did irritate her more
against <hi>Abdemar,</hi> than all that he
had said to her; and I was but
just gone out, when he return'd.
<hi>I see</hi> (said he) <hi>that your heart
cannot harbour any other thoughts
than such as are proportionable to
its condition; and while you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
a Prince, you give a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
attention to a Slave, by reason
of the proportion which he bears
with your condition.</hi> I am not to
give you an account of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of my heart, (<hi>replied</hi> Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida,
<hi>angrily</hi>) and it would please
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55010:19"/>
me very much to remain ignorant
of yours: Do not expose your
self to the shame of loving a
Slave, who has not a Soul large
enough to contain such an esteem
as it should have of such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
as you would be: Leave
me and my unworthiness, with
the liberty of not hearing of you;
and raise to some higher place
those tenders of Services which I
do not, nor never shall deserve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roxana</hi>'s presence prevented
her proceeding; and <hi>Abdemar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
so netled, that his last looks
did set <hi>Almanzaida</hi> into a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
with the fears of the result
of his Passion: But he never did
break out, and the Prince, as jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as he is, being vertuous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
has never attempted any thing
against my Life or Fortune. But,
<hi>Aristan,</hi> what has he not done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Love? How oft has he
most cruelly torn me away from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55010:20"/>
                  <hi>Almanzaida's</hi> presence, to possess
my room? What Stratagems have
I not invented to gain the sight
of her, mauger all those Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which his Jealousie did sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to him? In a word, he has so
ordered things, that though I am
fully assured of <hi>Almanzaida's</hi>
Heart, the vexations of seeing her
but by stealth, and <hi>Abdemar's</hi>
strict observing of my Actions,
have reduc'd me unto that restless
melancholy which you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of.</p>
               <p>Here did <hi>Almanzor</hi> end his
Recital; and perceiving that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristan</hi>
remained silent, <hi>Will you
not say something to me</hi> (said he)
<hi>is it thus that you have promised
to comfort me, and to allay my
griefs?</hi> Ah, <hi>Almanzor, (replied
the Eunuch)</hi> you know them not
all yet; and the greatest Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
you can be Master of, cannot
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55010:20"/>
secure you from trembling, when
you learn those that I am oblig'd
to inform you of. Oh, what a
Love is this that the Fates have
inspired you with! and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
so many others, what a
Person have they chosen to give
you a Passion for, such a Passion
as cannot be continued but with
horror! <hi>How,</hi> (replied <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
strangely moved) <hi>what horror,
and what repentance ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that Passion which I have for
the most amiable Person in the
World?</hi> I know <hi>(replied the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch)</hi>
that her Beauty, her Merit,
her Mind, and her Vertue, render
you pardonable for that Error
you have been in to this present:
but, <hi>Almanzor,</hi> learn, since it
must be told you, that she is your
Sister, and that one and the same
Blood does animate you both.
<hi>My Sister?</hi> (said he, in a great
passion) <hi>do not deceive me thus,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55010:21"/>
it would be my death,</hi> Aristan.
You must not die, though nothing
is more true, <hi>(continued the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch) Abdemar</hi> shall not be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than you, since that he shares
in the same misfortune, and is <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida</hi>'s
Brother, as Well as
yours. In a word, <hi>Almanzor,</hi> you
are <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Child, as he is; and
both <hi>Almanzaida</hi> and your self
were born of that Prince, and of
the generous <hi>Cleonisa.</hi> The King
knows it not, <hi>Cleonisa</hi> is also ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it, and I am the onely
Depositary of that important Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
It is that Blood which is
ever acting, though by secret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which renders you so dear
unto <hi>Abdala.</hi> It is the same that
affection which <hi>Cleonisa</hi> has for
you: and doubtless it is that also
which restrains <hi>Abdemar</hi> from
acting against you with more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
than he hath shewn. <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>
was exceedingly astonish'd at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55010:21"/>
what he heard; never was sorrow
comparable to his: he curs'd his
Stars, and remain'd in a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
condition, while <hi>Aristan</hi>
inform'd him in this manner of
the whole Mystery of his Birth.</p>

of <hi>Abdemar</hi> had fill'd all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Moroco</hi> with joy,
and had fortified the imperious

                        </gap>ly,</hi>
who commanded the Naval Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of this Kingdom, a Person
considerable both to the King
and his People, through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Services which he had
rendred, did unfortuuately perish
by the strength of an infinite
number of Pyrates who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55010:22"/>
bined his destruction, seeing him
the Terror of all the Eastern Seas.
He was of an Illustrious Birth,
and descended from the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that had reign'd over <hi>Moroco.</hi>
His unfortunate Death having ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
his Fortunes, which had not
always been one of the happiest,
he left behind him his Family,
composed of two Daughters and
one Son, without Means or assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
His Widow felt most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
his loss, and finding her self
incapable of giving her Son such
an Education as would suit with
his Birth, she came into this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
followed by her three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to bring them and her Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
at the Feet of <hi>Abdala,</hi> and
humbly to implore his Protection
and Assistance for the Reliques of
a Person who had been so faithful
in his Service. Those Objects
which accompanied <hi>Haly's</hi> sad
Widow, were too moving not to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55010:22"/>
prevail. The Son was but twelve
years of age, the Daughter that
preceded him, thirteen; and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onisa,</hi>
who was the eldest, was
going into her sixteenth. It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for you to imagine, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was so beautiful as she: the
blackness of her Habit added
more Charms unto her Face, and
the King found so much in her
Eyes, though drowned in Tears,
that granting both Means and
Dignities unto the young Prince
<hi>Hily,</hi> he made a Gift far greater
and more precious than all this
unto <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> since it was of that
Heart over which <hi>Roxana</hi> had
till then had an absolute Empire.
He had too much Love, to cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself; and mauger <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi>
Rage and Jealousie, some few
days after he espoused <hi>Cleonisa.</hi>
Thus <hi>Roxana</hi> had the grief to see
her self have a Rival, even an
adored one. As she is ingenious,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55010:23"/>
but very dissembling withal, she
took upon her the Art of feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
she conceal'd her Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with policy, &amp; frequently
visited <hi>Cleonisa</hi> (who presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grew with Child) and became
almost inseparable from her; thus
obscuring under a formal and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Complaisancy, a form'd
design of ruining her, she decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the King and <hi>Cleonisa</hi> also. I
was the only Person that distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her real intentions, and that
feared the evil consequences of
this disguised Friendship: <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi>
Endearments were always
suspected to me, because I knew
her Inclinations: yet all my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection
could not prevent
an accident which had like to
have been of a most dreadful
consequence. The King did
love <hi>Cleonisa</hi> most passionately;
but he feared <hi>Roxana's</hi> evil spirit,
and durst not be wanting in his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55010:23"/>
complaisancy: therefore he was
highly pleased to see them in a
strict union, which to promote
the more, he sought all the means
imaginable, daily procuring them
a thousand various delights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cleonisa's</hi> great Belly taking
away her appetite towards Flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat,
she was complaining one
day of it to <hi>Roxana,</hi> who caused
some Baskets of choice Fruits to
be presented unto her, of which
she did eat with great delight and
satisfaction; but she was scarce
retired to her Apartment, when
she fell into a Distemper, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of which did make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of her Life. I found her in
the arms of her Slaves, without
colour, and almost without moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The King, almost desperate,
came in running. <hi>Roxana</hi> was
one of the first, and of the most
busied in her assistance; but in
her Actions I could observe a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55010:24"/>
Joy mix: and examining
more nearly all Circumstances, I
concluded that the had been poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.
I have some skill in the
choice of Plants, such as I have
found divers times by experience
to be great enemies to Poysons;
and after I had administred a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> I was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the suspicion which I had
had, of the cause of her Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
The Heavens blessed the
means, and the young Princess
seconded their strength; who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
she had vomited the Fruit and
Poyson, remained without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of her Life, but much fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
with the Pains she had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
                  <p>So soon as she could go forth,
she returned to <hi>Roxana's</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with the same assiduity as
she did before, without the least
distrust: but apprehending the
future by the late experience, I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55010:24"/>
resolved to make her Partaker
of my jealousies and fears. My
Fidelity was well known unto
her, and she had reason to conside
in it; so that she fell into such an
astonishment at my Discourse, as
would be difficult for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.
<hi>I confess (said she) that
not mistrusting in the least</hi> Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's
<hi>dissimulation, I should have at
some time or other blindly precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
my self in those ambushes
that she laid for me, had I not
had this timely advertisement.
Madam, you must feign, as she
doth (I replied); but let it be so,
that she may not have the least
distrust of it: Caress the King,
who loves you, and to whom I have
lately given to understand the
same as I have now declared unto
you: Secure your own life, and
that you go with: for I must tell
you, Madam, that</hi> Roxana <hi>is not
onely jealous, but highly ambitious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55010:25"/>
also: She hates you mortally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she sees that you triumph
over her in the Kings Heart; and
fearing lest you should one day
produce a Rival for the Throne
unto</hi> Abdemar, <hi>as there are no
Crimes black enough to strike hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in her, neither will she spare
any means to prevent it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cleonisa</hi> did rellish my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
The King came unto us,
and we took our measures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
That which we
thought the surest way, was to
conceal the time of <hi>Cleonisa's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
that your death might be
feigned. This took happily;
you came into the World, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
you out of the Palace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of such Persons
which I knew to be very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and which I had managed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
to that purpose. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa</hi>
shed such tears at your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as confirmed <hi>Roxana</hi> in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55010:25"/>
belief of your death, which for
the present setled her cruel mind:
but within the term of a year, we
were again in the same trouble,
and <hi>Cleonisa's</hi> second great Belly
did set us in a greater confusion
than was the first: In fine, we
overcame it. <hi>Cleonisa</hi> is tall, her
shape easie; and cruel <hi>Roxana</hi>
was not the onely Person that
was ignorant of her big Belly;
but every body else of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
except the King, two Slaves,
and my self. <hi>Almanzaida</hi> came
into the World with the same
cautions as we had had for you:
I took her from hence also,
though but a Daughter, that I
might hazard nothing. I trusted
her unto a Man of my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
whose Wife had been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
about the same time as <hi>Cleoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.</hi>
Mean time, my Lord, the
tender <hi>Cleonisa</hi> was not long
without entreating me to have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55010:26"/>
you brought secretly into the
Palace. I thought my self too
weak not to be overcome at some
time or other; therefore I rather
chose to cause some sorrow to
<hi>Cleonisa</hi> for some time, than to
hazard your Life, and <hi>Almanzai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi>
also, by telling her that you
were dead, and that the young
Princess had not outlived you
above two Months. She grieved
for you both a long time. I told
the same story to the King, for
fear that through his tenderness
to <hi>Cleonisa</hi> he might have unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her. Six years were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
before I durst introduce you
into the Palace. A supposed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
presented you to <hi>Abdala</hi>
for a Slave: you from that very
moment did please him; and that
high Recompence which he gave
to him that had presented you,
was a sufficient testimony of it.
He commanded me to take the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55010:26"/>
care upon me of your Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and you may easily imagine
what joy I received with that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
In fine, two years after, by
other means, I got the young
Princess also into this Place, to
whom had been given the name
of <hi>Almanzaida</hi> (you bearing that
of <hi>Almanzor</hi>) who was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto <hi>Roxana,</hi> to endeavour by
that means the engagement of her
Affections towards her, through
a familiar frequentation. She took
great care of her; and <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>
has rendered her self so
worthy the affections of all the
World, that she could not refuse
her hers. My dear Prince, this
is that important Secret, of which
your particular Interest made me
the particular Depositary: You
perceive the Reasons which made
me conceal it, though I fear too
long; but I could not foresee
that fatal Engagement, the cause
of your afflictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55010:27"/>Ah, cruel <hi>Aristan, (cried out</hi>
Almanzor, <hi>seeing him silent)</hi> why
did you not abandon me to <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
fury? Ton see that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
disapprove of your pity, since
I am fallen into that sad disaster
of loving my own Sister with a
more than Brotherly love.‚ÄîMy
Sister! <hi>(added he, a moment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi>
Good Gods! How can I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that word, and live? Oh,
thou too charitable Friend, why
did you rescue a Victime from
<hi>Roxana</hi>'s fury, and did not let
it fall unto <hi>Roxana</hi>'s satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the security of <hi>Abdemar</hi>'s
future Reign? How many evils
had you spared me, and sorrows
to your self? What a Life shall I
lead for the future? What quiet
can I ever hope for, being thus
linked to a Passion, which I find
that the name of Brother will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
extinguish in me? <hi>Whatever</hi>
Aristan <hi>could oppose to his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55010:27"/>
or that he could alledge to
moderate the Princes grief, was
all in vain; he could find nothing
in him but a rebellious and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Reason, which would not
permit him to hearken to any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
He conjur'd</hi> Almanzor <hi>to
continue the Secret, and took
upon him to inform</hi> Almanzaida
<hi>of all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is easie to imagine what a
restless night this miserable Prince
had. The next morning he feign'd
himself indisposed, that he might
not be disturbed; and <hi>Aristan</hi>
having found out some opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of entertaining <hi>Almanzaida,</hi>
related unto her the same things
which he had done to <hi>Almanzor</hi>
the day before. Though she was
less passionate than the Prince her
Brother, yet she was not less sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
and if she fell into no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
before <hi>Aristan,</hi> as he had, she,
it is very probable, did it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55010:28"/>
and with as much sorrow.
<hi>Aristan</hi> exhorted her to silence,
till he had disposed the minds of
the most concerned for the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of such surprizing News;
and so he left her, as much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with grief, as was <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor.</hi>
He kept his Chamber three
days, and <hi>Almanzaida</hi> her Bed
during the same time, the better
to conceal a trouble which she
could not overcome: She feared
to see a Brother whom she loved
with too much passion; and this
unfortunate Prince, still fearing
to confound his Sister with his
Mistriss, had not the power to go
towards <hi>Roxana's</hi> Apartment,
though carried on by such power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Motives. At last he resolved
it. Three days of violent sorrow
had made such an impression on
<hi>Almanzor,</hi> as was sufficient to
perswade any one that he had
been sick; and <hi>Almanzaida's</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55010:28"/>
tears had rendered her eyes so
languid, as if she had thus punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them for having carried her
Charms into her Brothers very
Heart. The disconsolate <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>
found her alone, in <hi>Roxana's</hi>
Chamber; and never two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that feared, and yet passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
longed to see one another,
did feel more equal Passions at
their approch. The Princess did
cast down her looks; and <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi>
who under the name of a
Lover, as well as of a Brother,
did still take the same delight in
beholding her, fixed his upon her
Face; and after some moments of
silence, which were employed in
sighing, <hi>Madam,</hi> (said he) <hi>have
you forgot me? have you not one
word for me? will you not speak
to me at this time specially that I
have so much need of your Vertue,
to consolate a Soul so overcome
with sorrow, and grown even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55010:29"/>
by that very advantage
which will prove fatal to me,
though in the same moment infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
glorious.</hi> If I had that
pitch of Vertue which you speak
of <hi>(replied the Princess)</hi> it would
be very useful to my sef at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and you may well imagine,
that being no less surprized, nor
less overcome with Sorrow than
you are, Consolation would be
as necessary for me, as for you:
But, dear Brother, we must seek
for comfort in constancy; and if
I cannot be an example of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
at the receit of so unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a knowledge as we have
lately come to by <hi>Aristan,</hi> but too
long concealed from us, I will at
least serve you, in helping you to
forget that criminal tenderness
which ought not to consist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such Persons as are anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with one and the same Blood.
<hi>Oh, cruel one,</hi> (replied the Prince,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55010:29"/>
looking languishingly upon her)
<hi>I find that it will be easie for you
to effect what you say, since that
you can pronounce with so little
concern that Name which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be expressed by me. What</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>he) shall a few moments be
capable to extinguish those Fires,
that I have had so much pains in
a long assidnity to kindle? And I
foresee that you will easily be
brought to look with some indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
upon that Person who, though
a Slave, you had preferred to a
Prince. I see,</hi> Almanzaida, <hi>that
you onely thought you loved me,
but never did it really. I shall
profit but little of the advice you
would give me; and though the
merciless Fates have determined,
that I must never be more than a
Brother to you, yet they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
force my passionate affections
from you, but that I shall ever love
you, as I have always done: For it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55010:30"/>
is but just, that since you have
changed onely in Name, but have
preserved all your Beauties, I shou'd
likewise preserve my Love, after
the loss of all my Hopes.</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
(<hi>replied</hi> Almanzaida, <hi>sighing</hi>)
would punish you, should you do
what you say; and being what
we are, such a Love can remain
no longer innocent. <hi>Alas! what
more cruel Griefs than those I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
at present, can happen to me?</hi>
(repli'd the Prince) <hi>It is not death
that I wish for, though it would be
far more welcom to me than life, as
I look upon it at present. Know,
Madam, that the more I reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what has past, the more horror
I have for the future. You know,
that through your bounty, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the obscurity of my Birth, and
all that could afflict a Man whose
Soul was sufficiently raised above
the Vulgar, I was become sensible
to my Passion onely. You are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55010:30"/>
also, Madam, that proud of
that preferency which you had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me above</hi> Abdemar, <hi>I esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my self incomparably more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
than him with all his Dignities.
And can you think, that this so
passionate and constant Heart, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it self unto a timid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
would sacrifice unto it such a
Passion as is to out-last all Sorrows,
and even Time it self? In such a
case, the Resignation would be a
Crime; and doubtless that Love
must be but very superficial, that
can so soon be laid aside. But you,</hi>
Almanzaida, <hi>you that have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
me with your Love, or that
at least would have made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
such a thing in you, is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that you should so soon be at
an agreement with that thing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Decency, so that a meer scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can so suddenly triumph over
your Heart? and that in the midst
of all my sorrows, I have not so
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55010:31"/>
much left me, as the bare comfort
to think, that this surprising
change has been unwelcom to you?</hi>
Good my Lord, <hi>(replied the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)</hi>
do not thus pierce into a
weakness which is so difficult for
me to conceal. I seek how to
cure, and not how to afflict you.
But you, my Lord, do not do me
that Justice. I hid my Tears from
you; yet you are so cruel as to
lay all your Sorrows open to me,
and add to them such Reproches
as I do not deserve. Can you
imagine, that she that preferred
you before the Prince <hi>Abdemar,</hi>
at that very time also when your
Chains were your greatest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did but indifferently love
you? Can you believe, that that
Preferency was the effect of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
Heart, not firm in its Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions?
No, Sir, you know not
<hi>Almanzaida:</hi> I share your Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
am no less sensible of them
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55010:31"/>
than your self; but they are past
remedie, and I can see nothing but
Time and Reason that can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them: Let us wait the one,
and endeavour to make use of the
other; and in the mean time, my
Lord, in pity of me, moderate a
Passion that overcomes me, and
be assured, that I am not of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
strength to bear, without
dying, both your Sorrows, and
my own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almanzaida</hi> was going on,
when the Prince <hi>Abdemar</hi> came
in: He presently cast such Looks
on <hi>Almanzor</hi> as were full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation;
but straight smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up again at the sight of
the Princess, whom he had not
seen of three days before, he
took notice of a change in her
Face; and then perceiving <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor's</hi>
trouble, he knew not what
to attribute it unto: and being
but too well persuaded of their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55010:32"/>
reciprocal Love, he imagined that
their sadness proceeded from the
despair of ever being happy in
the enjoyment of each other:
And it is probable, that in this
imagination he might have flown
into some Passion against <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi>
had not <hi>Roxana</hi> come in.
<hi>Almanzor</hi> withdrew himself, and
passing through a Gallery that
led into <hi>Cleonisa's</hi> Apartments, he
met her as she was coming out of
them. Though she was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of his Condition, she
had a most tender affection for
him, and making him sign to draw
near, <hi>As I have always been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in your Interest,</hi> Almanzor,
(said she) <hi>I must now give you a
most important advice, while I
have the opportunity of speaking to
you in private. You love</hi> Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida;
Abdemar <hi>is your Rival,
who intends (in order to your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
separation from her) to get
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55010:32"/>
the King to enfranchize you, so to
turn you out of the Palace, and out
of</hi> Moroco <hi>also. This I learned
from his own mouth some days
since, I being hid in a place where
I overheard him, while he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoursing
of it with Zais, who
doubtless is of his Secrets. What
Charms soever Liberty can put on,
I am of opinion that you would
find but little content in them,
whilst separated from</hi> Almanzai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.
<hi>I was glad of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of giving you this Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that you may take your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
against</hi> Abdemar <hi>and</hi> Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's
<hi>Designs, who will not sail in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately
to execute whatever
her Son shall require.</hi> During
<hi>Cleonisa's</hi> Discourse, the Prince
found himself agitated in divers
manners, and was often upon the
point of discovering all <hi>Aristan's</hi>
Secrets unto her; but remembring
that he had promised the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55010:33"/>
he kept them still within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>I am infinitely obliged to your
Bounties, Madam,</hi> (said he) <hi>and
I know nothing in the World that
I would not do, to render me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it. It is certain, that I love</hi>
Almanzaida; <hi>and it is no less
true, that</hi> Abdemar <hi>is my Rivalin
it: But, Madam, neither he nor I
can have any further hopes: Some
day you may learn the surprising
cause of it: Mean time, Madam,
continue to protect a miserable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who is threatned with so many
misfortunes; watch also for</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida.
<hi>Cleonisa</hi> could return
no answer, because some body
came by; so that <hi>Almanzor</hi> was
forced to retire himself; and she
went into <hi>Roxana's</hi> Apartment,
amazed at his Discourse, where
she found <hi>Almanzaida</hi> all in tears.
<hi>Abdemar,</hi> transported with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
was resolved to break off
all Converse between <hi>Almanzor</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55010:33"/>
and <hi>Almanzaida;</hi> and having
found <hi>Roxana</hi> in a fit humour to
open his Designs to her, he told
her, That they had a confirmed
private Intrigue between them,
which for some discontents against
<hi>Almanzor,</hi> he intreated her to
break off, and to forbid him her
Apartment. <hi>Roxana</hi> was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Enemy to all the Worlds
quiet, and glad of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of troubling two Persons
that loved one another, she assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her Son, that she would not
onely forbid <hi>Almanzor</hi> her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that she would also turn
him out of the Palace, for having
secret Amours there, and even
out of <hi>Moroco</hi> also, if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
it. <hi>Abdemar</hi> went forth
well satisfied with this assurance;
and <hi>Roxana</hi> having caused <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida</hi>
to be called, <hi>I should
never have believed</hi> (said she to
her) <hi>that forgetting that Vertne in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55010:34"/>
which you have been educated, you
would have lent an ear after amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Propositions, and bound your
self in an Intrigue of Love with
one of the Kings Slaves: yet it is
but too true, that it is so; and the
audacious</hi> Almanzor, <hi>abusing of
those Privileges which my Bounty
and</hi> Abdala's <hi>Favours had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him above many others, has
been so bold as to seduce your Heart
in this very place. I am convinced
of this by unquestionable assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and it is with trouble that I
speak it. I had conceived a sincere
affection for you from your very
Infancy; and looking upon you
with the Eyes of a Mother, rather
than of a Mistris, I had designed
something more than a Slave for
you: But since your Heart has made
an unworthy choice, and would
not stay for mine, all that you
must hope from it, is, that</hi> Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor
<hi>shall turn out of this Palace,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55010:34"/>
never to enter into it again; and
moreover, I shall not onely deprive
you of those advantages which I
intended you, but of my Esteem
and Friendship also.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Almanzaida's</hi> Heart was but
too sensible, to endure with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>Roxana's</hi> Taunis; she was
conscious of her own innocence,
and had always lived with <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>
in such a manner, as deserved
Praises, rather than Reproches.
Therefore looking on <hi>Roxana</hi> as
on a Person that would have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to her own Fury both <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa</hi>
and <hi>Almanzor,</hi> with a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that had some mixture of
scorn in it; Madam, <hi>(said she)</hi> I
neither deserve your Reproches,
nor your Menaces; and my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
have ever been so much
to Vertue, that peradventure I
have even outgone those Lessons
which were given me therein. I
have no commerce that can make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55010:35"/>
me blush; and I dare tell you,
Madam, (whar Respects soever I
owe you) that you never did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in me any thing that could
give you any disadvantageous
thoughts of <hi>Almanzaida.</hi> I speak
with that freedom, Madam, which
perhaps is not wholly sutable to
my Condition, but which is very
conformable to the motions of my
Heart, and to those sensible
wrongs which I do not deserve,
neither, know I any Power that
can make me to suffer them. I have
made no unworthy Choice, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;
and mauger the obscurity
of my Birth, knowing my Soul
sufficiently raised above the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
I leave the success of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny
unto the protection of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
I hope the Gods will accept
of it, and procure me the means
of justifying my self. But, Madam,
though you should unhappily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
me of your Protection, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55010:35"/>
such groundless suspicions, I
should endeavour to consolate my
self of such a disgrace as I had
not drawn upon my self, and that
I had not deserved. <hi>I know not</hi>
(replied <hi>Roxana,</hi> fretted at <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida's</hi>
Answer) <hi>which of us two
is the Queen, and which the Slave:
Yet when I consider you, I can see
nothing but the effects of my Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and</hi> Almanzor's <hi>Mistriss.</hi> I
know what I am, Madam, <hi>(replied</hi>
Almanzaida, <hi>resolved to justifie
her self)</hi> I acknowledge my self
your Slave: But if my Person is
obliged to you, it was for protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a miserable wretch, destinated
to bear your Chains, and to serve
you; and I am sensible enough,
that this servile condition requires
nothing but submission in me:
But, Madam, my Heart and my
Condition are at odds, and I may
say, that the one is the wreck of
the other; and if I believe my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55010:36"/>
Heart, which is impatient of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
wrong, if I am no Queen, at
least I am not descen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed from a
place much inferiour to a Throne.
<hi>A Conquest so Illustrious as that
of</hi> Almanzor (replied <hi>Roxana</hi>
scornfully) <hi>cannot inspire lower
thoughts. Almanzor (replied the
Princess)</hi> has a Vertue that would
justifie all those that I have for
him. <hi>I know</hi> (interrupted <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana)
that Vertue does affect you so,
as to make you fancy your self
the more considerable for it; but
such weak Imaginations move no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Commiseration: and for
my part, I pitty you, for losing in
one day that precious Lovers sight,
with all the hopes of ever seeing
him again. Go, shut up your shame,
and hide it from my sight, and
the rest of the Worlds also.</hi> At
these words <hi>Almanzaida</hi> retired,
anger drawing a deluge of tears
from her fair Eyes, which was the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55010:36"/>
condition that <hi>Cleonisa</hi> had found
her in. She endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her, and to learn the cause of
her troubles. <hi>Almanzaida</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her of it, not mentioning
in the least <hi>Aristan's</hi> Secret,
though not without great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
<hi>Cleonisa</hi> was moved at

she) since I was advertising <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi>
of what you were both
to fear: but, my dear <hi>Almanzai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
what Service can I render
you?</q> 
                     <q>The most cosiderable
that I can expect from your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,

mine (replied the amiable <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa)</hi>
are too different, to have
the same Motives: I have but
too much cause to believe her
unjust; and though I were not
so satisfied as I am of your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55010:37"/>
her bare Accusations would
be sufficient to confirm your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence

use all the means they can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to deliver me from these

                     <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa</hi>

the Princess, that she would
act as she desired; for <hi>Roxana's</hi>

retire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> said not a word to <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa</hi>

that the business should

Answer had so strangely netled
her, that she could entertain no

she could not seek out <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi>
her self, so soon as she was

Note, which she gave to an old
Eunuch to deliver unto him, in
which were these words.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>To ALMANZOR.</head>
                        <p>A Most important Businesse is
the cause that I must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55010:38"/>
see you this day; having
such things to impart to you, as
are not to be confided to Paper.
Meet me within two hours at the
Fountain of the Labyrinth: I
shall not fail to be there, and to
let you know whether your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
are dear unto me, and what
thoughts there are of you in the
Bosom of</p>
                        <closer>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>What a World of Troubles
did this innocent Letter cause in
<hi>Abdala's</hi> Palace? The Slave <hi>Tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara</hi>
did carry it in his Hand so
that it might easily be perceived,
and was passing into the Kings
Apartment to seek out <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
when he met <hi>Roxana,</hi> whose su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
Eyes were immediately
cast upon the Note. <q>What Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
are you going about, <hi>Tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara,</hi>
(said she to the Slave)?
What is that Paper you carry?</q>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:55010:38"/>
He not answering, and seeming
perplexed, rendred <hi>Roxana</hi> the
more curious, who took the Note
out of his Hand, with no further
consideration than of her own
satisfaction, with which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into her Apartment. <hi>Tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara</hi>
durst not inform <hi>Cleonisa</hi> of
the truth of the business, but gave
her to understand that he had lost
the Note, after he had made a
fruitless search for <hi>Almanzor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> whose spirit was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
wicked, presently suspected
that <hi>Cleonisa</hi> had some private
concerns with <hi>Almanzor;</hi> and
howsoever she had hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
her thoughts, it is most
certain that she always hated her,
seeing with rage and spite her
Merits to reign so powerfully
over <hi>Abdala's</hi> Heart: being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
of having this opportunity
of ruining so dreadful an Enemy
as she esteemed <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> she put
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55010:39"/>
up the Note for the present, not
without a world of revengeful
thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Mean time this accident, and
the night coming on, had broke
all <hi>Cleonisa'</hi> Measures; and what
desire soever she had of serving
<hi>Almanzaida,</hi> she was forced to
stay till Morning, to advertise
<hi>Almanzor</hi> of her desires to speak
with him: While she was musing
which way to compass it, (a Note
having already been lost) <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>
in her solitude overcome
with sorrow, <hi>Almanzor</hi> suffering
still at the same rate, uncapable
of comfort, <hi>Roxana</hi> was not
idle: <hi>Abdala</hi> coming into her
Chamber that night, according to
his custom, she could no longer
defer giving the first onset unto
<hi>Cleonisa's</hi> Happiness: <q>My Lord,
(said she to <hi>Abdala,</hi> with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
sorrow) it is with great
reluctancy that I am obliged to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55010:39"/>
inform you of a Business which
will be unpleasing to you; and
were not your Honour interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it, I would not be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in any trouble to
you: But, my Lord, your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is concerned in it; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
be the event, you are not
to be long kept from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that <hi>Cleonisa</hi> is false to
you, and that it is <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
whom you love as your own
Child, that insolent Slave, that
dishonours you, and entertains
a secret Traffick of Love with
her. Ah, Madam, (said the
King, struck with her words as
with Thunder) do not distrust
<hi>Cleonisa's</hi> Vertue, and <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor's</hi>
Fidelity.</q> 
                     <q>You know <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onisa's</hi>
Character, (replied <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
giving him the Note) Read.</q>
At this sight <hi>Abdala</hi> had much to
do to believe his own Eyes: He
loved <hi>Cleonisa</hi> more than ever he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55010:40"/>
had loved <hi>Roxana,</hi> and <hi>Almanzor</hi>
had always been in a manner as
dear to him as <hi>Abdemar;</hi> and
those kind thoughts he had for
them, making them seem much
the more guilty, <q>Ah, persidious,
(cried he) you shall both perish,
and your criminal Lives shall
revenge me of so sensible a
wrong. Does <hi>Cleonisa</hi> thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
me? and is it <hi>Almanzor</hi>
that seduces her? This is too
much, and I will no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Decree of their Ruine.</q>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> who politickly weighed
all things, did fear that if this
Business should break forth more
publickly, it might so happen that
a Justification would destroy her
Designs, retained the King as he
was going forth to pronounce
their deaths, and craftily gave
him to understand, that he was
not to publish an Affront which
would grow greater by being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55010:40"/>
This Advice did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
allay <hi>Abdala's</hi> rage, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into his Apartment. At the
same instant <hi>Abdemar</hi> came in, and
<hi>Roxana</hi> renewed her pleasure, in
repeating to him what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
He believed nothing of it,
and was too well skilled in tender
Affections, to believe that those
which <hi>Almanzor</hi> had for <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>
were not real: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would have perswaded his
Mother, that <hi>Cleonisa's</hi> Note was
more mysterious than guilty, and
that she ought not to expose her
to the Fury of the King, without
a further search into the Business
had first been made: But in stead
of receiving this good advice, she
accused him of timidity and
weakness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdala</hi> passed that Night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rest; and the great Love he
resented for <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for <hi>Almnazor,</hi> made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55010:41"/>
them the more deserving
death, which he was preparing for
them. <hi>Aristan</hi> had hitherto been
the sole Depositary of all his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;
but he would not make
him partaker of this last: he was
<hi>Almanzors</hi> Adorer, and <hi>Cleonisa's</hi>
faithful Agent, who had too great
a liberty with him, not to employ
all his Interests in their behalf.
Thus did all things concur to
both their ruines; who not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what was preparing for
them, were entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all that had hapned the
day before. <hi>Almanzor</hi> returned a
thousand thanks to <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> for
what she had done for him; and
being sensible of those ill things
which <hi>Roxana</hi> was contriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Almanzaida,</hi> he took leave
of <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> to go seek <hi>Aristan,</hi>
to conjure him to declare a Secret
that could not have more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequences when publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55010:41"/>
than it had already. The
Eunuch, to please the Prince, run
immediately to the King, who
having resolved not to see him
till after he had executed his
Designs, feigned to be sick, and
pretended to repose; so that the
Fates had a full scope to bring
this Adventure to the last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
<hi>Almanzor</hi> was past all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
at these delays; he durst
no longer cast his Eyes towards
the place which contained <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida:</hi>
Imperious <hi>Roxana</hi>
was insulting over <hi>Cleonisa;</hi> and
<hi>Abdemar</hi> durst not complain of
not seeing <hi>Almanzaida,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
drawn this evil upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>Mean time, the incensed King
would no longer defer his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and the evening of that
same day the Executioners of
such private Deaths had Orders
given them to deprive <hi>Cleonisa</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:55010:42"/>
and <hi>Almanzor</hi> of their Lives.
<hi>Roxana</hi> was suddenly informed
of the Sentence, and so was feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ambitious thoughts with
the pleasure of Reigning solely.
She would have the satisfaction
to acquaint <hi>Almanzaida</hi> first, of
that thing which she thought
would be the most sensible to her
in the World: She sent for her,
and not forbearing at <hi>Abdemar</hi>'s
arrival, because she no longer
feared the revocation of those
Orders that had been given, and
`tis probable already executed,
she informed the sorrowful <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida</hi>
both of the Deaths
and pretended Infidelities of her
Lover, and of <hi>Cleonisa.</hi> This
unexpected News had like to
have cost the Princess her Life;
she fell upon a Couch that was
near her, without colour or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Abdemar</hi> run to her, and
discovered unto his Mother, by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55010:42"/>
that diligence he used, what she
had never mistrusted. <hi>Roxana</hi>'s
Slaves did second those Cares
which he took to succour her;
and while some were flinging of
Water in her Face, and others
tearing off her Clothes, <hi>Abdala,</hi>
mortally troubled at what was
going to be done, came into
<hi>Roxana</hi>'s Chamber, and found
<hi>Almanzaida</hi> in that desperate
condition: He learned the cause
of it, and judged <hi>Almanzor</hi>
the
more deserving death, in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not onely his Bounties, but
the beautiful <hi>Almanzaida</hi> also;
who at last came out of her
swoon, having gathered some
strength through an effect of the
very same Sorrow that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
her of it before: How
beautiful did she appear? and
how difficult it was to see her in
that strange disorder, and not be
infinitely moved at it? The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55010:43"/>
of her Dress, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidness
of her Eyes, her Tears,
her sorrowful Complaints, and,
in a word, all her Actions, did
contribute in exciting both Love
and Commiseration at the same
time. The discomposure that
she found her self in before the
King, did not prevent her from
casting her self down at his Feet,
<hi>Ah, Sir,</hi> (said she to him) <hi>preserve</hi>
Cleonisa, <hi>and do not lose</hi> Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,
<hi>if you will not expose your
self to a remorse more cruel than
their deaths. Almanzaida (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi>
Abdala) I ought to revenge
my self of a most ungrateful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and deliver you from a
perfidious Man, who is unworthy
of your Tears, and that deserves
a thousand deaths more cruel
than that which is going to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his Crimes. <hi>He is not perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
Sir,</hi> (cried she); <hi>he is your
own Blood, your son, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55010:43"/>
Cleonisa, <hi>who by</hi> Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<hi>'s
treachery, after so many years
of distrusts and precautions, falls
at last the victime to her fury.
Yes, Sir,</hi> Almanzor <hi>is your Son,
and that unfortunate Creature that
speaks to you at this present is his
Sister, your Daughter, Sir: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, Sir, and</hi> Aristan <hi>shall
confirm it; it is he who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by experience of what we
were to fear from</hi> Roxana<hi>'s rage,
deceived you, to preserve us:
These are the Criminals that you
sacrifice to her satisfaction. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida</hi>'s
Discourse found not
any thing in <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Heart that
could resist it; and those tender
affections which he always had
for <hi>Almanzor,</hi> were convincing
proofs that he was his Blood: It
would be difficult to express his
grief; and the first word that he
spake, was to bid <hi>Abdemar</hi> hasten
to render him a Service more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55010:44"/>
than his Life, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
with all diligence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s death, and <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s
also, if it were yet time;
bidding him remember that he
was his Brother, and worthy of
that Title by a thousand Vertues.
<hi>Abdemar</hi> deferred not a moment
to obey; he was generous, and
really moved with what he had
but just learned, he flew to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa</hi>'s
Apartment. Mean time
<hi>Roxana</hi> seeing <hi>Abdala</hi> busied in
giving <hi>Almanzaida</hi> some Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his Affections, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
with an inward rage on
the sudden change that some few
words had brought to this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and was seeking in her Heart
and Spirit, ingenious to all evil,
some means by which she might
invalidate <hi>Aristan</hi>'s Testimony,
and render it of no effect, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it pass for a feigned Story,
who in a days space did bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55010:44"/>
to life not onely that Child
of <hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s which she her self
had thought dead coming into
the World, but another also, of
whose Life she was wholly ignorant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdemar</hi> came happily to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisa</hi>'s
rescue, who constant in her
adversities, was writing her last
thoughts unto <hi>Abdala.</hi> He staid
with her no longer than to make
known that the Orders were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed,
and run immediately to
<hi>Almanzor</hi>'s Lodgings; but it was
too late, and his Executioners,
more diligent than <hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found him upon his Bed, had
mercilesly strangled him there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdemar</hi> moved at so deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a fate, could not stay his Eyes
on so dreadful a Spectacle; and
too certain of a Truth which so
afflicted him, he returned to <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>'s
Apartment: <hi>I have staid too
long, Sir,</hi> (said he to the King)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55010:45"/>
Cleonisa <hi>lives, but</hi> Almanzor <hi>is
breathless.</hi> At these fatal words
he King resented his Sorrows to
the quick, and repented that he
had so lightly given credit to
<hi>Roxana</hi>'s perfidiousness: The
beauteous <hi>Almanzaida</hi> found her
self in the heighth of extremity
also. <hi>Abdemar,</hi> whose affections
unto her had given way to a real
tenderness, did wholly lay upon
himself the cause of all these evils,
and being moved with a sincere
penitency, did reproch unto <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
her barbarousness, unto which
the King added his resentments;
and certainly nothing in the
world could be more touching,
than to hear all that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. In fine, <hi>Abdala</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
from a place in which <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>'s
presence did but augment
his sorrow, and went to <hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s
Apartment, leading the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>Almanzaida</hi> along with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55010:45"/>
him; where they found the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
as composed, as if she had
had nothing to fear: but she soon
ceased to be so, when she learned
at once both the Life and Death
of her dear Son: It was her Hand
that had sacrificed him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that fatal Note <hi>Roxana</hi> could
not have destroyed him. In vain
did the King endeavour to recal
her Fortitude by his Embraces;
<hi>Almanzor</hi> was no more, and
though innocent of his death,
she looked upon her self as the
cause of it. <hi>Since that your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
distrusts</hi> (said she to the
King)  <hi>have caused me so much
sorrow as nothing can ever conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
me, and that the unfortunate</hi>
Almanzor <hi>was not rescued from
furious</hi> Roxana<hi>'s rage, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a more noble Victime to her
cruelty; and that without enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the happiness of his Life, I
have all the sorrows that such a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55010:46"/>
death could produce, suffer at least
that I may give unto his Heart,
as cold as it is, such Embraces as
I could not give unto him living.</hi>
At these words, without staying
for <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Answer, she went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Slaves Quarters, and
had already crossed some Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that made the distance bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween
the Kings and the Womens
Apartment, when she perceived
<hi>Aristan,</hi> with that beloved Son
which she was lamenting, and
whose supposed loss was going in
all probability to cause hers
effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.
She was no sooner cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of his Life, but that she gave
a full scope to all her Joys, and
to the tenderness of her Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the King was no less sensible
of this Happiness: But <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida,</hi>
notwithstanding her reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
to the contrary, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it in a manner which it is
like was yet more eminent than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55010:46"/>
the rest. <hi>Aristan</hi> in few words
did clear more amply that Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which had preserved two such
precious Lives, and did receive
such Eulogies from all as his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
did deserve. <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
surprised at so many Accidents,
could not be taken off from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on the dangers unto
which <hi>Cleonisa</hi> had been expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
As for his part, he found
his Soul in such a condition, as
made him look upon Death as a
refuge, and not as an evil. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
and expressions of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were often repeated on all
sides; but the Princess <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida,</hi>
who knew by her own
experience what Sorrows <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>
did yet feel for her, durst
scarcely look upon him.</p>
                  <p>Mean time it was unhappy
<hi>Yoxana</hi> who had received that
sad fate which was intended for
<hi>Almanzor:</hi> He had found the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55010:47"/>
Princes Chamber open, and
while he was walking with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>
in the Garden, he had thrown
himself upon his Bed, where the
Executioners had strangled him,
taking him for <hi>Almanzor. Tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara</hi>'s
loss was not significant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to disturb so much joy.
After <hi>Abdala</hi> had left <hi>Cleonisa</hi> in
her Apartment, where he also
parted with <hi>Almanzaida,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
himself unto his also; and
<hi>Abdemar,</hi> who had nothing but
Brotherly Affection for <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi>
would not part from him;
he being not capable of so strong
a Passion as his Brother, his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
overcame his Love: But <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi>
was less conformable; he
was more in love than ever: and
while the rest were at quiet, his
share was Tears and Sighs.</p>
                  <p>The next morning he rendered
his Dovoirs unto the King, and
in the next place to <hi>Cleonisa;</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55010:47"/>
who seeing now her Happiness
above her own desires and hopes,
did continually ply <hi>Almanzaida</hi>
with Caresses. That amiable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
did answer her favoors with
a world of affection, but with as
much sadness; so that <hi>Cleonisa</hi>
was perswaded, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of her Fortune had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
her Heart to its Liberty,
and that <hi>Almanzor</hi> did still hold
there a larger place than the name
of a Brother would admit of:
<hi>Almanzor</hi>'s presence did confirm
her in that Opinion; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness,
her Eyes would speak
another Language than that of
Friendship unto the passionate
<hi>Almanzor.</hi> This mutual Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did not trouble <hi>Cleonisa,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than as it had relation to
their quiet; and being confident
in both their Vertues, she knew
that she had no cause to fear of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55010:48"/>
that side: therefore she busied
her thoughts in healing of such
Evils which a long Error had
contracted: But he was incapable
of it; neither Time, nor <hi>Cleoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>'s
and <hi>Aristan</hi>'s Cares, could
obtain any thing upon his strong
Impressions; but forgetting eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment that <hi>Almanzaida</hi> was
his Sister, he did speak to her of
his Love: and the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
being sometimes deluded by
a too powerful Charm, did hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto him without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and did daily more and more
plunge her self into an Abyss,
whence it was impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
her.</p>
                  <p>Mean time <hi>Roxana</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s Prosperity with
rage; and never were so many
attempts made for the ruine of
her happiness, as then: But all
too late; <hi>Abdala</hi> was convinced
of the Vertue of the one, and of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55010:48"/>
the others evil Designs: and it is
likely that he had resented <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
wickedness in an higher mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
yet, but that he looked upon
her as on <hi>Abdemar</hi>'s Mother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almanzor</hi> of a Slave had taken
upon him the Name and Rank of
Prince, but not the Pride; and
as in his mean condition he had
the Art of pleasing all the World,
it was not difficult for any Person
to add to that esteem they had
always had for him, those respects
due to his Birth. <hi>Aristan</hi> seeing
his Designs come so forward, did
look upon his good Success with
delight; onely <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Passion did intermix some
discontents with it: He was
thinking on the small hopes there
was of curing him, when he was
advertised, that a Stranger asked
to speak with him: He gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he should be brought in; and
no sooner had he cast his Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55010:49"/>
him- than he knew him to be
that Person to whom he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
<hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s first Years.
As he had ever found him most
faithful to all his Secrets, he did
entertain such thoughts of him as
were full of Acknowledgments;
so that he embraced him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the first testimonies of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he offered him his Services at
<hi>Moroco,</hi> in all that he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
<hi>I am perswaded</hi> (replied
<hi>Zideus) that you would generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
serve a Person in whom you did
once repose the highest confidence:
but, as the case stands now, it is
on no particular Interest that I
come here at present.</hi> Aristan, <hi>I
have a business of the highest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to impart to you, the mystery
of which I conjure you to pardon
me, since that all my intentions
in it, have been but to save you
from much sorrow. That Child
with whom you had intrusted me,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55010:49"/>
was not the same I returned you
back, Death bereaved us of it
within six months after you had
committed it to our care; and I
being informed of its Birth, I
guess'd at the sorrow that you
would have for the loss of it;
which to prevent for the present,
I supplied the place of the King
of</hi> Moroco<hi>'s Daughter, by another
young Princess, reduced to seek
for succour, and exiled from her
very Birth, through extraordinary
events, since it had pleased the
Heavens to intrust her into our
Hands. I did it,</hi> Aristan; <hi>and
the Age was so well sitted, that
you were not sensible of the change
which I had put upon you. But
now pray bearken unto the Story
of that Person after whom I am
now come to inquire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You are not ignorant, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benzais</hi>
King of <hi>Fez</hi> was driven
from his Kingdom some twenty
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55010:50"/>
years since, by the ambitious <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat;</hi>
and that he unhappily ended
his days, being about to defend the
Remains both of his and his Queen
<hi>Zaira</hi>'s Liberty. The Queen was
then with Child, and near the time
of her Delivery, when the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Albenzais</hi> lost his life; the
sorrows of his Queen ended hers
also, presently after that she had
brought a Daughter into the World.
I was born in <hi>Europe,</hi> but had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
my self from my youth unto
<hi>Albenzais</hi> his Service, and was
married unto one of those Persons
whom <hi>Zaira</hi> did most consider:
We were the onely two that did not
abandon them in their Adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and it was into our Hands
(in the presence of Prince <hi>Orti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
Brother unto <hi>Albenzais,</hi> who
had never for saken her) that the
dying Queen deposited that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Creature which she had newly
brought into the World, entreating
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55010:50"/>
us to conceal her from <hi>Morat</hi>'s
knowledge, and to retire into some
unknown place, to wait for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fortune. <hi>Ortisis</hi> extremely
grieved at the Queens death, sent
us away without delay, assuring me,
that either he would perish in the
attempt, or tear <hi>Albenzais</hi> his
Scepter from the unjust <hi>Morat</hi>'s
Hands, and restore it unto that
new-born Babe his Brother's
Daughter. Thus we parted from
<hi>Ortisis,</hi> who some time after was
taken by the Agents of <hi>Morat,</hi> as
he was on a Design, and shut up in
a close Prison, in which he did
languish for a long time.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, that I might
not be far from some place where
I might hear News from <hi>Fez,</hi> I
come to <hi>Moroco,</hi> where I met with
you, and where you were pleased
to take me into your Friendship:
My Wife did appear to you a fit
Person to take upon her the care of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55010:51"/>
                     <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Daughter: but when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her death, I had given you the
Princess of <hi>Fez</hi> in lieu of her, I
was well satisfied as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
and finding my self use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
at <hi>Moroco,</hi> I took a Voyage,
and at my return learned that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisis</hi>
had escaped out of <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>son. I
made some stay at <hi>Fez,</hi> and
through my care and diligence did
learn the place of his retreat. I
came to him, he received me
kindly; and I was the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
when I assured him of the
Princesses Life. In sine, after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
years of needless Cautions,
and of Secret Enterprizes, one
has taken effect, in which <hi>Morat</hi>
the Vsurper has been massacred by
the People of <hi>Fez,</hi> tired with the
Oppressions; of his Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
after whose death, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisis</hi>
has no sooner appeared, but
the Name of <hi>Albenzais,</hi> and his
also, have been repeated a thousand
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55010:51"/>
times. He generously refusing the
Crown, has assured the Chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, That there was a
Daughter of <hi>Albenzais's</hi> living, in
whom his Memory was to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated;
That for his part, he had
taken up the Sword but as its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positary,
till the arrival of the
Princess. <hi>Thus presenting some
Papers to</hi> Aristan; This is <hi>(conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
he)</hi> the Prince <hi>Ortisis</hi> his
Testimony, with a Note of the
Queens, which will confirm the
truth of my Relation.</p>
                  <p>The Eunuch was so amazed at
this Discourse, as to remain some
time in a profound silence: But
after he had read the Letters,
being fully perswaded of a thing
in which there was so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of truth, <hi>Ah,</hi> Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,
(cried he, thinking on the
joy this would bring to the
Prince) <hi>what happy News are here
for you?</hi> And being unwilling to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55010:52"/>
lose a moments time of publishing
them, in few words he informed
<hi>Zideus</hi> of <hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and gave him also some light
Informations of what had passed
of her Concern. So conducting
him into the Kings presence, they
found <hi>Almanzor</hi> entring the
Chamber, with such a consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spirits, as did speak him
worse than ever he had been yet.
<hi>Will you thus for ever give your
self over to sorrow, Sir,</hi> (said <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristan</hi>
to him)? <hi>and will you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
endeavour to overcome it?</hi> I
should attempt Impossibilities
<hi>(replied the Prince)</hi> should I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
it; but as the Cause has been
from my Infancy, and as it were
born with me, so neither can it
end but with my Life. <hi>Hope
better things, my Lord,</hi> (replied
<hi>Aristan); Here is a Man, Sir, that
boasts of curing you, if you please;
but will not undertake a Business
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55010:52"/>
of such importance, but in the
King's presence.</hi> Ah, (<hi>cried out</hi>
Almanzor) save me at once both
the labour and confusion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him of what passe in my
Breast. At these words they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
where they found <hi>Abdemar</hi>
onely with the King; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
conceiving, that this Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
did not present himself thus
without Orders, but on some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
account, expected to
learn the occasion, when <hi>Aristan</hi>
informed the King of the business.
During the Relation, never was
Man more hearkned unto than he
was by <hi>Almanzor,</hi> neither was
there ever so pleasing a surprize
as this. <hi>Zideus</hi> his Relation, the
Queen of <hi>Fez</hi>'s Note, and the
Letters from <hi>Ortisis,</hi> did joyntly
confirm the truth, and removed
all doubts. <hi>Abdala</hi> was the first
that congratulated <hi>Almanzor</hi>
with these surprising News, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55010:53"/>
immediately went with <hi>Aristan</hi>
and <hi>Zideus</hi> unto <hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to inform her and <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>
of a thing that would so
strangely surprize them. During
their stay in that place, <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi>
in the midst of his Joys,
thinking on <hi>Abdemar</hi>'s concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
in his Amours, fell into a
sudden melancholy, of which the
Prince could not forbear asking
him the cause. <hi>Almanzor</hi> ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
confessed, that he feared a
return of <hi>Abdemar</hi>'s amorous
Flames, which he might reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fear would re-kindle, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because his own had never
suffered the least decay. <hi>Abdemar</hi>
did assure him, in so obliging a
manner, that he was free, and that
he had no other Affections left
for <hi>Almanzaida,</hi> but such as
might become a Brother, that far
from opposing in the least his
Happiness, he would seek all the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55010:53"/>
ways imaginable to contribute to
it. The King by his return did
further confirm <hi>Almanzor</hi> in his
Happiness, in promising him the
possession of the Princess of <hi>Fez;</hi>
to that purpose immediately send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back with <hi>Zideus</hi> some of the
most considerable of his Officers
to advertise the Prince <hi>Ortisis</hi> of
the state of things, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of him the Princess of <hi>Fez</hi>
for <hi>Almanzor,</hi> he being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Person on whom she did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
                  <p>Mean time <hi>Almanzor</hi> run to
<hi>Cleonisa</hi>'s Apartment: she took
no small part in his contentment,
and was somewhat consolated of
the loss of her own Daughter, by
the consideration that her Son
should possess the beautiful <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaida;</hi>
to whom he having
expressed part of those Joys he
felt, he went from her Apartment
into that in which was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55010:54"/>
of <hi>Fez,</hi> whom he found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
company: Their contented
looks did speak to each other a
mutual joy; but being both fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with various thoughts, they
kept a profound silence for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time, before they could
express themselves; which was
first broke by <hi>Almanzor,</hi> in these
words: <hi>Madam,</hi> (said he) <hi>all my
Happiness has its whole dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on you onely; and the same
happy Fate which has brought us
out of that confusion in which all
my hopes were lost, without the
least decay or alteration in my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
does assist me to bring at
your Feet both my Love and my
Hopes, here prostrating my self, to
demand of the Queen of</hi> Fez <hi>a
continuance of those Affections
which the beauteous</hi> Almanzaida
<hi>did once entertain for the Slave</hi>
Almanzor. My Lord, (<hi>replied</hi>
Almanzaida) you should demand
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55010:54"/>
with more confidence that which
you are sure to obtain: The Slave
<hi>Almanzor</hi> was ever dear unto
me; <hi>Almanzaida</hi>'s Brother has
been the same, peradventure
more than he ought to have
been; and the Prince of <hi>Moroco</hi>
Shall ever be more precious than
her own Life unto the Daughter
of <hi>Albenzais.</hi> I complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Fortune, when some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
had made me believe
that I was <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Daughter,
because that Greatness was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
to the Inclinations of a
Heart which could not pardon
any thing that did but check its
Passions for <hi>Almanzor:</hi> But now
I am contented with my change,
since that through <hi>Ortijis</hi> his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
it gives me a Throne, in
which I may have something that
may please you. It is you onely,
Sir, that I can share it with; and
give me leave to tell you, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55010:55"/>
that which renders it the most
considerable to me, is, that I can
offer it you. <hi>Generous Princess,</hi>
(replied the passionate Lover)
<hi>all that I can boast of, is of a
Heart that has been wholly yours
since it first knew it self. I have
nothing more to repay those preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Favours which you so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusely pour upon me.</hi> That Heart
you speak of (<hi>replied</hi> Almanzai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da)
which I esteem above the
World, has already acquitted
you of all the Favours I could
bestow upon you; and no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
shall <hi>Ortisis</hi> say the word, but‚Äî
<hi>Ah, Madam,</hi> (cried out <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor)
can he be the sole Opponent to
my Happiness?</hi> Hope for better
things (<hi>replied the Princess); Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi>
has given us an advantageous
account of his Goodness, and his
Actions hitherto have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to it: Having so much
Vertue, he cannot be ungrateful;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55010:55"/>
and if he is sensible, he will
doubtless share in those Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which I owe you. <hi>It is I
that owe you immortal ones</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the Prince) <hi>and I should
have just cause to fear all things,
if I had not more confidence in
both your Goodness, than in all
my Pretensions.</hi> My Lord, (<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Princess)</hi> I hope he will
be favourable to you; but should
I be deceived in my hopes, that
Faith which I at present give
you, to be ever yours, shall never
be altered.</p>
                  <p>These last words eleveted <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi>
at the heighth of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
<hi>Cleonisa</hi> met him: <hi>Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
came presently after, and
did assure them in a handsom
manner of the joy he resented at
their satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>In fine, after a tedious expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our impatient Lovers
(though it was not long) <hi>Abda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55010:56"/>
Envoys returned with a full
consent from <hi>Ortisis,</hi> for <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida</hi>'s
marriage; which was no
longer deferred, than to prepare
the Gallantry there of, which was
worthy <hi>Abdala</hi>'s Magnificence,
and sutable to those Lovers for
whom it was made.</p>
