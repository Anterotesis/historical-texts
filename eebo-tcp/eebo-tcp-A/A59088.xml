            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Dominion here asserted: However, this I finde, that as hee seemed, by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Preparations in the year 1635, to resent the many injurious usurpations of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Neighbors, and did in words also stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously assert the Jurisdiction at Sea; so hee set a value upon this Book, as it's main Evidence: and in the 12 year of his Reign it was upon his special command, deliver'd by the hands of Sir <hi>William Beecher</hi> (one of the Clerks of his Council) to the <hi>Barons</hi> of the Exchequer in open Court; and by immediate Order of that Court, it was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among their publick Records, where it remain's to this day. Now, had hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with the same firm resolution in this honorable business of the Sea, as hee did in other things, that were destructive to the Nation's interest, the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> had been prevented from spinning out their long opportunitie to an imaginarie Claim of Prescription; so that they would have had less Pretence to Act those Insolencies now, which in former times never durst enter the Thoughts of their Predecessors. The truth is, too much easiness and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Fathers and Grand-fathers of
<pb facs="tcp:64062:4"/>
the present Generation, was the first occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of elevating them to this height of Confidence, in pressing upon the Seas of <hi>England:</hi> For, who know's not with what tenderness, and upon what terms, they were first taken into the bosom of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeth?</hi> yet they were no sooner warm, but they shew'd their sting, and proved the onely great vexation (becaus deceitful friends) to that excellent Ladie, who, in those Infant-daies, was both Mother and Nurs of their ungrateful Republick. Too much of the same tenderness was expressed afterward by King <hi>James,</hi> becaus (as in the former Reign, so in his) it was counted Reason of State to permit them to thrive; but they turning that favorable Permission into a Licentious Encroaching beyond due Limits, put the King to a world of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charge, by Ambassies and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to assert his own interest, and dispute them into a reasonable submission to those Rights which had been received before as indisputable by all the world. For the truth whereof, I am bold to refer your Honors to the Memorials of several Transactions in those daies, which I have added at the
<pb facs="tcp:64062:5"/>
end of this Book; and for which I stand indebted (as I am also for many other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors) to a <hi>Right honorable Member</hi> of your own great Assembly. By the same also it will appear, how this People perceiving that King to bee of a temper disposed to use no other arguments but words, held him in play with words again, and while they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled out his Reign in Debates and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, carried on their design still to such a height, by a collusion of Agencies and Ventilations to and agen, and a daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion upon the Territorie by Sea, that in time they durst plead and print <hi>Mare Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum;</hi> and after his Son <hi>Charls</hi> came to the Crown, they in effect made it so: For, though hee were not ignorant of his own Right, as appear's by his esteem of this Book, his Preparations, and Proclamation <hi>for Restraint of Fishing without Licence,</hi> &amp;c. Yet hee never made any farther use of them, than to milk away the Subjects monie under pretence of building Ships to maintein his Autoritie by Sea; which end of his beeing served, hee immediately let fall the prosecution of what hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So that through the over-much easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:64062:5"/>
and indulgence of preceding Princes, they in a short time arrived to so loftie a Presumption, as to seem to forget and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and now at length, by most perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actings, to defie the Dominion of <hi>England</hi> over the Sea.</p>
                  <p>These things beeing consider'd, it was supposed this Translation (it beeing a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Plea asserting that Dominion) would bee a very seasonable Service; which (how poorly soëver it bee apparel'd in our <hi>English</hi> dress) is bold to lay Claim unto your Honors as its proper Patrons, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ought to bee no less under your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection than the Sea it self: And therefore let mee have leav here (without Flatterie or Vanitie) to say, though in other things I may injure the eminent Autor, yet in this hee will bee a Gainer, that his Book is now faln under a more noble Patronage, in the tuition of such heroïck Patriots, who, observing the errors and defects of former Rulers, are resolved to see our Sea-Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as bravely mainteined by the Sword, as it is by his Learned Pen. It is a gallant sight to see the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Pen</hi> in victorious Equipage together; For, this subdue's the
<pb facs="tcp:64062:6"/>
souls of men by Reason, that onely their bodies by force. The <hi>Pen</hi> it is which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest's the Right of Things; and when that is once cleared, it give's spurs to resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becaus men are never raised to so high a pitch of action, as when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that they engage in a righteous caus; according to that old Versicle,

                  <p>Wherefore seeing you (<hi>Right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!</hi>) have had so frequent experience of the truth of this in our late Wars, wherein the <hi>Pen</hi> Militant hath had as many sharp ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters as the <hi>Sword,</hi> and born away as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Trophies from home-bred Enemies in prosecution of your most righteous caus by Land, certainly you will yield it no less necessarie for the Instruction of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ingenious people, in vindicating your just Rights by Sea, against the vain Pretences and Projects of encroaching Neighbors. For, what true <hi>English</hi> heart will not swell, when it shall bee made clear and evident (as in this Book) that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie
<pb facs="tcp:64062:6"/>
of the Seas flowing about this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, hath, in all times, whereof there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main's any written Testimonie, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old <hi>Roman</hi> Invasion and since, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every Revolution, down to the present Age, been held and acknowledged by all the world, as an inseparable appendant of the British Empire; And that by virtue thereof the Kings of <hi>England</hi> successively have had the Soveraign Guard of the Seas; That they have imposed Taxes and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes upon all ships passing and fishing therein; That they have obstructed and open'd the passage thereof to strangers, at their own pleasure, and don all other things that may testifie an absolute Sea-Dominion; VVhat <hi>English</hi> heart (I say) can consider these things, together with the late Actings of the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> set forth in your <hi>publick Declaration,</hi> and not bee inflamed with an indignation answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Insolence; That these People raised out of the dust at first into a state of Libertie, and at length to an high degree of Power and Felicitie, by the Arms and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of <hi>England;</hi> or that they, who in times past durst never enter our Seas to
<pb facs="tcp:64062:7"/>
touch a <hi>Herring,</hi> without Licence first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by Petition from the Governor of <hi>Scarborough</hi>-Castle, should now presume to invade them with armed Fleets, and by a most unjust war bid defiance to the United Powers of these three Nations? Had they dared to do this in the daies of our Kings, I suppose, they (even the worst of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) would have checkt and chastised them with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution suitable to their monstrous Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; For, however som of them were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly busied in vexing and undermining the people's Liberties at home, yet they were all very jealous of the Rights and Interests of the Nation at Sea; and good reason they had for it, since without the maintenance of a Soveraigntie there, the Island it self had been but a great Prison, and themselvs and the Natives but so many Captives and Vassals to their Neighbors round about; not so much secluded, as excluded from all the world beside. Upon this ground it was, that Kings ever conceived and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined themselvs as much Monarchs by Sea as by Land; and the same you will finde here was received by all other States and Princes, the Land and Water that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round's
<pb facs="tcp:64062:7"/>
it, making one entire Bodie and Territorie. Moreover, our own Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Constitutions every where declare the same, as may bee seen by the several Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents and Proceedings thereunto relating; which manifestly shew, that by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law of the Land, our Kings were Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Lords of our Seas; That the Seas of <hi>Engl.</hi> were ever under the Legiance of our Kings, and they soveraign Conservators of the peace as well upon the Sea as Land.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore (<hi>Right honorable!</hi>) when I look upon you, and behold you more highly intrusted than Kings, and far more nobly adorned upon a better Ground than they were, with all the Rights, Interests, and Privileges of the People; when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how God hath wrested the Sword out of their hands, and placed it in yours for our Protection, with the Conservation of our Peace and Liberties, and made you the happie Instruments of freeing us from the yoke of Kings; When I call to minde, how nobly you asserted the Rights of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> against Domestick Tyrannie, upon the neck of the late King, and laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Freedom upon the highest Act

                     <hi>Cicero,</hi> while hee was in exspectation of Letters from his brother <hi>Quinctus; Adhuc Clausum Mare scio fuisse, <hi>I know the Sea hath been shut until now.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:64062:15"/>
both of <hi>Clusius</hi> and <hi>Patulcius,</hi> might rightly enough have been given to <hi>Neptune,</hi> as well as <hi>Janus.</hi> But yet, though the Title had been taken from this Nation of the Seas beeing shut or closed, it would not truly have been so reprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For, seeing it is in the power of an Owner, so to use and enjoy his Own, that without som Compacts of Agreement, Covenants or som spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Right supervening, hee may lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain any others whatsoëver, it cannot bee amiss for any one to say, that the Seas, which might pass into the Dominion of any person, are by the Law of Dominion shut to all others who are not Owners or that do not enjoy such a peculiar Right; in the same manner almost as that, whereby in that Winter-season they becom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigable by the Law of Nature, as saith <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius.</hi> But truly there is another and far clearer meaning of the Title. The simple sens of its terms doth denote, that the Sea is so shut up or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and secluded for private Dominion, no otherwise than the Land or a Port, by bounds, limits, and other Notes and circumstances of private Dominion, and that by all kinde of Law, that without the consent of the Owner and those special restrictions &amp; qualifications of Law, which variously intervene, vanish, and return,
<pb facs="tcp:64062:16"/>
all others are excluded from a use of the same. For, most certain it is, that <hi>Claudere, <hi>to shut</hi>
                     </hi> doth not only denote the mere simple Act of shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as wee say <hi>de Januis oculisve clausis <hi>of gates or one's eies beeing shut,</hi> clauso ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> or as it is in that of <note n="i" place="margin">Pharsal. 3.</note>

The one concern's matter of <hi>Law,</hi> the other matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> both of them beeing denominated (as is usual) from the major part: For, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64062:25"/>
the point of <hi>Law</hi> hath many things mingled with it, which manifestly arise from matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> so this of <hi>Fact</hi> comprehend's not a few which relate unto that of <hi>Law.</hi> As to what concern's the point of <hi>Law,</hi> this Question fall's chiefly under debate, to wit, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Law the Sea bee capable of private Dominion, or Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</hi> And by matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is meant only such a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Testimonies, or clear shewing forth of Evidences by which may bee proved and mainteined, <hi>The long and continual conjunction with the British Empire, of enjoiment and possession, or lawful prescription; whereupon as on a most strong Title, the Dominion or Ownership of the same Empire herein may bee founded;</hi> it beeing first made manifest, that the Sea it self is not only not repugnant by any Law to Dominion or Ownership, but every way capable thereof. To each of these Particulars a several Book is allotted. In the first, is discussed matter of <hi>Law:</hi> In the second, that which concern's matter of <hi>Fact:</hi> For, except manifest proof bee made of the first point, it will bee utterly in vain to discours about the second. But for those things which are to bee handled in the first Book, it seemed meet to observ such a Method, as in the first place to lay open the Rise or Original ground of those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes that have occasioned this enquirie into the point of Law, together with the Opinions of those men, who denie that the Sea is capable of private Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Ownership, or that it may pass into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of any one particular, so as in the mean time to exclude it from beeing common to the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Next are premised som things, for explaining the terms of the Questions, that it may bee clearly thence understood, as well what kinde of <hi>Mediums</hi> are to bee used, as what the Thing is, whereof wee intend to Treat; lest by neglect of such a Cours, wee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64062:25"/>
bee perplex't with Doubts about the notion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, either of the Terms themselvs, or of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in Controversie. After this preparation thus duly made, it is then demonstrated, that not onely no kinde of Law whatsoëver, rightly understood, doth deny a Dominion over the Sea, but that all kinds of Law, even the most known and approved, whereof there may bee any use in Disputes of this nature, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and allow a proprietie and private Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Sea, as well as the Land. Lastly, the Objections usually brought against such Dominion or Ownership of the Sea, are cleared and answered; And with these wee shall now begin; for the Method of the second Book is more conveniently put there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>

                        <p>THe Arguments usually brought against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea, are of three sorts. <hi>Som</hi> are drawn from freedom of Commerce, Passage, and Travel; <hi>Others</hi> from the nature of the Sea; and a <hi>third</hi> sort from the Writings and Testimonies of learned men.

                        <p>Touching the <hi>second</hi> sort of Objections drawn from the nature of the Sea it self, it is commonly alleged; That the Sea is alter'd and shifted every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the state of it, through a continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of new waters, alway so uncertain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main's so little the same in all things (the Channel onely excepted) that it is impossible it should ever bee retained in the possession of any one Particular. Moreover, they say the nature of Possession consist's chiefly in a separation or distinction of Limits and Bounds, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64062:26"/>
no such Materials or Instruments can possibly bee found in the Sea, as that the Law for regulation of Bounds, which hath a principal place in all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies about Dominion or Ownership may bee grounded thereupon. They produce also a saying out of<note n="e" place="margin">Hexaëmer. lib. cap. 10.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <p>A <hi>third</hi> sort of Arguments lie's in those Testimonies that are drawn out of antient Writers; partly out of old Poëts, Divines, and others writing of other subjects; partly from such Lawyers as handle the matter purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

And therefore from thence they seem to hold, that a Dominion over the Sea cannot bee atteined by any antient usage, custom or prescription, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other pretence or title whatsoëver, for (faie they) no Plea or Barr is to bee allowed against nature, <hi>Nor</hi> (as <note n="o" place="margin">Neque prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptio longae possessionis ad obtinenda lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca jure Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium publica solet concedi. li. 45. tit. de usucapioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pationibus.</note>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64062:28"/>
most forward in opposing a Right of Dominion over the Sea, are onely two, both indeed very eminent men, but of unequal learning and elegancie of wit; by name <hi>Fernandus Vasquius</hi> the Spaniard, and <hi>Hugo Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Hollander: the former an honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor to King <hi>Philip</hi> the 3. of <hi>Spain</hi> in his high Court of Exchequer.

But <hi>Vasquius,</hi> in his discours both of the Law of Nature and Nations, as also concerning the Rights of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, Prescription, and other things of that nature, speak's to this effect. <note n="p" place="margin">

                           <hi>From hence</hi> (saith hee) <hi>it appear's how little esteem is to bee had of their opinion, who suppose that the</hi> Genoëses <hi>or</hi> Venetians <hi>may without injurie, forbid others to sail through the Gulph in their respective Seas, as if they could have laid claim to those Seas by Prescription; which is not onely contrarie to the Imperial Laws</hi> (above mentioned) <hi>but also against the Primitive Law of nature and nations, which cannot bee alter'd. And that it is against this Law, is evident; becaus by the same Law not onely the Seas, but all other immov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things whatsoëver, were common. And although in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that Law came to bee abolish't in part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so far as concern's the Dominion and Proprietie of Lands, which beeing enjoied in common, according to the Law of nature, were afterwards distinguish't, divided, and so separated from that common use; yet it hath been otherwise, and is still, as to the Dominion of the Sea, which from the beginning of the world to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent daie, is, and ever hath been in common, without the least alteration, as 'tis generally known. And though I hear many of the</hi> Portugals <hi>are of this opinion, that their King hath had such an antient Title by Prescription in that vast Ocean
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64062:29"/>
of the</hi> West-Indies, <hi>so that other Nations have no right to sail through those Seas; and also that the ordinarie sort of our own Nation of</hi> Spain <hi>seem to bee of the same opinion, that no people whatsoëver, but Spaniards, have any right to sail through that immens and most spatious Sea, to those Indian Countries that have been subdued by the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Kings of</hi> Spain <hi>(as if they onely had a right by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription thereto;) yet all these men's opinions are no less vain and foolish, then theirs, who use to dream the same things of the</hi> Genoeses <hi>and</hi> Venetians. <hi>The follie of which opinions appear's the more clearly even in this respect; becaus neither of those Nations singly consider'd can prescribe ought against themselvs; that is to saie, neither the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of</hi> Venice <hi>against it self; nor that of</hi> Genoa <hi>against it self, nor the Kingdom of</hi> Spain <hi>against it self, nor that of</hi> Portugal <hi>against it self; for there ought ever to bee a difference between the</hi> Agent <hi>and</hi> Patient: <hi>Much less can they prescribe ought to the prejudice of other Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus the Law of Prescriptions is purely Civil. Therefore such a Law can bee of no force, in deciding Controversies that happen betwixt Princes or people that acknowledg no Superior: For the peculiar Civil Laws of every Countrie are of no more value, as to Forrain Countries and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or their people, then if such a Law were not in Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or never had been; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nd therefore in Controversies of that nature recours must bee had unto the common Law of Nations Original or Secondarie; which Law certainly did never admit of such a Prescription or usurpation of Title over the Sea.</hi> Other matters hee hath of the same kinde, beeing a very confident opposer of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Dominion over the Sea.</p>
                        <p>But in the year <hi>MD CIX</hi> (it beeing the year after that large Treatie held at the <hi>Hage</hi> betwixt the Spaniard and the Hollander, about freedom of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64062:29"/>
Trade and Navigation to the <hi>East-Indies</hi>) there was published that Book of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> entituled MARE LIBERUM, <hi>or a discours concerning that Right which the Hollanders have to Trade in the</hi> Indies. Wherein hee endeavor's first to prove, that, by the Law of Nations, there ought to bee such a freedom of Navigation for all men whatsoëver, which waie they pleas, so that they cannot, without injurie, bee molested at Sea. Next, that the Atlantick and Southern Ocean, or the Right of Navigation to the <hi>Indies,</hi> is not, nor indeed can bee, any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar of the <hi>Portugalls: forasmuch as the Sea</hi> (saith hee, according to the <note n="q" place="margin">Mari Libero cap. 5.

                           </hi> Moreover, wee shall explain what is meant by the SEA, as also by those Terms of LAW and DOMINION. By the SEA wee understand the whole Sea, as well the main Ocean or Out-land Seas, as those which are within-land, such as the <hi>Mediterranean, Adriatick, AEgean</hi> or <hi>Levant, British, and Baltick</hi> Seas, or any other of that kinde, which differ no otherwise from the main, then as Homogeneous or Similary parts of the same bodie do from the whole. But the <hi>Law</hi> (as it is the rule, measure, and pointing out of things lawful or unlawful) fall's under a twofold consideration. Fither as it is <hi>Obligatorie,</hi> which is called also <hi>Preceptive;</hi> or as it is <hi>Permissive,</hi> which is also by writers commonly termed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive.</hi> As <hi>Obligatorie,</hi> it is known by such things as are commanded or forbidden, as <hi>to give every man his due, not to forswear,</hi> and the like. As <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive,</hi> it is set forth by things whose use is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor forbidden, but permitted; as in the very Act of buying, selling, infranchisement, framing conditions of contract according to the will of the contractors, and many more of the same nature. But both these kinds of LAW concern either mankinde in general, that is, all Nations, or not all. That which relate's to the generalitie of mankinde, or <hi>all Nations,</hi> is either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Divine.</hi> That is, either manifested by the light of nature or the use of right reason, beeing elegantly described by <hi>Tertullian</hi> to bee the <note n="b" place="margin">Lex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico mundi, &amp; Tabulis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalibus scripta.

The second the <hi>Common Law of divers Nations,</hi> so named from som common tie or obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt them.

But as to that which jointly concern's divers Nations by mutual obligation, that is, <hi>the Common Law of divers Nations,</hi> it is divisible likewise into two parts, to wit, into that which is <hi>Imperative</hi> over divers Nations or people; or that which is <hi>Intervenient.</hi> By the <hi>Imperative Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> is meant that which is observed or receiv's Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among several Nations or people, who are subject to

And when any Nations, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Pope's</hi> Autoritie and command, do alike submit to one and the same Law, it may bee rightly called the <hi>Imperative</hi> Law of Nations. But that is to bee called the <hi>Intervenient</hi> Law of Nations, which take's it's rise, not from any command imposed upon several Nations in common, but through the intervention ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of som Compact, or Custom; and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly styled the <hi>Secondarie Law of Nations:</hi> The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal heads whereof are conteined in the Laws about <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming War, Ambassie, Prisoners of War, Hostages, Right, Remitter upon return from Captivitie, Leagues and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Commerce,</hi> and other matters of that Nature which usually intervene betwixt divers Nations. For, as much as in these Laws here spoken of, it is in several Nations wholly composed of such <hi>Additions</hi> as have been made to the <hi>universal Obligatorie Law of Nations,</hi> and of such <hi>Alterations</hi> as have accrued to the <hi>Universal Permissive,</hi> and no more may challenge the name of <hi>Imperative</hi> or <hi>Intervenient.</hi> And it is most plain, that the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64062:32"/>
rest retain's still the name of the <hi>Universal or Primitive Law of Nations.</hi> Moreover also, the <hi>Imperial Law,</hi> which usually take's place in all Controversies about the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Particulars of the <hi>Intervenient Law,</hi> so far as it agree's with the Universal Law of Nations, Natural or Divine, is to bee comprised under the same Notion; But as by the consent of some certain Nations, with whom it is in use, divers principal heads and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of it (beeing no part of the <hi>Universal Law</hi>) are so made use of, it most clearly fall's under the name of the <hi>Intervenient Law of som Nations.</hi> Lastly, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and used at home by som particular People in their Courts of Judicature, it is to bee called the Law <hi>Civil or Domestick of divers Nations.</hi> And thus having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a plain Scheme of the <hi>Law,</hi> in all those various Notions and Acceptions that are to bee used in the Controversie; it remain's that in the next place that of <hi>Dominion</hi> or <hi>Ownership</hi> bee taken into consideration.</p>

                        <p>BY the introducing of <hi>private Dominion,</hi> in the aforesaid manner, it came to pass, that the same Territorie or Field, whose use before was free for all men alike in Tillage, Building, Pasturage cutting of wood, gathering of Fruits, egress and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, was either by distribution or occupation so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly appropriated unto the possessor, that hee might lawfully hinder such a Communitie of use and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor might any other man use it lawfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his permission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And from this Original sprang every Dominion or Proprietie of things, which either by Alienation, or any other kinde of Cession, is transferr'd upon others, or held by a continued pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; respect beeing alwaies had to those particular Forms and Qualifications, which usually relate unto Dominion, either by Law, Custom, or compact, according to the various Institutions of several people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For by these, the free and absolute power of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, in what hee enjoie's, is lesned and restrained; but when this Reason wholy ceaseth, then what the Proprietor possesseth is so his own, that it cannot lawfully in any wise, without his consent, becom another man's. And all these things are derived from the alteration of that <hi>Universal</hi> or <hi>Natural Law of nations</hi> which is <hi>Permissive:</hi> For thence came in private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Possession, to wit from the <hi>Positive Law.</hi>

                        <p>These things beeing thus premised, wee shall next see what respect hath been had unto the Sea, either in the very first or any more antient Distribution or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of things. For if it appear that the Sea also hath been assigned over with Lands, it must certainly bee confessed, that from the same original there spring's a private Dominion of the Sea, as well as the Land, and so that it is equally capable of the same, with this. And truly, in the distribution of Land which was renewed after the flood (so far as wee are able to collect by Tradition from the Antients) wee finde no express mention made of any Sea, as a part assigned: But yet somtimes the Sea is added as a Bound to a part assigned. As where the part first assigned unto the Sons of <hi>Cham,</hi> is extended from the Borders of <hi>Egypt</hi> through <hi>Africa</hi> as far as <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars, or <note n="a" place="margin">African. apud Euseb. in Chronic. pag. 10.

God Almightie, as Father of the Univers, retein's his supreme Dominion both over men, as also all other Things; which never was denied yet by any sober man. But the Controversie is about the Dominion of man, to wit, that which comprehend's any enjoiment or proprietie whatsoëver, saving still that right of the Dominion of God, which cannot bee diminished. And the distinction about this matter is very ordinarie in the Schools: According to the first sort of Dominion, nothing whatsoëver, much less may the Sea belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men: According to the second, all things indeed are or may bee theirs, which can bee apprehended, seized, and possessed.

The first opinion is of those who affirm, that the whole western Sea (as it lie's before the western Coast of the Land of Israël or as it is bounded inward by streight lines drawn on both sides, from the North-east and South border before mentioned, through that Ocean into the west) together with the Continent was given unto them by God; and therefore that those Precepts are to bee observed in that vast Ocean, as in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of Israël. The chief Autor of this opinion was an antient and very famous Interpreter of the Law, by name <hi>Rabbi Jehuda,</hi> who also from the express words of the Holie Law above-mentioned,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64062:42"/>
conclud's that the western Ocean, thus bounded on both sides, was assigned. His Doctrine is deliver'd after this manner, as wee finde it in the most antient Digests of the Jewish Law. <note n="e" place="margin">

But this is most certain, that the name of the Spanish Sea hath been used here by the Rabbins, not from such a promiscuous or common denomination of the Sea; but according to the explanation of such an antient Assignation of the Dominion of Israël as wee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64062:43"/>
have mentioned. And so this first opinion would have the whole Western Ocean, as far as the streights of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which the Antients thought the utmost Bound of the world, to bee reckoned for that part of the Territorie of Israël, which is included within the lines drawn from the Promontorie of mount <hi>Hor</hi> or <hi>Amanus</hi> and the entrance of <hi>Pelusium,</hi> into the West. But by the other opinion, which seem's much more agreeable to reason, it is determined, that the Divine Assignation of the Territorie of Israël is comprehended indeed within more narrow Bounds of this Sea, but yet Sea-room large enough: so that according to this opinion, the North and South-Borders do end at the very shore, or at the utmost point of the said Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, North-East, and at the entrance of <hi>Pelusium,</hi> towards the South; not stretching any farther, into the West. But indeed the Autors of this opinion would have a streight line drawn from that Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to the entrance of <hi>Pelusium,</hi> to wit from the North-East into the South, thereby to limit and bound the Western part of the Dominion of Israël; so that what portion soëver either of the Sea or the Isles should bee comprehended within such a line, or lie on the East side of it, the whole were to bee reckoned a part of the Territorie of Israël, as well as any Coast upon the Continent or main Land. And so after this manner, the aforesaid line, included within the nooks and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the shore of that Territorie (possessed by the Tribes of <hi>Asher, Ephraim, Dan, Zabulon,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi>) was situate before very large spaces of of the Sea, for above two hundred miles; and supposed to bee of the same accompt with the shore it self. In the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests of the Jewish Law, this opinion is explained thus; <note n="i" place="margin">In Gemara Babylonic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of the Territorie of Israël, and what is to bee reckoned out of that Territorie</hi> (as to the North-East and Western bounds;) <hi>whatsoëver is stretcht forth on this side and within Mount Amanus, is the Territorie of Israël. And that which is placed beyond that Mountain, is without this Territorie. And so by the same reason it is to bee determined touching the Isles of the Sea that are seated over against that Mountain. Let a small Cord or Line bee drawn over those Islands, from Mount Amanus to the river of Egypt; that is conteined within the Line, is the Territorie of Israël; but that which lie's without the Line, is no part of that Territorie.</hi> With this agree's that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> concerning the Sea-Coast of the holy Land, after hee had described the South part which is near the Sea; <note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. cap. 47. 20.</note>

These are they which lie near the Sea of Hemath.</hi> So that every Translation speak's to the same purpose. But that which wee have added to the Hebrew, agree's both with the Chaldee Paraphrase, and the Exposition of the Spanish Jews. Moreover, <hi>Solomon Jarchius</hi> expound's it there after this manner, according to the doctrine of the Antients; <hi>From the South-Corner</hi> (for, so hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret's this word, from the Border) <hi>which is the river

of Egypt, till a man com over against the entrance which lead's to Hamath; that is, to the Corner situated under the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west, which is the very Mount Hor over against the entrance unto Hamath.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64062:44"/>
it is clear by what wee have shewn you, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the same way of speaking it is granted, that other Cities also within their Territorie were seated in the verie Sea. And so at length, from both the Opinions, here recited, wee have sufficiently proved, that such an Exposition of the divine Assignation was received by the antient Interpreters of the Jewish Law, to whom that Assignation was made, that they made no doubt but the Sea was every jot as capable of private Dominion, as the Land; and so reckoned those Islands placed in the neighboring Sea, as belonging to the Territorie of <hi>Israël,</hi> becaus of their Dominion over the Sea that did flow between them.

                        <p>AS to what concern's here the <hi>Law Natural,</hi> as one head of the <hi>universal</hi> or <hi>Primitive Law of Nations,</hi> in our former Division of the Law, commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a right and discreet use of Reason; that it doth in no wise gainsay a private Dominion of the Sea, but plainly permit it, wee shall prove hereby; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus by the <hi>positive Law of Nations of every kind,</hi> which is humane, (for wee have alreadie spoken of the Divine) to wit, as well by the <hi>Law Civil</hi> or <hi>Domestick of divers Nations,</hi> as the <hi>Common Law of divers Nations,</hi> whether it bee <hi>Intervenient,</hi> or <hi>Imperative;</hi> that is to say, by the Customs of almost all and the more noble Nations that are known to us, such a Dominion of the Sea is every where admitted. It is not indeed to bee denied, that a right use of humane Reason, which usually serv's as an Index of the natural Law, cannot well bee gather'd from the Customs of several Nations, about things Divine or such as relate unto Divine Worship. Nor are the Points either of the <hi>Obligatorie</hi> or <hi>Permissive</hi> kinde of natural Law relating thereunto, to bee thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. For, it hath been the common Custom of men, in all Ages and throughout all parts of the known World, to conclude of such maters, either without exact and convenient examination, or els for the serving of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64062:45"/>
their own Interests, or els to suit with the humor and disposition of the people whom they are to rule and keep in order; as do the Pagans, Mahometans, and others of that sort, as well modern as antient. And therefore <hi>Antisthenes</hi> of old taught well and boldly at <hi>Athens,</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Cicero de Naturâ Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, lib. 1.</note> as many other Philosophers have don, <hi>Populares Deos esse multos, sed naturalem unum esse, <hi>That there are many National Gods, and but one Natural,</hi>
                           </hi> contrarie to what the most usual practice of men and Custom had introduced among the ordinarie sort of People. So that as of old in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, so also in the <hi>Christian,</hi> the use of humane Reason among the vulgar, though free in other things, yet when it dived into the contemplation or debate of Religious matters, it hath often been most deservedly restrained, by certain set-Maxims, Principles, and Rules of holy Writ, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Bolts and Bars upon the Soul; lest it should wantonize and wander, either into the old Errors of most Ages and Nations, or after the new devices of a rambling phansie. And truly, such a cours as this hath ever been observed in Religious Government. But in such things as are meerly humane, and so humane that they reflect only upon matters of dutie betwixt man and man, and are not forbidden by any command of God (of which kinde you cannot so much as imagine any thing more plainly to bee, then a distinction of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Territories, and the manner thereof which is wholly grounded upon the consent of men) that which shall bee permitted by the <hi>Law Natural,</hi> is no less rightly determined by the Laws, Placarts, and received Customs of divers Ages and Nations, both antient and modern, then it may bee collected what every Clime will or will not bear, by the diligent observation of Countries, Shrubs, Trees, Plants, and other things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64062:46"/>
which belong unto the bodie of Husbandrie. For, as many Nations as have admitted such a private Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as wee inquire after, whether by a Law Civil or Domestick of their own, or by any Law common to themselvs and their neighbor-Nations, are either to bee allowed competent Witnesses of the <hi>natural permissive Law</hi> (so far as there is any use of it here;) or els it must bee said (which I believ no man dream's) that so many and those the more famous Nations, have for so many Ages erred against Nature.

                           </hi> But where are all Nations? It is not yet discover'd how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are, much less upon what Customs they have agreed.

But in applying our selvs unto the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Age,</hi> wee do not ground Arguments upon Fables, as they are meer Fables; but wee manifest Historical Truth out of the most antient Historians, though wrap't up in the mysteries of Heathen Priests and Poëts. For, (as <note n="a" place="margin">De falsa Religione, lib. 1. cap. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith well) even <hi>Those things which the Poëts speak are true, but cover'd under a certain veil or Figure.

                              </gap>.</note> Brothers, som of the Antients have taught, that the Truth it self which lay couched in this Fable, was quite another Thing. They say these were not gods, but men. Also that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was not King of Heaven, but of the Eastern part from whence the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64062:48"/>
Light first dawn's upon mortal men; by which means also it seemed the higher part, and therefore was called Heaven: And that <hi>Pluto</hi> was King of the West, which point's at the Sun's setting and Night, from whence it was said to bee lower and Hell. Lastly, that <hi>Neptune</hi> was Lord of the Sea and the Isles scatter'd therein. Thus it appear's here, that a private Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sea, no otherwise then of the Land, arose from <hi>Humane</hi> distribution. And that the case stood thus, it was affirmed long since by <hi>Euhemerus Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> an old Autor, in his Historie of the Affairs of those men who were supposed gods, recorded and translated by <hi>Ennius.</hi> For, <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith thus; <note n="c" place="margin">Loco jam citato.</note> 
                           <hi>Concerning the lot or share of Neptune, it is manifest I say, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was such as was that unlimited command of</hi> Cneius Pompeius, <hi>who, by decree of the Senate, had Autoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him over all the Sea-Coast for suppressing Pirats, and scouring the whole Sea.

This Historie</hi> Ennius <hi>did both translate and follow, whose words are these;</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter <hi>grant's the Dominion of the Sea unto Neptune, that hee might reign over all the Islands, and all Places near the Sea.</hi> But both the Translation of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries themselvs of <hi>Euhemerus,</hi> are utterly lost; nor
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64062:48"/>
is it to bee thought, that they were lost without the knowledg and design of the chief Priests of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and other Deities. For, doubtless whatsoever had been written touching the Originals of the gods, was so much the more odious, by how much the more it did lay them open, and discover, that those great Names which were magnified in their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels and Temples, were taken out of the List ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of great Kings, or Heroes, and obtruded upon the credulous vulgar. For, from hence it was, that <hi>Euhemerus,</hi> with <hi>Diagoras</hi> and som others, was branded an Atheist, who is used as a singular Autor, not onely by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> but also by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Eusebius, Augustin, Arnobius,</hi> and others; to whom wee know very great credit is given in those Arguments that are pieced together against the vain Theologie of the Heathen.

                        </head>
                        <p>BEfore the first <hi>Punick</hi> War, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> both strove with equal Forces and affections for the Empire of the World; save that they of <hi>Carthage</hi> seemed the more potent, by reason of that Dominion of the Sea by them held so many years. But then <hi>C. Duillius</hi> beeing made General of a Navie of <abbr>CLX</abbr> Ships, riding at Anchor, and arm'd within sixtie daies after the wood had been cut, almost undid <hi>Carthage</hi> in that Sea, and wholly reduced it under the <hi>Romane</hi> power. And <hi>Florus</hi> saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>when the Sea and the Isles were taken away, it shamed that noble Nation to pay Tribute, who were wont to command it.</hi> So, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> beeing deprived of this kinde of Dominion, the <hi>Romanes</hi> got it by the Law of Arms and Victorie; so great and so constant honor beeing, for this caus, paid to so renowed a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> that Minstrels were ever sent to make him mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick after Supper, and a Torch was carried before him. Moreover, both the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> and <hi>Cilicians</hi> had Dominion over the <hi>Romanes</hi> Sea, as appear's by the League made betwixt them and <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of <hi>Syria;</hi> wherein it was thus provided: <hi>That</hi> Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus <hi>should surrender his long ships and their warlike furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and not have more than ten nimble Gallies (none of which should bee rowed with above thirty Oares) nor so much as a Galley with one range of Oares when hee shall have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64062:64"/>
to make a War. Nor should hee sail on this side the Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of</hi> Calycadnus <hi>or</hi> Sarpedon; <hi>unless it bee a ship imploied to convey money, pay, or Embassadors, or Hostages.</hi> So saith <note n="b" place="margin">Decad. lib. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>Livie.</hi> But wee read in Polybius, <hi>Nullam habeto triginta remis actam navem, <hi>Let him have no Ship rowed with</hi>
                           </hi> 30 <hi>Oares.</hi> In like manner <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in a speech made unto <hi>Scipio,</hi> saith thus, <note n="c" place="margin">Livie, lib. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>Wee deny not, but that all those places are yours for which the War hath been undertaken,</hi> Sicilie, Sardinia, Spain, <hi>and all the Isles contained in the whole Sea, betwixt</hi> Africa <hi>and</hi> Italie. <hi>And may wee</hi> Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, <hi>that are confined within the shores of</hi> Africa, <hi>see you (when it so pleaseth the Gods) ruling foreign Dominions by Land and Sea.</hi> And a little after, the Peace beeing agreed, five hundred Ships of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> that were rowed with Oars, were by them seized and burnt. To wit, that they might not use the Sea, which was then to bee in the Dominion of others. Afterwards also, the Senate of <hi>Carthage</hi> was chastised, <note n="d" place="margin">Epit.

If you take it for that very Sea, the matter is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and seem's to agree very well with it self. It is most consonant to reason, that the spatious Province of the <hi>Proconsul</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi> was denoted by <hi>Asia</hi> it self, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring narrow Sea, and the Isles; Not thus, by <hi>Asia</hi> it self and the <hi>Isles,</hi> adding moreover I know not what pettie Countrie, obscure enough, and supposed also to bee a part even of <hi>Asia.</hi> Also the Custom of the following Age seem's to interpret a more antient Government in this place. The very <hi>AEgean</hi> Sea (which comprehend's almost all this neighboring Sea) is expresly number'd by the aforesaid <hi>Constantinus Porphyrogenitus,</hi> among the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Lievtenantships, or Provinces of the East. His words are, <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 1. Them. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>But the</hi> AEgean <hi>Sea it self also is reckoned among the Provinces.</hi> And a little after also concerning the Isles, he saith, <hi>There belong to the command or Government of the AEgean Sea the Isles called</hi> Cyclades, <hi>and the most eminent of the</hi> Sporades, Mytilene, <hi>and</hi> Chios, <hi>and</hi> Lemnos <hi>it self.</hi> So that the Isles and the Sea it self might bee conteined here, as particular parts of the Government or Province, as well as any other Regions whatsoëver. Moreover, it is to bee observed out of the <hi>Notitia</hi> or <hi>Breviarie</hi> of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64062:67"/>
East, that in the <hi>Badges</hi> or signal <hi>Ornaments</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> which were usually painted in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission whereby hee was established in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there were contained (besides the <hi>effigies</hi> of the Princes, and the Book of instructions) representations of <hi>three women,</hi> set forth alike with towred Diadems on their heads, according to the patern which wee shall present you with by and by, representing those three Provinces together, to wit, <hi>Asia,</hi> the <hi>Isles,</hi> and <hi>Hellespont</hi> in such a manner, and so remarkbly noted by an addition of their names, that there is not the least shadow of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why wee should grant the last to have been a part or Region of the first. I thought fit also, to add here <hi>Pancirollus</hi> his description of those Pictures or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, who hath made use not onely of the printed Books of the <hi>Breviarie,</hi> set forth by <hi>Alciatus</hi> (from whom wee have taken the Figure) but also of the Manuscripts of <hi>Fulvius Ursinus</hi> and others. This <hi>Proconsul</hi> (saie's Pancirollus) <hi>underneath the Book of Instructions, hath the pictures of three women which represent the Provinces committed to their charge, to wit,</hi> Asia, <hi>the</hi> Isles, <hi>and</hi> Hellespont, <hi>as the Inscriptions of their names upon them do shew. These bear a kinde of royal Ornament on the head</hi> (the printed Books say, each of them had a towred Diadem) <hi>and vessels full of coin in their hands, which signified that the levying of Tributes in those three Provinces, belong'd to the</hi> Proconsul. <hi>They were apparell'd also in long garments of Gold. The Manuscripts say they have white or skie-colour'd.</hi> Asia <hi>weareth shoos or Sandals and a skie colour'd Mantle; The other are without shoos: Shee which represent's the</hi> Isles <hi>weareth a purple Mantle; Shee which represent's</hi> Helles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont <hi>a green one. But in the Book of</hi> Ursinus, <hi>they are all shod high with red Buskins, not differing in their habit. In</hi> Mandruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus <hi>they are set forth in long garments, which almost cover their feet.</hi> Thus far hee. And now judg yee, whether it bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64062:67"/>
or no, that any pettie Countrie of <hi>Asia</hi> should bee set forth in these Ornaments in an equal state and majestie with <hi>Asia</hi> it self, seeing even this had comprehended that also, no otherwise then the whole doth the smallest part.

Yea, when there was no such distinction of Provinces, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Isles and the Sea it self, made one entire Provincial bodie also with the continent.

And that also by the Autoritie of <hi>Ulpian,</hi> who notwithstanding useth to say, that the Sea is common to all men.

For, force by that Interdict is allowed, that hee may enjoy what hee hath hired.</hi> Therefore the Sea, becaus it was possessed by the people, was reckoned among publick things; that is, those things which are proper and peculiar to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> not common to all men, after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner then publick Baths, Theatres, and other things of that kinde.

But if no man sustain damage, hee is to bee defended who build's upon the shore, or cast's a Pile into the Sea. If any man bee hinder'd from fishing or Navigation by Sea, hee shall not have an Interdict; nor hee likewise, who may hee restrained from playing in the common Field, or from washing in a publick Bath, or from beeing a spectator in a Theatre. But in all these Cases hee must use an Action of Trespass.</hi> Therefore a Prohibitorie Interdict or Decree was to bee used, when dams were cast into the Sea no otherwise then when damage was don to a Theatre, Bath, Court, or any publick place whatsoëver.

It is no hard matter to guess what the Intent of that League might bee; For, about that time, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had raised his Toll in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and in like manner the King of <hi>Poland</hi> within his Territories by Sea. And that for the maintenance of that Dominion which they enjoyed; which that kinde of League betwixt the States of the <hi>Hans Towns</hi> and <hi>United Provinces</hi> did seem to oppose. But, to pass over these things, seeing a private Dominion of the Sea, which is the point in Question, is founded upon such clear Testimonies, out of the Customs of so many famous Nations both antient and modern (whereto wee shall add many other also, when wee treat of the <hi>British</hi> Sea in the next Book) nothing now, I suppose, hinder's why wee may not determine, that the Sea is capable of Dominion as well as the Land, not only by the <hi>Law Natural-Permissive,</hi> but also by the Law both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Common of divers Nations,</hi> and in many places almost according to the <hi>Intervenient Law</hi> (which in cases of this nature is the surest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the <hi>Natural-Permissive</hi>) unless there remain any impediment in the objections, which are next to bee handled.</p>

And though the Art of those that taught them was no whit the less, becaus of that skill which the Barbarians had gained; yet by the Law, it was death to communicate that Art unto them. And at this day, there are other instances of the same nature: So that it in no wise diminisheth from any man's Right or Power, to permit another to participate of what is his, when hee himself loseth nothing thereof. And that wee may determine this point in brief, it is most evident from the Customs of all times, that free Passage (as they call it) is wont ever to bee so limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Princes in their Territories, that it is permitted or prohibited, according to the various concernments of the Publick Good, and not otherwise. <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi> upon that Passage concerning the <hi>Amorites,</hi> saith, <note n="d" place="margin">De Jure belli, lib. 1. cap. 19.</note>

And touching the Division of such an Island according to the nature of several Lands, situate near one Bank or both, <hi>Bartolus in Tiberiade,</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long since; but of later time <hi>Joannes Buteo, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta Aymus, Antonius Maria, Joannes Gryphiander,</hi> and others. Therefore, in that case, a Proprietie of the Chanel, and so of the River (even of that which according to the Civil Law, is of publick and common use; as well as of a Field that hath a common Thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare) was common before to the Owners that had Lands lying on both sides. By the same reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, an Island newly sprung up in any sea, that never was possessed by any, and whatsoêver shall bee built upon it, become's his that first enter's it by

But by virtue of that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Compact or Agreement (before mentioned) whereby things not yet possessed, were to becom the Proprietie of him that should first enjoie them by Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation; hee that shall so possess them by Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, receiv's the Island and Building as it were by a Surrender of Right from former Owners. Seeing therefore that a Proprietie and private Dominion of Rivers hath been every where acknowledged, why should it not bee acknowledged in like manner that there may bee Owners of any Sea whatsoëver? Since the fluid nature of water can no more hinder a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in the one, then in the other.

The Sea (I suppose) is not more inexhaustible then the whole world. That is very much inferior to this, as a part is to the whole, in greatness and plenty.

                        <p>IT remain's in the next place, that wee consider of what validitie the contrarie Opinions of Writers are whereof wee formerly made mention. As to what concern's those Passages of the Poêts, <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Phaenicides;</hi> it is clear in <hi>Plautus,</hi> that the lewd slave <hi>Trachalio</hi> was but in jest with <hi>Gripus</hi> the Fisherman: Hee saith in general, that the Sea is common to all, which signifieth a Sea that never was possessed, as well as that which is necessarily and naturally common; and in that place, that, rather then this. Wherefore it may bee understood, that Fishing was common or not yet appropriated; that, is, that the people either of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> had such a Dominion over any kinde of Sea (for, by what hath been alreadie mentioned, it appear's both of them had a Dominion over som Sea before <hi>Plautus</hi> his time) that either of them might use their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Seas at their own pleasure, in hindling others from sailing through them, and removing such impediments of Trade and Commerce as should happen therein: And yet that hitherto they had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64062:101"/>
prohibited no man from fishing in that Sea (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Phaenicides</hi>) in such a manner, but that the use of it might remain common either to Natives or Neighbors, as the use of a ground for feeding of Cattel; though there may indeed bee a particular Owner in possession, reserving the other Commodities of it to himself, as it often come's to pass. But afterwards also, especially in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire, or among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it is clear out of what wee have alreadie shewn you, that a peculiar Right of Sea-fishing hath passed into the hands of private persons, as well as of Princes: So that such Expressions as these beeing applied against private Dominion of the Sea, soon vanish and com to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                        <p>As to that passage out of <hi>Ovid, Quid prohibetis aquas? <hi>Why do yee forbid water? &amp;c.</hi>
                           </hi> (then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more usual in Disputes about this matter) it is not so much an Assertion of the communitie of waters, as a vehement and hyperbolical reproof of the inhumanitie of that rustick Rout in <hi>Lycia.

                           <hi>Plautus</hi> did merrily, to <hi>Sceparnio</hi> a slave that denied her water;

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64062:101"/>
without prejudice of the Owner, hee is concerned many times in humanitie to impact it to a meer stranger that asketh him. For, the word <hi>Hostis</hi> in that place signifie's a Stranger, as wee often finde among the <note n="b" place="margin">

                           <q>Why <hi>(saith hee)</hi> dost thou denie mee that help, one Citizen afford's another?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here hee opposeth <hi>Citizen</hi> to <hi>Stranger.</hi> From the same Office of humanitie those particulars are derived; as <hi>not to denie running Water; to suffer one Fire, or one Candle to light another;</hi> and other things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are profitable to the Receiver, and not troublesom to him that give's or permit's the Favor. And upon this Rule of Moralitie onely, which is the Rule of Charitie, are those demands both of <hi>Latona</hi> and <hi>Ampelisca</hi> grounded. They denie not the private Dominion of waters: Neither <hi>Latona</hi> of the Lake (whose private Dominion is confess't by all) nor <hi>Ampelisca</hi> of the Well, from whence shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded water for the Priest of <hi>Venus.</hi> Moreover, those words of <hi>Latona</hi> are spoken concerning a Lake of little water; as <hi>Ovid</hi> sheweth in that place,

Yea, wee know that in many places an excise or paiment is made somtimes for the very use of water. As among the <hi>Hollanders</hi> they have in <hi>Delph-land</hi> a Custom called <hi>Jus Grutae;</hi> which hath ever been under the care of those Officers called in Latine <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Comites Plumarii</hi> or Officers of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their place is to see that Birds or foul bee not transported thence.</note> 
                           <hi>Comites Plumarii,</hi> in Dutch, <hi>Pluymgraven,</hi> and whereby the Beer-brewers (as <note n="e" place="margin">In Histor. Bat. c. 19.</note>

                        <p>Lastly, as to that saying of the <hi>Jewish Rabbins</hi> concerning <hi>Alexander,</hi> it shew's onely they were of Opinion that <hi>Alexander</hi> had not gotten a Dominion over the Sea. They do not say at all, that hee could not lawfully get it; nor truly could they say it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gross indiscretion, unless they would renounce their own Right (which wee have alreadie mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of their determinations) in the great or <hi>Phaenician</hi> Sea.

                        <p>For my part, I most willingly yield my assent to the emendation of the Cosmographie: But do conceiv, that the antient and received reading of the Answer ought not to bee alter'd, save onely in the pointing. Oftentimes no regard hath been had, nor any use of points in antient Books: So that succeeding Generations have been puzzled now and then with a confusion of Syntax. But by a very small alteration of them in this place (for they are the very same with those in the <note n="m" place="margin">Vide Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat. Disp. lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> Books that are published) the sens appear's to mee not onely suited to the matter of the Petition, and clear; but also plainly freed, both from that Phansie, as if Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea were denied the Emperor in that place; and also from that fiction there expresly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered touching the Sea-Dominion of the Law. Nor can I bee perswaded, that Interpreters hitherto have sufficiently hit upon the <hi>Emperor's</hi> meaning. For, what is this to the purpose? <hi>I indeed am Lord of the world, but the Law of the Sea.</hi> If it were spoken of the Law in general, certainly the Law had Dominion as well upon the main Land, The Emperor himself was Lord of every kinde of Law, even by Land as well as by Sea: And so truly, the Answer had hitherto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Petition nothing at all. If you would
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64062:110"/>
understand it of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Law, in such a sens (as <hi>Alciatus</hi> did) that the Emperor's meaning was that the Law had Dominion over the Sea, what then is the Consequence? that the matter was to bee determined by the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Law, so far as it was not opposed by any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws. What, was the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Law simply supreme over the Sea, and yet notwithstanding that high Title subject to restraint by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws? These things do not cotten well. Let it bee pointed therefore, either after this manner; <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>The Case was this: <hi>Eudemon Asiaticus,</hi> born in <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> having suffer'd Shipwrack in the <hi>Telian</hi> Sea (or the <hi>AEgean,</hi> which is about <hi>Telos</hi>) complain's that his Goods were seized by the Customers of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> petitioning the Emperor for relief, in such a manner as if the Customers had made an advantage by his misfortune in a most injurious manner. Hee salute's him with the style of Lord and Emperor. The Emperor in his Answer readily owneth himself to bee a Lord, and so far a Lord, that hee saith the whole Earth, yea, and the world it self was comprised within his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64062:111"/>
Lordship or Jurisdiction. Therein also hee signifie's that it belong's to him to reliev Petitioners when wrong is don them: But as to what concern'd the matter of complaint, or the Petition about the wrack't Goods that had been seized by the Customers, that it did not sufficiently appear whether those Customers had don it wrongfully. Becaus (if our former reading, or pointing bee admitted) in general, saith hee, and according to Rule, the Sea-Custom, or that Law of the Sea which give's wrack't Goods to the Customers, hold's good. For, so these words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> [<hi>but that Custom</hi> or <hi>that Law of this kinde belong's to the Sea</hi>] hath relation to the thing don by the Customers, as it was in brief set sorth in the Petition. But in regard that to this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom or Law of the Sea, there might, either through som privilege, or becaus of the qualitie of the goods, or som other Custom no less in force, certain Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications arise, according to circumstance, in respect whereof perhaps either the Customers ought, in this case, to have forborn medling with the goods, or the Complainant might have a special exception to privilege his goods from Seizure; therefore hee did well to leav it, beeing a matter so succinctly and without any addition of circumstance expressed in the Petition, to bee determined by the Naval Laws of the <hi>Rhodians;</hi> but yet so far onely as the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws in the mean time were not contrarie thereto. Nor doth the sens much differ, if the latter pointing and translation bee admitted: I indeed am Lord of the world, and the Sea as well as the Land is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined within my Jurisdiction: in both, I willingly right those that are wronged, according to Law: But truly what the Custom of the Sea may bee in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64062:111"/>
this case, and whether the Complainant ought to bee relieved, let it bee determined by the <hi>Rhodian Laws,</hi> which, by my permission, are in use upon the Sea, where they are not contrarie to our own. But it seem's to mee not a little conducing to a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fore-going sens, whereby the Maritim Law touching Wrecks and the Right of the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers (that is, of the Exchequer, whose Right is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d into their hands) is, asserted, if it shall bee made appear that such a Law or Custom was in force at that time, which Interpreters are not wont here to grant. It is indeed certain enough according to the Imperial Law (as wee have it now compiled in the Books of <hi>Justinian</hi>) that <note n="n" place="margin">

                           </note> Wrecks are reserved to the former Owners, and so that both the Exchequer and the Customers are thence excluded: Yea, and that the Custom whereby they are confiscated, is condemned by the received determinations of the <hi>Roman-German</hi> Empire, as well as the Canon Law, as wee hinted in the former Chapter. But it is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by manifest evidences, that the Law or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom for Confiscation of Wrecks was in force, in the time of this Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi> (I mean <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pius</hi>) who, as <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> write's did in the establishing of this Law, make use of <hi>Volusius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> the Lawyer, out of whose Books the Petition and Answer here spoken of was transcribed into the <hi>Digests</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">Locis supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riùs citatis.</note>. It is clear, that almost all those Passages that wee finde in the <hi>Digests</hi> for reserving them to the former Owners, were taken out of <hi>Paulus, Callistratus,</hi> and <hi>Ulpian,</hi> who lived many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Antoninus.</hi> There is somwhat also to this purpose out of <note n="p" place="margin">

                           <hi>Priscus Javolenus,</hi> who lived at the same time with this <hi>Antoninus.</hi> But this Emperor
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64062:112"/>
reigned <abbr>XXII</abbr> years, and as appear's out of <hi>Javolenus,</hi> hee did by Decree mitigate the rigor of Confiscation in this Case. From which it might easily com to pass, that under the same Emperor such a Law and Custom as wee have mentioned might bee in force, and under the same it might either bee abrogated, or the rigor of it abated. The principal Constitution, which, according to the <note n="q" place="margin">L. 1. C de Naufragiis.</note> Book of <hi>Justinian,</hi> would not have the Exchequer to interpose in this case, is by <hi>Antonius Contius,</hi> a very eminent Lawyer, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Emperor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> according to the Testimonie of an antient Book in Manuscript; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the name of <hi>Constantine</hi> bee put before those that are published. The words are these; <hi>If at any time a Vessel bee driven a Shore by Shipwrack, or if at any time it run aground, it shall belong to the Owners. My Exchequer shall not interpose it self. For, what right hath the Exchequer by another man's misfortune, that it should seek after profit upon so sad an occasion?</hi> Yea, and <hi>Ulpian</hi> shew's, that such a kinde of Constitution there was also under <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was this man's Father by Adoption. <hi>It is decreed</hi> (so saith <note n="r" place="margin">L. 12. ff. tit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio.</note> 
                           <hi>Ulpian</hi>) <hi>that it may bee lawful for every man, to recover his losses by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack freely; and thus much was ordained by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> Antoninus, <hi>with the Emperor his Father.</hi> There are in these very clear Evidences, that about that time, there was such a Law or Custom of Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as wee have mentioned; which wee know very well was wont to take place often, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Autoritie of antient Decrees.

is not capable of private Dominion. But hee hath so warily couched this subject with other things, that whether in this hee did hit or miss, the rest how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soëver might serv to assert the point which hee was to handle. Moreover, hee discourseth about the Title of Discoverie, and primarie occupation (pretended to by the <hi>Portugals</hi>) and that also which is by Donation from the <hi>Pope.</hi> And hee seem's in a manner, either somtimes to quit that natural and perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, which many Civil Lawyers are eager to maintein, and hee himself, in order to his design, endeavored to confirm; or els to confess that it can hardly bee defended.

Wherein this Method is observed, that in the first place wee premise both the distribution and various appellation of the Sea flowing about it, in order to the Discours.

Lastly, that the Kings of Great <hi>Britain</hi> have had a peculiar Dominion or proprietie over the Sea flowing about it, as a Bound not bounding their Empire, but (to borrow the Terms used by Surveiors of Land) as bounded by it; in the same manner as over the Island it self, and the other neighboring Isles which they possess about it.</p>

Afterwards, it is made evident by such Testimonies as are found among the Antients, that the <hi>English Saxons</hi> and others who enjoied the supreme Power in <hi>Britain,</hi> before the <hi>Norman</hi>'s Invasion, had such a kinde of Dominion. Lastly, according to the fourfold division of the <hi>British</hi> Sea, wee set forth the antient Occupation, together with the long and continued possession of every Sea in particular, since the <hi>Norman</hi>'s time; whereby the true and lawful Dominion and Customs of the Sea, which are the subject of our Discours, may bee drawn down, as it were by a twin'd thred, until our own times.

                           <hi>That the Sea hath been enjoyed by Occupation, not for this reason onely, becaus men had so enjoied the Land, nor is the Act or intent of the minde sufficient thereto; but that there is a necessitie of som external Act, from whence this Occupation may bee understood.</hi> Therefore Arguments are not to bee derived altogether from a bare Occupation or Dominion of Countries, whose Shores are washed by the Sea: But from such a private or peculiar use or enjoiment of the Sea, as consist's in a setting forth Ships to Sea, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend or make good the Dominion; in prescribing Rules of Navigation to such as pass through it; in receiving such Profits and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities as are peculiar to every kinde of Sea Dominion whatsoêver; and, which is the principal, either in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting or excluding others at pleasure. Touching which particular, wee shall make diligent inquirie into those things which concern the Isle of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> through the Ages past, down to the present time.</p>
                        <p>It is upon good ground concluded, that the most

antient Historie, whereto any credit ought to bee given about the affair's of <hi>Britain,</hi> is not elder then the time of <hi>Caius Julius Caesar;</hi> the Ages before him bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too obscured with Fables. But at his coming wee finde clear passages of the <hi>Britain</hi>'s Ownership and Dominion of the Sea flowing about them, especially of the South and East part of it, as a perpetual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of the Soveraigntie of the Island. For, they not onely used the Sea as their own at that time for Navigation and Fishing; but also permitted none besides Merchants to sail unto the Island without their leav; nor any man at all to view or sound the Ports and Sea-Coast. And that the Case stood cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thus, it is no slight Argument which wee shall insert here out of <hi>Caesar</hi> himself. But allowance must bee given ever to Arguments and Conjectures, touching times so long since past and gon; especially when there is a concurrence in the Customs and Testimonies of following times. And as things bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed at too remote a distance, so that they cannot bee certainly discerned by the eie, are wont to bee more surely discover'd by the help of a triangle at hand; So what uncertainty soêver may bee in those proofs that are to bee brought out of so remote Antiquitie, I question not but it will bee made sufficiently manifest by the continued and more certain usage and Custom of later times, as shall bee abundantly made evident in the following Discours.</p>

Others there are also that write of these small Vessels. But they are not (I suppose) at least in that Age, to bee called small Ships, which sailed through the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64062:127"/>
Sea in six daies space, nor such as <hi>Caesar</hi> made one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to transport his Souldiers, and conveied them by Cart above <abbr>XXII</abbr> miles, according to his own Relation. It cannot bee doubted therefore, but that the <hi>Britains</hi> had Vessels made even of the aforesaid matter, big enough and very fit for service at Sea. Moreover, there will bee very good ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv out of what wee shall deliver by and by, about the excluding of their Neigbors from the adjacent Sea, that they were wont to build and set forth Ships of war, of a far more commodious and solid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for the guarding of their Sea and the Isles. But their use of frequent Fithing (though <note n="i" place="margin">Dio Cassius, lib. 76.</note> som write that the more Northerly <hi>Britains</hi> did never eat fish) may bee collected upon this ground, that the better and more Civil sort of them were wont to embellish the Hilts of their Swords with teeth of the bigger Fishes. So saith <hi>Solinus</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">Polyhist. cap. 25.</note>, <hi>They which endeavor to bee neat, do burnish the hilts of their Swords with the teeth of such great Animals as swim in the Sea, becaus they are as white and clear as Ivorie: For, the men take an extraordinarie pride in the brightness of their Arms.</hi> Now, I suppose, that without an extraordinarie abundance of such kinde of Animals, which could not bee caught without great pains and numbers of Fishermen, there could not have been matter enough of this kinde to serv for the triming of a most warlike Nation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was a Custom for the Mother of every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to put the first Food that hee received into his mouth, upon the point of its Father's Sword, in token of a warlike disposition. And the Mothers usual Blessings were to this effect, that their Sons might die no other death then in War and Arms. I know these words of <hi>Solinus</hi> are commonly taken by
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64062:127"/>

and other Writers. But now, if those words which follow that brief description, wherein the first mention of <hi>Ireland</hi> is made, were to bee understood of the <hi>Irish,</hi> not of the people of great <hi>Britain,</hi> then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there, that <hi>Solinus</hi> forgetting what hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the very entrance of his Discours, passed immediately from great <hi>Britain</hi> unto <hi>Ireland</hi> and the neighboring Isles; and that hee made not any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Customs of its Inhabitants, besides the striping of their skins with divers shapes, and this at the latter end of the Chapter: which I can not in any case believ. Nor is it agreeable to the scope of his discours, that <hi>Ireland</hi> should bee meant in this place, as well as great <hi>Britain.</hi> For, of <hi>Britain</hi> hee saith, <hi>It is encompassed with many considerable Islands, whereof</hi> Ireland <hi>is next to it in bigness. It is a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Countrie, by reason of the rude behavior of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, &amp;c.</hi> Then, this more large description of its manners and Customs which immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is no otherwise joined to the mention of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the Edition of <hi>Delrio,</hi> and most of the rest which wee have followed in the place before-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged. And who seeth not that the beginning of that description, and so what follow's, ought with much more reason to bee referr'd thus to <hi>Britain,</hi> concerning which his purpose is to treat, then to <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose name is inserted onely by the way. Nor doth that hinder at all which wee read there about <hi>Serpents.</hi> I confess it to bee most true indeed, if spoken of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein there is no venemous Creature; and fals, if of <hi>Britain.</hi> But yet even this also hath been believed of our Countrie of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that in the clearer light of learning in time past; As appear's not onely by the Books of <hi>Cardan de Subtilitate,</hi> wherein hee

                           <hi>The men in their dispositions and habits do not differ much from</hi> Britain.</p>
                        <p>But now, that wee may return unto that trimming which was made of Fishes teeth; Auxiliaries were wont (as <hi>Caesar</hi> saith) to bee supplied out of <hi>Britain,</hi> in almost all those wars that the <hi>Gauls</hi> mainteined
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64062:129"/>
against the <hi>Romans.</hi> And therefore it must bee said, either that the <hi>Britains</hi> were for the most part an abject savage people, yea and a dull slothful Generation (which appear's to bee most fals,) or els it must bee conceived that the Nation used Fishing very much, which together with the frequent use of Navigation and Commerce, shew's that they did enter upon the Sea corporally by Occupation. But if to such a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral occupation, as this, wee add also, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded others from the Sea, shutting it up in such a manner, that they restrained them at pleasure from passage and entrance, what hinder's why wee may not conclude, that they acquired a manifest Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own, both by an Intentional and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral possession? But that the Sea was thus shut up by them, <hi>Caesar</hi> himself seem's to inform us plainly enough. For, when hee, upon his first attempt to cross the Sea into <hi>Britain,</hi> made diligent enquirie among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> touching the Shore and Situation of the ports, and to this end had summoned the <hi>Gallick</hi> Merchants together from all Quarters, hee was so deceived in his expectation about this matter, that hee was necessitated to send <hi>C. Volusenus</hi> before with a long Ship to sound them, as beeing wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: For as much as the <hi>Gauls</hi> were utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of these Shores, becaus they were prohibited entrance, and so excluded from a free use of the Sea. For, hee write's expresly, <note n="p" place="margin">De Bello Gallico, lib. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>not a man of them went thither without leav, besides Merchants; nor was any thing known even to those Merchants, besides the Sea Coast, and those parts which lay over against</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Now <hi>France.</hi>
                           </note> Gaul <hi>or</hi> Gallia. Therefore, according to the usual Custom, no man, besides Merchants, could touch upon the Shore, without leav of the <hi>Britains;</hi> nor was it lawful for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64062:129"/>
those Merchants to make a narrow search or prie into such places ashore as were convenient or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for landing, or what Havens were fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Shipping. For, although hee saith they knew the Sea-Coast; yet, as <hi>Caesar</hi> affirm's, they were utterly ignorant, what ports were fit to receiv a number of the greater sort of Ships. And it seem's, Merchants were permitted to visit the Sea-Coasts, onely by Coasting about, and using Commerce in the very Sea with the Inhabitants of the Island. The old Greek Interpreter of <hi>Caesar,</hi> saith also upon the place, <hi>None els, besides Merchants, were easily admitted among the Britains:</hi> That is to say, neither by Land nor by Sea, whereof they had (as hath been shewn) a very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent use, and from which they excluded all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, except Merchants, as from a part of that Territorie, whereof they were Lords in possession. From whence it follow's also, that they also who were wont to cross the Sea often out of <hi>Gaul</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> to bee train'd up in the learning and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>Druïdes,</hi> could not do it without rendring themselvs liable to punishment for their boldness, if leav were not first had from the pettie Kings or Lords of the Island. From those pettie Kings, I mean, that ruled upon the Sea-Coast: For, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> at that time were not subject to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a single Person.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64062:130"/>
fitted to bear the brunt of any assault whatsoëver; and that <abbr>CCXX</abbr> sail or thereabout in number, went out of the Haven very well manned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with all necessaries for War, to oppose the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Navie. It is very probable, that the most of these were Auxiliaries fetched by the <hi>Veneti</hi> out of <hi>Britain,</hi> or how great soëver the <hi>Venetan</hi> strength was at Sea, yet that it was not greater then the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> may bee collected from the same Author: For, hee write's expresly, that Auxilaries were not onely sent for at that time by the <hi>Veneti</hi> out of <hi>Britain,</hi> but also that they had very many Ships wherewith they used to sail into <hi>Britain:</hi> But yet, as it hath been shewn out of him alreadie, no man might sail hand over head into <hi>Britain,</hi> or without leav of the <hi>Britains.</hi> It is not to bee doubted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that, besides their Twig or leathern Vessels, they had a stout gallant Navie, which was able even at pleasure to exclude those Ships of the <hi>Veneti</hi> that were best armed. Els, how could it bee, that none but Merchants were admitted out of <hi>Gaul</hi> upon the Sea-Coast of <hi>Britain?</hi> Moreover, the whole Senate of the <hi>Veneti</hi> having been put to death by <hi>Caesar,</hi> not a man was found among those who remained alive after <hi>Brutus</hi> his Victorie, that could discover (so much as one Port of <hi>Britain;</hi> as appear's out of the same Author. Which how it might bee admitted, I do not at all understand, if the strength of those <hi>Veneti</hi> that were wont to sail thither, had been greater then the <hi>British,</hi> or if the <hi>British</hi> had not been much greater then theirs. But the reason why at <hi>Caesar's</hi> arrival afterwards, no Ship of that kinde was found upon the <hi>British</hi> Sea or Shore (which <note n="s" place="margin">De C.

This is plainly to bee understood of the <hi>British</hi> Sea. And <hi>Hegisippus</hi> an old Autor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (representing the person of King <hi>Agrippa</hi> speaking to the Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi>) saith, <note n="c" place="margin">De Excidio Hierosolymit. lib. 2. cap. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>It was more to have passed over the Sea to the</hi> Britains, <hi>then to have triumphed over the</hi> Britains <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs.

But what could they do, when the Elements were once subdued to the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire? The Sea taught them to bear the yoke of servitude, after that it self had upon the arrival of the</hi> Roman <hi>Shipping acknowledg'd an unusual subjection.</hi> Hence it was also, (as<note n="d" place="margin">In Claudio, cap. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith) that in honor of the Prince, the resemblance of a Ship was fixed upon the top of the imperial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. But these particulars relate onely to the more Southerly part of the Sea. <hi>Claudius</hi> never had any Navie sail to the <hi>North;</hi> For, his Conquest reached not so far. But the <hi>Romans</hi> sail'd about the Island first in the daies of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and then it was, that they first discover'd and subdued that remotest part of the Sea. <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the life of <hi>Agricola</hi> who was Lievtenant in the Province of <hi>Britain,</hi> saith, <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Navie sailing then the first time</hi> (under <hi>Domitian</hi>) <hi>about the Island, affirmed this Coast of the remotest</hi> (Caledonian) <hi>Sea to bee the Isle of</hi> Britain, <hi>and hee discover'd and subdued also those Isles called the</hi> Orcades, <hi>which had been unknown till that time.</hi> To the same purpose also speak's <hi>Juvenal,</hi>

any Shipping at all upon the Sea-Coasts of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> without the Mediterranean Sea. At least, it is no where mentioned by antient Writers.

For, it was even the whole Navie of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that which belonged wholly to the Sea, not having any relation at all to the Rivers.

bee able to judg of the former (as wee often use to do) by the latter cours that was taken in ordering affairs, and disposing of Guards and Garrisons. But that this was a compleat Navie, and had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Prefect or Commander in chief over it, is testified by a fragment of an antient Inscription in a Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Palatium Capranicense,</hi>

had tho <hi>Romans</hi> or their Dukes or Counts any thing at all to do within the Isle with the <hi>Saxons.</hi> So that it must needs bee gross ignorance in Histories, and in the Calculation of time, to set down any <hi>Saxon Limit</hi> or <hi>Saxon Shore</hi> in the Island it self, whilst the Roman Empire flourished, or had any kinde of Autoritie in this Countrie. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore is more evident then that the Shore lying on the other side of the Sea over against the South and Eastern Coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> as wee described it before, was called the <hi>Saxon</hi> in that Dignitie or Command.

                           <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> where hee saith, information was given by a Messenger, <hi>that</hi> Britain <hi>was reduced to an extreme low condition by a barbarous Conspiracie; and that</hi> Nectaridius <hi>Count of the Sea-Coast, and</hi> Buchobaudes <hi>the Duke were surprized unawares by the craft of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Nor is any difference to bee imagined between the Dignitie of the <hi>Count of the Saxon Shore,</hi> in this sens, <hi>throughout Britain,</hi> and that which the fore-named <hi>C.

                           </hi> ought to bee put in stead of <hi>Militum <hi>Souldiers:</hi>
                           </hi> For it is not agreeable to the nature of the Imperial Offices, that the word <hi>Militum</hi> should bee admitted in that place. And it appear's most certain by those things which follow, that <hi>Italie, Africa,</hi> the Tract of <hi>Strasburgh, Britain,</hi> and the <hi>Saxon Shore,</hi> had their respective <hi>Counts,</hi> as <hi>Comites Limitum <hi>Counts of the Limits</hi>
                           </hi> or Bounds, no otherwise than those Territories which are added there next after; as <hi>Mauritania Caesariensis, Tripolis,</hi> and other Provinces in like manner, besides <hi>Britain,</hi> which had their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Dukes</hi> likewise, by the name of <hi>Duces Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum <hi>Dukes of the Limits.</hi>
                           </hi> But now both the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> had the very Shore of the Island for their Limit or Bound. And therefore seeing it is so, what Limit had that <hi>Count</hi> relation to, was who entitled of the <hi>Saxon Shore throughout Britain,</hi> if you will not yield that hee took his Title from the Shore lying over against us? There was a <hi>Duke,</hi> and a <hi>Count of Britain</hi> (simply so called) besides a <hi>Vicarius</hi> or <hi>Deputie of Britain,</hi> who governed the whole Island according to their several charges; and wee finde in the <hi>Breviarie,</hi> that both the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> and the <hi>Deputie</hi> had for the signal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Offices, the whole Island, but in several Forms, encompassed with the Sea; even as the <hi>Count of the Saxon Shore</hi> had the Isle in like manner, encompassed with Sea-Towns or Ports. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, it is manifest by those which are set forth in the <hi>Breviarie of Dignities,</hi> that the <hi>Deputie, Duke,</hi> and <hi>Count of Britain</hi> had the very Territories of the Isle for the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64062:151"/>
Limits of their Government, and so also that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themselvs to the very Shores every where throughout the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Romans.</hi> So that also both the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Count of Britain</hi> ought to have been entitled in like manner from the <hi>Saxon Shore</hi> as from a Limit or Bound, if the Shore of <hi>Britain</hi> had been called by this name at that time. For, wee plainly see, that the Islands of <hi>Britain</hi> themselvs, so far as the Isles about it are comprehended under that name, are expressly described under the notion of Limits, in that Catologue of Dignities relating to <hi>Limits,</hi> which wee have cited out of the <hi>Breviarie.</hi> Therefore from hence also it appear's, that Limit which was the <hi>Saxon Shore</hi> is to bee reckoned without the Island, and so in the Shore over against us or which lie's beyond Sea, according to that which wee proved before in our Discours. Nor truly, is it to bee passed over without observation, seeing there are very many signal Ornaments of Sea-Provinces and Jurisdictions, as well as of those within Land, pictured in the <hi>Breviarie,</hi> and this according to the Form or Fashion received from those that had the supreme power, by the principal Secretaries or others who drew up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions; That not only no Ornaments at all are found in the Dignities of the West, wherein there is any Tract of the Sea, except those which belong to the Government of Jurisdiction of <hi>Britain,</hi> nor indeed in the Dignities of the East, except the Counts of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Isauria</hi> (both whose Ornaments had a Sea-bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about them;) but also that the Sea was ever placed round about in the signal Ornaments belonging to the four several Governments or Jurisdictions of <hi>Britain,</hi> that is to say, that of the <hi>Deputie,</hi> the <hi>Duke,</hi> the <hi>Count,</hi> and lastly, the <hi>Count of the</hi> Saxon Shore <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

as it is found among the <hi>Roman</hi> Coins.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64062:154"/>
that the Dominion of the <hi>Romans</hi> was so limited in this Sea, according to their possession of the shore, that they had little power in that part of the <hi>British</hi> Sea, which border'd upon the shores of those <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Nations, who were not under their obedience: This is to bee taken chiefly of the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, and the rest that lie's North-west. For when the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire began to decline, not onely <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the Isle of <hi>Man</hi> also, and the other Isles of the Western Sea, and a great portion of the more Northerly part of <hi>Britain,</hi> was possessed by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> so that wee have sufficient ground to conceiv, that they also had an antient Dominion of their own in the neighboring Sea. And so let this serv to have been spoken concerning the Empire or Dominion of the <hi>British</hi> Sea, in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as that which by antient Right no less belong'd to the Isle and the Empire thereof, then either a Wall or Suburbs unto a Citie.

For this caus also it was, that the <hi>Danes</hi> growing strong at Sea, K. <hi>Alfred</hi> mightily augmented his Naval Forces, by building ships twice as long as the <hi>Danish</hi> ships, deeper, nimbler, and less rocking or rolling, and so much more convenient for Sea-Fights. <hi>Florentius</hi> the Monk saith, <hi>In the same year</hi> (that is to say, the year of our Lord <abbr>MCCCXCVII</abbr>.) <hi>the Forces of the Pagans residing in East-England and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, using Piracie upon the Sea-Coasts, did grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously infest the West-Saxon's Countrie, with very long and nimble ships, which they had built divers years before.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64062:160"/>
In the very Entrie whereof hee is reported to have said to his Lords, that then his Successors might boast themselvs Kings of</hi> England, <hi>when they should bee thus attended by so many Kings, and enjoy the state and glory of such honors;</hi> or, as <hi>Malmsburie</hi> write's of the same thing, <hi>when they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy so great a Prerogative of honors:</hi> So many Kings as Vassals, to bee readie alwaies to assist with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whensoëver they should bee required, both by Sea and Land. There is also a notable testimonie in the same <hi>Florentius,</hi> and the Monk of <hi>Malmsburie,</hi> how that this King sailed round about his Sea every year, and secured it with a constant Guard and Forces. <hi>Every Summer,</hi> saith <hi>Malmsburie, immediately after</hi> Easter, <hi>bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ships upon every shore to bee brought into a Bodie, sailing usually with the Eastern Fleet to the West part of the Island, and then sending it back, hee sail'd with the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Fleet unto the Northern, and thence with the Northern hee returned to the Eastern, beeing indeed very diligent to prevent the Incursions of Pirats; that is, behaving himself in this manfully</hi> (as say <hi>Florentius</hi> also, and <hi>Hoveden</hi>) <hi>for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Kingdom against Foreiners, and the training up of himself and his people for warlike emploiments.</hi> Thus the Guardianship or maintenance of the Dominion by Sea is evident.</p>
                        <p>But as concerning the Fleets aforementioned, they each of them consisted of <abbr>MCC</abbr> ships, and these, as Writers say expressly, <hi>very stout ones;</hi> so that in the time of his Reign, the <hi>British</hi> Navie consisted of such ships to the number of <hi>Three thousand six hundred Sail,</hi> as <note n="m" place="margin">In anno 975.</note> 
                           <hi>Florentius</hi> and <hi>Hoveden</hi> speak expressly. But others write, that these Fleets amounted to <hi>Four thousand</hi> ships; as <note n="u" place="margin">Ms. In Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liothecâ Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniana.</note>

see in <hi>Florilegus.</hi> So, as <hi>Florentius</hi> also saith, <hi>Hee by the help of God governed and secured the bounds of his Kingdom with Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance, as long as hee lived, and having the courage of a fierce Lion, hee kept all the Princes and Lords of the Isles in aw.</hi> Wee read also in <hi>Ordericus Vitalis,</hi> of King <hi>Harold</hi> or <hi>Herald,</hi> that hee so <hi>guarded the Sea with a force of soldierie and shipping, that none of his Enemies could without a sore conflict, invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> So that wee cannot otherwise conceiv, but that these Naval Forces were at that time disposed, and the Sea-Fights undertaken, for the defence and guard of the Sea, as an Appendant of the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Dominion in this Island.

                           <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi> saith) <hi>that eight marks should bee paid to everie Rower of his Navie, and ten marks to each Commander, out of all England.</hi> Hee saith again also of the same King; <hi>that hee appointed Officers through all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to collect the Tax imposed, without favouring any, and therewith to provide all things necessarie for his Forces at Sea.</hi> And <hi>Florentius</hi> saith; <note n="g" place="margin">Anno eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> 
                           <hi>Hee gave command for the paying of eight marks to every Rower of his Navie, and twelve</hi> (so wee read it in that Autor) <hi>to everie Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, out of all</hi> England; <hi>a Tax indeed so grievous, that scarce any man was able to pay it.</hi> But these things spoken of <hi>Canutus,</hi> his son <hi>Harald,</hi> and <hi>Hardecanute</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late perhaps unto that Tribute or Tax called <hi>Danegeld:</hi> which was paid yearly for the maintenance of the Navie and guarding the Territorie or Dominion by Sea.</p>
                        <p>Among the old Laws of <hi>England</hi> it appear's; <hi>that the paiment of</hi> Danegeld <hi>was first imposed becaus of Pirates</hi> (either Robbers or others invading the Sea.) <hi>For, they infesting the Countrie, wasted it as far as they were able. Therefore for the repressing of their insolence, it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that an yearly paiment should bee made of <hi>Danegeld;</hi> that is to say, twelve pence upon every hide through the whole Land, for the pay of those that should bee imploied to hinder the eruption of Pirates.</hi> So wee read it in som <note n="h" place="margin">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64062:162"/>
Sea. Nor can the word <hi>Eruption</hi> otherwise bee well put in that place. So that even that antient Dignitie of the <hi>Count of the</hi> Saxon <hi>shore</hi> (whereof wee have alreadie spoken) is therefore not obscurely represented by him who commanded as <hi>Admiral</hi> over the Fleets of that Age. This Tribute or Tax had its beginning under King <hi>Ethelred.</hi> For, hee beeing brought into miserable streights by <hi>Swane</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> beeing forced to buy a Peace of him, hired <abbr>XLV</abbr> 
                           <hi>Danish</hi> Ships also by Agreement, for the guarding and securing of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in the Sea, who were to receiv their pay yearly out of this Tribute for their maintenance. For the right understanding whereof, it is to bee observed out of the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Storie, that the Tribute or Tax usually paid at that time to the <hi>Danes,</hi> was of more kindes then one. There was one Tribute or sum of Monie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> were forced somtimes to buy Peace of such as grievously infested the Island. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was levied to pay the <hi>Danish</hi> Navie, which was hired to guard the Sea and defend the Sea-Coasts. The first kinde of Tribute appear's by that of <hi>Florentius</hi> and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> in the year <abbr>MVII</abbr>. <hi>Ethelred King of</hi> England <hi>by the advice of his Lords, sending Embassadors to the</hi> Danes, <hi>gave them Commission to declare, that hee was willing to defray their Charges and pay them a Tribute upon this condition, that they would desist from rapine, and establish a firm Peace with him. To which demand of his they yielded. And from that time their charge was defraied by all</hi> England, <hi>and a Tribute paid, which amounted to</hi> 36000 <hi>pounds.</hi> That is, hee effected this onely for the present, <hi>that hee obteined a peace for a time by monie, which hee could not by Arms,</hi> as <hi>Florilegus</hi> saith well. Four years after also, <hi>all the great Lords of</hi> England <hi>of both Orders, met together at</hi> London <hi>before Easter, and there they staid so long till paiment was made of the Tribute promised
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64062:163"/>
to the</hi> Danes, <hi>amounting to fourtie eight thousand pounds;</hi> which wee reade of likewise both in <hi>Florentius</hi> and <note n="k" place="margin">Anno 1012</note> 
                           <hi>Hoveden.</hi> But this was paid to the intent, <hi>that all</hi> Danes <hi>which were in the Kingdom, should in every place dwell peaceably by the English, and that both People should have as it were one heart and one soul,</hi> as it is expressed by <hi>Florilegus.</hi> Other passages of the same kinde there are in the storie of that Age, yea and som of an elder date. Yet this first kinde of Tribute was not wont to bee paid yearly, but levied now and then, as occasion required. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may bee true perhaps which <note n="l" place="margin">Autor Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici Melrosen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, Ms. in Bibliotheca Cottoniana.</note> som write, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelred</hi> in the aforesaid agreement of the year <abbr>MVII</abbr> 
                           <hi>yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay every year a Tribute of Thirtie six Thousand pounds to the</hi> Danes, <hi>for a longer continuation of the peace.</hi> Wee read here that hee yielded or granted, but no where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that hee paid it. But as for the second kinde of Tribute, which was to bee paid (as wee have told you) for hire of the <hi>Danish</hi> Navie, it was a yearly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and levied at the same time, at least in the same year, (to wit, of our Lord <abbr>MXII</abbr>.) wherein these four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eight thousand pounds were paid to procure a peace. Nor was it limited by any set-summe of monie, but so much as would serv for victualling, and clothing the Forces at Sea. <hi>Florentius</hi> and <hi>Hoveden</hi> in the aforesaid year say; <hi>After these things, upon paiment of the Tribute,</hi> (meaning that of fourtie eight thousand pounds) <hi>and a confirmation of the peace by Oaths, the</hi> Danish <hi>Navie which was before in a Bodie, was disposed and dispersed abroad afar off.

Nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that they were sufficiently agreed touching the Tribute and Taxes before the next, or one thousand and thirteenth year. For, concerning that year, <hi>Florentius, Hoveden,</hi> and others speak expresly thus; <hi>In the mean time the Tyrant</hi> Swane <hi>gave command to make readie Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in abundance for his Navie, and for paiment of an almost intolerable Tribute.

Nor is it any prejudice to this autoritie, that the other things there related are fabulous; For wee know that out of the Fables of <hi>Heliodorus, Achilles, Tatius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Prodromus, Eustathius,</hi> and such others, whether of an amorous or any other strain, somtimes many use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful observations may bee gathered concerning the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, manners, and received opinions, as well of the men among whom they are feigned to bee acted, as of the times to which they are related. <hi>John Harding</hi> also, who, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, wrote an Historie of the affairs of <hi>England</hi> in vers, when hee reckons up those Princes that sware fealtie to King <hi>Canutus</hi> for the Lands which they held of him, <note n="d" place="margin">Chap. 117.</note> hee adds

                              <l>So did the Kings of Wales of high parage,</l>

That is to say, <hi>the same was don at that time by the greatest Kings of</hi> Wales, <hi>and of all the North-western Sea, for their respective Kingdoms and Territories.</hi> Thus <hi>Canutus</hi> was King of the Kings of that Sea, which hee himself also sufficiently declares, when hee expressly affirms in what was before related, that the Sea it self was under his

Dominion. And so much for testimonies, to prove that the <hi>British</hi> Sea hath been possessed not onely by the <hi>Britains,</hi> after they had cast off the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, but also by the <hi>English-Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Kings.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it seem's they did use to take a kinde of cours for the strengthning and preservation of their Dominion, both by Sea and Land, as the antient <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (of whom both <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> are a part) were wont to do for the defence of their midland Cities. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them</hi> (saith <note n="e" place="margin">De Bello Gallico, l. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Caesar</hi>) <hi>it was the highest glory to make very large depopulations, and lay all the Countrie round about them waste; measuring their honor by their distance from any neighbor, and accounting it the onely token of valor when none durst plant themselvs within their reach; and besides, they thought by this means to render themselvs more secure by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the fear of any sudden incursion.</hi> So it hath been the manner of those that at any time have made themselvs Masters of the Kingdom of <hi>Britain,</hi> to extend their Dominion in the circumambient Sea to the largest Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, scouring the Seas about, and keeping other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at a distance, as it were from the Wall or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of the Island. Nor were those <hi>German</hi> Cities more Masters of that waste part of the Countrie that lay about them, then the King's of <hi>Britain</hi> were over the Sea of the same name. But as wee observed before of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> so here also it is to bee noted of the <hi>Norwegians</hi> or <hi>Normans,</hi> (for many times they are to bee taken for one and the same people) and other Northern Nations, That those <hi>British</hi> Isles which are situated in the West and Northern Sea, were somtimes so possessed by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> as also by the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> and such others as infested the Northern Sea, and invaded the Isles ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them and <hi>Britain,</hi> that it is not to bee

doubted, but they also according to the various altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Dominions by Land, succeeded one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that interval of time, in the possession of a proportionable part of the Sea also, as an Appendant to every one of the shores of <hi>Britain</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> (saith an <note n="f" place="margin">

But in the mean time it is sufficiently manifest, that as by reason of the tumultuarie &amp; unsetled posture of affairs in those daies, the Dominion of the Island it self was very often tossed to and fro; so also the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sea was in like manner attempted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed, invaded, recovered, and defended, as that which did inseparably follow the Dominion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie of the Island.

                        <p>AS concerning the Guard or Government of this Sea, there are three things therein that deserv spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial consideration. 1. <hi>The bare mention and nature of the Guard of the Sea,</hi> and of the <hi>Guardians or Admirals</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in publick Records and Histories. 2.

Here call to minde those observations touching this kinde of Guard, which have been alreadie gathered out of that Record or Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viarie of <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Doomesday.</hi> And King <hi>Henrie</hi> the first, saith <hi>Florentius</hi> of <hi>Worcester, gave order to his</hi> Butsecarli <hi>to guard the Sea, and take care that no person from the parts of</hi> Normandie, <hi>approach the</hi> English <hi>Coasts.</hi> The same saith <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> in the very same words almost, save onely that the printed Copies err in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Nor is it to bee omitted, that in antient times before the autoritie of the high Admirals of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was sufficiently established by our Kings, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so distinct, that the Command and Government of the Sea did belong onely to them, the Governors or Keepers of the Provinces whom wee call <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the Counties, by virtue of their Office had also som

Custodie or Command of part of that Sea which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to their respective Provinces, as of a part of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Which truly (to let pass other proofs) is sufficiently evident by this, that many times in those daies, they who, by the Common Law of the Land, were wont, as at this day, to put in execution the Commands of the King in those places onely that were committed severally to their charge and custodie, did do the same also in the Sea it self as well as in any Land-Province belonging to him from whom they received their autoritie. For, by virtue of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie power derived from the King, and such as was founded upon the very same right by which they held the Government of the Countie or Province, they did oftentimes remove the King's Ships and Fleets from one Port to another by Sea, as through the Territorie of the Province that was committed to their charge.

                        <p>And afterwards there follow verie many other particulars in the King's Commission, setting forth that most ample Command and Jurisdiction. In former times, as hath been alreadie shewn you, this kinde of Commanders were called <hi>Custodes Maris, <hi>Guardians or Keepers of the Sea,</hi>
                           </hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward began to bee invested with the name of <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the First. But their Commands were usually restrained to certain Limits of Coasts; So that particular Commanders were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times set over each of the Three, Western, Southern, and Northern Coasts, but for the most part over the Western and Northern. Seldom was one set over both, before that the Title of Admiral of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Aquitain</hi> was put into the Commissions; of which more by and by. But as the name of <hi>Guardian of the Sea</hi> was taken from the Sea it self, whereof hee was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor as of a Province; so that of <hi>Admirals</hi> (a word, whose Original is very uncertain; but <gap reason="foreign">

For, the Southern and Western Coast did, as appear's by the thing it self, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie one and the same: That is to say, the Coast stretched here and there along the Shore from the North of the <hi>Thames.</hi> But as the Dignitie of those Officers called <hi>Comes</hi> and <hi>Magister Equitum</hi> of the West, <hi>Magister Equitum</hi> throughout Gallia, <hi>Magister Militum</hi> throughout the East, <hi>Magister Militum</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Thrace,</hi> and others of that kinde in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Offices, did no less denote the Autoritie and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of them that commanded in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, who before were Lords of the Provinces, than if they had been called <hi>Comes</hi> and <hi>Magister</hi> of the West, <hi>Magister</hi> throughout <hi>Gallia,</hi> throughout the <hi>East,</hi> and throughout <hi>Thrace;</hi> so it is evident, that the Admirals of the Fleets and Navies (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Sea is guarded after the same manner, as the Land is possessed by Land-Forces) did no less set forth the Command and Dominion, and civil possession of those that had autoritie over the Sea (who before were Lords of the Sea) then if they had been styled Guardians of the Sea, Commanders, or Admirals, in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions.

                        <head>It is proved by words plain enough in the <hi>form of the Commissions</hi> for the Government or command of the high <hi>Admiral of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from antient to the present time, that the Sea, for whose guard or defence, hee was appointed by the King of England as Lord and Soveraign, was ever bounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, by the shore of <hi>Aquitain, Normandie,</hi> and <hi>Picardie. CHAP. XVII.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>BUT in the Form alreadie shewn, which hath continued in use for so many years, you see menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made onely <hi>of the Seas of our Kingdoms of</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>our Dominions, and Islands belonging to the same,</hi> as the Province, for whose guard or defence the <hi>Admiral</hi> was appointed; that is, (as wee have told you) the <hi>English, Irish,</hi> and <hi>Welch</hi> Sea, all which is conteined under the name of the <hi>British,</hi> as it hath been observéd at the beginning of this Book. Yet the names of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, Gascoign,</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> besides <hi>Calais,</hi> are added, which are Provinces seated upon the shore over against us. As to what concern's them in this place, they are either to bee considered in the same manner as if they had been alwaies held in subjection by the <hi>English</hi> from the time of the first mention of them in the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or as they have alreadie for som Ages past been out of their Jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>But suppose in the first place, that they had alwaies remained in the Jurisdiction and Possession of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
                           <pb n="313" facs="tcp:64062:186"/>
Questionless, howsoêver the Admiral of <hi>England</hi> might then, according to this Form of Commission, have had Courts of Admiraltie in those Provinces (as there is no place almost without Courts of Admiraltie, even where not any Dominion of the Sea at all is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to belong unto the place, wherein they are held) yet by no means might hee thence bee called Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Sea it self (if so bee you except the Ports, and such like Creeks of the Sea, which are as it were incorporated within Land) either as it may bee said to belong to <hi>Normandie,</hi> or to <hi>Aquitain, Gascoign</hi> or <hi>Picardie:</hi> But by virtue of this form of Commission, hee had exercised Maritim Jurisdiction in those Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, no otherwise almost than our Admiral in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or others the like do at this day, over men's persons &amp; goods upon the <hi>African, Mediterranean, Indian,</hi> or any other Sea at a remote distance: For, the extent of such a Jurisdiction by Sea is without bounds. But the extent of his Jurisdiction, or of the Sea, over which hee is placed Admiral, as Warden, Guardian, or President, to defend and keep it under the Dominion of him who is Lord thereof, are bounded. And it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear's by express words of the antient form of Commission, that no Sea is conteined therein, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to bee defended, but that which is either <hi>English, Welch,</hi> or <hi>Irish,</hi> or relate's to <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as an appendant. From whence it follow's, that those names of the opposite shores in the Commissions do not at all mention the Sea flowing between as proper to those shores, or belonging to them in any kind, but serv onely as a limit beyond the Sea (so far as concern's the limiting of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Sea;) as those names also of <hi>England, VVales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> serv in stead of a limit on this side of the Sea, so far as in the Commissi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="314" facs="tcp:64062:187"/>
on they denote the Sea under the Admiral's Charge or Protection: So that, even as that Officer called the <hi>Count of the Saxon shore throughout Britain,</hi> was eminently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the name of his dignitie, Commander of the whole Sea flowing between <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> as of a particular Province, (which hath been shewn <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 6. of this Book.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie) and had the name of the opposite shore for the limit of his Jurisdiction; so the high Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or Commander of the Sea belonging to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Empire, hath in the King's Commission the shore of <hi>Normandie, Gascoign, Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Picardie,</hi> to set forth onely the beyond-Sea limits of his Jurisdiction or Command (so far as hee hath charge of defending the Sea-Province or Dominion belonging to <hi>England</hi>) in those shores which lie over against us. For, if any say, that the case is otherwise, wherefore then is not the sea over which hee hath command, denominated from som of these shores over against us, as well as of the English, Irish, and Welch, or <hi>the Seas of the Kingdoms of</hi> England, Ireland, <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>and of the Dominions and Isles belonging to the same?</hi> The Reason is, becaus no other Sea, as it fall's under a Civil consideration (for wee speak not here of the denomination given by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers) doth flow between the Territories on this and the other side of the Sea which are mentioned in his Commission. Therefore as in that Roman dignitie of the <hi>Count of the Saxon shore throughout Britain,</hi> the shore was the transmarine bound or limit of that dignitie, so also in the Command of the high Admiral of <hi>England</hi> (so far onely as hee hath a Province or Jurisdiction by Sea, as a Governor of a Territorie) those opposite shores or transmarine Provinces, named in his Commission, are to bee reckoned the Bounds of the Sea under his Charge or Protection. And this truly is sufficiently
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64062:187"/>
apparent from the words of the Commission alreadie handled, if so bee wee suppose (as hitherto wee have don for discours sake) that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did, all the while that form of Commission was in use, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain those Beyond sea Provinces under their Dominion as the <hi>Romans</hi> had don of old. But the matter is made more evident, if wee observ how the names of those Provinces have, at least, from the time of Queen <hi>Marie,</hi> been so kept in the form of this Commission, that since her Reign there remain's not the least ground for any of those in the Commission, to signifie any other thing than what wee have alreadie declared: For, in her Reign <hi>Calais</hi> was yielded up to the <hi>French,</hi> and since that time, the <hi>English</hi> have not been possessed of any Province up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any part of the opposite shore.</p>
                        <p>Moreover also, in the one and thirtieth year of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt, or <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 
                           <abbr>MCCCCLIII</abbr>. the <hi>English</hi> were driven out of <hi>Gascoign, Aquitain,</hi> and the other Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Charls</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: Nor was there after the time of this <hi>Henrie,</hi> any Officer or Governor of Note appointed, or that could conveniently bee appointed by the <hi>English</hi> either in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> or in <hi>Aquitain</hi> it self; yea, nor in <hi>Normandie,</hi> either after or long before the loss of <hi>Aquitain.</hi> It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Countie of <hi>Guise, Calais,</hi> and som other Towns in <hi>Picardie,</hi> besides those neighboring ones that <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight gained by force of arms in the same Countrie, remained long after in subjection to the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> yea, and that a small part of <note n="b" place="margin">

Nor doth it make to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, that somtimes under som of our later Kings, there was one appointed <hi>Captain General</hi> or <hi>Governor over
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64062:188"/>
all our subjects in Normandie,</hi> with which Title both <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Adrian Poynings</hi> were honor'd in the time of Queen <note n="c" place="margin">Rot. Pat. 4. Eliz. R. part. 1. in dorso.</note> 
                           <hi>Elisabeth.</hi> For, they were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Generals of the Forces that were transported thither to assist the King of <hi>France,</hi> not invested at all with any Government or Command of the Dutchie of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie.</hi> But yet, even after the time of <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt, the name of <hi>Aquitain</hi> was constantly retained in the Commission of the High Admiralship of <hi>England:</hi> That is, for one hundred and fourscore years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, after the <hi>English</hi> were driven out of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> as appear's in the former Chapter. Hereto at length was added (as is shewn there also) the name of <hi>Normandie,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight: whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the King of <hi>England,</hi> was not possessed of <hi>Normandie</hi> a long time before, nor in any wise after; nor did hee in that agreement <note n="d" place="margin">Rot. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae, 2 Hen. 8.</note> made a little before with the King of <hi>France,</hi> claim any other possession in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> besides that of <hi>Calais,</hi> and the Territorie of <hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Hammes.</hi> And so it hath continued now for one hundred twentie two years also in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Maritim Government or high Admiralship of <hi>England,</hi> without any relation at all had to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Command of the Dutchie it self, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the shore, which bounded the Sea under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's protection, upon the Coast of <hi>France.</hi> For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Aquitain</hi> indeed was first added to the names of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in that Commission, while the <hi>English</hi> possessed the Dutchie of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> nevertheless it not onely so remained likewise in that form of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission constantly, even after the expulsion of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> until our times, but <hi>Normandie</hi> also (which had never been named before in the Commission of high Admiral of <hi>England</hi>) was added, and this som Ages
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64062:188"/>
after that the <hi>English</hi> were wholly deprived of the Dutchie it self: So that either these names do serv in stead of a Limit to the Sea under his protection, or els wee must perforce admit contrarie to reason, that they signified nothing in the Commission for so many years. For, wee see that those names of opposite Shore were reteined in the Admiral's Commission, even from the end of Queen <hi>Marie's</hi> Reign until our times, or for the space of 77 years, though the <hi>English</hi> in the mean time were not possest of the least part of <hi>France;</hi> as also that <hi>Normandie</hi> was added many years before, but yet long after the <hi>English</hi> were outed of its possession. Nor ought any man fondly to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that these Names were inserted, becaus of that right the King of <hi>England</hi> had to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> For indeed, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have, by an antient Right, usually entitled themselvs Kings of <hi>France:</hi> Also the Dutchies of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Normandie</hi> and the other Provinces of <hi>France</hi> mentioned in this Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, are comprehended in that name of the Kingdom, as the lesser in the greater. But if that had been the caus, certainly the name of <hi>France</hi> should have been ascribed to our Admiral; yea, and other Officers of that Kingdom have been made in the same manner by the King of <hi>England</hi> after hee was driven thence: Of which thing there is not the least evidence indeed any where exstant. And it is to bee observed, as soon as ever an alteration was made in the Draught of the Commission, from that denomination of the Command of the Admirals of <hi>England,</hi> which was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Fleets and Coasts over which they had command, unto that which is made up of the Kingdoms and Provinces, that then an Addition was made of <hi>Aquitain;</hi> to the end that the limit or Bound,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64062:189"/>
as well on this as the other side of the Sea, might bee pointed out by the Shores: The name of <hi>Normandie</hi> beeing added afterwards, and reteined still together with <hi>Calais</hi> and the Marches thereof and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same account. But while that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were in former times possest of <hi>Normandie, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitain,</hi> and other Countries in <hi>France,</hi> there are not found in the form of Commission, wherein the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Provinces (as hath been alreadie shewn) are expressly nominated, any other Admirals or Governors of the Maritim Province or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by Sea made by them, besides those to whose care the Fleets and Coasts were committed in the manner alreadie mentioned; that is to say, the whole Sea flowing between our <hi>British</hi> Isles and the Provinces over against them, and the Fleets belonging to any Territories whatsoëver of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> were at that time by a peculiar right of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in the Sea, so subject to them who were so put in Command over the <hi>English</hi> Fleets and Coasts, that there remained neither place nor use for any other Commanders of that kinde. Which may bee said likewise of those times, wherein som of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> stood possessed also of the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> as <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and the two <hi>Henries</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Nor is it a bare conjecture, that they did not put any others in command over the Sea and Fleets, besides those to whom, by right onely of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> the power was committed (to wit, according to that right which comprehended the whole Sea flowing between) but it is sufficiently proved also upon this ground, that wee have the antient publick <note place="margin">

                        <p>And if it bee demanded here, wherefore it was that the Shore of <hi>Bretaign</hi> was omitted (which in like manner lie's over against our Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi> and together with the Shore of <hi>Picardie, Normandie,</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> sufficiently take's up that whole Tract which stretcheth it self in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> before the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Sea;) certainly, if the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned reason take place, there is little caus to doubt that it hapned thence, becaus the King of <hi>England</hi> was not at any time so possest of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> that beeing outed of it, hee needed to bee very sollicitous touching the Bounds of the Sea-Territorie adjoining. Distinct Lords of Territories confining on each other (as were the King of <hi>England</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; for <hi>Bretaign</hi> had Kings and Dukes of its own before <hi>Charls</hi> the Eight, under whom, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1491. it was united to the Realm of <hi>France</hi>) do for the most part keep their Bounds so distinct, that they may bee the more evidently taken notice of by all; but when of such kinde of Territories there is but one and the same Lord (as the King of <hi>England</hi> was while hee possessed either <hi>Normandie</hi> or <hi>Aquitain</hi> or any other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritim Province in <hi>France</hi> together with <hi>England</hi>) hee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outed of either, ought above all things to take care that the past confusion of possession bee not prejudicial to the future distinction of Bounds. For fear then, lest it might have been pretended that even the Sea ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining or confining with those Maritim Provinces, which were a long time heretofore possessed by the <hi>English</hi> and afterwards taken away, was taken away
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64062:190"/>
together with the Provinces, whenas perhaps, by reason of the past confusion of possession in one and the same Lord, all men might not bee sufficiently instructed touching the Bounds of the <hi>English</hi> Sea placed, as wee have said, upon the Shore over against us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the setting forth of those Bounds, the name first of <hi>Aquitain</hi> after its beeing lost was reteined in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's Commission, and then that also of <hi>Normandie</hi> was added. And afterwards both of them, with the name of <hi>Calais</hi> and the <hi>Marches,</hi> in stead of the Shore of <hi>Picardie,</hi> were for the same reason continued down to our times. Which reason truly could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Bretaign</hi> at all; nor <hi>Flanders</hi> likewise, nor any other Shores lying Eastward over against us: All which nevertheless do, after the same manner, bound the Sea-Territorie of <hi>England.</hi> Moreover, those things that have been hitherto observed, shall bee confirmed, by what wee shall add next, touching the Office of Admiral among the <hi>French.</hi>

                        <p>THat there were Admirals also constituted by the <hi>French</hi> King upon the opposit Shore of <hi>France,</hi> is known to everie man. And as there is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral appointed in <hi>Gallia Narbonensis</hi> to over-see mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim Affairs there, so also on the opposite Shore, there are distinct Offices of the Admiral of <hi>Aquitain, Bretaign,</hi> and <hi>Normandie</hi> and the adjoining Coasts. But the <hi>French</hi> Lawyers of late are wont to call their Admiral in Latine <hi>Praefectus Maris, <hi>Governor of the Sea,</hi>
                           </hi> as if the Sea were subject to him also as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; whereas notwithstanding, if the thing bee rightly consider'd that Government of the Sea by what name soëver it bee called, doth not signifie (as among the <hi>English</hi>) any Dominion of one having command in any nearer part of the Sea (for, wee speak not of the Sea of <hi>Marseille,</hi> which hath no relation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

or the Western Shore which lie's more Southerly with <hi>Normandie</hi> by the <hi>English; Bretaign</hi> either by Kings or Dukes of the same, aud <hi>Flanders</hi> by Earls: So that whilst the whole Sea-Coast, except <hi>Picardie,</hi> remained separate from that Kingdom, there was Sea little enough lying before it. Yea, and the Naval Forces were small enough, of which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the accession of a larger Sea-Coast to the <hi>French</hi> Kingdom) there was most use in the expedition of the <hi>holy War.</hi> Nor was any other Governor wont to bee appointed there by the name of Admiral, then hee who as occasion required was put in Command over the Navie and Militarie Affairs by Sea, yea, and was borrowed from som Nation bordering upon the Sea, as the <hi>Genoeses</hi> or others of that kinde. But the Kings themselvs had at that time no Command over the Sea, as it is expressly written by <hi>Johannes Tilius,</hi> a Clark of the Parlament of <hi>Paris.</hi> His words are these; <note n="e" place="margin">

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64062:192"/>
of <hi>France</hi> had gotten ground upon the Sea-Coast, the use of Sea-Affairs also was somwhat augmented; That is to say, about the times of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Henrie</hi> the third Kings of <hi>England.</hi> So that the first Admiral that they reckon in the Catalogue of French dignities, of whom any memorie is left to posteritie, was <hi>Engue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus Coucaeus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Bold King of <hi>France,</hi> or about the year 1280, as it is related by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Feronius.</hi> And what kinde of dignitie his was, appear's sufficiently thence, that his next Successors <hi>Matthew Momorancie,</hi> and <hi>John Harcourt</hi> were onely, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular occasion, put in command over the Sea-Forces by <hi>Philip the fair;</hi> as wee <note n="f" place="margin">Apud An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draeam Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storia Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae Momo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranciae, lib. 3. pag. 183.</note> understand by their Commission.

                           <hi>There are</hi> (saith hee) <hi>four Governors of the French Sea, who bear an equal command under a different title, and upon several Coasts of the Sea.

Which truly there is no man but will conceiv, that shall in the first place observ the defect and deep silence of antient Testimonies, touching such a kinde of Dominion among the French, besides the Qualitie of that Government among them, and at length the entire and most ample Power alwaies exercised throughout the Sea and the shore lying about it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sole command of the English, and will but compare it for so many Revolutions of years, with those so long broken and divided Dominions upon the opposite shore of <hi>France,</hi> and with the late addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea-Coast to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those things which have been alreadie spoken
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64062:193"/>
about it. It is clear, that there are no Testimonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our time, concerning any Dominion of this sea, belonging to the King of <hi>France.</hi> Nor are there any in our time, except certain Lawyers, who speak of it either by the By, or in a Rhetorical flourish onely, not in a way of asserting it by strength of Arguments. Of these things I have spoken alreadie in the former Book; where also other matters are alleged, of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al observation, which confirm what is handled in this particular. But now let us add hereunto, that the very French Historians, both of the past and present Age, do affirm, that in antient times the Kings of <hi>France</hi> therefore either had no Admirals at all, or els that they were constituted now and then (onely as occasion required) <hi>becaus they had no Empire over the Sea,</hi> as <hi>Tilius</hi> saith expresly in the place above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In vain therefore doth <note n="o" place="margin">L'Amiral de France, chap. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>Popellinerius</hi> reprehend those Historians, in saying it is fals, becaus <hi>Normandie, Picardie,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> were heretofore under the French Dominion. For, not to mention this, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> reigned a long time without the possession of <hi>Normandie</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and reteined not any other shore besides that of <hi>Picardie,</hi> (as appear's by what hath been alreadie shewn, and by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Testimonie of Historians) and the consequence doth not appear to bee good, that they had any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the Sea, becaus they were in possession of som Sea-Coast; no more truly than it may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that a man is Lord of a River in <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus hee hath Lands lying by it: whereas by received Custom according to the <note n="p" place="margin">

                        <p>But as to what concern's the Qualitie of this Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim Government among the French; it is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that as every one of the more eminent Offices or Governments, hath a peculiar place in their high Court of Parlament, and that according to the nature of the Government, as it chiefly respect's any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or Government within the limits of the French Dominion, as the <hi>Constable,</hi> the <hi>Grand Escuyer,</hi> or Master of the Hors, the <hi>Grand Master,</hi> and others; yet the <hi>Admiral of</hi> France, hath no place at all upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: As it was determined in the time of <note n="q" place="margin">

For, by the title of Admiral, hee had no Government in Chief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the Kingdom; but becaus beeing Admiral of the Fleets and Sea (in the aforesaid sens) which is out of the King's Dominion, hee exercised Jurisdiction over Persons and Affairs onely upon the Accompt of the Sea; therefore in this respect hee was to bee denied any place. For which caus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it came to pass (as it seem's) that those four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Admirals before-mentioned, have in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner also a Government of Provinces, from which they are wont to bee denominated, as wee understand by these passages alreadie cited out of <hi>Choppinus,</hi> and others that write of this matter. So they that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny principal command within the limits of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that is, within the shores of <hi>France,</hi> do enjoie an equal privilege with the other more eminent digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:64062:195"/>
(unless you fondly except <hi>Edmund</hi> the <hi>Anglo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> by whom the Kingdom was for som little time divided) did Reign without any other sharer in the Dominion upon this shore. No wonder then that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> beeing entire and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lords in command of so ample a shore, for so many Ages, did also take special care to retein the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea lying before it, as an Appendant of the Island; especially seeing they not onely had so long and large a command likewise on the shore over against us, but also there were not any of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors that could in any wise hinder it, except such as possessed som pettie Countries bordering on the Sea (which truly may bee so called, beeing compared to the spacious shore of the English Empire) and those also that were under distinct Jurisdictions.</p>
                        <p>The summe of all this is, seeing that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our great Grand-Father's daies, there was onely a very small shore conteined within the bounds of the French Kingdom, and the Lords of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim Provinces, by the addition whereof that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (as wee have alreadie shewn) was afterwards enlarged, did not so much as pretend any Right to the Dominion of the Neighboring Sea, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of those Provinces; and seeing no Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie can bee had in the Monuments of antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning such a kinde of Dominion, but that very many are found touching the Sea-Dominion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> they having continually posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the whole <hi>English</hi> shore in its full latitude under one entire Empire for above a thousand years, and concerning the perpetual enjoiment of the Sea, as an Appendant of the Kingdom; Therefore it follow's,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64062:196"/>
that their Right is very manifest in this particular, and so that the Sea it self is a Province under the tuition or protection of the Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> as part of the Kingdom; but that the Admirals of the shore lying over against us are not in reason to bee called Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Sea, in such a sens as may signifie any Dominion of a Commander in Chief in the Sea it self, out of the Ports or other In-lets of that kinde. For which caus also it was, that som Ages since ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of the Neighbor-Nations understanding well enough the Right of <hi>England,</hi> made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in express tearms against <hi>Reyner Grimbald</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the King of <hi>France,</hi> becaus that <hi>l' Office del Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralté en la mier d' Engleterre per Commission de Roy de France tourcenousment Emprist &amp; usa un an &amp; plux,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <hi>Henrie</hi> the third resigned his Right to <hi>Normandie.</hi> But suppose wee grant what is commonly received, that these Islands were of the

                           <hi>Norman</hi> Jurisdiction, or belonging to the Dutchie of <hi>Normandie;</hi> yet truly even so, they neither could bee taken away by the sentence, nor did they fall to the <hi>French</hi> by Resignation, forasmuch as the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Sea, and so of the Islands placed therein, was still reteined; after the same manner almost as manie Priories were in <hi>England</hi> it self, who though they were belonging to the <hi>Norman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church-matters, yet even as they were of the Government of <hi>Normandie,</hi> they ever remain'd under the Dominion of <hi>England,</hi> as long as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Monasteries were in force among the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish;</hi> as beeing situate within the undoubted bounds of the <hi>English</hi> Empire. Nor is it easily understood wherefore the Islands could have been so reteined, unless they also had been seated within the bounds of the <hi>English</hi> Empire in the Sea.</p>
                        <p>But the thing chiefly to bee consider'd here is, that verie manie Foreign Nations, as well as the Estates of <hi>England,</hi> did in a Libel or Bill of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint publickly exhibited in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and King <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> before a Court of Delegates specially in that behalf by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, in express terms acknowledg that the King of <hi>England</hi> hath ever been Lord not onely of this Sea, but also of the Islands placed therein, <hi>par raison du Roialme d' Angleterre, upon the account of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>or as they were Kings of England.</hi> Which truly is all one, as in most express terms to ascribe this whole Sea unto them, as far as the Shores or Ports lying over against us. But concerning that Libel, I shall add more by and by. Nor is it to bee omitted, that the addition of a Shore, larger than that of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> hapned first at
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64062:197"/>
that time, wherein those Isles were so reteined by the <hi>English</hi> after they were outed of <hi>Normandie:</hi> For before, the Shores of <hi>Aquitain, Bretaign,</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> were in the possession of other Princes; that of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Normandie</hi> beeing possest by the <hi>English,</hi> and that of <hi>Bretaign</hi> by the Duke or Earl of that Countrie: So that the <hi>French</hi> King had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any shore almost, nor any considerable use of Sea-affairs at that time; by which means also the <hi>English</hi> did with the more ease retain the aforesaid antient possession of the Sea and the Isles, after they were deprived of the <hi>Norman</hi> Dutchie. And this sufficiently appear's also by that Sea-Fight perform'd between the <hi>French</hi> Fleet (commanded by <hi>Eustachius</hi> the Monk, in the time of <hi>Philip Augustus</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>) and the <hi>English</hi> Fleet under the Command of <hi>Philip de Albenie</hi> Governor of the aforesaid Islands, and <hi>John Marshal,</hi> who both carefully guarded the passages of the Sea, in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Third. That is to say, a <hi>French</hi> Fleet of about 80 Sail was designed to transport Auxiliarie Forces out of <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Lewis</hi> (afterwards the Eight of that name that was King of <hi>France</hi>) who through the Treason of som Conspirators, made War upon the <hi>English</hi> King in <hi>England.</hi> This of the <hi>French</hi> was assailed by an <hi>English</hi> Fleet of 40 Sail.

But as touching the English Command over such as pass or sail through their Sea, there are many other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken (as wee shall shew by and by) from the manner of our King's prescribing limits to such as sail in this Sea; as also from those passages which wee have <note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 14 of this Book.</note> alreadie cited out of Records, concerning the Tributes or Customs imposed by the English upon such as passed through the Sea. And truly it is very considerable also, that the Kings both of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> together with the <hi>Hans-Towns,</hi> very often and earnestly begg'd of Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> that they might have free passage through the English Sea with Provisions towards <hi>Spain,</hi> during the Warr betwixt her and the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> I know indeed that such a Licence was denied them not onely in respect of the Dominion of the Sea, but chiefly to prevent the conveying of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions to the Enemie. For which caus also divers Ships belonging to the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> laden with Corn, were <note n="f" place="margin">30 Junii, 1589. quâ de re <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> tunc Londini ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Edita.</note> taken by English men of Warr, in the very Streights of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> without the Sea-Territorie of <hi>England,</hi> which went by the <note n="g" place="margin">Thuanus, Histor. l. 95.</note>

But the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> cried out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that the Laws of Nations, Commerce, and Leagues, were violated; becaus their ships were so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>English</hi> onely upon this account, that they carried Provisions to the Enemie; that is, in a Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64062:203"/>
where the <hi>English</hi> did not in the least pretend to any Dominion. And concerning this particular, there is a notable Question controverted by very <note n="h" place="margin">

That is to say, they were by her first <note n="i" place="margin">1585. As you may read in the Queen's Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1589.</note> Answer enjoined to abstein from transporting Arms with other Warlike Necessaries and Corn, <hi>but</hi> (saith the Queen) <hi>in transporting other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, wee shall not hinder you at all, but shall with all favour permit the ships of your Subjects to abide and pass after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed manner, that they may perform their Voiage.</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer they did not seem to take amiss. But two years after they sent into <hi>England Sebastian à <hi>Berghen</hi>
                           </hi> their Ambassador with Petitionarie Letters, desiring that the Exception in the Licence formerly granted might bee taken away, and a freedom to transport all kindes of Merchandise permitted. Their Petition was denied again, and this moreover added, <hi>That such as should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to do the contrarie, should for their bold presumption suffer the loss of all their Goods and Merchandise so carried against her Majestie's will and pleasure, if they fell into the hands of her Men of Warr, or any other of her Majestie's Subjects.</hi> Thus they ever addressed themselvs by Petitions; and the Queen gave Answers according to her pleasure. They did not so much as pretend the Laws of Nations or of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64062:204"/>
Commerce, before that they understood their ships were seised in another Sea, to wit, that of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which they conceived free for themselvs by the Law of Nations and Commerce, without leav from the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> Then it was they began to plead, that Libertie ought not by any Law to bee denied; even these men who but som years before, had humbly Petitioned the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> more than once for free passage through the English Sea: So that, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point (as som would have it) of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that relief ought not to bee conveyed to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by a Friend, was not onely the ground either of the <hi>Hans-Town's</hi> Petition, or the <hi>Queen's</hi> denial, but her right of Dominion by Sea was concerned also, which the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> well knew they should vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, if they should pass the Queen's Seas without her leav.</p>
                        <p>Hereunto for the same reason those particulars relate, which wee finde concerning this matter in those points that were to bee insisted on in the year <abbr>MDXCVII</abbr>. by <hi>Witfeldius,</hi> and <hi>Bernicovius,</hi> Ambassadors from <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiern</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Embassie in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie.</note> 
                           <hi>Wee were</hi> (say they) <hi>strictly enjoined by our King, to mediate with her Majestie, that our Countrie men may bee permitted a freedom to transport Corn or Provision towards</hi> Spain, <hi>even as wee have don formerly, and do now again with all earnestness desire, especially since it is supposed, that the same Licence of transporting Corn is granted som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both to English and Dutch; that our Countrie-men may not bee used in a wors manner than your own Subjects, and that at least som certain ships might in favor of the King's Majestie, have leav granted them once a year at least, during the Warr, to carrie Provisions; and that wee may bee able to certifie the King our Master, how far wee in this case
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64062:204"/>
prevail.</hi> But the Ambassadors had this Answer; <hi>that the Queen cannot in reason bee induced to consent it should bee don as they desired. And whereas you allege a supposal, that both English and Netherlanders have Licence given them somtimes to transport Corn, Wee</hi> (to wit, the Chief men of her Majestie's Privie-Council, who gave the Answer) <hi>dare confidently affirm, that never any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was granted by the Queen, nor will shee ever incline to grant the like, during the warr.</hi> If the Queen had not in the opinion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> (as well as of the <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> before) been Soveraign of the Sea-Territorie, through which they were to pass, to what end then was this so earnest a Petition, and so imperious an Answer? Here, in this often iterated Petition, no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is pretended besides that which depended upon the Queen's pleasure, as Soveraign of the Passage.</p>
                        <p>For this caus also it was, that <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in that Letter of his sent to Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi> in the year 1587. wherein hee desired leav for <hi>Olavus Wormaeus</hi> a Swede, to carrie Merchandise into <hi>Spain,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, that hee must of necessitie <hi>Maritimas Reginae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones pertransire, pass through the Sea-Dominions of the Queen,</hi> which are the very <note n="l" place="margin">

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64062:205"/>
safely to bring, with all that shall bee found in them, into</hi> England. <hi>And therefore wee command you, that yee bee attending upon them in this business, so that yee bee in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>with all your Ships and Merchandises at such Port and Coast as they shall appoint you. And if any shall attempt to resist them contrarie to our command, you, our Liege-men, are required to assist them with all your strength, as you tender your selvs and your chattels, and peace and residence in our Land for you or any of your Generation. Witness here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto William <hi>Briwr</hi> at <hi>Lutegar,</hi> the eight daie of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie.</hi> These <hi>Sturemanni</hi> here do signifie Sea-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and <hi>Marinelli</hi> Sea-souldiers. But to command that all ships should bee <hi>arrested</hi> throughout the Sea, that is, staid or taken, and brought into <hi>England,</hi> what els was it but undoubtedly to declare himself Lord of the Sea through which they passed? Now let no man object, that this Commission extended onely to the Ships of <hi>English</hi> men, or of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of him that gave the Commission. It is true indeed, that the Commission before cited, was sent and directed onely to the Sea-Captains, Men of Warr, and Merchants of <hi>England:</hi> But yet it is manifest thereby, that the four persons there named, and others Barons of the Cinque-Ports, and the rest that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were obliged by the aforesaid Commands <hi>to arrest all the ships that they should finde throughout the Sea, and bring them safely into</hi> England, <hi>with all that should bee found in them.</hi> But this part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was added (as it plainly appear's) that no English Sea-Captain, or Souldier, or Merchant what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soëver, might bee wanting in their assistance, in staying the ships of Foreiners; <hi>If anie one shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to resist them contrarie to our command, you, our Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

are required to assist them with all your, &amp;c.</hi> Our <hi>Liege-men</hi> in this place, or they that ought to give assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in making stay of ships, are all the Sea-men and Merchants of <hi>England</hi> that sail up and down throughout this Sea: They therefore whose ships were to bee staid, did not com under the name of <hi>Liege-men,</hi> or Subjects; and that it so appear's to bee by the very Form of this Commission, that there need's not any thing more bee added touching this matter, I suppose no man will doubt, who take's it into his more serious consideration. Nor do the words make mention of the ships of Enemies, but of any whatsoëver; as beeing deliver'd by a Soveraign Prince, who was concerned at that time, for his own occasion, and at discretion, to use not onely his own Sea-Territorie, but also the ships sailing therein, as well as those that were in Port.</p>
                        <p>Wee finde a Commission of the like nature, and which speak's to the same purpose, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, wherein Command is given to make stay of all ships of ten Tuns and upward, that should bee found in the South and Western Sea (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept som that were newly designed to cross over into <hi>Bretaign</hi>) that they might bee arm'd and set forth in the King's service.

you, to arrest and seiz all ships, Flie-Boats, Barks, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ten Tuns burthen and upward, which may happen to bee found in the aforesaid Admiraltie,</hi> (that is, in the Sea reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth toward the South and West) <hi>and to caus the Flie-Boats, Barks and Barges afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bee well and sufficiently arm'd and provided for the warr, by the Masters and owners of the same, and to bring them speedily so provided and arm'd to</hi> Sandwich, <hi>except one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ships that are order'd for the passage of our beloved and trustie Thomas de <hi>Dagworth</hi> and his men that are bound for Bretaign; so that you bee readie there in your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, together with the Ships, Flie-Boats, Barks, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges aforesaid, so well provided and fitted for the warr, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saturday next before the Feast of the Apostles</hi> Simon <hi>and</hi> Jude, <hi>next ensuing at the farthest, to go thence upon our Command, according to such direction as shall then on our part bee given, to the Masters and Mariners of the aforesaid Ships, Flie-Boats, Barks, and Barges, and to take sufficient Provision for the enabling of you to do the premises, in such places as you shall see most convenient (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely Church-Land) you making due paiment for the same; and also to seiz and arrest all those that you shall finde to oppose or resist you in the execution of the premises, and them to commit into our Prisons, there to abide till wee shall think fit to take farther order, &amp;c.</hi> All Officers also in the said Admiraltie are commanded to yield obedience and assistance upon the same occasion. The usual subscription in that Age shewing the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Autoritie of the Commission was, <hi>By the King himself and his Council.</hi> But that the aforesaid Sea it self was conterned under the name of the Admiraltie, is clearly manifest by what wee have alreadie shewn you. And King <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64062:207"/>

                           <hi>for one whole year onely</hi> (somtimes for six Months) <hi>&amp;c. to go and fish throughout the Sea at all times and as often, &amp;c.</hi> But this leav was granted under the name even of a Passport or safe conduct; yea, and a size or proportion was prescribed to their Fishing-boats or <hi>Busses;</hi> that they should not bee above <abbr>XXX</abbr> Tuns. And it is true indeed, there was a kinde of consideration or condition added, that som others, who were subjects of the King of <hi>England,</hi> might in Fishing enjoy the same securitie with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners: Which was for this caus onely put into the Licence, that if the Foreiners did disturb or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64062:208"/>
them, they should lose the benefit of their Licence. The words of that consideration or condition, in the beginning of those Licences, run after this manner; <hi>To the end that the business of the Herring-fishing and of other Fish, may bee advanced, continued, and mainteined for the publick good; yea and that the like securitie may bee yielded and afforded to som certain Fisher-men under our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> I suppose that those certain Fisher men under our Obedience were also the <hi>French,</hi> who at that time continued in subjection to the <hi>English;</hi> whereas almost all in <hi>France,</hi> except the Shore of <hi>Picardie,</hi> had newly revolted from the King of <hi>England:</hi> That is to say, at the latter end of the reign of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Sixt. But that which wee finde either here touching equal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, or in other places somtimes also, about the giving of safe conduct even to the Fishermen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Licence granted, either to <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Flemings,</hi> or <hi>Bretaigns;</hi> that usually hapned when the heat of War was over &amp; a Cessation agreed on to treat of Peace or Amitie. In the mean time, securitie of that kinde was given on both sides now and then by agreement: But by the King of <hi>England</hi> as well in respect of his beeing Lord of the place, as his beeing a partie that was treating about a League or Amitie. By others upon this account onely, not upon that; unless you understand the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee about the use of Ports and Shores: For so, no man denie's but these were Lords as well as hee. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over also, in our time, leav was wont to bee asked of our Admiral, for <hi>French</hi>-men to fish for <hi>Soles</hi> in the neighboring Sea, for King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> his own Table; as it is affirm'd by such as have been Judges of our Admiraltie and Commanders at Sea of an antient standing; yea, and that the Ships of those <hi>French</hi> were seized, as trespassers upon the Sea,

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64062:209"/>
by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> there are many Testimonies in <note n="e" place="margin">Gerard. Malinius in Lege Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoriâ, cap. 35.</note> other Writers. But the caus why wee do not often meet with the Forms of those <hi>Licences,</hi> granted either for passage or fishing in the <hi>English</hi> Sea, was plainly this; becaus by the Leagues that were made with the neighbor Princes, a Licence or freedom of that kinde (as also of Ports, Shores, Passage, and other things) was so often allowed by both Parties, that, as long as the League was in force, the Sea served, as if it were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Field, as well for the Foreiner that was in amitie, as for the King of <hi>England</hi> himself who was Lord and Owner. But yet in this kinde of Leagues, somtimes the Fishing was restrained to certain Limits, which is a thing chiefly to bee consider'd. The limits related both to place and time: So that according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Foreiner in amitie might not fish beyond these Limits; the K. of <hi>England</hi> reteining a Dominion over the whole adjoining Sea. Touching this, there is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Example in the time of our <hi>Henrie</hi> the Fourth. An agreement was made betwixt the Kings of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rot. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae,</hi> 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Septemb.</hi>

                           <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that the Subjects of both might freely use Fishing throughout that part of the Sea, which is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this side by the Ports of <hi>Scarborough &amp; Southampton,</hi> and on the other side by the Coast of <hi>Flanders</hi> and the mouth of the River <hi>Seine.</hi> The time also was limited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Autumn</hi> &amp; the <hi>Kalends of Januarie</hi> following. And that the <hi>French</hi> might securely enjoy the benefit of this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our King directed Letters to that end, unto all his Sea-Captains and Commanders. Here you see plainly, those Limits wholly excluded the <hi>French</hi> from that part of the Sea which lie's toward the West and South-west<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also from that which lie's North east of them, as beeing so limited by our <hi>Henrie,</hi> at his own pleasure, as its Lord and Soveraign. Nor was there so much
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64062:209"/>
as the least shadow of right or Prerogative, whereby the <hi>French</hi> King might seem to have any interest as a Lord or Owner in the setting of these Limits; seeing that part of the Sea which was secluded did not touch upon any Shore of his in the North, nor had hee any Countrie lying before the Sea in the South (except <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi>) or in the West; the rest beeing held either by the Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> or by the King of <hi>England,</hi> as wee have alreadie observed. From hence truly it was a Custom, for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to give protection to Fisher-men that were Strangers, somtimes by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and somtimes with a Fleet of men of War, when they went to Fish either by agreement made upon treatie, or by leav obteined, qualifications beeing added according to the <hi>English</hi> King's pleasure.

both parties, with safe passage, yea, and declared hee would give equal protection to both in such manner, that within these limits neither might the <hi>Spaniards</hi> use any hostilitie against the <hi>United Netherlanders,</hi> nor these against them, nor the Subjects of any Nation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever against those of another, without incurring his displeasure. The words of the Proclamation are these; <hi>Our pleasure is, that within our Ports, Havens, Roads, Creeks, or other places of our Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or so near to any of our said Ports and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as may bee reasonably construed to bee within that title, limit or precinct, there shall bee no force, violence, or offence suffer'd to bee don, either from man of war to man of war, or man of war to Merchant, or Merchant to Merchant of either partie. But that all of what Nation soever, so long as they shall bee within those our Ports and places of our Jurisdiction, or where our Officers may prohibit violence shall bee understood to bee under our protection, to bee ordered by cours of Justice, and bee at peace each with other.</hi> But by the same Proclamation hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that violence should so onely bee permitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Enemies in that limited part of the Sea, that if any man of war should either bee hovering near hand with an intent to offer violence to his enemie, in the open Sea adjoining, or the Creeks, Ports, and Havens of the same, or should out of any place so prohibited, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the intent of the Proclamation, fall upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ship, setting forth to Sea from the same place, then the English men of war, as well those belonging to Merchants as Commanders in the King's service, should remove and punish such kinde of violence. The words of the Proclamation are these; <hi>Our
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64062:212"/>
pleasure therefore and commandement is to all our Officers and Subjects by sea and land, that they shal prohibit (as much as in them lieth) all such hovering of men of war of either side so near the entrie of any of our Havens, or our Coasts. And that they shall rescue and succor all Merchants and others that shall fall within the danger of any such as shall await our Coasts in so near places, to the hinderance of Trade and Traffick outward and homeward, from and to our Kingdoms.</hi> The <hi>Prescribed limits</hi> afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were set forth in a Table or Map cut in Brass, and published by the King's Command. The manner of it was such, that both the limited part of the Sea, and those Ports and Creeks were pointed out by direct lines draw from one point of land or adjacent Island, to the next Point or Island upon the <hi>English</hi> shore. These points with the Isles fetching a compass round about from the North-Coast of <hi>England,</hi> by the East and South as far as the West, beeing in number <hi>twentie seven,</hi> are ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thus in their order. <hi>Holy Island, the Sowter, whitby, Flamborough head, the Sporn Cromer, winterton-nesse, Easter-nesse, Layestof Estnesse, Orfortnesse, the Northforeland, the Southfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Dungenesse, Beach, Dunenoze, Portland, the Start, the Ramme, the Dudman, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, Lands end, Mildford, S.

But in that Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well the distance of all the Points in respect of each other, as the manner of sailing in a direct cours is explained, from whence the latitude of every one of the <hi>King's Chambers,</hi> may in part bee collected. Those twelv men beginning at the <hi>Holy Iland,</hi> fetch't a compass round from the North by the East and South to the West, in the order hereafter following. The first cours and distance is from that Island to <hi>The Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And from thence the rest are reckoned in the like manner.</p>

So, the spaces within the streight lines drawn from one point to another, are the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Ports of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who beeing Lord in like manner of all those parts of the Sea, as farre as the opposite Shores or Ports, whilst hee commanded a keeping of the peace within these Creeks or Closets, did, as <hi>Arbiter,</hi> permit those that were in amitie with him; but enemies among themselvs, to make prize of one another, in the rest of the Sea; yet not without som qualifications or restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons added concerning the use of the more open part of the Sea. And truly, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alleged afterward, that themselvs ought to bee protected from hostilitie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, without these limits, in the more open part of the Sea; and that by virtue of the agreement of peace, whereby the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were obliged to protect one another's subjects, in all parts of their Kingdoms: which is as much as to say, that the rest of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64062:218"/>
the Sea flowing between com's no less under the name of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> And this appear's also from the dispute held by their Advocate in <hi>England, about the protection of the Territorie by Sea,</hi> against the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who <hi>mightily exclaimed</hi> (as <note n="c" place="margin">Albericus Gentilis in Advocat.

That it was an unjust violence; that beeing disturbed and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ought to have reparation made them, and to bee beard against those Spaniards, who beeing prisoners were discharged with the goods that were taken.</hi> But that the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might justly give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> protection against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Sea, either within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out those limits, hee plead's after this manner. <hi>You see</hi> (saith hee) <hi>how f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Item, the Commons do pray, that (seeing our Soveraign Lord the King and his illustrious Progenitors, have ever been Lords of the Sea, and now that through Gods gtace it is so com to pass, that our said Lord the King is Lord of the Shores on both sides of the Sea) such a tribute may bee imposed upon all Strangers passing through the said Sea, for the benefit and advantage of our said
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:64062:223"/>
Lord the King, as may seem agreeable to reason for the safeguard of the said Sea.</hi> The Answer subscribed to this Bill was, <hi>Soit avise par le Roy,</hi> that is, <hi>let the King himself bee advised of it.</hi> For, the King resided in <hi>France</hi> at that time, beeing Lord of that Countrie by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Conquest, and <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was President of the Parlament, beeing then Keeper or Lieutenant of <hi>England,</hi> by whom, as the King's Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, this kinde of Answer was usually given to Bills, as often as an assent to them was delaied; but when the King was present in person, <hi>le Roy s' advisera, the K. will advise,</hi> served in stead of an Answer from antient down to the present time, in such Bills as were not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into Acts. That is to say, in those Bills to which the Lords and Commons had given their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before, that is, the Estates of the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> which is here especially to bee considered. For, most certain it is, that, according to Custom, no Answer is given either by the King or in the King's name, to any Parlamentarie Bills, before that the Bill, whether it bee brought in first by the Lords or by the Commons, hath passed both Houses, as it is known to all that are verst in the Affairs and Records of Parlament. And when the name of either of them is left out in the draught of the Bill, (as the Lords are in that before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged) it was wont to bee supplied, as it is also at this day, by the brief form of Assent, which is added by that Hous, to whom the Bill is sent and transmitted. For, that Hous which first prefer's it, transmit's it to the other, who either give's an assent, or reject's it. And when both Houses have so given their assent, then after a while, either the King give's his assent (whereby it becom's an Act or Law) or els hee laie's it aside, and (as I have alreadie shewn) take's time to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64062:224"/>
advise; Neither of which is ever don by the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cours of Parlament, till both Lords and Commons have first given their assent. But the whole form of the afore-mentioned Bill, which is full of all kinde of storie concerning things transacted in Parlament, is taken out of the very Schedules annexed to the Bill, (wherein the Forms of this kinde of assent were wont expressly to bee added) and register'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to antient Custom, among the Records of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, in the very same words wherein it was at first exhibited; no express mention beeing made of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent both of Lords and Commons which is annexed to the Body of the Form (for, the assent of both suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appear's, in that according to the cours of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament it was so presented to the King) and the Kings assent onely or intent of deliberation beeing added by way of subscription, as I have shewn. But most of those Schedules annexed to that kinde of Bills which relate to the more antient times are lost; whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Records wherein they were wont to bee register'd, have been carefully preserved in the <hi>Tower</hi> for above <abbr>CCC</abbr> years. All which wee thought meet to mention here, to the end that in the Bill before alleged out of the Parlamentarie Records of <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift, these three things may bee observed, which make very much to the point in hand. <hi>First,</hi> that the Estates in Parlament, according to the Custom of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, that is to say, both Houses of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, beeing well-informed of the matter perhaps by som antient Testimonies whereof wee are bereft by the injurie of time, did with one consent affirm it as a thing unquestionable, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is Lord of the Sea: As it appear's also in that former Record which relate's to the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third;
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:64062:224"/>
for, both the Bills are placed alike in the aforesaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Sea whereof they speak is the whole that flow's between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> For, they say in express terms, that King <hi>Henry,</hi> beeing Lord of the Sea, was at that time Lord <hi>des costes d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it is very improbable, and not in reason to bee admitted, that they would so upon deliberation (for both Lords and Commons use to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate such matters a long time before they pass a Bill) that they would, I say, so upon deliberation require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of Customs by the Act of an <hi>English</hi> Parlament, in a place that was not subject, as a part of the Roial patrimonie, to the King of <hi>England,</hi> as King of <hi>England.</hi> From hence it was also, that our present King <hi>Charls</hi> did this last year declare, <hi>that himself and his progenitors the Kings of</hi> England <hi>have in all times hitherto, by an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and most just title, been Lords of this Sea;</hi> to wit, in his <note n="d" place="margin">

Authors of our Law who wrote above <abbr>CCCL</abbr>. years ago or thereabout, after they had (as the manner then was) read through the <hi>Civil Law</hi> also, they were so strict in following those determinations word for word, which they found concerning the Sea in that Law, that when they treated <hi>de acquirendo Rerum Dominio <hi>of the manner of acquiring the Dominion of things,</hi>
                           </hi> they tranferr'd them into their own writings. From thence it is, that <hi>Henry Bracton,</hi> who was a very famous Lawyer at the later end of the reign of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Third, saith, <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>THE last head in the afore-mentioned Division is concerning som Testimonies of a lesser account. There hath been a piece of Gold very often coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Kings, called a <hi>Rose-noble,</hi> which was stampt upon one side of it with a ship floting in the Sea, and a King armed with a Sword and Shield, sitting in the ship it self, as in a Throne, to set forth a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Dominion of the English by Sea. The first Autor hereof was <hi>Edward</hi> the third; when

hee guarded his own Sea with a very numerous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, consisting of <note n="a" place="margin">

But the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>English</hi> Coin had an inscription upon the revers (which is not unusual in the gold Coins of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie) taken out of the Gospel, viz. <hi>Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat,</hi> which <note n="d" place="margin">Apud Guil.

                        <head>That the Sea-Dominion of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is acknowledged by <hi>Foreiners, whom it most concern's,</hi> by their <hi>usual striking of Sails,</hi> according to antient Custom. Also concerning two Edicts or Ordinances that were set forth about this Thing, by the Kings of <hi>France. CHAP. XXVI.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WEe are com now to Foreiners. And it is clearly evident, by what wee have discoursed before, either touching the limits set for Navigation by the King of <hi>England,</hi> or the Licence of passage through this Sea often desired by Petition, that som of them have indeed acknowledged this Dominion. But there are two Testimonies more notable than the rest, which shew (if you consider chiefly, as you ought, their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Neighbors, and such whom it concerned) that they generally did the same. The one is the usual striking of the Top-sails, by every Ship of any Forein Nation whatsoêver, if they sail near the King's Navie or any Ship belonging to the same Navie in the Sea. The other is a <hi>Libel</hi> published of old, or a <hi>Bill of complaint</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, wherein very many forein Nations heretofore, in the time our <hi>Edward</hi> the First, did all together, and by common consent with the <hi>English,</hi> acknowledg the Dominion of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by Sea. Whereto I shall add also a particular declaration of that kinde, made by the <hi>Flemings,</hi> in an Ambassie to our <hi>Edward</hi> the Second.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="399" facs="tcp:64062:234"/>But that the striking of Sails is don, not onely in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>English</hi> King, but also in acknowledgment of his Soveraigntie and Dominion in this Sea, is, I suppose, a thing out of question. Certainly, the <hi>French</hi> cannot doubt of it, who, by such a kinde of striking, would have had themselvs heretofore acknowledged Lords of our Sea; but in vain. That is to say, they were as much over-seen in the former Age, in setting forth two Edicts or Ordinances, to require and ratifie such a kinde of striking Sail to themselvs by all Foreiners, as they were in so rashly vindicating the Sea-Dominion of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Concerning those Edicts wee spake before in the <note n="a" place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> former Book; Neither of which was received as valid in any Court of Justice, according to a decision made in the <note n="b" place="margin">

Yea, and here I shall set down the very words used by <hi>Ludovicus Servinus</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate general to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to magnifie the Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of those Edicts or Ordinances, at the time of that Decision. The one of them beeing set forth by King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Second of <hi>France,</hi> or in the year <abbr>MDLV</abbr>; the other by <hi>Henrie</hi> the Third, or in the year <abbr>MDLXXXIV</abbr>, they were both objected by those, who required a striking of Sail to them in the name of the <hi>French</hi> King, even without the bounds of <hi>France</hi> (for, the words of the Edicts did not relate onely to the Sea confining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>France;</hi>) upon which ground also they offer'd vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to certain <hi>Hamburgers</hi> who refused to do this, and seized them as guiltie of contempt against the dignitie and Dominion of the <hi>French</hi> by Sea. But as to this thing, saith <hi>Servinus,</hi> it may bee said on the contrarie, <hi>That the</hi> (Edicts or) <hi>Ordinances of the Realm making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to strike and com aboard, have not been observed and are not to this day; And it doth not appear that of the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:64062:235"/>
year</hi> 1555. <hi>hath been verified in the Court of Parlament, but the Defendants do report onely an extract out of the Register of</hi> Broüage (which indeed is evident enough when that <hi>Edict</hi> is objected by the <note n="d" place="margin">Servinus, placit. citat. pag. 254.</note> same man.) <hi>Moreover,</hi> it was an old obsolete Law, <hi>and that which prove's it, is the new Ordinance of the year</hi> 1584. <hi>For, there had been no need of a new Law if the old one had been kept; And notwithstanding that the last hath not been verified simply, but as it was promoted by persons in Power at that time, it did not pass without resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but was Registred and Published with the Qualification required by the Procurator General, at the charge of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, according to the antient Forms, and such as the Officers of the Admiraltie had made in former time, without doing any thing anew.</hi> The former <hi>Edict,</hi> which was objected, was never admitted by the Estates of the Realm; for, nothing of that matter is to bee found in the Records of Parlament, which is the proper place for a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of its admission. But the later was indeed admitted, though as to any effect of a Law, either at that time to bee enacted or introduced, or as received before into Custom, it was plainly rejected, and that at the instance of the King's Procurator; who desired it might bee so qualified, as you see, that what was grounded upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Custom, it onely might bee ratified, even after this Edict was so admitted in favor of som great Ones. Which was discreetly don; seeing both the Edicts were extremely contrarie to the Custom of their Neighbors, yea, and of all Foreiners. But as to the business of striking sail, which they would have to bee a special Sign or Pledg of their Soveraigntie and Dominion in those Edicts, which notwithstanding, upon second thoughts, were rejected afterwards in Law (as hath been shewn;) truly, it having been usually and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually acknowledged due for so many Ages to the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:64062:235"/>
                           <hi>English,</hi> and performed accordingly both by stranger, and by the <hi>French</hi> themselvs (as a matter grounded upon long prescription) can bee no slight argument among the <hi>French,</hi> to confirm that Dominion of the <hi>English,</hi> whereof wee treat.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it is affirmed by all that are used to the Sea as a thing out of Question, that this intervenient Law or Custom of striking sail hath been very usual to the <hi>English</hi> and other Nations; And that it is very antient and received for above four hundred years, appear's by this, that at <hi>Hastings,</hi> a Town situate upon the Shore of <hi>Sussex,</hi> it was decreed by King <hi>John,</hi> (in the second year of his Reign, or of our Lord <abbr>MCC</abbr>) with the assent of the Peers; that if the Governor or Commander of the King's Navie in his Naval Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (which were all in that Age upon the Southern Sea) shall <hi>encontre sur la mer</hi> (so the words run in the <note n="c" place="margin">

                        <p>Now what was don by the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known: It seem's it was a matter of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was thought more convenient to make an end by agreement, than bring the matter to a trial.

                           <hi>AEmilius,</hi> speaking of this very time, saith; <hi>The French King threatned ruine to</hi> Flanders. <hi>The King of</hi> England <hi>protected the</hi> Flemings. <hi>For,</hi> Edward <hi>was so far onely a friend of the King of</hi> France, <hi>that yet hee would not have the</hi> Flemings <hi>ruined.</hi> Thus our King order's the matter, both as a Defender of his own Right, and supreme Moderator also of Navigation in respect of others. Nor truly is it to bee omitted, that <hi>Grimbald</hi> himself here, beeing Governor of the French Navie, did not onely arrogate this power in this Sea from the Autoritie granted him by his King's Commission, but in express terms also made use of that <hi>Prohibition</hi> of the King of <hi>England,</hi> which was in force according to the Third Article of the said League, thereby to defend himself; as if hee had also acknowledged, that himself could not have lawfully held that office of. Admiraltie in this Sea, without such a Permission as hee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself to enjoy, by virtue of that <hi>Prohibition.</hi> For, by that <hi>Prohibition,</hi> it was required that no relief should bee given to the French King's Enemies, nor any aid afforded them within the Dominion of the King of <hi>England,</hi> (that is, <hi>per my son poere,</hi> which were the very words of <hi>Grimbald,</hi> as you may see in the <hi>Libel</hi> it self set down hereafter.) And so <hi>Grimbald</hi> expressly objected the Autoritie of that <hi>Prohibition,</hi> together with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Master's Commission in defence of himself: As if hee had said, I use this power, it beeing given mee by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who put mee in Command over his Navie, and Affairs belonging to the Sea: But besides this, the King of <hi>England</hi> having set forth his <hi>Prohibition,</hi> commanded that no kinde of relief should
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:64062:241"/>
bee given to any Enemie of the French, within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, according to the League made between both the Kings. And therefore, seeing I have not taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Persons or Goods of any but such as are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or at least such as according to the <hi>Intervenient Law</hi> of Nations, are to bee reckoned upon an hostile Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (for, doubtless hee pretended, that they were to bee taken as Enemies of what Nation soêver they were, who relieved the <hi>Flemings</hi> by Merchandise or otherwise) I conceiv it a sufficient ground of defence in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that the King of <hi>England,</hi> according to the League made, did by publick Proclamation require, that no succor or relief should bee given to the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> in any part of his Dominion. Upon which account, not to these, whom I took at Sea. The summe of all in brief is this; That <hi>Grimbald</hi> did not so much as imagine, that his office of Admiraltie or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given him by Commission depended upon any Dominion of the King of <hi>France</hi> by Sea, but altogether upon the Autoritie of his Kings Commission, the League, and the King of <hi>England's</hi> Prohibition: As if the English King had openly declared by that <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Prohibition,</hi> that hee would not take it for any injurie to himself, during that kinde of League and Prohibition, although the <hi>French</hi> should fall upon any of their Enemies in his Dominion, or though they, which is all one here, should bee taken in his Sea, by the French King's Officers. Certainly, unless you so understand <hi>Grimbald,</hi> I do not see wherefore he should at all join that <hi>Prohibition</hi> together with the King his Master's Commission, in defence of himself, as it is expressed in the <hi>Libel,</hi> or why mention was made there of the Dominion of the King of <hi>England,</hi> throughout which that <hi>Prohibition</hi> was proclaimed, seeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:64062:241"/>
arose touching things don onely by Sea. But if hee bee so to bee understood, certainly then hee did not onely forbear to oppose the antient right of the King of <hi>England</hi> by Sea, but also sufficiently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it, while hee seem's to affirm that a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie restriction onely was added thereto, by an accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>League</hi> and the <hi>Prohibition:</hi> So that wee have a tacit acknowledgment even of the French themselvs at that time, in this their <hi>Admiral.</hi> But how the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal points of the League ought to bee expounded, it is no place here to discours; for; wee observ onely that the Sea. Dominion of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, in that <hi>Libel,</hi> by so many Nations.</p>
                        <p>Moreover truly, it is worthie observation; that about the very same time, to wit, a little before the making of the League, the King of <hi>England</hi> did homage to the French King for the Dutchie of <note n="f" place="margin">

                           <hi>Paris;</hi> yea, and that about one hundred years before, King <hi>John</hi> was outed of <hi>Normandie;</hi> and yet afterward that the King of <hi>England</hi> now and then regained a possession of it, and that before the time of the League, and of the publication of this <hi>Libel;</hi> which serv all to this end, that wee may observ, that when the aforesaid famous controversie arose about the use and Soveraigntie of the Sea flowing between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> and the absolute Dominion thereof was asscribed by so many Nations, upon a Title derived time out of minde, to the King of <hi>England</hi> and his Predecessors, yet in the mean time no title at all was pretended in right to their possession either of <hi>Normandie,</hi> or <hi>Aquitain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Dominion of any part of the Sea might in any
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:64062:242"/>
sort bee grounded, but claimed upon the sole right of the English Empire. And it appear's evident by the thing it self, that the things complained of by those Nations in the <hi>Libel,</hi> were don by that Governor of the French Navie, chiefly in the Sea near the shores of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which were in hostilitie with each other: And so certainly they all unanimously affirm, that the whole Sea, whereof they speak, is under the Dominion of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that upon the sole Account and right of the English Empire. And as for <hi>Grimbald,</hi> hee did not defend himself, either by a pretence of any Dominion of the King of <hi>France,</hi> or by disproving of that Prescription; whereupon the English Title depend's, as a thing not declared according to Truth or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Right; nor did hee at all pretend, that the Right which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had in the Sea borde ring upon <hi>France,</hi> did belong to them either upon the account of <hi>Normandie,</hi> or any other French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince whatsoêver, as Fiduciarie Clients or Vassals of the King of <hi>France,</hi> though it had been convenient and very seasonable for him to have alleged all these Particulars, if the Truth had been so indeed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also that is not a little confirmed, whereof wee discoursed before, about taking the names of the shore over against us, in the later Commissions of the Office of high Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> for limits onely of the Sea-Dominion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Province thereof under their protection. Moreover also, about seven years before the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the aforesaid <hi>Libel</hi> to the Commissioners, when as the King of <hi>France,</hi> by reason of divers heinous injuries don to his Subjects by the English in this Sea, required that the King of <hi>England</hi> (as
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:64062:242"/>
hee was the Fiduciarie Client or Vassal, becaus of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and other Provinces that hee held under him in <hi>France</hi>) should bee questioned not onely for wrong don, but also for his right to those Lands which hee held, and bee summoned to appear in the Parlament of <hi>Paris;</hi> the matter beeing set down at large in the Letter of Summons, hee inserted nothing therein whereby hee might seem to arrogate any Sea-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion at all to himself, or diminish that which belong'd to the King of <hi>England;</hi> as you may see in <note n="h" place="margin">Anno 1293.</note> I <hi>lorilegus,</hi> who hath set down an entire Copie of them in his Annals. The same Autor also, speaking of the same Time, saith, <note n="i" place="margin">Anno 1294.</note> 
                           <hi>At that time, there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord, nor Law over the Sea men; but what every man was able to catch, or snatch, hee called his own;</hi> which plainly denote's an extraordinarie Licence or of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predation, and infesting the Sea; yet so to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that in the mean time the incomparable power of the English in Shipping, which guarded their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by Sea according to the Custom of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, was chiefly signified thereby, the King very freely permitting his Subjects to use depredations by Sea, as long as the war continued. For, <hi>Florilegus</hi> himself relate's, that great numbers both of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were then taken at Sea by the <hi>English.</hi> Yea, and about <note n="k" place="margin">Anno 1297</note> that time, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Walsingham</hi> write's, that either a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> Navie of two hundred Sail, which roved about this Sea to rob the English, were overcom by a Fleet of sixtie English Ships, and brought into <hi>England.</hi> There is also another <hi>antient Autor</hi> of the same time, when these affairs were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who saith, <note n="l" place="margin">Ms.</note> 
                           <hi>That in the Month of May,</hi> 
                           <abbr>MCCXCIV</abbr>. <hi>there fell out a Quarrel between the Sea-men of the Cinque-Ports of</hi> England, <hi>and the Sea-men of</hi> France, <hi>and it was
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:64062:243"/>
determined by a fight at Sea, wherein the</hi> English <hi>with a Fleet of one hundred Sail, took two hundred Ships of</hi> France, <hi>and drowned or killed almost all the Sea-men of</hi> France, <hi>for which caus,</hi> Philip <hi>King of</hi> France, <hi>endeavored to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Gascoign from the King of</hi> England. Others there are likewise, that have other expressions touching these things, whereby it is easie to collect what is meant by that of <hi>Florilegus,</hi> when hee saith, <hi>that there was neither Lord, nor Law, over Sea-men, at that time;</hi> that is to say, the King of <hi>England</hi> had let the reins loos to his Subjects, as Moderator of this Sea, and this hee did, that they might not onely restrain his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but them also that should reliev his enemies in any manner whatsoêver, or that should use the Sea otherwise than at his pleasure, who was Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But as concerning the like acknowledgment, made singly and apart by the <hi>Flemings,</hi> of the Dominion of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> over the Sea, I shall Treat by and by; after that I have in the next place set before you the <hi>Libel</hi> it self in its own, that is, the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue, as it stand's recorded in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

                        <p>IN the Archives of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where Records of above four hundred years are kept, there is a bundle of Parchments, which contein som affairs relating to the times of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Third, and of <hi>Edward</hi> the First and Third. The first contein's an agreement made between <hi>Edward</hi> the First and <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> touching their Ships bearing of Colors about this Sea, to the end that they might bee the more easily known. Then there are annexed three ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Originals or Copies of the said <hi>Libel</hi> written at the same time. For (as it seem's) the several Procurators of those Nations, that were parties in the Complaint, had their several <hi>Libels,</hi> though expressed in the name of all together. So that one is endorsed thus, <hi>De Baiona,</hi> as if that <hi>Libel</hi> had been exhibited singly by the men of <hi>Bayonne;</hi> but the title run's thus, <hi>De Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritate Maris Angliae, &amp; Jure Officii Admirallatûs in eodem,</hi> that is, <hi>Of the Superioritie</hi> (or Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) <hi>of the Sea of</hi> England <hi>and the right of the Office of Admiraltie in the same,</hi> as it is also in the said agreement between the King and the Earl of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Also, in one of the <hi>Libels,</hi> to those words is added <hi>retinendis &amp; confirmandis;</hi> All beeing very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written in the usual Character of that Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the matter relate's. And there can bee no scruple touching the realitie and truth of them to any one that

                        <p>I have alreadie spoken in general, of the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>British</hi> Sea, which is a part of the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> but chiefly as it lie's either East or South.

It is evident to all, that part of the Western Sea, lying before <hi>England,</hi> is understood as well in that <hi>Libel</hi> which was exhibited by so many Nations to the Commissioners deputed by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> above three hundred and thirtie years ago, wherein wee so often read <hi>le mer d' Angleterre</hi> or <hi>the sea of England,</hi> as in the King's Commission-before mentioned, wherein our Kings are expressly-declared Lords of the <hi>English Sea</hi> on every side; and therefore I shall forbear to repeat what is <note n="a" place="margin">CAP. 24.</note> cited out of <hi>Bracton,</hi> about the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyning</hi> or excusing of a man absent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other things of that kinde alleged before, which make to this purpose. Moreover also, wee read every where, that all the Isles in this neighboring Sea were called <hi>British</hi> (as wee observed at the beginning of this Book) just as if the narrow Seas flowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, like Rivers or turnings of Rivers, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join those Banks or Shores from great <hi>Britain,</hi> as

                           <hi>Fragments</hi> of the same. Whereby it appear's, that the narrow Seas themselvs with the Isles, even as Rivers with their Banks, are to bee reckoned a part of the <hi>British</hi> Territorie. And hereunto especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late's also that expression in the <hi>Libel</hi> so often cited; to wit, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ever been Lords both of the <hi>English</hi> Sea (or of the <hi>British,</hi> so far as it stretcheth before <hi>England</hi>) and also of the Isles situate therein, <hi>par raison du Royalme d' Angleterre, <hi>by right of the Realm of England.</hi>
                           </hi> So that the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> which (as <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> saith) stand's in this Sea, in the very midst betwixt the Northern Parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> was (if I understand any thing) reckoned of old among the Land-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>England,</hi> even as the Isle of <hi>Wight, Lundie,</hi> and others of that kinde. Nor doth it seem to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood otherwise by those men of antient time, who, upon occasion of a dispute, whether this Isle ought by right to bee taken for an appendant of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> beeing placed in the midst of the Sea flowing between, determined the controversie on this manner. They brought venemous serpents; and observing that the Isle did entertain and cherish them, as well as <hi>England</hi> and the rest of <hi>great Britain,</hi> but on the contrarie that <hi>Ireland</hi> destroied them, <hi>it was concluded</hi> (saith <note n="b" place="margin">Topograph.

For, by an Argument drawn from the nature of the very soil one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without a civil consideration of Dominion (though they would have here the very nature of the soil to bee the evidence thereof, as a Lot for decision) it ought no more to bee ascribed either to <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> than to <hi>Norway, Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> where every man know's that venemous Creatures are bred as well as in <hi>Britain.</hi> Therefore, to bee ascribed to <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Britain</hi> in that

                           </hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross. Moreover in the Deucaledonian Sea toward the North-East, there are the Isles of</hi> Orcades, <hi>seated next to the Coast of</hi> Scotland, <hi>whereof onely twentie eight are at this daie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; and above an hundred miles beyond the</hi> Orcades <hi>towards</hi> Norway, <hi>are the</hi> Shetland <hi>Isles in number eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, which are at this daie inhabited, and in subjection to the King of</hi> Scotland; <hi>concerning which, there was a great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in former Ages between the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Danes, <hi>yet the</hi> Dane <hi>kept possession. All these Islands did</hi> Christiern <hi>King of</hi> Denmark <hi>peaceably surrender, together with his daughter in marriage to</hi> James <hi>King of</hi> Scots, <hi>until that either hee himself or his posteritie paid to the</hi> Scotish <hi>King or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, in lieu of her Dowrie, the summe of fiftie thousand Rhenish Florens, which were never discharged to this daie. For, so much I my self have seen and read in the Deeds of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age betwixt Ladie</hi> Margarite <hi>daughter of the King of</hi> Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark

                           <hi>and</hi> James <hi>the third King of</hi> Scotland, <hi>drawn up and fairly signed with the Seals of both Kingdoms</hi> Anno Dom. 1468. <hi>&amp;c. But afterwards, when Ladie</hi> Margarite <hi>beeing Queen had been delivered of ber eldest son</hi> James <hi>Prince of</hi> Scotland, <hi>the</hi> Danish <hi>King willing to congratulate his daughter's good deliverie, did for ever surrender his right in the Islands of the Deucaledonian Sea, to wit, the Isles of</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, Shecland, <hi>and others, which hee deliver'd in pledg with his daughter, upon her marriage to the</hi> Scotish <hi>King. I hear the deeds of this surrender are kept among the Records be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Crown of</hi> Scotland. And so at length those Isles, and the Dominion of this Sea, returned to the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they enjoy at this day. The Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> have a pledg of Dominion also in this Sea, that is to say, Tributes or Customs imposed upon Fisher-men, for Fishing; of which by the way you may read in their <note n="k" place="margin">Parlam. 6.

Moreover, <hi>Nicolas Craig,</hi> who was sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Christiern</hi> the fourth in the year <abbr>MDXCIX</abbr>. pretended the agreement at <hi>Haderslabe,</hi> in the year <abbr>MDLXXXIII</abbr>. between <hi>Frederick</hi> the second and Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> as if it had therein been express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided, that this servitude in the Sea of <hi>Island,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the English, might bee limited by a denial of Licence at the pleasure of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> But it was answer'd both by the Lords at home in <hi>England,</hi> as also by the Queen's Commissioners sent to <hi>Bremen</hi> for the transacting of this business, that this right or Sea-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude is so confirmed to the English, as well by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of time, as by perpetual agreements of Leagues, that that particular which occurr's in the agreements of King <hi>John</hi> the second, and <hi>Henrie</hi> the seventh about asking of Licence, doth in no wise relate to this effect; that whether it were denied or not requested by Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that right or servitude could bee diminished, but to this end onely, that the English, by a customarie Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning every seven years, might acknowledg the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegian</hi> right in this Sea. There was neither manner, nor condition, nor time annexed to the servitude, but it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:64062:261"/>
took place there onely to this end, that the memorie meerly of the benefit of the League or of the Original of the servitude established, might bee renewed now and then by Petition. Yea, <hi>Frederick</hi> the second in his letters to Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> dated the fourth of <hi>Maie,</hi> 
                           <abbr>MDLXXXV</abbr>, most expressly disclaim's this Claus of the League, which concern's Petitioning for Licence. And truly the whole right of the English in that Sea, was not first claimed by them upon the account of that League at <hi>Koppenhagen,</hi> whatever they of <hi>Norway</hi> may pretend to the contrarie. For, when the Ambassadors sent heretofore by <hi>Erricus</hi> the tenth to our <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift, made complaint about English men's fishing in this Sea, the King of <hi>England</hi> (I suppose) intimate's plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, that hee had som right before in that Sea, while at that time hee granted this onely in favor of the King of <hi>Norwaie,</hi> that the English should no otherwise use Fishing there for the year immediately ensuing, <hi>than as it had been usual in antient time,</hi> and this hee commanded by publick Proclamation made in the more eminent Ports and Cities.

Which the most excellent Prince your Father, acknowledging, desired by his Letters, that that controversie might bee referr'd to another

disquisition. But since that time, no such disquisition hath been made. Nevertheless wee understand that our subjects fishing have been taken, tormented, and handled in a hostile manner. Whether this bee justly don, all men will bee able to judg who shall weigh our Reasons with an impartial minde. Wee do not deny, but that the Lord Chancellor <hi>Whitfeld</hi> and</hi> de <hi>Barnico, <hi>when</hi>

                           <hi>they came unto Us, did in words pretend that the fishing of</hi> Island <hi>and</hi> Norway <hi>was used by the</hi> English, <hi>contrarie to the Leagues and Agreements of the Kingdoms. But seeing they neither did nor could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any proof, and wee have authentick evidences attested by the Kings</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Christiern <hi>to the contrarie, whereto more credit ought to bee given than to bare Allegations, the matter was put off to another time. It was answer'd also to</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Craig, <hi>that the Transaction which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with King</hi> Frederick <hi>at</hi> Haderslabe <hi>in the year of our Lord</hi> MDLXXXIII <hi>belong's nothing at all to this Business,</hi> for the reason before mentioned. And a little after the Letters speak thus. <hi>But that which is pretended from the Treatie with King</hi> John, (the aforesaid Treatie at <hi>Koppenhagen) that licens for fishing ought to bee renewed by petition from seven years to seven years (as a thing which for very many was not omitted) Wee answer, that the fault of its omission proceeded not from the</hi> English, <hi>but from the</hi> Danes. <hi>For, that seven years Licens was petitioned for till the time that King</hi> Christiern <hi>was expelled, about the year of our Lord</hi> 
                           <abbr>MDXX</abbr>. <hi>But afterward it ceased to bee renewed, becaus of the uncertaintie to whom the succession of the Kingdom did lawfully belong. And since the time of the said expulsion of King</hi> Christiern, <hi>neither King</hi> Frederick <hi>your great Grandfather, nor</hi> Christiern <hi>your Grandfather, nor</hi> Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick <hi>your Highnesse's Father, ever urged any such petition for Licens. But concieving former Treaties sufficient, which
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:64062:263"/>
were made between the Kings and Kingdoms, they would not innovate any thing after a prescription of verie manie years, seeing they were otherwise sufficiently secure that the same thing would never bee attempted, which was the first occasion of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining such a Licens. And to this end, the Letters of King</hi> Frederick <hi>your Highnesse's Father written to Us, and bearing date the fourth of</hi> May, <hi>Anno</hi> 
                           <abbr>MDLXXXV</abbr> 
                           <hi>were shewn to Doctor</hi> Craig, <hi>purporting that if the</hi> English <hi>absteined from doing injuries, they should enjoy the wonted libertie and favor, without any mention or requiring of a Petition for Licens; whereas nevertheless Wee offer'd you, that our Merchants should hereafter petition you from seven years to seven years, according to the antient and long continued Custom, which offer Wee understand your Highness would not admit.</hi> For, the most excellent Queen would not otherwise acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Jurisdiction and Empire of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> in this Sea, than that the whole servitude or right of fishing afore-mentioned, there established (as afore-said) might (as a considerable part of the antient Patrimonie) bee reteined to her and her Successors.

                  <p>Notwithstanding this Proclamation, the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> proceeded still in their way of encroachment upon our Seas and Coasts, through the whole Reign of that King, and were at length so bold as to contest with him, and endeavor to baffle him out of his Rights, pretending, becaus of the long connivence of himself and Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> that they had a Right of their own by <hi>immemorial possession;</hi> which som Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of theirs that were sent over hither, had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to plead <hi>in Terminis,</hi> to the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. And though the King, out of his tenderness to them insisted still upon his own Right, by his Council
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:64062:269"/>
to those Commissioners, and by his Ambassador to their Superiors, yet they made no other use of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, than to tire out his whole Reign, and abuse his Patience by their artificial delaies, pretenses, shifts, dilatorie addresses, and evasive Answers. And all that the King gained by the tedious disputes, overtures, and dispatches to and again, was in conclusion onely a verbal acknowledgment of those Rights; which at the same times that they acknowledged, they usually designed to invade with much more insolence than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But you have the main of what passed in those daies in this particular, with their insolent demeanor, lively described in these following Collections, taken out of several Dispatches that passed betwixt Secretarie <hi>Naunton,</hi> and <hi>Dudley Carlton</hi> Lord Ambassador from the King, to the States of the <hi>United Provinces.</hi>

                           </head>
                           <p>I Must now let your Lordship know, that the State's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners and Deputies both having attended his Majestie at <hi>New-Market,</hi> and there presented their Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, returned to <hi>London</hi> on Saturday was a sevennight, and upon Tuesday had Audience in the Council-Chamber, where beeing required to communicate the points of their Commission, they deliver'd their meditated Answer at length. The Lords upon perusal of it, appointed my Lord <hi>Bining</hi> and mee to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Majestie for directions, what Reply to return to this Answer of theirs; which I represented to their Lordships yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to this effect; That his Majestie found it strange, that
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:64062:269"/>
they having been so often required by your Lordship his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Ambassador, as from himself, in their publick Assembly, to send over Commissioners fully autorised to treat and conclude, not onely of all differences grown between the Subjects of both States, touching the Trade to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Whale-Fishing,</hi> and to regulate and settle a joint and an even Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in those Quarters, but withall to take order for a more indifferent cours of determining other Questions growing between our Merchauts and them about their Draperies and the Tare; And more especially to determine his Majesties <hi>Right for the sole Fishing upon all the Coasts of his Three Kingdoms,</hi> into which they had of late times incroached farther than of Right they could; And lastly, for the reglement and reducing of their Coins to such a proportion and correspondence with those of his Majestie's and other States, that their Subjects might make no Advantage to transport our Monies by inhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their valuation there. All which they confessed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship had instanced them for in his Majestie's name, that after all this attent on his Majestie's part, and so long deliberation on theirs, they were com at last with a Proposition to speak onely to the two first points, and instructed thereunto with bare Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Creance onely, which his Majestie take's for an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fashion of proceeding in them, as if they were com hither to Treat of what themselvs pleased, and to give Law to his Majestie in his own Kingdom, and to propose and admit of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what should tend meerly to their own ends.</p>
                           <p>To the second; Whereas they would decline all debate of the Fishings upon his Majestie's Coasts, first by allegations of their late great losses and an <hi>Esmeute</hi> of their people, who are all interessed in that Question, and would bee like to break out into Jom combustion to the hazard of their State which hath lately scaped <hi>Naufrage,</hi> and is not yet altogether calmed; What is this but to rais an advantage to themselvs out of their disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? But afterwards they profess their lothness to call
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:64062:270"/>
it into doubt or question, claiming an immemorial possession secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Law of Nations; To which his Majestie will have them told, that the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have sought leav to Fish there by Treatie from this Crown; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> (a nearer Neighbor to our Coasts than they) to this day request's leav for a few Vessels to Fish for Provision of his own houshold; And that it appear's so much the more strange to his Majestie, that they beeing a State of so late date, should bee the first that would presume to question his Majestie's antient Right so many hundred years inviolably possessed by his Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, and acknowledged by all other antient States and Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That themselvs in their publick Letters of the last of <hi>June,</hi> sent by your Lordship, seemed then to confirm their immemorial possession (as they tearm it) with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Treaties, as are of the year 1550; and another between his Majestie's Predecessors and <hi>Charls</hi> the fift, as Prince of those Provinces, and not by the Law of Nations. To which their last Plea, his Majestie would have them told, that hee beeing an Islander-Prince, is not ignorant of the Laws and Rights of his own Kingdoms, nor doth exspect to bee taught the Laws of Nations by them, nor their <hi>Grotius,</hi> whose ill thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving might rather teach others to disavow his Positions; And his honestie called in question by themselvs, might render his Learning as much suspected to them, as his person. This his Majestie take's for an high point of his Soveraigntie, and will not have it slighted over in any fashion whatsoëver.</p>
                           <p>Thus I have particulated unto you the manner of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with them. Let them advise to seek leav from his Majestie, and to achnowledg him his Right, as other Princes have don, and do; or it may well com to pass, that they that will needs bear all the world before them, by their <hi>Mare Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum,</hi> may soon com to have neither <hi>Terram &amp; Solum,</hi> nor <hi>Rempublican liberam.</hi>

                           <p>WHether the final resolution here will bee according to his Majestie's desire, in that point concerning the Fishing upon the Coasts of his three Kingdoms, I cannot say; And by somwhat which fell from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by way of Discours when hee took leav of mee on <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> last, at his departure, I suspect it will not, in regard the Magistrates of these Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> beeing new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed, and yet scarce fast in their seats, who do autorise the Deputies which com hither to the Assembly of the States in all things they are to Treat and resolv, will not adventure, for fear of the people, to determine of a Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, on which the livelihood of fiftie thousand of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this one single Province doth depend.

that I presumed of his permission to suffer them to continue their cours of Fishing; which they might use thereby with more Freedom, and less apprehension of molestation, and let than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and likewise spare the Cost of som of their Men of War, which they yearly send out to maintein that by force, which they may have of courtesie.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> answer'd, that for himself at his return from <hi>Utrecht,</hi> hee would do his best endeavor to procure his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie contentment, but hee doubted the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the same effect in their paiment for Fishing, as they found in the passage of the <hi>Sound,</hi> where at first an easie matter was demanded by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but now more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted than they can possibly bear: And touching their Men of War hee said, they must still bee at the same charge with them, becaus of the Pirats. Withal, hee cast out a question to mee, whether this freedom of Fishing might not bee redeemed with a Summe of monie? To which I answered, it was a matter of Roialtie more than of Utilitie, though Princes were not to neglect their profit.</p>

                  <p>This Proclamation beeing set forth in the year 1636. served to speak the intent of those naval preparations made before in the year 1635. which were so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and well-provided, that our <hi>Netherland</hi>-Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors

beeing touched with the apprehension of som great design in hand for the Interest of <hi>England</hi> by Sea, and of the guilt that lay upon their own Consciences, for their bold Encroachments, soon betrayed their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and Fears, and in them a sens of their offences, before ever the Proclamation was made publick: As I might shew at large (if it were requisite) by certain Papers of a publick Character yet in beeing. But there is one, <hi>Instar omnium,</hi> which may serv in stead of all; and it is an acute Letter of Secretarie <hi>Coke's,</hi> that was written to Sir <hi>William Boswel,</hi> the King's Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the Original whereof is still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served among the publick Papers: In which Letter, hee set's forth the Grounds and Reasons of preparing that gallant Navie, with the King's resolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Right derived from his Ancestors, in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Seas; and therefore I here render a true Copie of it, so far as concern's this business, as most pertinent to our purpose.

                           </opener>
                           <p>BY your Letters and otherwise, I perceiv many jealousies and discourses are raised upon the preparations of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's Fleet, which is now in such forwardness, that wee doubt not but within this Month it will appear at Sea. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expedient both for your satisfaction, and direction, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you particularly what was the occasion, and what is his Majestie's intention in this work.</p>
                           <p>First, wee hold it a principle not to bee denied, That the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> is a Monarch at Land and Sea to the full extent of his Dominions, and that it concerneth him as much to maintain his Soveraigntie in all the British Seas, as within his three Kingdoms: becaus without that these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee kept safe; nor hee preserv his honor and due respect
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:64062:274"/>
with other Nations. But commanding the Seas, hee may caus his Neighbors and all Countries to stand upon their guard whensoever hee think's fit. And this cannot bee doubted that whosoëver will encroach upon him by Sea, will do it by Land al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, when they see their time. To such presumption <hi>Mare li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum</hi> gave the first warning piece, which must bee answered with a defence of <hi>Mare Clausum:</hi> not so much by Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as by the lowder Language of a powerful Navie, to bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood, when overstrained patience seeth no hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving her Right by other means.</p>
                           <p>The Degrees by which his Majestie's Dominion at Sea hath of later years been first impeached and then questioned, are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as notorious.</p>
                           <p>First, to cherish, and as it were to nurs up our unthankful neighbors, Wee gave them leav to gather wealth and strength upon our Coasts, in our Ports, by our Trade and by our People. Then they were glad to invite our Merchant's Residence with what privileges they would desire. Then they offered to us even the Soveraigntie of their Estates, and then they sued for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to fish upon the Coasts, and obtained it under the Great Seal of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which now they suppress. And when thus by leav or by connivence, they had possessed themselvs of our Fishings, not onely in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and by our staple had raised a great stock of Trade; by these means they so encreased their shipping and power at Sea, that now they endure not to bee kept at any distance: Nay, they are grown to that confidence to keep guards upon our Seas; and then to project an Office and Companie of Assurance for the advancement of Trade; and withal, prohibit us free commerce even within our Seas, and take our ships and goods, if wee conform not to their <hi>Placarts.</hi> What insolencies and cruelties they have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us heretofore, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>nland,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> is too well known to all the world. In all which, though our sufferings and their wrong may seem forgotten, yet the great
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:64062:275"/>
interest of his Majestie's honor, is still the same, and will refresh their Memories as there shall bee caus. For, though charitie must remit wrongs don to private men, yet the reflection upon the publick may make it a greater charitie to do Justice on crying crimes. All this notwithstanding, you are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv that the work of this Fleet, is either revenge or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice for these great offences past, but chiefly for the future to stop the violent current of that presumption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Men of War and Free-booters of all Nations (abusing the favor of his Majestie's peaceable and gratious Government, whereby hee hath permitted all his Friends and Allies, to make use of his Seas and Ports in a reasonable and free manner, and according to his Treaties) have taken upon them the boldness, not onely to com confidently at all times into all his Ports and Rivers, but to conveie their Merchant's ships as high as his chief Citie, and then to cast Anchor close upon his Magazins, and to contemn the commands of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, when they required a farther distance. But which is more intolerable, have assaulted and taken one another within his Majestie's Chamber, and within his Rivers, to the scorn and contempt of his Dominion and Power; and this beeing of late years an ordinarie practice which wee have endeavored in vain to reform by the waies of Justice and Treaties, the world I think will now bee satisfied, that wee have reason to look about us. And no wise man will doubt that it is high time to put our selvs in this Equipage upon the Seas, and not to suffer that Stage of action to bee taken from us for want of our appearance.</p>
                           <p>So you see the general ground upon which our Counsels stand. In particular, you may take notice, and publish as caus require's, That his Majestie by this Fleet intendeth not a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with any Prince or State, nor to infringe any point of his Treaties; but resolveth to continue and maintein that happie peace wherewith God hath blessed his Kingdom; and to which
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:64062:275"/>
all his Actions and Negotiations have hitherto tended, as by your own Instructions you may fully understand. But withal considering, that Peace must bee mainteined by the arm of power, which onely keep's down War by keeping up Dominion, his Majestie thus provoked, finde's it necessarie even for his own defence and safetie to re-assume and keep his antient and undoubted Right in the Dominion of these Seas, and to suffer no other Prince or State to encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, thereby assuming to themselvs or their Admirals, any Soveraign command: but to force them to perform due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his Admirals and Ships, and to pay them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, as in former times they did. Hee will also set open and protect the free Trade both of his Subjects and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And give them such safe Conduct and Convoie, as they shall reasonably require. Hee will suffer no other Fleets or Men of VVar to keep any guard upon these Seas, or there to offer violence or take prizes or booties, or to give inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to any lawful intercours. In a word, his Majestie is resolved, as to do no wrong, so to do Justice both to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Friends, within the limits of his Seas. And this is the real and Roial design of this Fleet, whereof you may give part as you finde occasion to our good neighbors in those parts, that no Umbrage may bee taken of any hostile act or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to their prejudice in any kinde. So wishing you all health and happiness, I rest</p>

                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:64062:276"/>In this Letter you see first, how it was held for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable principle, that the King was King by Sea as well as by Land; That neither the honor nor safetie of this Island and <hi>Ireland</hi> could bee maintained, but by preserving the Dominion by Sea; and that it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that they that encroach upon us by Sea, will do it also by Land when they see their time. Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare's also, how our unthankful neighbors are risen to this hight and insolence, partly by grant, partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, but principally through their many injurious abuses of our Patience and Indulgence. And lastly, you may observ here what resolutions were then taken to prevent the lil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e injuries, and preserv our <hi>English</hi> Interest in time to com. But how those Resolutions were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the succeeding part of his Reign, I shall not stand to examine; onely it sufficeth here to take notice, that the Claim of Sea-Dominion was made by him, as well as by his Father, and for a time strenuously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted; though afterward hee slackned his hand in the prosecution; whereof the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and of our late commotions (which were their <hi>Halcyon</hi>-daies, and time of Harvest) are now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to such a monstrous pitch of pride, malice, and ingratitude, that they dare bid defiance to those antient Rights which wee have received from all Antiquitie, and justifie their actions by a most unjust and bloudie war, in the view of all the world. What remain's then, but that the Parlament and People of <hi>England</hi> should lay these things to heart, with an indignation answerable to so prodigious violations and invasions? They have now an opportunitie and strength given them by God (O let not hearts bee wanting!) to make good the Claim, and accomplish that work of establishing our Interests by Sea, beyond the possibilitie
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:64062:276"/>
of future impeachments. Let it not bee said, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the state of <hi>Monarchie,</hi> was able to hold the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie of the Seas so many hundred years, and then lost it in the state of <hi>Libertie.</hi> It is, as now established with its Appendants, the greatest and most glorious Republick, that the Sun ever saw, except the <hi>Roman.</hi> God hath made it so by Land, and will by Sea; for, without this, the Land is nothing. It was ever so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Kings, yea by the last and worst of our Kings: And shall the Founders of this famous stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Government now in beeing, who have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered Kings, and vindicated the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Nation upon his head and his whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie and partie, not assert them against perfidious Neighbors? It were unpardonable in any to harbor a thought of that nature, or to yield that such a blemish should bee brought upon all those glorious actions and atchievements, whereby God hath freed and innobled our Land and Nation.</p>
                  <p>But that the people of <hi>England</hi> may bee excited to a valuation, maintenance, and improvement of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest by Sea, it is necessarie to let them understand what advantages are to bee made thereby, and are made by others, who of <hi>Usufructuaries</hi> by permission, have in design now to make themselvs absolute Lords of the Fee. And therefore it is very convenient here to set down an excellent Discours which was written in the time of the late King, and presented by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Title.

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:64062:278"/>
have 100 Doyer Boats, of 150 Tuns a piece, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, 700 Pinks and Well-Boats from 60 to 100 Tuns a piece, which altogether fish upon the Coasts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> for Cod, and Ling onely.

                                    <p>For the Herring-season, they have 1600 Busses at the least, all of them Fishing onely upon our Coasts from <hi>Boughonness</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the mouth of <hi>Thames.</hi> And every one of these maketh work for three other ships that attend her; the one to bring in salt from Forein parts, another to carrie the said salt, and cask to the Busses, and to bring back their Herrings, and the third to transport the said Fish into Forein Countries. So that the total number of ships and Busses plying the Herring-Fair, is 6400; whereby every Buss, one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, imployeth fortie men, Mariners and Fishers within her own hold, and the rest ten men a piece, which amounteth to 112000 Fishers and Mariners.

                                    <p>Moreover, they have 400 other Vessels at least, that take Herring at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and there sell them for readie monie: so that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (besides 300 ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned fishing upon their own shores) have at least 4800 ships onely maintained by the Seas of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> by which means principally <hi>Holland</hi> beeing not so big as one of our shires of <hi>England,</hi> containing not above 28 miles in length, and three in breadth, have encreased the number of their shipping to at least <hi>ten thousand sail,</hi> beeing more then are in <hi>England, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Denmark, Poland, Sweden,</hi> and

                                    <p>During the wars between the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> before the last Truce, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, spoiling, and burning the Busses of <hi>Holland,</hi> and setting great ransom upon their Fisher-men, enforced them to compound for great summes that they might Fish quietly for one year, whereupon the next year after the Fisher-men agreed amongst themselvs to pay a doller upon every last of Herrings, towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of certain Ships of War to waft and secure them in their Fishing, by reason whereof there was a Record kept of the several lasts of Herrings taken that year, and it appeared thereby that in one half year there were taken thirtie thousand lasts of Herrings which at twelv pound <hi>per</hi> last, amounteth to 3600000, and at sixteen, twentie, thirtie pound the last, they are ordinarily sold, then transported into other Countries, it cometh at least to 5000000 <hi>l.</hi> Whereunto if wee add the Herrings taken by other Nations together with the God, Ling, Hake, and the Fish taken by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and other our neighbors upon the

British Coasts all the year long, the total will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arise to bee above 10000000 l.</p>
                                    <p>The great Trade of Fishing imploying so many men and ships at Sea, must likewise necessarily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as great a number of Tradesmen, and Artizens on Land, as Spinners, and Hemp-winders to Cables, Cordage, Yarn-twine for Nets and Lines, Weavers to make Sail-Cloaths, Cecive Packers, Tollers, Dressers, and Cowchers to sort and make the Herring lawful merchandise. Tanners to tan their Sails and Nets; Coopers to make Cask, Block, and Bowl-makers for ships, Keel-men, and Laborers for carrying and removing their Fish, Sawyers for Planks, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Ship-wrights, Smiths, Car-men, Boat-men, Brewers, Bakers, and a number of others, whereof many are maimed persons, and unfit to bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise imploied.

                                    <p>The premisses considered, it maketh much to the ignominie and shame of our English Nation, that God and Nature offering us so great a treasure even at our own doors, wee do notwithstanding neglect the benefit thereof, and, by paying monie to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the Fish of our own Seas, impoverish our selvs to make them rich. Insomuch that for want of industrie and care in this particular two hundred twentie five Fisher-Towns are decaied and reduced to extreme povertie; whereas on the contrarie by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent endevoring to make use of so great a blessing, wee might in short time repair these decaied Towns of the Kingdom, and add both honor, strength, and riches to our King and Countrie, which how easily it may bee don, will appear by som few observations following.</p>
                                    <p>By erecting two hundred and fiftie Busses of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable strength and bigness, there will bee emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for a thousand Ships, and for at least ten thousand Fisher-men and Mariners at Sea, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently for as many Tradesmen and Laborers at land.</p>
                                    <p>The Herrings taken by the Busses will afford his Majestie two hundred thousand pound yearly custom outward, and for commodities returned inward thirtie thousand pound and above.</p>
                                    <p>Wee have Timber sufficient, and at reasonable rates, growing in our own Kingdom for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:64062:282"/>
of Busses, every Shire affordeth hardie and able men fit for such emploiment who now live poorly and idle at home.</p>
                                    <p>Wee have victuals in great plentie sold at easie rates without paiment of Excises, or Impost.</p>
                                    <p>Our shores and harbors are near the places where the Fish do haunt.</p>
                                    <p>For drink, or nets, salting and packing our Fish; and for succor in stress of weather, wee may bring our Fish to land, salt and pack it, and from som part of his Majestie's Dominions bee at our Markets in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> before the <hi>Hollanders</hi> can arrive in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Wee have means to transport our Fish into som Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries, where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver com. And though wee had as many Busses as the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> yet is there vent for all, or more, for in the East and Northern Countries, and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, Herrings are every daies meat, Winter and Summer, as well to draw on drink, as to satisfie hunger, and in most places the greatest part of the year they bee scarce to bee had; for presently after <hi>Michaël<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Sound and Rivers are frozen up so as no Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings can bee transported into twentie several King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and free States until <hi>July,</hi> which is for thirtie weeks space together, so that when Lent com's, there are few to bee bought for monie.</p>
                                    <p>Lastly, since by care and industry wee gained from the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> doubtless so by the means wee may as easily grow expert in the Art of Fishing, and in time make it a staple commoditie of our own.</p>
                                    <p>But this wee shall the better and sooner do, if wee

consider and endeavor to reform certain wants and abuses which hitherto have hindred us from effecting that good and great work, whereof these that follow are none of the least.</p>

General libertie of eating flesh contrarie to old custom, and the Statute-Laws provided for observing Fish-daies, from whence our scarcitie and dearth of Fish proceedeth; for where Flesh is ordinarily spent, Fish will not bee bought, and want of sale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caieth all Trade, gain beeing the Nurs of Industrie.</item>
                                       <item>2. Want of order and discretion in our Fishing, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man beeing left to himself and permitted to Fish as best liketh him: whereas amongst the <hi>Hollanders</hi> two of the best experienced Fisher-men are appointed to guide the rest of the Fleet, all others beeing bound to follow them, and to cast their lines according to their direction.</item>
                                       <item>3. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> and other Nations set forth with their Busses in <hi>June,</hi> to finde the shole of Fish, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found it, dwell amongst it till <hi>November,</hi> whereas wee stay till the Herring com home to our rode-steads, and somtimes suffer them to pass by ere wee look out, our Herring-Fishing conteining onely seven weeks at the most, and theirs twentie.</item>
                                       <item>4. The <hi>Hollander's</hi> Busses are great and strong, and able to brook foul weather, whereas our Cobles, Cray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Boats beeing small, and thin sided, are easily swallowed by a rough Sea, not daring to adventure far in fair weather by reason of their weakness for fear of storms.</item>

The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are industrious, and no sooner are discharged of their lading, but presently put forth for more, and seek for Markets abroad as well as at home; whereas our <hi>English</hi> after they have been once at Sea, do commonly never return again until all the monie taken for their fish bee spent, and they in debt seeking onely to serv the next Market.</item>

The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have certain Merchants, who, during the Herring-season do onely com to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Busses arrive, and joining together in several companies, do presently agree for the lading of thirtie or fortie Busses at once, and so beeing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, they may speedily return to their former shipping; whereas our Fisher-men are uncertain of their Chap-men, and forced to spend much time in putting off their Fish by parcels.</item>
                                    </list>
                                    <p>These and other defects would carefully bee taken into consideration, and certain orders made to make our Fishing prosperous, and successful, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the fearful mischiefs the neglect hereof hath brought to the King and Kingdom in general, and to many good Towns and Corporations in particular, as by autoritie even of Parlament it self in the Statute of 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> the eight, is plainly testified, which I have summarily here set down, to avoid the prolixitie of the original.</p>
                                    <p>Becaus the English Fisher-men dwelling on the Sea-Coasts did leav off their Trade of Fishing in our Seas, and went the half-Seas over, and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Seas did buie Fish of <hi>Pickards, Flemmings, Normans,</hi> and <hi>Zelanders,</hi> by reason whereof many
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:64062:284"/>
incommodities did grow to the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> the decaie of the wealth and prosperitie as well of the Cinque-Ports, and Members of the same, as of other Coast-Towns by the Sea-side, which were builded, and inhabited by great multitudes of people by reason of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and exercising the craft and feat of Fishing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the decaie of a great number of Boats and Ships. And thirdly, the decaie of many good Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, both able in bodie by their diligence, labor, and continual exercise of Fishing, and expert by reason thereof in the knowledg of the Sea-Coasts, as well within this Realm as in other parts beyond the Seas. It was therefore enacted, that no manner of persons English, Denizens, or strangers at that time, or any time after dwelling in <hi>England,</hi> should buie anie Fish of any strangers in the said Ports of <hi>Flanders, Zealand, Picardie, France,</hi> or upon the Sea between shore and shore, &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p>This act by many continuances was continued from Parlament to Parlament, until the first of Queen <hi>Marie,</hi> and from thence to the end of the next Parlament, and then expired.</p>
                                    <p>For conclusion, seeing, by that which hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been declared, it evidently appeareth, that the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> by immemorable prescription, continual u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and possession, the acknowledgment of all our Neighbor-States, and the Municipal Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have ever held the Soveraign Lordship of the Seas of <hi>England,</hi> and that unto his Majestie, by reason of his Soveraigntie, the supreme command and Jurisdiction over the passage, and Fishing in the same rightfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth;
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:64062:284"/>
considering also the natural site of those our Seas that interpose themselvs between the great Northern Commerce of that of the whole world, and that of the East, West, and Southern Climates, and withal the infinite commodities that by Fishing in the same is daily made; It cannot bee doubted, but his Majestie, by means of his own excellent wisdom and virtue, and by the industrie of his faithful subjects and people, may easily, without injustice to any Prince or person whatsoever, bee made the greatest Monarch for Command and Wealth, and his people the most opulent and flourishing Nation of any other in the world. And this the rather, for that his Majestie is now absolute Commander of the British Isle, and hath also enlarged his Dominions over a great part of the Western <hi>Indies;</hi> by means of which extent of Empire, (crossing in a manner the whole Ocean) the Trade and persons of all Nations (removing from one part of the world to the other) must of necessitie first, or last, com within compass of his power and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                                    <p>And therefore the Soveraigntie of our Seas, beeing the most precious Jewel of his Majestie's Crown, and (next under God) the principal means of our Wealth and Safetie, all true English hearts and hands are bound by all possible means and diligence to preserv and maintain the same, even with the uttermost hazzard of their lives, their goods and fortunes.</p>
                                    <p>Thus you see what wondrous advantages may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Felicitie, and Glorie of this Nation, if God give hearts and resolutions to vindicate those rights
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:64062:285"/>
which are now most impiously and injuriously inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And so much for what concern's <hi>England.</hi>

                                    <p>Now that I may reflect a little upon the point of Sea-Dominion in general, to shew how far it hath been asserted, and mainteined by others, who have enjoied a Dominion in other Seas, when they have been concerned in the like Case with <hi>England,</hi> having their Soveraigntie at Sea impeached and questioned by encroaching neighbors; it was thought meet here to annex an ingenious and learned Plea touching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea; which was very succinctly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Italian,</hi> but faithfully rendred in English by an honorable Member of this Common-wealth, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished som time since, under the following Title.</p>

                     </hi> Thought it fitting not to instruct, but rather to remember the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this Sea, over which the <hi>Venetians</hi> challenge So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigntie and Dominion, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly called the <hi>Gulf,</hi> is nothing els but a large Bay or inlet of the Sea, which entering in betwixt two lands, and severing them for many miles countinuance, in the end receiv's a stop or interruption of further passage, by an opposite shore, which join's both the said lands together. It is called the <hi>Gulf of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> from the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> situated upon certain broken Islands near unto the bottom thereof. It is also called the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> from the antient Citie of <hi>Adria,</hi> lying not far
<pb facs="tcp:64062:288"/>
distant from the former. From the entrance thereof unto the bottom, it contein's in length about 600 Italian miles: where it is broadest, it is 160 miles over, in others but 80, in the most 100. The southwest shore of it is bounded by the Provinces of <hi>Puglia,</hi> and <hi>Abruzzo</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Marquisate of <hi>Ancona</hi> and <hi>Romagnia</hi> in the Pope's State, and the Marqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The North part of it, or bottom, hath <hi>Friuli</hi> for it's bounds, the North-East is limited by <hi>Istria, Dalmatia, Albania,</hi> and <hi>Epirus:</hi> whereof <hi>Istria</hi> doth not so entirely belong unto the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but that the Arch-Duke of <hi>Gratz,</hi> of the Austrian family, who at this present is Emperor, doth possess divers Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritim Towns therein.

For the securing hereof from the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pirates, and the pretenses of divers Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Princes, as the Pope, Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the great Turk, who have each of them large territories lying thereupon; also to caus all such ships, as navigate the same, to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there to pay custom and other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Republick maintein's continually in action a great number of ships, gallies and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liots, whereto they also add more, as there may bee occasion, whereof som lie about the bottom of the Gulf in <hi>Istria,</hi> others about the Islands of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> to clear those parts of Pirates, who have much infested those seas: others, and those of most force, have their stations in the Island of <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:64062:289"/>
the Gulf without licence, was assailed by the Venetian General, who sunk divers of their vessels, and compelling the rest to flie unto <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> hee held them there besieged, although the same Citie, and Port whereon it stand's, bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the jurisdiction of the Grand Signor. And notwithstanding that a great and dangerous war was likely to ensue thereupon, betwixt the Grand-Signor and the Republick, becaus the Venetian General, beeing not content to have chased them into their own Ports, did moreover then that, sink their vessels, and landing his men, slew divers of their Mariners who had escaped his furie at Sea: yet after that a very honorable peace was again concluded betwixt them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, amongst other things, it was agreed, that it should bee lawful for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as often as any Turkish vessels did without their licence enter the Gulf, to seiz upon them by force, if they would not otherwise obey. And that it should likewise bee lawful for them so to do, within any Haven, or under any Fort of the Grand-Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's, bordering on any part of the Venetian Gulf. Out of all which, when I considered the real and absolute Sovereigntie, which this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick doth actually enjoy over this sea, which they have ever defended, as well by the sword as
<pb facs="tcp:64062:289"/>
the pen; and withal how that som neighboring Nations of late years, did seem to envie the title of <hi>England</hi> to the narrow seas, affirming in som of their writings, the <hi>Sea to bee free; that it neither ought, nor could bee under the jurisdiction of any;</hi> that <hi>it was a wilde beast which could not bee ruled;</hi> that, <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessio</hi> beeing <hi>Pedis positio,</hi> there <hi>could no possession bee either taken or kept of it;</hi> that <hi>the limits thereof, beeing a fluent element, could not bee scored out,</hi> or <hi>certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</hi> that <hi>it was as free for all mankinde to use, and as common as the aër,</hi> with many other things to that purpose; I chancing som years past to bee at <hi>Venice,</hi> upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the premisses, did labor with a great desire, to know the grounds of that title, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> founded their <hi>Dominion of the Sea;</hi> and after much search, even to the despair of obteining of it, I hapned upon this ensuing argument, conteining a <hi>Plea</hi> or <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Austrians</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> touching the <hi>Dominion of the Adriatick Sea,</hi> not fictitious or devised onely to color the caus, but faithfully transcribed from out the publick Registers of that Citie, which I offer herewith to the Reader in English, and withal these two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:64062:290"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> that hereby it will appear, that the Common-wealth of <hi>England's</hi> challenge to the Dominion of the Sea, is neither a Noveltie or singularitie; especially, when it is besides most apparant that the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> doth not onely pretend to the Sovereigntie of the Sound, but causeth all such Ships as pass through it, to pay what toll hee pleaseth. The great Turk pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit's all Nations, saving his own Vassals, to enter the black Sea, or <hi>Pontus Euxinus;</hi> the like hee doth to the red Sea, whch contein's at the least 1200 miles in length, beginning from the streits of <hi>Babelmandel,</hi> which give's entrance thereinto, and ending at the Town of <hi>Sues,</hi> which is seated at the bottom thereof. The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> opposeth, to the utmost of his power, any, but his own subjects to sail into the East-Indies, affirming those Seas to bee intirely under his dominion, as well by Conquest, as the Pope's donation, insomuch as the smallest vessel, even of the natives of those parts, cannot sail from Port to Port, without the pass-port of the <hi>Vice-Roy of Goa,</hi> or of som other by him deputed thereto, styling himself, amongst others his Titles, to bee King of the Conquest, Navigation, and Commerce, or Traffick of <hi>AEthiopia, Arabia, Persia, India,</hi> &amp;c. which
<pb facs="tcp:64062:290"/>
hath been hitherto so punctually observed, as no <hi>Castilian,</hi> or Spaniard, might at any time, or for any occasion, sail into the East-Indies, though both those Nations were for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther united under one King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the Dominion of these Seas do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely and properly belong to the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> (as hath been so sufficiently cleared and proved to the whole world, by that learned Book entituled <hi>Mare Clausum</hi>) why may not, or ought not the People of <hi>England,</hi> by all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful waies procure, that the Dominion of these Seas that so justly appertein's unto them, may bee secured from any force, violence, or opposition, how great soever, of their most powerful neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; whenas wee see the <hi>Venetians</hi> to bee so jealous in preservation of the title they pretend to their Seas, as rather then to suffer it to bee in the least sort questioned, they do upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions oppose themselvs by force, or otherwise, against the most potent Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> Vale.</p>

truce, until in the year 1529 all differences betwixt them were composed, and a peace concluded in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> which continued all that Age, with the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, together with his brother <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and Archduke of <hi>Austria.</hi> But becaus by the division, made betwixt the said brethren, seven years before, all the <hi>Austrian</hi> lands which confined with the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> were laid by agreement unto the part which belonged unto King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the confines of which as they had conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with the lands of the Republick, were very intricate; and of great difficultie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, unto whether partie they did belong, as well for the publick reasons of the said Princes, as for those of their private subjects; To end all which in quiet, it was agreed that there should bee an arbitrarie Tribunal erected in <hi>Trent,</hi> for the deciding of these doubts, which in the year 1535, pronounced sentence, whereby all the differences (bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then an hundred) were definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded.</p>

                  <p>To this <hi>Chizzola,</hi> Advocate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick made Answer, saying, that it was a clear case indeed, that <hi>Navigation ought to bee free;</hi> but yet those things, whereat they were aggrieved, were no waies repugnant to this freedom; forasmuch as in countries which are most free, those who have the dominion thereof receiv <hi>custom,</hi> and order by which way all Merchandise shall pass; and therefore no bodie should bee grieved, if the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for their own respects, did use so to do in the Adriatick Sea, which is under their dominion; and hee added, that if they intended to dispute of the business in question, hee was to advertise them, that this caus could not by any pretens bee brought into judgment, at that convention, which was onely instituted, for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such things as were formerly senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and for righting of such new wrongs, which succeeded after the sentence; it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing besides a thing most notorious, that the <hi>Republick,</hi> as Lord of the Adriatiok Sea, did exercise that dominion at the present, which from time out of minde, it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64062:294"/>
don, without any interruption, as well in receiving of customs, as in assigning of places for the exaction of it, and that the pretens now alleged was new, and never before used by any predecessor of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, either as King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> or as Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> or the countries thereto adjacent, or of his Majestie then beeing, for many years, until this present time. Hee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the Imperialists to shew, when ever any such thing was before pretended; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not before the peace of <hi>Bolonia;</hi> for then such a difference as this (if there had been any such) had been there determined, or referred over to the Arbitrarie Tribunal, wherein were handled above 120 contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies; but of this not any mention made, neither, from that time to this, was there any such pretension once set a foot. But if this were a new wrong, succeeding after the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Trent,</hi> they should shew what it was, and when it had beginning, becaus hee was prepared to shew unto them, that any thing concerning the same, was of most antient use and continuance, without the least noveltie in the world; and therefore they ought not to bee heard, who came with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64062:294"/>
demands, which could take no original ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the sentence of <hi>Trent,</hi> or from any innovation of wrongs succeeding thereupon.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Rapicio</hi> replied, that hee intended not to lay his principal foundation upon that, which to all is so well known, which is to say, <hi>that the Sea is common and free,</hi> and that by reason thereof, not any might bee prohibited, to sail unto any place, which best pleased him: and if any Doctors should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to say, that the Republick hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Dominion over the Adriatick Sea, with a long possession, notwithstanding they prove it not: and to Doctors who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a thing barely out of fact, without any manner of proof, little belief is to bee given; for which caus, hee would not dwell upon that; but would com to his principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which was, that admitting the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to bee Patron of the Sea, yet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Subjects might navigate freely by the Capitulations, which were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished betwixt the Princes on both sides, and therefore the Petition proposed was pertinent to bee handled by the said Convention; to which (hee beeing so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64062:295"/>
required by the <hi>Venetians</hi>) added this for a foundation, <hi>Quia libera navigatio Maris Adriatici cùm Majestatis suae Caesareae, tum subditorum damno &amp; incommodo, ab Illustris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simi Domini Veneti triremium Praefectis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedita fuerit, contra Capitula Vormatiae, Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae, Andegavi, &amp; Venetiis inita:</hi> Forasmuch as the free navigation of the Adriatick Sea, hath been hindred by the Captains of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Gallies, to the loss and prejudice of his Imperial Majestie, and of his subjects, against the Capitulations of <hi>Worms, Bolonia, Angiers,</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi> And here hee produced a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Capitulation of <hi>Bolonia</hi> which spake as followeth; <hi>Quòd communes subditi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berè, tutè, &amp; securè possint in utriusque statibus &amp; dominiis tam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

whose Countrie or Dominion they do com: and that it bee provided, that no violence or injurie, bee for any caus whatsoëver of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them; and moreover that justice bee speedily administred. Hee also recited the capitulations of the truce of <hi>Angiers</hi> and <hi>Worms,</hi> and of the peace of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is not necessarie here to repeat, beeing of the same tenor. Hee did rest much upon the word <hi>liberè,</hi> considering that <hi>liberè</hi> is joined to the word <hi>Navigare:</hi> by which it ought to bee understood, according to the common construction of Law, <hi>That everie one might navigate freely;</hi> but hee cannot bee said to bee <hi>free,</hi> who is constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go to <hi>Venice.</hi> Hee added moreover, that the word <hi>liberè</hi> could not bee imagined to bee superfluous, but must of necessitie operate somthing; that the two words, <hi>tutè &amp; securè,</hi> could import nothing els, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> but <hi>without impediment,</hi> or <hi>molestation,</hi> or <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Customs;</hi> to this hee added, that there were then 400 complaints of his Majestie's subjects, whose vessels were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there made to pay Custom, for happening onely to arrive in the ports of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> either by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64062:296"/>
fortune or som other occasion. Hee read the sentence of a Rector of <hi>Liesina,</hi> who freed a ship, which touched upon that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland by chance; and hee made a narration, that certain barks with salt were suffered by the Venetian Fleet, to pass upon their Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, without sending them to <hi>Venice.</hi> Hee concluded, that his request extended to these three points. 1. That the <hi>Austrian</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might Navigate whither it pleased them. 2. That arriving in any Port of the Republick, onely <hi>per transitum,</hi> they should not pay any thing. 3. <hi>Lastly,</hi> that coming to Trade in any of them, they should not pay more then the subjects of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. <hi>Chizzola</hi> answered hereto, promising clearly to solv all the objections introduced by the other, so as there should not remain any place of reply, and to shew with true and lively reasons, that what was don by the Ministers of the Republick in the <hi>Gulf,</hi> was don by lawful Autoritie. And reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himself, to speak of the <hi>Dominion of the Sea</hi> afterwards, howsoëver presupposing it in the first place, hee began with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations; and <hi>first</hi> hee said, that the word <hi>liberè,</hi> was not joined, as <hi>Rapicio</hi> said, to any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64062:296"/>
such word as <hi>Navigare,</hi> but to the words <hi>Morari &amp; negotiari tam terrâ, quàm Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> &amp; therefore by <hi>liberè</hi> is to bee understood as the common construction of Law intend's, when one doth either dwell, or do business in the hous, or land of another, that is to say, <hi>observing the Laws, and paying the Rights of the Countrie.</hi> Hee added also, that those Capitulations, betwixt the hous of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the <hi>Republick,</hi> were equally reciprocal, and not made more in favor of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> in the State of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> then of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> in the State of the <hi>Austrians;</hi> neither was there greater libertie granted to the Sea, then to the Land; and that the words were clear enough, which import, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on both sides might stay, trade, and merchandise, in the state of one another, as well by Land as by Sea, and bee well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; insomuch as the subjects of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> were to have no less libertie in the Lands of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> then the <hi>Austrian</hi> subjects in the Sea of <hi>Venice;</hi> And that by virtue of those words, what his Majestie would have in the State of the <hi>Republick,</hi> it is fitting that hee allow to them in his own State; and if his Imperial Majestie within
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64062:297"/>
his own State, upon the Land, will not yield that the subjects of the <hi>Republick</hi> shall go which way they list, but coustrain's them to pass by such places onely, where Custom is to bee paid, hee cannot with justice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that his subjects may pass by or through the Sea of the <hi>Republick</hi> which way they list, but ought to content himself, that they go that way onely, which shall best stand with the commoditie of those who have the Dominion over it; and if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie caus Custom to bee paid, upon <hi>his</hi> Land, why may not the <hi>Venetians</hi> likewise do it, upon <hi>their</hi> Sea? Hee demanded of them, if by the Capitulation they would have it, that the Emperor was restrained, or hindred, from taking of Custom? and if not, why would they have the <hi>Venetians</hi> tied thereunto by a Capitulation, which speak's of both Potentates equally with the same words? Hee shewed by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Narration, that from the Peace of <hi>Venice</hi> 152<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, until that present, the Emperor had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his Customs, to the grievance of the <hi>Venetian</hi>'s subjects, in victuals and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, which passed from the one State unto the other; insomuch as that which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64062:297"/>
formerly paied but one, was now increased in som to 16, and in others to 20. and hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in iron and other commodities, which were wont to pay little or nothing, were now raised to such an excessive Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, as proved much to the damage of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> besides they were forced to pass onely by such places, where they should pay Custom, out of which to pass, it was <hi>Contra banda,</hi> and their goods confiscated. And if his Majestie think's it lawful to do what it pleaseth within his own estate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking of the Capitulations, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that the <hi>Venetians</hi> doing but the same, should, contrarie thereunto, any waies offend. Hee added, that in every Peace established betwixt two Princes, after a war, it is necessarie that their subjects may live and trade together, not to the excluding of Customs, although there bee excluded the violences, hostilities, and other impediments of trade, which were formerly used in time of war, neither is the autoritie of the one, or other Prince, thereby taken away or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by Sea or by Land.</p>
                  <p>At the force and clearness of this discours, the <hi>Austrians</hi> remained as it were in a trance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64062:298"/>
looking one upon another, insomuch that <hi>Chizzola</hi> judging it not to bee necessarie to dwell longer upon this, passed to the proof of the presupposed truth, viz. <hi>That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick had the Dominion of the Sea,</hi> and said; that the proportion was most true, that the <hi>Sea was common and free,</hi> but yet no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that could bee understood, then as it is commonly said, <hi>The high-waies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and free,</hi> by which is meant, that they cannot bee usurped by any private person, for his sole proper service, but remain to the use of everie one: not therefore that they are so free, as that they should not bee under the protection and government of som Prince, and that every one might do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in licentiously, all that which it pleased him, either by right or wrong; forasmuch as such licentiousness or Anarchie is abhorred both of God and nature, as well by Sea as by Land. That the true libertie of the Sea, exclude's it not from the protection and superioritie of such as maintain it in libertie, nor from the subjection to the laws of such, as have command over it, rather necessarily it include's it. That no less the Sea, then the Land, is subject to bee divided
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64062:298"/>
amongst men, and appropriated to Cities and Potentates, which long since was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God from the beginning of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, as a thing most natural, which was well understood by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when hee said, that unto Sea or maritim Cities, the Sea is the Territorie, becaus from thence they take their sustenance and defens; a thing which cannot possibly bee, unless part of it might bee appropriated in the like manner as the Land is, which is divided betwixt Cities and Governments, not by equal parts, nor according to their greatness, but as they have been, or are able to rule, govern, and defend them. <hi>Bern</hi> is not the greatest Citie of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and yet it hath as large a Territorie, as all the rest of the twelv Cantons together. And the Citie of <hi>Norimberg</hi> is very great, and yet the Territories thereof hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the walls. And the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> for many years was known to bee without any possession at all upon the firm Land. Upon the Sea likewise, certein Cities of great force and valor have possessed a large quantitie thereof, others of little force, have been contented with the next
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64062:299"/>
waters; neither are there wanting Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such, who notwithstanding they are Maritim, yet having fertile Lands lying on the back of them, have been contented therewith, without ever attempting to gain any Sea-dominion; Others, who beeing aw'd by their more mightie neighbors, have been constrained to forbear any such attempt; for which two causes, a Citie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it bee Maritim, may happen to remain without any possession of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Hee added that God did instant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, for the maintenance of Justice, to the benefit of mankinde, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to bee executed, as well by Sea as by Land. That S. <hi>Paul</hi> said, That <hi>for this caus there was due to Princes, Customs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions:</hi> that it should bee a great absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie to prais the well governing, regulating, and defens of the Land, and to condemn that of the Sea: that if the Sea in som parts for the ampleness and extreme distance thereof from the Land, was not possible to bee governed and protected, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a disabilitie and defect in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; as also there are deserts so great upon the Land, as it is impossible to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64062:299"/>
protect them; witness the many sandie parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the immens vastities of the new world. And as it is a gift of God, that a Land by the Laws and publick power, bee ruled, protected and governed; so the same happen's to the Sea: that those were deceived by a gross equivocation, who said, that the Land by reason of its stabilitie might bee governed, but not the Sea, for beeing an unconstant element, no more then the aër; forasmuch as if, by the Sea and the Aër, they intend all the parts of those fluent elements, it is a most certein thing, that they cannot bee governed; becaus, whilst a man serv's himself with any one part of them, the other escape's out of his power; but this chanceth also to Rivers, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee reteined. But when it is said to rule over a Sea or River, it is not understood of the Element, but of the site, where they are placed. The water of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea continually run's out of it, neither can it all bee kept in, and yet it is the same Sea, as well as the <hi>Tiber, Po,</hi> or the <hi>Rhine</hi> are the same Rivers now, which they were 1000 years past. And this is that which is subject to the protection of Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64062:300"/>Hee asked the <hi>Austrians</hi> if their pretens were, that the Sea should bee left without protection, so that any one might do therein well or ill, robbing, spoiling, and making of it un-navigable; this would bee so absurd, as hee durst answer for them, <hi>no:</hi> therefore hee concluded, that by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie consequence his Majestie would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that it should bee kept, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and protected by those unto whom it did appertein by divine disposition: which if it were so, hee desired to know, if it seemed to them a just thing that such should do it, with the expence of their own pains, charges, and bloud; or rather that such should contribute towards it, who did equally enjoy the benefit: To this also hee durst answer for them, that they would say the doctrine of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> is too clear in the point (not to allege matter of Law) that <hi>all such who are under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and protection, are thereby bound to pay Customs and Contributions.</hi> And thereupon hee concluded, that if the Republick were that Prince, to whom it did appertein to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and protect the Adriatick Sea, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed necessarily, that whosoëver Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64062:300"/>
it, ought to bee subject to their laws, in the same manner as such are, who travel through a Countrie upon the Land.</p>
                  <p>From thence hee went on to shew, that this Dominion over the Sea, from time out of minde, did belong to the Republick, and thereupon caused to bee read out of an Abstract which hee had taken, the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thirtie Lawyers, who, from the year 1300, until that present time, did speak of the Dominion which the Republick had over the Sea, as of a thing most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of which, even in their times, the minde of man knew not the contrarie: som of them affirming, that the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick had no less Dominion over the Sea, then over the Citie of <hi>Venice;</hi> others say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Adriatick Sea is the Territorie and demeasnes of the said Citie, making mention of the lawful power which the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> had to establish laws over Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to impose Customs upon such as navigate those Seas; and hee added that hee never read any Lawyer, which ever said the contrarie. And turning himself to <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>picio</hi> hee said, that if hee would not believ those Writers which testified that the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64062:301"/>
to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereof they had possession from time out of minde, before the age wherein the Autors lived, although they prove it not, yet hee could not denie to receiv them for testimonies of such things which they saw and knew in their times, and to hold them as witnesses, far above all exception, beeing famous men, and dead so many years ago, as they could not bee any waies interessed in the present diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. And becaus more then 250 years were past, from the time that the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which hee alleged as witnesses hereof did write, to the time of those, which hee last cited in that behalf; by their attestation it was sufficiently proved, that for long time more then so many years, the Republick hath commanded the Sea, and therefore hee could not denie the immoveable possession thereof to the present.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards turning himself to the Judges, hee praied them, that upon the Autorities alleged, they would bee pleased to listen unto a short consideration of his, which hee did not doubt, but would leav in them a full impression of the Truth. And <hi>first</hi> hee desired them to consider, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64062:301"/>
som of the aforesaid cited Autors speak with general words, saying, the Sea of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> neither declaring the qualitie nor quantitie thereof; yet others do specifie it, using the name of the <hi>Gulf;</hi> and others with terms more expressive, saying, the <hi>Adriatick Sea;</hi> which clearly demonstrate's, not onely the site, but also the quantitie of the Sea possessed; and so shewed, that those who speak more expressively, ought to clear the passages of those, who write more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, according to the common precept, that <hi>with clear places the more obscure are to bee illustrated.</hi> Hee considered also, that the divers manner of speaking of the same Doctors, som deriving the Dominion of the Republick over the Sea, from Custom, som from prescription, others from an induced subjection, and others from a privilege, did arise all out of this reason, becaus as they were most assuredly informed of the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and jurisdiction of the said Seas, which they both saw and heard to belong to the Republick from time out of minde; so they writing upon that matter, not at the instance of any one, but of their own proper motions, and by way of Doctrine onely,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64062:302"/>
each one of them judged it most convenient to express the title of that jurisdiction, som with one term, som with another, without coming to use the sole and true proper term, as they would have don, if they had been put to write for the interest of any one; in which cases the Counsellors are alwaies conformable, receiving from the person interested equally the like instructions.</p>
                  <p>Hee added, that, through the varietie of expressing themselvs, the truth of the caus was no waies diminished, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased; as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, speaking of the diversitie which is observed to bee betwixt the holy Evangelists; becaus by the divers manner of expression, used by the said Writers, every one may rest assured, that none of them did write <hi>nè pagato, nè pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gato,</hi> neither paied, nor praied. In which cases they are never wont to varie, from the single form prescribed unto them by the partie interessed; but rather hee that shall well examine it, shall see amongst the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors a wonderful concord in this one point most true, that after the declination of the Constantipolitane Empire, the Adriatick Sea was found to bee for many years
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64062:302"/>
abandoned, (as also many Islands and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that State) in such manner, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unguarded and without the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and government of any Prince, and under the jurisdiction of no bodie, until by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, to receiv their lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thereby, were constrained to maintain it in freedom; and thereupon taking it into their protection, got thereby the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dominion over it, in like manner as by the law of Nature and of Nations, the Land, the Sea, and other things, which are not under the Dominion of any other, com justly unto those who first get the possession of them; by which reason the first Empires were founded, as well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land as at Sea, and daily there are new ones in the same manner formed, when any of them, either through age or vice, becoming weak, wanteth force, and sink's of it self. The which costodie and government of the Sea, so acquired, the Republick hath daily advanced, by the keeping of potent Fleets and greater Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does every day then other, with the expence of a great deal of Treasure, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of a world of bloud, both of their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64062:303"/>
Citizens and Subjects, continuing without interruption, in sight of all the world, the said begun Dominion and custodie, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and removing all such impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as either by Pirates or Potentates, as well of <hi>Italie</hi> as of the opposite shore, at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times have been raised. And for the clearing of such doubts, as might arise by the subtil construction of words, hee added; that although those who took upon them to speak in the strict terms of the Law, were wont to say, that such things onely were gained by Custom, which by the Civil Law, beeing to bee common, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding converted to a private benefit, yet without any impeachment of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profit, as to fish in a River without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Navigation; yet for all that, the Title of Custom cannot bee unproperly given, where there shall bee gained and continually kept in possession and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a quantitie either of Sea or Land abandoned, and of no man possessed, as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholus, Baldus, Castro,</hi> and others do affirm. And although that by title of <hi>Prescription</hi> a thing cannot possible bee said to bee posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, unless, by the occupation of it, another
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64062:303"/>
bee thereof spoiled and dispossessed, which title come's not in this place, forasmuch as the Republick hath not spoiled any of the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Sea, but hath seized upon it, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it abandoned &amp; without Patron or Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor: notwithstanding in som sort, it may bee called <hi>Prescription,</hi> as if a Falcon were let flie and cast off by its master, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon growing wilde, should after bee taken up by another, and by him mann'd, and for a long time fed; although not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet not absurdly it may bee said, that this second master hath it by <hi>Prescription.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to speak in terms of Law, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of speech doth not admit the use of this word <hi>Servitude,</hi> unless to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Territorie of a State, there bee gotten som power over another State, and yet that State remain's Patron of its own not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding; in this sens the Republick hath not brought the Sea in servitude to the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> becaus it hath not gotten any special use or command over it, the Dominion for all that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another Patron, but hath assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the total and intire Dominion thereof, which was before abandoned, neither
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64062:304"/>
by any governed or protected: nevertheless it may in a certain proportion bee called <hi>Servitude,</hi> inasmuch as the Republick hath been constrained to assume the total Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Government thereof, for the service of the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> whereof it had necessarie use.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the <hi>Privilege</hi> of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sea, and who was the Donor, this neither can here have any place, forasmuch as at the time of the assumption of it, there was not any who could make any grant thereof, the Emperor of the VVest never having any Power or Autoritie over it; and as little superioritie or jurisdiction had any other western Prince; and therefore could so much the less give it to another. The Emperor of the East, not having force suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to keep it, had long since abandoned it, and beeing thereupon divested of all the Power hee had over it, and of the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof, never made any grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the successive Peace and Treaties which happened afterwards betwixt the said Empire and the Republick. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all which the <hi>Italian</hi> Lawyers, as Professors of the Cesarean Law, &amp; sworn to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64062:304"/>
the very words of it, beeing besides most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his Imperial Majestie, as if at this present day <hi>Augustus</hi> or <hi>Antoninus</hi> did reign, do force themselvs with all extortion, to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie upon the western Emperor that saying, <hi>Imperator est Dominus Mundi,</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is Lord of the world. VVhich at that very time when it was first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, was not true in the hundred part of the world, and at this present not in any considerable proportion. And whilest they would honor the Emperor, and give him, with such words as these, that which hee neither hath nor can have, they consider not the absurditie of the speech, as if they should say, that no King possessed any estate lawfully, unless it were granted him by the Emperor, which is as true, as when they affirm that the <hi>Venetians</hi> possess the Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea, by an Imperial privilege. But it appear's clear enough, in what sens this is spoken by them, becaus there is none of them do intend thereby, that there was ever any such Grant made thereof by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; but by that they do figuratively intend a privilege assumed by immemorable pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, which possession they interpret to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64062:305"/>
bee with the knowledg and sufferance of the Emperor, which is as much as if they should say, that Christian Kings possess their Kingdom, and the Republick posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> as lawfully by their title of acquiring it, as if those Kingdoms and that Sea had belonged to the Emperor, and from and by him to those Princes, and to the Republick afterwards granted. So spaciously did <hi>Chizzola</hi> dilate in speaking of the opinion of the Lawyers, it beeing the field of his profession: hee concluded, that any one might rest satisfied, as well in truth, as in reason, that by the Autoritie of the said Doctors, there were sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid to the caus, which hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
                  <p>After the testimonie of the Lawyers, hee added that of the <hi>Historians,</hi> who do relate, that the Republick, for more then 300 years past, did receiv Custom, of such as sailed that Sea, and kept armed vessels in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness, for to compel all such Ships so sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> testifying moreover, that even unto their present time the same Custom was observed. But upon their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations hee dwelled not much, saying,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64062:305"/>
that though they were good Testimonies of preceding occurrences; yet when one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to prove the interests of Princes, or of private persons, hee ought to help himself by authentick writings, and to use the Historians with great discretion; som of them beeing moved by love, others with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and others with hope of preferment; which constrain's them oftentimes to use flatterie, or Hyperboles, upon which cannot bee laid any sure foundation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore hee produced an act of the general Council of Lions, <hi>anno</hi> 1274, where the Abbot of <hi>Nervesa,</hi> beeing delegated by the Pope (upon a pretension of those of <hi>Ancona</hi> to have free Navigation upon the Adriatick Sea) sentenced, that the demand should bee rejected, and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> should not bee molested in the defens and protection thereof, from the <hi>Sarazens</hi> and Pirates, neither should bee disturbed from exacting thereupon their Rights and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, which they had of victuals, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise and other portable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chizzola</hi> likewise added, that it is clean out of memorie, when first of all there was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64062:306"/>
created in <hi>Venice,</hi> a <hi>Captain of the Gulf,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus in the year 1230, the Chancerie was burned, with the memorials of all such ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but from that time to this present, hee could shew out of the publick Registers, the continual succession of the said elected Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains without any interruption. Likewise hee added moreover, that there remain the Registers from that time to this, of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes granted to pass the said Sea, with armed vessels or ships of war, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and goods belonging to their use, at the request of divers Princes, who had their Possessions upon the shore of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, and that as well by sundrie Popes, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, Vicars, Governors, and Commonaltie of the Land of <hi>Romania</hi> and <hi>Marca,</hi> as by the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> for <hi>Puglia,</hi> of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were granted, som denied and others yielded to, but in part; But it beeing super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to allege the Acts of those, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of whom do not so much as question this Title, hee descended to particularize onely the Predecessors of his Majestie, as Kings of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and Arch-Dukes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi> Hee recited a Brief of Pope <hi>Urbane</hi> the sixt, directed to <hi>Antonio Veniero</hi> the Duke
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64062:306"/>
of <hi>Venice,</hi> bearing date <hi>Luca</hi> 14 Junii 1388. where hee give's him thanks, that with his Gallies deputed for the keeping of the Gulf, <hi>Marie</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungarie</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, who had been kept prisoner in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel-novo;</hi> with two other congratulatorie Letters, the one to the said Queen, the other to King <hi>Sigismund,</hi> who after was Emperor, beeing her Husband, rejoicing with them likewise of the said enlargement made by means of the Captain of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, deputed to the custodie of the <hi>Gulf.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hee caused to bee read a safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct granted at the Petition of <hi>Rodulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Sala,</hi> in the name of <hi>Ladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and of <hi>William</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> anno 1399. 12 <hi>Decembris,</hi> that the sister of the said King (espoused to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Arch-Duke) might bee conducted by Sea from <hi>Puglia,</hi> to the Coasts of her Husband, with Gallies and other Vessels, in all to the number of about twelv; with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that there should not bee suffered to pass upon them any <hi>Bandito</hi> or banished person of <hi>Venice,</hi> who had don any thing against the Republick, which did merit death: which safe-conduct should bee avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Austrians,</hi> as well in going as in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64062:307"/>
coming, so as by the same, they might also re-imbark at <hi>Trieste</hi> and return unto <hi>Puglia.</hi> But yet this safe Conduct was not made use of, becaus the King having deferred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of his sister for a small time, in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim</hi> shee died.</p>
                  <p>Also hee produced two letters of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Frederick,</hi> unto Duke <hi>Giovanni Moce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigo,</hi> the first dated in <hi>Gratz</hi> 24 Sept. 1478. the other 2 Apr. 1479. from the same place, where hee tell's him that hee having taken order that there should bee brought from <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> to his castles of <hi>Castro</hi> and of <hi>Istria,</hi> a certain quantitie of corn, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest's that it may bee permitted him to do it freely, which beeing to him a great pleasure, hee shall acknowledg it with many thanks.</p>
                  <p>This hee seconded with a letter of <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> to <hi>Giovanni Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenigo</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> dated the last of Jan. 1481. whereby desiring for her proper use to have divers things from the parts of <hi>Italie,</hi> which shee could not bring from thence by Sea, without the permission of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, shee desired that, for curtesie sake and friendship, it might bee granted her, which shee should take for a great favor,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64062:307"/>
and correspond upon the like occasion.</p>
                  <p>And another of <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie</hi> to the said Duke dated 26 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1482. where relating how the Republick was accustomed to give Licence every year to Count <hi>Frangipani</hi> Patron of <hi>Segna</hi> and other Maritim places, to bring from <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Marca</hi> a certain quantitie of victuals, and that after the said places, were passed over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, hee had omitted to desire it; wherefore hee now praied, that the same grace might bee shewed unto him, and that concerning this, hee would write his letters and give them to a person which hee had sent expressly to receiv them; which hee should acknowledg as a favor and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond accordingly.</p>
                  <p>And another of the same King to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustino Barbarigo</hi> the Duke, dated 18 <hi>Oct.</hi> 1487. in the which relating, that hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving need of wood for the reparation of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress standing in the mouth of <hi>Narenta,</hi> hee praied, that hee might have leav to carrie it unto <hi>Segna</hi> by Sea, and that there might bee Letters Patents made thereof, offering to gratifie him in a greater matter.</p>
                  <p>Hee added to this a Letter of <hi>Anne</hi> Queen
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64062:308"/>
of <hi>Hungarie</hi> 30. <hi>Aug.</hi> 1502. in the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the sterilitie of the Countrie of <hi>Segna,</hi> shee desire's leav to bring certain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals from <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Marca,</hi> and that hee would give to the bearer, who was sent on purpose, Letters of Licens for the same, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to acknowledg it as a great favor and courtesie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, hee produced a Letter dated 3 <hi>Sept.</hi> 1504. of <hi>Giovanni de Dura</hi> Captain of <hi>Pismo,</hi> servant to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> which hee writ unto the Duke <hi>Leonardo Loredano,</hi> importing, that <hi>Giacomo Croato,</hi> a subject of his Majesties, parting from <hi>Fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nona,</hi> entered into the Sea, which is under the Dominion of the Republick, for to go to <hi>Segna,</hi> and was there assailed by an armed Bark of Pirates in contempt of the Signorie or Republick, and supplicate's that som order might bee taken therein.</p>
                  <p>Upon all which particulars, hee weighed most that which ought best to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, having respect to the times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and qualities of the several Princes, and for greater confirmation of their assent, hee remembred the yearly Cerimonie used at <hi>Venice;</hi> where the Duke, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64062:308"/>
of the Ambassadors of other Princes, particularly of his Majesties, did use to espous the Sea, by the casting of a Ring into it, with these words: <hi>Desponsamus Te Mare in signum veri &amp; perpetui Dominii:</hi> Wee do marrie the Sea, in sign of our true and perpetual Dominion over it. VVhich Cerimonie as the foresaid writers do affirm, had beginning when Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Third was in <hi>Venice,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they add withal, that it was instituted in sign of the Dominion which the Republick had formerly gotten, <hi>jure belli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the 400 complaints of the Emperors Subjects, and to the sentence of <hi>Liesina,</hi> hee answered, giving thanks for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of them, as a thing brought in much to his favor, becaus the complaints do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose the prohibition, and the sentences, either condemning or absolving, do prove the jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>And to the salt-barks, hee said, that they were not suffered to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> as never any are suffered to go, all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein salt beeing prohibited to enter into that Citie; and if it were not cast into the Sea, it was a courtesie, which ought
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64062:309"/>
not to bee imputed to them to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                  <p>Hee concluded, that hee had delivered the true sens of the Capitulations, and proved the immemorable possession of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea; that hee could have said much more, but it seemed to him super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and these two points were made most clear; <hi>First,</hi> That this pretence of the <hi>Austrians</hi> was but new; And <hi>secondly,</hi> That their Petition at this Convention could have no place.</p>
                  <p>The Imperialists after they had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, took a resolution not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in the demand of Justice, and the Baron with <hi>Suorz</hi> said openly, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick was Patron of the Gulf, and might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose what Customs they thought fitting; and that they thought so in their consciences:</hi> but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal they were of an opinion, that for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie sake, and for the friendship which the Republick had with the hous of <hi>Austria,</hi> it should bee don with the least incommoditie of the subjects to that hous, as could bee possible. The other three said, that it was now no time, either to approve or to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Dominion of the Sea, but rather
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64062:309"/>
to finde by way of courtesie som kinde of temperature, whereby the Republick might receiv the Rights belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto from the <hi>Austrian</hi> subjects sailing those Seas, and on the other side, that such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons annexed formerly thereunto, might bee taken away, which were incommodious to the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and no waies profitable to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Whereupon divers waies to effect it were examined, and a conclusion taken to refer all to their several Princes, as it was necessarie to refer all things els; the Commission beeing to bee onely perfected by their ratification, and so this Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended.</p>
