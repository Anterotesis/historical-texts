            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:43715:3"/>
in its opposing pure and undefiled Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) had almost brought it to the Birth before its time: When the Edition of that excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> upon the same Subject, in that juncture, inclin'd me to think of Stifling it in the Womb as altogether useless. But when I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that the greatest part of the Serpents Brood stopped their Ears to the Doctors Learned Charms, it came in my mind, that the Cure of this <hi>Tarantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> requires (according to the different Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Patients) different Tunes, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a less skilful hand might hit upon Lessons, that might recover some out of that distemper, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Musick of smoother Airs: I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to my old Opinion, that I could not put the hours I spare, from dayly business incumbent upon me, to a better improvement, than by expending them in study how to reason the World out of that High-way to Atheism it is faln into. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of these Studies I humbly submit to the Censure, and commend to the Patronage of your Grace, as that Person whom the Holy Ghost hath made Over-seer over the whole Flock of God within the Pale of that Province, whereof by your Graces Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as Patron, and Institution, as my then Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan, that part was committed to my Cure, whereto I have hitherto diligently, though, God knows, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably attended. To whom I therefore think my self peculiarly bound (in Conscience as well as Gratitude) to give an account even of my Leisure, as well as Work, in that part of the Vineyard where
<pb facs="tcp:43715:3"/>
it pleased your Grace to assign me my Station and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Humbly requesting your Graces Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of those Nods you may possibly see me take at a Work of this Length, and interwoven with such variety of Matter, and some Threads that have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been snarl'd or not well unravel'd by the best Criticks: (wherein if my Pen hath dropt a word or sentence prejudicial to the Common Faith, Good Manners, or the Peace of the Church, I heartily wish it cancel'd,) <hi>[Secundas partes habeat, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destiae; qui primas non potuit habere, sapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ae: qui non valuit omnia non paenitenda dixis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, paeniteat quae cognoverit dicenda non fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse.]</hi> And your Candid Acceptance of this my good meaning and Labour for the Vindication of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion, as being a Sacrifice that hath not cost me nothing; your Grace being both privy to that mature Deliberation I have taken in moulding these Meditations, and apprehensive of the Industry is required in making so many Quotations out of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Authors: which have long lain out of my rode, and which I was therefore forc'd to run over again, that I might speak to the heart of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Fools, with whom nothing is savoury but Humane Learning. In which Particular I am not conscious to my self of trusting to any but mine own eyes, in any material Testimony, except where I make Reference to Second-hand Authors.</p>
            <p>And lastly, your Graces Blessing, and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Blessing of Heaven upon these poor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. May the saving Strength of Gods right Hand

            <head>THE PREFACE Expressing the Occasion and Design of the Work.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was one of <hi>Licurgus</hi> his Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>(Plutarch. Lysander)</hi> that men should wear the Hair of their Head and Beard at full length, grounded upon this Reason of State; because by this means white-liver'd Milksops would look more comely in the eyes of their Mistresses, and grim-fac'd Soldiers aspect be more terrible to the enemy. Indeed this was a way to make them look out like Lions upon their Foes at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: but that wise Law-maker should have consider'd that these Hair-ropes would serve the enemy in a close fight for handles to catch hold of and pull them down by. Upon which Consideration the <hi>Abantes</hi> whose Custom it was to fight pell-mell, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes out of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> were wont to shave their foretops and chins, <hi>(Plutarch Thes.) Alexander</hi>'s imitation of which Custom contributed not a little toward his Conquest of the World in the opinion of the same Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Author. While Religion kept her Grave Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Cut, she triumph'd in the Conquest of the
<pb facs="tcp:43715:5"/>
World, the enemy gall'd her with his Darts at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but durst not come to handy-gripes; or if he had the boldness to close with her, he was sure of a foile, having nothing to fasten upon in a Doctrine which is all Reason, all Piety, all Justice, all Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But when by the false Glosses of men of corrupt Minds or debauch'd Practices it degenerated into a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine abetting such Immoralities as even natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science abhors. It is no wonder if it fell into such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with men, who had Reason enough to see the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the Additions, and not Grace enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern and abstract from thence the Piety of the Original; as I cannot altogether blame the zeal of those well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning men, who to render it more august in the eyes of the Vulgar (who are taken with out-sides) Periwigg'd it with a Border of Reverend Ceremonies. Though I should more have commended their Discretion had they cut off those Elf-locks which Heretieal pravity had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened to it (as the first Four General Councils did; thereby depriving the enemy of that hold he had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.) For though this adventitious Cover did hide those Asses ears, and Religion lookt out of this borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hair with some kind of Majesty, while none durst approach nearer than the Principle of Implicit Faith <hi>[All is holy that holy Church teacheth and practiseth,]</hi> conducted them: yet when men grew bold to make nearer address to this seeming Lion (and certainly with Religions leave hitherto they were no more bold than welcome) It is not to be thought strange if persons Atheistically inclin'd, and who sought occasion against Religion, pul'd her by the false Beard and triumph'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her as a feigned thing: but rather to be admired, that God should give so many thousand Protestants, as appeared in that happy reformation which all pious men groaned after, so much wisdom as to discern the Body from the Dress, to distinguish betwixt Religion and the Innovations annexed to it: and so much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as that by their hands not one Hair of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Growth, nor Hair-breadth of its natural Length fell from the Head when they pluckt off the false
<pb facs="tcp:43715:5"/>
Locks and Beard, wherein the Demy-politicians had disguised her; (those pious Reformers were led by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit than that, which hath since hurled some blind zealous Furioso's into an humour, to shave Religion so close, in point of external Decency, as she looks fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and not as she did while she cast her Doves-eyes from under her native Locks;) But Religion thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to her Primitive majestick Purity, look'd too gravely upon persons of prophane Spirits and loose Lives; who when they could not by their Antinomian glosses pervert her, to Patronize their Villanies, Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Blasphemies, Treasons, Rebellions, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Debaucheries of Humane Nature, the most skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artist of Iniquity could arrive at, (but that she still ecchoed back the guilt of their crying sins, into the Ears of their Consciences, from such immoveable Rocks of irrefragable Placits, and such plain Texts, as stand firm to their genuine Sence, against all possibility of mis-interpretation) enter'd into a wicked Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their own hearts, how they might put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence so great a troubler of their peace, so incessant a disturber of that Repose, they are resolv'd to take in the bosome of their <hi>Dalilahs:</hi> And finding no occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, they are resolv'd to make some, by fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certain Prejudices upon her, as so many Foretops to take hold of, and thereby to tumble her down from that Throne she had erected in their Consciences, and from that Pinacle of highest Respect she had gain'd in the World. By these Methods, this (Generation of men shall I call them, or) Cage of unclean Birds are grown to that height of impious audacity, as (with <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Socrates</hi> his Dream) they sit perching upon the venerable Head of that sacred Philosophy wherein they were initiated; pecking at those bald places they imagine they have espied, and crowing over it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a meer trick of Policy; sometimes as silly and Ridiculous, sometimes as Despicable and not Divine. In a deep Resentment of these unthankful Returns to God that made them, and to that Faith that would have sav'd them, I have undertaken the Patronage of Religion
<pb facs="tcp:43715:6"/>
against their Surmises, in the following Treatise; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I endeavour to dis-intangle her from those Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are taken up against her, and by occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Sceptick misrepresents her to himself, and other credulous inobservant Persons: To scare these foetid Harpies, from laying their impure Talons, upon that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice, wherewith God hath ratified the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace betwixt himself and <hi>Abrahams</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by the Voyce of Birds of the same Feather, by the Testimony of Heathens and Dictates of Reason, which are either born with us or enter into us, by the Senses: To allay their priding themselves in a Conceipt, that they are the only Birds of <hi>Apollo</hi> (because forsooth they are witty in contriving their own Perdition;) while I discover them to be <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Birds, a Flock of Owles; who can neither open their Eyes upon that Natural Light, which gilded the World with its Rayes in our Saviours Age, nor that Supernatural, which shines in the admirable Matter and contexture of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture: And demonstrate the Misprisions wherewith they load Christianity, (in revenge that they cannot force it to gratifie their Lusts) to be (like the Allegations of the Elders against <hi>Susanna)</hi> mere groundless prejudices, and false Beards fastned unto it; that snatching hold thereon they may pull it down and rowle it in the Mire of Calumny. And this (if God permit) by the Confessions of their Fellows, by the Testimonies of as great Enemies to Holy Religion as themselves, and the Witness of Vulgar Sentiments, attesting to the Truth of these Four Propositions, which are the Basis of the whole Discourse, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of so many books, <hi>viz.</hi>

The Apostles could never have hoped to induce the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this world to a belief of as unlikely stories, had they had no more than an arm of flesh to trust to. The conclusion of the whole matter. God's Tabernacle set in the Sun shining out in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est lustre of humane Sciences. § 4. The Civick Religion both with the Vulgar and Politicians in high respect in our Saviours Age, proved, from the Philosophers salvo's, by consequence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from several examples.

But the signs of Christs coming, of our Gods manifestation in the flesh, were presented to an age in which the greatest mysteries of Nature, her most hidden secrets, were by the sagacity of inquisitive wits, found out and ransack'd. <hi>(Aristotle</hi> is stiled by some the <hi>praecursor</hi> of Christ, <hi>in naturalibus, Heylin.

               <p>To be sure the masculine poetry of that age, ushered Christs doctrine into the Empire, as the Baptist did into <hi>Judaea</hi> (for what the Law was to the Jew, that the liberal Sciences were to the gentile, a School-master, to bring them to Christ, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus (Stromat.</hi> 1.) affirms) and, as it were, set the game for the net of the Gospel, as the same learned Father observes: Or, as <hi>Theons</hi> Musicians in <hi>Aelian, (Aelian. var. hist.</hi> 2. 44.) prepared the expectant spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, with their incentive Songs, for a more plausible reception of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Image of the eternal Father, riding upon his white horse, conquering and to conquer.

of those black Philosophers was grown so numerous under <hi>Tiberius;</hi> as his decree to banish them the City had taken effect, if the multitude of Families, which that hook threatned to extirpate, and their promise to give over the practice of those curious arts, had not made the Emperour relent. <hi>(Sueton.

               <p>The naming of <hi>Apuleius</hi> his Apology, brings to mind the occasion of it: which was to purge himself of the crime of Magick, wherewith he was charged before <hi>Claudius Maximus,</hi> Lievtenant of <hi>Africa:</hi> as <hi>Apollonius Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneus</hi> was of the same crime before <hi>Domitian:</hi> A pair of the fiercest Pagan ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to our Religion. <hi>August. de Civitat.</hi> 8. 19.</p>
               <p>The Jews indeed had a sharper edge against us: and as strange a back as Hell could forge, coming not one whit behind the Gentile in his proficiency in the black Art, being grown more <hi>Samaritan</hi> than the <hi>Samaritan</hi> himself. 1. Not only in their charmings, by the explication of (the <hi>Tetragrammaton) Jehovah</hi> in twelve, and in forty two letters; to which they imputed that force, as they affirm'd (with no less blasphemy to their own than our Religion) that <hi>Moses</hi> wrought all his miracles by means of <hi>Shemhamphorash,</hi> the twelve-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd explication of the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ingraven on the rod of God: And that our Jesus by vertue of the same, sowed within his skin, effected those great works which he performed. And that <hi>Rabbi Chanina,</hi> by vertue of the two and forty letter'd name of God, did whatsoever he would. (The Jews father'd this Art upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> who they say left forms of conjurations, of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whereof one <hi>Eleazar</hi> gave proof before <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and his Sons, and their whole Army, <hi>Josephus</hi> being present, as himself reports, <hi>(Antiquit. lib. 8. cap.</hi> 2.)

               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. The world secured against Innovations by the soundness of its then Politiques. While the Shepherds sleep the flock made a prey. The Emperour <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> (a solid States-man himself) had a most sage Council. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a versatil head-piece seconded with wise Sages. § 2. The genius of the then <hi>Roman</hi> policy disgusted the introduction of a strange God. <hi>Tiberius</hi> upon <hi>Pilates</hi> information moving the Senate to Canonize our Jesus, is repulst. The <hi>Romans</hi> admit of no foreign Gods till they have renounced their old Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Altars. <hi>Constantine</hi> upbraided <hi>Licinius</hi> with his imbracing a strange God. Our Jesus the first foreign God which the <hi>Roman</hi> State im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd. § 3. Of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his deisication at <hi>Rome.</hi> § 4. Christ got the start of <hi>Magus</hi> in the point of obtaining Divine Honour at the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> hands. <hi>Augustus</hi> erected an Altar, To the first begotten. <hi>Suidas</hi> his story of <hi>Augustus</hi> his Altar defended. <hi>Augustus</hi> his unhappiness in his Issue might probably put him upon referring the choice of a Successour to the Oracles determination. His slighting <hi>Apollo</hi> argues the Answer he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not to have made for <hi>Apollo</hi>'s credit. § 5. Some passages touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Argument in <hi>Tertullian</hi> cleared from the Anabaptistical gloss. Where the Emperours and Senates shooe pincht them. How much this State-maxime prejudic'd the Apostles.</p>
               <p>§ 1. NOtwithstanding that the World was so well fortified against Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by its being so well seen in the above-mentioned Arts; yet had the Gospel found it in a disordered posture, through its defect of polity, this might have given an advantage to the Assaylants to subdue it to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of things not rationable or credible. While every man is left to do what is good in his own eyes, as the Jews were when there was no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> the stragling Sheep may easily become the prey of Wolves and Foxes. How many vast, valiant, expert and (while well marshall'd) terrible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable Armies, have through want of Discipline, in a disordered march been put to the Rout by a less strong and worse skill'd Enemy? But the Gospel charged the world, when it stood in a full field and well ranked body to receive the on-set; not in that condition wherein the <hi>Danites</hi> found <hi>Laish,</hi> careless and heedless, without a Magistracy to put them to shame in any thing, and keep them in order, which was the great incouragement their Spies gave them to make an attempt upon that City: (Weem's <hi>Exercitations on Judg.</hi> 18. 7, 8, 10.)

The two Luminaries <hi>(Augustus,</hi> of stay'd policy, <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of versatile craft) moving successively through a Zodiack of Twelve Statists, stars of the greatest magnitude that ever shin'd at once in the firmament of that State: The two first Judges of the Universe, that enter'd upon that preferment, by way of inheritance (as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted each of them, with a full Jury of as able Lawyers as ever past Verdict together) sitting successively upon the Bench, when the Cause of the Gospel was first pleaded; as if they had been impannell'd on purpose to take notice of the Evidence brought into Court.

not to be administred by the Conduct or Counsels of any God but their own. <hi>Tiberius</hi> himself (saith <hi>Tertullian, Apolog. cap.</hi> 5.) could not obtain of the Senate an Edict, to have our <hi>Jesus</hi> canonized for a God at <hi>Rome,</hi> though he moved earnestly for it, upon <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Letters informing him what had past in <hi>Judaea.

               <p>And more fully exprest by <hi>Vives, in Aug. de Civit. 2. 22. When the Romans besieged any City which they intended to demolish, (that they might not seem to wage war with its tutelar Gods, and turn them out of doors against their will, by pulling down their Temples about their ears) the General, by certain charms, obtained of them to forsake the tutelage of the City destin'd to ruine, and betake themselves to the stronger side, to the conquering party.</hi> Thus <hi>Camillus</hi> decoy'd the <hi>Veijan</hi> Gods; <hi>Scipio,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Numantian; Mummius,</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian.</hi> And lest others might serve their Guardian God with the same sauce, they concealed (as divers Authors have thought mention'd by <hi>Servius</hi> in his <hi>Epist. vir.

It was upon the same score, that <hi>Numa</hi> caused <hi>Mamurius</hi> to make eleven shields, so like the <hi>Ancile</hi> of their Patron <hi>Mars,</hi> wherein they conceived the happiness of their City to lie (as <hi>Thebes</hi> her good fortune in <hi>Nisus</hi> his golden lock, and <hi>Meleagers</hi> life in the fagot-slick)

                  <hi>The very City of</hi> Rome <hi>it self is worshipped as a Goddess by Sacrifices; and they adore the name of the place as a Deity.</hi> Thus hath Antichristian <hi>Rome,</hi> both Pagan and Papal, exalted her self above all that, in the most extensive sence, is called God or worshipped. What hopes then could the Apostles have, had they been supported by no other but an arm of flesh, to obtrude upon that Empire, that unknown, that strange God whom they preacht? A thing, First, so ill resented by that State in <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; as <hi>Licinius,</hi> in his Speech to his Soldiers (mentioned by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Constantine, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 5.) whets their courage, and animates them to the fight by this argument alone, That the Army they were to ingage against had imbrac'd a strange God, and intended to fight under his colours. Secondly, Of so harsh a sound in the ears of some Christian Theologues, as not knowing how to put a good sence upon that phrase when they met with it in <hi>Daniel, (Dan.</hi> 11. 39.) they have mangled the coherence, making a meer hotch-potch of that prophecie, and perverted its sence, forcing it (to point at the marks of Antichrist) from its plain intendment to describe the conquest of Christ, and his subduing the Empire to an abrenunciation of the Gods of its Ancestors, and the acceptance of himself, that foreign God to them, <hi>(Mede in locum)</hi> that (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) unknown God <hi>(Act.</hi> 17.) that only Potentate, God blessed for ever, that should set his conquering Banners upon the Walls of that proud City, that had set hers upon the Temples of all other strange Gods; and gather that Eagle as a Chicken under his, that had made the Gods of all Nations creep under her wings; the full experiment whereof he gave in the Reign of <hi>Constantine.</hi> And that's the clear importance of <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecie, and of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> his Argument. The first perverter of <hi>Daniels</hi> words to a sinister sence, was the Patriarch of those hackney Commentators, that think it a strange thing, that the Empires embracing a strange God, should be taken in a good sence, and import the Christning of it into the name of our Jesus. But if the Name of a foreign God startle some of our Divines, it is less to be wonder'd, that, Thirdly it should grate so harshly upon Pagan-Roman ears, as that State could never be charmed into the imbracing of any strange God upon his own terms, before or beside the blessed Jesus; <hi>[nisi homini placuerit Deus, Deus non erit; homo jam Deo propitius esse debebit] (Tert. Ap. contr. Gent.</hi> 5.) all others, before their reception, were capitulated with, and forc'd to lay their Crowns of Divine Honour at the Senates feet, before they were permitted in that City to wear them on their own heads: they must undeifie themselves, and become no Gods of other Cities, before they are allowed to be Gods in that. From which custom <hi>Eusebius (Hist.</hi> 2. 2.) ascribes it to a signal providence, that our Jesus was not received, by the Senate, for God, upon <hi>Tiberius</hi> his motion; <hi>Which no doubt</hi> (saith he) <hi>was done to this end, that the wholesome Doctrine of the Divine Preaching might not need the approbation of men, the commendation of such men: i. e.</hi> That Christ might not seem to enter at the common door, in a precarious way, with cap in hand, till the Senate was pleased to bid him be cover'd: that his <hi>Divinity</hi> might not, like that of other Gods, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks <hi>ubi prius) de humano arbitratu pensitari,</hi> pass for no more than it weighed in the unequal scales of humane arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but settle it self among them by its own weight, and over them upon his own terms.</p>
               <p>§ 4. There is but one instance in all History that bears any semblance of opposition to this last assertion [That our Jesus was the first foreign God whom the Romans received without capitulations] and that is of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> who seems to have prevented our Saviour in the honour of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a God there.</p>
               <p>Which knot some attempt to untie, or rather rashly to cut asunder, by a back-blow against the truth of those current Stories which <hi>Eusebius</hi> (out of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus)</hi> reports of <hi>Simon</hi>'s Deification; the sword with which they wound the credit of this History comes out of the forge of <hi>Peter

In whose Temple <hi>Tanquill</hi> or <hi>Caia Caecilia</hi> resided with her whorle and distaff, as out of <hi>Varro Pliny</hi> reports, <hi>(lib. 8. cap.</hi> 48.) Now, though <hi>Justin</hi> might easily mistake <hi>[Semoni]</hi> for <hi>[Simoni]</hi> yet sure he must have had a beam in's eye if he took a Temple on the <hi>Quirinal</hi> Hill for a Statue on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> Bridge. And that <hi>Tertullian</hi> should follow him in that mistake, being so great an Antiquary, and which is more, by Profession a Lawyer, and therefore skill'd in the Roman Fasts and lect dayes, is still a greater wonder: And therefore notwithstanding <hi>Vossius</hi> his Arguments to the contrary, I still think those great Lights of the Primitive Church did not ground their story of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> upon such palpable mistakes. And as to <hi>Ciaconius</hi> his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the so late invention of that Statue dug up in or near the place where <hi>Justin</hi> reports <hi>Simons</hi> Statue to have been placed, I would think, That the Authority of <hi>Justin</hi> and his writing this by way of Apology for the Christian Religion to the Emperour, within that Century wherein it was done; and <hi>Tertulian</hi>'s mentioning it in his Apology, (who was a man better skill'd in that Cities Antiquities than to be imposed upon in a thing of which he might have had ocular demonstration,) are enough to blunt the edge of this sword, if not to turn it against those that use it; and make men of sober minds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suspect those diggers deceived, and that new-found basis to be a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Justins</hi> History, That coming so near the Inscription of <hi>Magus</hi> his Statue mentioned by him, and the difference betwixt that and this being, in all reason, imputable to the teeth of time, which corrodes the most durable Marble; against which, while the Characters could bear up themselves, they presented this Motto, <hi>SIMONI SANCTO DEO FILIO:</hi> besides the canker of Age, a blow with a Mattock might sooner make an alteration in a Letter or two, in one Image besieged with Mattocks, than the Mothes conspire to gnaw out a piece of a Letter in three several Authors. I have ever dislik'd too much Criticisme in the consuring of approved Authors, as the Devils engine, insensibly, to screw men up to infidelity, and disbelief of the sacred Scripture it self, that being conveyed down to us in the same way of pen or press-tradition that other writings are. But to the Objection, from <hi>Magus</hi> his Canonization, this will be answer sufficient; That whatever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

was conferr'd at <hi>Rome</hi> upon him, was given him as the <hi>Perkin Werbeck</hi> of the blessed Jesus, as his shadow and counterfeit; for he giving out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be that very Jesus who appear'd in <hi>Judaea; (Iren. contr. haer.</hi> 1. 20.) and by his inchantments, <hi>(Justin Mart. Apoleg.)</hi> perswading many of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and some of other Nations, by Name, Roman Citizens, and perhaps that Mushrome Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> that he was indeed that person whom he personated, and upon that ground had a Statue erected to him: So that <hi>Simon</hi> obtain'd Divine Honour under <hi>Claudius,</hi> according to <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> or by <hi>Claudius,</hi> according to <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> no otherwise than <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> his shadow obtain'd Imperial, and the pseudo-<hi>Alexander</hi> Regal, Honour, at the hands of those deluded Greeks and Jews, that took them for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose parts they acted. His Image was the Image of the supposed Christ, from the belief of whose Deity, first embrac'd, proceeded the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that that first begotten of the Devil, who gave himself out to be that Jesus which was Crucified at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was the Holy God. To speak all in a word, and but too intelligible, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was the <hi>James Naylor</hi> of that Age, to whom his deluded Followers cryed <hi>Hosannah,</hi> taking him to be him whom he counterfeited.</p>

And yet (to cast in over-weight) had this Sorcerer's Statue stood upon its own, and not a borrowed basis; he would not have prevented our Jesus in an early obtaining Divine Honour, who as he was censed in his Cratch by the Wise-men of the East, so he had an Altar erected to him in his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, by the Emperour of both East and West, if <hi>Suidas (in the Life of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus) play the part of a faithful Historian; for there he tells us <hi>[That</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus <hi>consulting the Oracle of</hi> Apollo, <hi>who should be his Successour, received this Answer,</hi>

                  <hi>Happy they that live without Wives, and die without Children! (Suet. Octav.</hi> 65.) Here was, if ever, <hi>Deo dignus vindice nodus,</hi> a snarle in his fortune requiring the aid of a Divine Solution. To which, no doubt, but so over Religious a Prince would apply himself. For if mans natural propensity to invocate the Divine, when humane counsel fails, was radicated in <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (notwithstanding his irreligiousness, <hi>[Circa Deos ac Religiones negligentior] Suet. Tiber.</hi> 69.) so deep, as he in the like case (to counterfeit <hi>Augustus</hi> in commendable things, where his native pravity would permit him to write after so good a Copy) durst not appoint his Successour, till he had supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Gods, by some manifest token to determine whom he should choose, <hi>Joseph. Antiq. 18. 8. [Consilium cui impar erat fato commist] (Tac. an.</hi> 6. 137.) Can we reasonably suspect <hi>Suidas</hi> of falsehood in reporting <hi>Augustus,</hi> where he found the last Act of the Comedy of his life thus perplext, to have call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Apollo</hi> into the Scene, to unite this knot, referring the choice of an Heir, where he had so bad choice, to the umpirage of the Divine Wisdom?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that the Answers which that, and whatever other Oracles he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, gave, were as little to the credit of the Gods, as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports them to have been, appears from that low esteem which in his old Age he had of both, exprest by his condemning to the flames, when he was great Pontiff, two thousand Oracles, <hi>(Sueton. Octav.</hi> 31.) though at his entrance into that Office, he was so devout an Adorer of the old Religion, consisting in a great part of those Oracles, as he preferr'd his Augurate above his Empire; fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his name at his reforming of the Calender, rather on that month when he commenc'd <hi>Augur,</hi> than on that wherein he began his Reign: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing, that if any of his Nieces had been old enough he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd her to the place of a Vestal, fallen void by the death of one of those Nuns; with that protestation upbraiding the Senators irreligiousness, exprest in their making means that their Daughters might not be called to that lot.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Apollo</hi> himself, and the rest of the twelve great Deities what his thoughts were grown to, by that time he was grown old, he more than intimated in his erecting of that strange Order of Table-Knights <hi>(Sueton. Octav.</hi> 70.) instituted (as not only <hi>Antonius</hi> but the common Libels object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him) in contempt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom <hi>Augustus</hi> as Master of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der personated, and the other eleven he and she Deities, whom the rest of the Knights represented in that his supper of the twelve Gods,</p>

§ 6. This may suffice to vindicate <hi>Suidas,</hi> and prove the truth of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, That the Polity of <hi>Rome</hi> was so averse to the entertainment of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign God, as our Jesus was the first strange God that that Empire embrac'd, either by Publick Edict of the Senate, or the private Conscience of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, as <hi>Tertullian (Apol. cont. gentes, cap.</hi> 21.) distinguisheth, <hi>Ipse pro sua conscientia Christianus; He as to his own private perswasion being already a Christian. Senatus respuit,</hi> Caesar <hi>in sententia mansit, (Id. ibid. cap. 5.) The Senate rejected</hi> Tiberius <hi>his motion for the Canonization of Christ, but</hi> Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>persisted in the Opinion of Christs being God. Sed &amp;</hi> Caesares <hi>ipsi credidissent super Christo, si aut</hi> Caesares <hi>non essent seculo necessarii, aut si &amp; Christiani po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuissent esse</hi> Caesares, <hi>(Id. ibid. cap. 21.) Yea, even the Emperours themselves would have become Christians, if they had not been hamper'd with secular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, or if that Christians could have been</hi> Caesars. Upon which passages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they give both light and strength to the preceding discourse (though not without hazard of spilling my Readers patience) I shall venture to make these reflections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To clear that clause <hi>[aut si &amp; Christiani potuissent esse</hi> Caesares] from the Anabaptistical gloss; this Note will be sufficient, That <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Successors reconciled this inconsistency of Christianity and Empire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not absolute but only occasional and temporary; nor of all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire or Civil command, but particularly respected the Roman Empire. For there were Christian Magistrates, and that under the Emperour, very early in the Primitive Times, both Martial, as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and Civil, as <hi>Sergius Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as Judicious <hi>Grotius</hi> observes. <hi>[Ob temporum circumstantias quae vix fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant exerceri sine actibus quibusdam cum Christiana lege pugnantibus, (Grotius de Jur. bel. &amp; pacis, l. 2. 9. 3.) The circumstances of those Times were such as did scarcely permit the Office of the Emperour to be exercised without certain Acts contrary to the Christian Law.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be therefore worth the while to enquire, what that Secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest was, in which the Emperours were so involv'd, in that juncture, as it was a <hi>Remora</hi> to their casting their assistance on Christ, and a bar to him that was a Christian to become Emperour. Let him that tied, untie this knot: let <hi>Tertullian</hi> himself <hi>(Apol.</hi> 5.) determine, who infers the story of <hi>Tiberius</hi> above-mentioned, with an <hi>[ergo]</hi> from that old Decree quoted by him in the preceding clause. <hi>Vetus erat decretum, nè qui Deus ab Imperatore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craretur, nisi à Senatu probatus, There was an old Decree, that none should be Canonized for a God by the Emperour, (Euseb. interpr.

               </p>
               <p>By this we see where the Senates and Emperours shooe pinches in the case of our <hi>Jesus:</hi> His not complying with them in this great maxime of State; his not induring this humane test; his not condescending to their terms, of renouncing <hi>Judaea</hi>'s, and undertaking the patronage of the people and City of <hi>Rome. Pilat</hi>'s writing him in his Letter to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as he had writ him in the Inscription over the Cross, <hi>Jesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>King of the Jews,</hi> was that very thing which would not down with the Senate; that which made the Evangelical Doctrine too strait a glove for their gouty hand: had it not been for this they would have drawn it on: And had they drawn it on, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> would have worn Christs colours, and not only have prohibited the persecution, but have commanded the profession of the Christian Religion: the Senate's sticking at his Canonization, being that secular concern which stifled the light of his Conscience; he choosing rather to save his Crown than his Soul. The fear of suffering shipwrack of a good Conscience upon the shelf of this temptation, together with the custom of exhibiting an oath to the Emperour, at his ingress to the exercise of that dignity <hi>[not to over-top the Senate in those privileges the ancient Laws had establisht them in]</hi> and also the College of the Pontiffs installing him in the great Pontificality, and committing to him the chief ordering of the affairs concerning the Ethnick Ceremonies; a thing that <hi>Gratian</hi> said (and thereupon refused the pontifical Stole) was unlawful for a Christian (and 'tis a wonder how the former Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperours could wear that Stole without galling their shoulders) <hi>(vid. Mord. vol. 2. pag.</hi> 746.) These circumstances (I say) were the Lion in the tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Christians way to the Imperial Crown, and made the Inauguration in that dignity incompetent to a Christian indeed, as not being tenable or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in that juncture but upon those terms, which were in effect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively, an abrenunciation of Christ.</p>
               <p>From all which may be inferr'd, for a conclusion of this Argument, the invincibleness of the Empire to the obedience of Christ, by an arm of flesh, and the ridiculousness of attempting to batter down this strong hold, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Empire had immur'd it self, against the fiercest assaults the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated consciences of their own Emperours could make) without the greatest assurance of the Divine aid. Had <hi>Aegypt</hi> been the head of the worlds Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, (that Wind-mill head turning its sailes about to every new wind, to the imbracing of every new and strange Deity) or <hi>Greece,</hi> which both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Secular Histories describe to be in love with novelties: It would have been a business of no great difficulty, to have reduc'd it to the belief of a well-coucht new Fable. But to prevail with it, to renounce its old and imbrace a strange God, when <hi>Rome</hi> was become its Metropolis, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus est.</hi> To poak out Leviathan, from under that shelf of prejudice against a strange God, by the Apostolical rod, into the Net of the Gospel; to draw him to that shore he had such an antipathy against, by that slender silken twine wherewith the Apostles fisht for men; to intice him with the bait of a foreign Deity cloathed in so mean and outwardly despicable flesh; can be imputed to nothing less, than the cooperation of that power, with those mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, that's able to subdue all things to it self, and bring to nought things that are, by things that are not.

The Apostles could never have hoped to induce the disputers of this world to a belief of as unlikely stories, had they had no more than an arm of flesh to trust to. The conclusion of the whole matter. God's Tabernacle set in the Sun shining out in its greatest lustre of humane Sciences. § 4. The Civick Religion both with the Vulgar and Politicians in high respect in our Saviours Age, proved, from the Philosophers salvo's, by consequence, and directly from several examples. The world was injoying her self</hi> Pigmalion-<hi>like in the warm imbraces of her-own-made sacred animals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. ALthough the World by this four-double shield (of knowledge in Arts Physical, Poetical, Demoniacal and Political) was thus well guarded against the surprizals of Impostures: yet had it wanted the eye of Theology, a cunning Stalker might possibly have catcht it on its blind side: Had the Sun of Metaphysical knowledge been cold set upon it, the Apostles might have presumed, in the darkness of that night, to have dazeled its eyes with the splendor of the Gospel, and to have struck it with their fish-spear, or have drawn their net over it, while it lay astonish'd with the strangeness of that sight: As we see Salmons caught with the flame of a broom-fagot, and Larks with a low-bell. In order therefore to our clearing the Apostles from the charge of designing to put a cheat upon the world, it will be expedient to take a view of the posture it then stood in, in point of Religion; which though miserably depraved, with the inventions of its own foolish and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially darkned heart, through its letting slip, in that vast tract of time, what was once deliver'd to it by the Sons of <hi>Noah;</hi> and in lieu of the old tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taking up, and filling its hand with vain imaginations: yet (whether it were through that Ages improving of Natural Principles, or retrieving of Supernatural, either by a more familiar converse with that Nation, to whom God had concredited the custody of his Oracles; or by means of the divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Septuagint; or by Gods blessing upon their faithfulness in a little;) never did any Age before it, since the first General Apostasie, stand better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against Impostors in Religion than this did. The Three Sects that only deserve the name of Divine, the <hi>Pythagorick, Socratical</hi> and <hi>Platonick,</hi> being about our Saviours time grown to that improvement, as more substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Divinity occurrs in the writings of one Roman, who then turn'd his stile that way, than in all the Volumes of preceding Philosophers.</p>

Witness his Books <hi>de Divinatione, de somnio Scipionis, de Seneciute, de Legibus,</hi> his <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> and <hi>Academick questions;</hi> wherein he traceth the Deity, by the foot-steps of the Creature and common Providence, more near its seat of inaccessible light than he durst openly, or in his own person, express; and therefore communicates his conceptions upon that subject by way of Romance under borrowed names, as <hi>Plate</hi> had done before him in the like case <hi>[sed nimirum</hi> Socratis <hi>carcerem times] (Lactant. de fal. rel.</hi> 1. 3.) both of them skulking under the shades of deceased Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, for fear of the impending whip of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> over <hi>Plato,</hi> of the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> over <hi>Cicero:</hi> both of them having heard the sound of the whip laid, on <hi>Socrates</hi> before <hi>Plato</hi>'s, on <hi>Varro</hi>'s back before <hi>Cicero</hi>'s face: for that <hi>Roman Socrates</hi> (for opening too wide, and not running with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cry) had been soundly lasht by the then great Hunter the <hi>Roman Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> having his Person proscribed, his Library rifled, and his Books burnt, as disfavouring the Religion of that State; yet for all this <hi>Tully</hi> sets this Royal Game, and gives the World notice (as it were by wagging his tail when he durst not open his mouth) where it was squatted, against the Apostles should come with their Net.</p>
               <p>Then lived the Learned <hi>Cratippus,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero,</hi> in the Proem to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, stiles the Prince of Modern Philosophers: but, his commending his Son to his Nurture, was a commendation of him, in fact, beyond all the streins, even of his, Rhetorick.</p>
               <p>Then lived <hi>Virgil;</hi> of whom <hi>Vettius (in Macrob. Saturn. 1. 24.)

               </p>
               <p>Then lived that miracle of humane Divines, <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher, the Glory of the Heathen, the shame of the modern Christian World; who gave the greatest experiment of the power of Stoicism, that ever man did, in his rooting the sentiments of a Deity, and, with them, Morality, so deep in that most barren heart of <hi>Nero,</hi> as those Seeds sown there by him flourish'd, and bore excellent fruit for the first five years of his Reign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in spite of the natural dyscrasie of that Monster, and the temptations to an earlier Apostasie, which an absolute Sovereignty laid before him. <hi>(Vid. Tacit. an.</hi> 15.) And who was himself as much a Philosopher in the inward of his Soul, as in the outward habit of his Beard and Gown; as much a Moralist in practice, as contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and precept: As the great Humanist of <hi>France</hi> the Lord <hi>Nountaigne (Essayes l. 1. c.</hi> 32.) hath more than Essay'd to vindicate him to have been, against <hi>Dion</hi>'s calumniations; <hi>(Xiphil. è Dione. Nero. pag.</hi> 519.) grounded upon <hi>Tigellinus</hi> and his parties reports; whom to have his enemies and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers was <hi>Seneca</hi>'s honour: <hi>Tigellinus</hi> being a person of so filthy and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating a tongue, as <hi>Dion</hi> himself (but <hi>three pages before</hi> he condemns <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> upon the suggestions of <hi>Tigellinus)</hi> commends that sarcastical Apothegm
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43715:27"/>
(as he calls it) of <hi>Pythia</hi> against him: who when she was urged by him to accuse her Lady <hi>Octavia Augusta</hi> of dishonesty, spate in his face, and said, <hi>The privities of my Lady,</hi> Tigellinus, <hi>are more clean than thy mouth.</hi> As himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, in his discourse with <hi>Nero,</hi> after he was grown the object of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellinus</hi>'s envy, for his wealth, and of <hi>Nero</hi>'s hatred, for the freedom he used in rebuking him; than whom, no man better knew (as he told <hi>Granius Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loanus)</hi> how far <hi>Seneca</hi>'s genius was averse to flattery, or how much his brave spirit was elevated above love to the world, or fear of death. And in his conference with his Wife betwixt his condemnation and death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he recommended to her (who was most privy to what he was at home with himself) the remembrance of his vertuous life (in those actions of it wherein there had been least personating) as the best expedient against her immoderate sorrow for his departure. And lastly, as the ancient Fathers of our Church implyed, in their opinion, that he had familiar converse with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> conceiving it scarce possible, that he could, in Life and Doctrine, hit so right upon the sence of Evangelical precepts without some such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</p>
               <p>Then lived <hi>Thrasea,</hi> that <hi>Martyr</hi> (under <hi>Nero)</hi> for Natural Theology, whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls the light of the Roman world, and thus prefaceth his Story: <hi>At last</hi> Nero <hi>covets to extirpate vertue it self, in putting</hi> Thrasea <hi>to death: having no other cause of displeasure against him, but his going out of the Senate, as refusing to give his Vote for the condemnation of</hi> Agrippina, <hi>upon the barbarous motion of her unnatural Son; and his not appearing at those Funeral Solemnities wherein Divine Honours were conferr'd upon that Court Drabb</hi> Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paea. A person of that Divine presence and discourse, as his friends were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he would have thunder-struck the Senate and <hi>Nero</hi> himself, if they could have perswaded him to have stooped so far from the contempt of death, as to plead for his life, and make his defence. In which point, through his belief of the Souls immortality (of which he was discoursing with <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Philosopher at that instant) he was of so well a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed mind, as he did not so much as change countenance, (except it were to a more chearful aspect) at the news of his condemnation. <hi>(Tacit. l. 15.) [Illic à Quaestore reperitur laetitiae propior.]</hi> And while his life was breathing out at the veins of both his arms, he spent not his breath in effeminate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, but in discourses upon that endless life to which he assur'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he was hasting; and calling the Questor who was sent to see his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Look here</hi> (saith he) <hi>young man, we are pouring out this offerings (Jovi liberatori) to God Redeemer. I pray God divert the Omen, but verily thou liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in such times, as it's very behoofeful to get thy mind fortified against all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral evil, by such examples of constancy,</hi> as thou seest me <hi>set before thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. But I go about to number the Stars, in attempting to reckon up all the Philosophers then flourishing, when the Christian Philosophy was first commended to the world: I will therefore cease the further prosecution of that point, and glance at their <hi>Dogmata,</hi> the Divine Axioms they deliver'd, touching Divination by Auguries, and prophetical Theology; where that I may avoid tedious repetitions I shall in a manner confine my self to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the opinions of others, <hi>Tully,</hi> who though himself an Augur, not only derides Divination by Birds, by Dreams, by Oracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but evinceth the vanity of them by <hi>Chrysippus</hi> his reasons, affirming, in general, that they are the productions of superstition, which dispersed through the Nations of the world, taking occasion from humane imbecillity, had almost opprest all mens minds, and tyrannized over them. <hi>[Ut verè loquamur, superstitio fusa per gentes, oppressit omnium ferè animos, atque hominum imbecillitatem occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.] de Divinat. l. 2. pag.</hi> 265.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In particular he explodes Divination by Dreams from several instances: Of one that, being to run in the Olympick Games, dreamed he saw himself over-night carried in a Charriot drawn with four horses; which one interprets
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43715:27"/>
to signifie that he should win the prize, because of the horses swiftness: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that he should lose it, because he had seen four swift Creatures before himself. Of another, who dreamt he saw an Eagle; That portends thou shalt win (quoth one Augur) for that's the swiftest bird: Thou shalt lose (saith another) for the Eagle pursueth all other birds, and is her self pursued by none, therefore she's alwayes hindmost. <hi>[Quae est ista ars conjectoris elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis ingenio? an quicquam significant, nisi acumen hominum ex similitudine ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua conjecturam modò huc, modò illuc ducentium?]</hi> Pag. 2. 64. <hi>What is this else but the Art of a Guesser wittily shifting off his want of wit? What do those interpretations signifie, but mens quickness of wit, from some resemblance or other drawing their conjecture sometimes this way, sometimes that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Divination by Oracles he derides, as fasten'd by impostures upon thë Divine Spirits motions: <hi>[Id certe magis est attenti animi quàm furentis: hoc scriptoris est non furentis, adhibentis diligentiam, non insani.]</hi> Pag. 251. When their being, most-what, given in Verse speaks them to be the result of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane industry: And their ambiguity fathers them upon persons providing for saving their own credit, let come what will. <hi>[Partim falsis, partim casu ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, (ut fit in omni oratione saepissimè) partim flexiloquis &amp; obscuris, ut interpres egeat interprete, &amp; ipsa sors referenda sit ad sortes; partim ambiguis, &amp;c.]</hi> p. 252. <hi>They being sometimes false, sometimes true by chance (as it frequently falls out in all kind of discourse) sometimes so equivocal and obscure as the Interpreter needs an Interpreter, and the Question what is the meaning of the Respond is harder to answer than the question which was put to the Oracle; and sometimes so ambiguous, &amp;c.</hi> Such as that which <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports <hi>Apollo</hi> to have given to <hi>Craesus,</hi>

                  </q>
which Oracle would have proved true, whatever had betided <hi>Craesus</hi> in that expedition; whether, (as he interpreted it) he had made spoyl of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or (as it fell out) of his own wealth: But what reason have I (saith <hi>Tully)</hi> to believe that <hi>Apollo</hi> did give this Respond, or to deem <hi>Herodotus</hi> to make a truer report of <hi>Craesus,</hi> than <hi>Ennius</hi> did of <hi>Pyrrhus:</hi> for what man living can think that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> received from <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracle this Respond?

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For first, <hi>Apollo</hi> never spoke Latine; secondly, the Greek Writers make no mention of this Respond; thirdly, before <hi>Pyrrbus</hi> his time <hi>Apollo</hi> had given over versifying; and lastly, though <hi>Aeacus</hi> his Progeny were a stolid Generation, that acted by main strength, not by policy, being <hi>belli-potents</hi> not <hi>sapienti-potents;</hi>

yet they could not be so thick-scull'd but to understand that this Verse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised no more to them than to the Romans; that amphibolie which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Craesus</hi> might have deceiv'd <hi>Chrysippus;</hi> but this not <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself. This affected obscurity of Oracles <hi>Macrobius</hi> complains of <hi>(in som. Scipion. 1. 1.) [qualis solet in divinationibus esse affectata confusio?] How great an affected confusion useth to be in divinations?</hi> And touching Oracles that prove true by chance, <hi>Cicero</hi> alledgeth this Example among others; <hi>The Water-man in</hi> Copponius'<hi>s Fleet foretold indeed such things as fell out: but that was no more than we all fear'd; only, what wisdom taught us to hide, the extremity of it forc'd him to reveal his fear.—I appeal to the Gods and Men, to say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis more likely, that the Gods should communicate their Counsels to that</hi>

half-witted Seaman, or to some of us who were present at the same time, in the same Fleet, such as <hi>Cato, Varro</hi> and <hi>Copponius</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>But (which is chiefly to be considered here) if our Ancestors have not imposed Fables upon us touching these Oracles, how come they to be ceast, not only now, but a long time ago, so as nothing can be more contemptible than <hi>Delphos</hi> is at present? <hi>saith</hi> Tully (in the place forequoted.)—[Sed, quod caput est, cur isto modo jam Oracula <hi>Delphis</hi> non eduntur; non modo nostrâ aetate sed jam diu, jam ut nihil possit esse contemptius?] They that say the vertue of that place, whence those breathings issued, that impregnated the mind of the Prophetess, are decay'd through age, speak as if they were discoursing of Wine or Pickles; such things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in time will grow insipid: but what length of time can wear out Divine Power? and what more Divine than such breathing from the ground, as makes the mind foresee things to come, and enables it to compose in Verse its praecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions? But when did <hi>Delphos</hi> lose this Vertue? not till men began to be less credulous of old wives tales, and to ponderate the unlikelihood of such stories. It is almost 300 years ago since <hi>Demosthenes</hi> said <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Priestess did <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pize:</hi> as much in effect as if he had said, <hi>Philip</hi> had corrupted the Oracle, and put words into the Prophetesses mouth. Whence we have reason to suspect, that in the rest of the Delphick Responds there was jugling, <hi>as</hi> Cicero <hi>argues; and upon these considerations he grounds this resolution:</hi> [Nec ego Publicio ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scio cui, nec Martiis vatibus, nec Apollinis opertis credendum existimo, quorum par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim ficta apertè, partim effutita temerè, nunquam nè mediocri quidem cuiquam, non modò prudenti probata sunt. I think we ought not to believe either I know not what <hi>Publicius,</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> his Prophets, or <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Ridles, whereof some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparently feigned, others rashly blabbed out, were never approved of by any, not only prudent but moderate person.] But I know not how, those superstitious, and almost fanatick Philosophers, had rather have any thing be, than themselves wise; they had rather think that Prophetick breath to have breath'd out its last (which if ever it was in being would have ever been, as Divine and not expirable) than not believe things incredible.

Gracchus</hi> imported no more to him or his Wife, than a pair of Mice there found: and though upon his letting the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male escape, <hi>Gracchus</hi> died; his death must be imputed to the sharpness of his disease, not to the emission of the Serpent, any more than <hi>Troy</hi>'s endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Ten years war is chargeable upon <hi>Calchas</hi> his nest of Sparrows, and not rather the valour of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and dissensions of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> Or <hi>Silla</hi> his victory, to the Serpent appearing on the Altar as he was a sacrificing, and not rather his own wise managing of that Battel. The Ants carrying grains of Wheat into <hi>Midas</hi> his mouth, and the Bees sitting on <hi>Plato</hi>'s lips (when they lay in their cradles) may perhaps be meer fictions; but be they true, the predictions made upon them were only witty conjectures, and the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their fortunes accordingly was fortuitous. As to <hi>Roscius,</hi> the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be false; but if it be true, that he was in the Cradle swathed about with a Snake, this is not to be wonder'd at, especially in his birth-place, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonium,</hi> where Snakes usually crawl about the harth: but rather the Respond that was given upon it, that <hi>Roscius</hi> would be a most noble and famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For to me it seems a wonder, that the immortal Gods should portend the future famousness of a Stage-Player, and not of <hi>Scipio Africanus.</hi> What if <hi>Flaminius</hi> his Horse trip and cast his Rider, is this a strange thing? What if the Ensign-bearer cannot pluck up his colours? may be he stuck them down with a better will than he plucks them out. Needed <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Horse a divine inspiration to move him to swim out of the River; or the Bees to fasten on his Main? If the <hi>Spartans</hi> hear the clashing of Armour in <hi>Hercules</hi> his Temple, and if his Temple doors at <hi>Thebes</hi> open of their own accord, or the Shields there hung up be found fall'n down and lying on the ground, why should we look on those things as the effects of special and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence? The setting of the golden Stars of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> at <hi>Delphos</hi> so as they never appear'd again, argues they fell into some Thieves pocket: But that the Greek Historians should write, that there never befell to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> a greater Prodigy, than an Apes overturning <hi>Dodona</hi>'s Urn, and scattering the Lots deposited in it, I again and again wonder at, far more than at that busie creatures spilling a Pot full of Lots.</p>
               <p>This was the then School-doctrine concerning Divinations: Whatever Antiquity had propounded touching that subject, that Age made no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, if it would not abide the test of Reason. Would it not then have been prodigious madness for the Apostles to have attempted to impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Age with the Evangelical History, wherein there is so frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dreams, Visions, Responds from Heaven, and Prodigies, as unlikely in their own nature, as most of those against which <hi>Cicero</hi> makes exception? Could they think that that Age, whose proud reason exalted it self above and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43715:29"/>
against the Authority of their own Annals, publick Records, and the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Tradition of their Forefathers; would stoop to the Authority of a company of poor Fishermen, in things more above the sphere of reason than those things were they had rejected, though backt with so great Authority, meerly because they could not apprehend the reason of them? What hope could they have that the disputers of this world (termed so <hi>signanter</hi> by our Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.) who would thus exactly weigh and tell money after their Father, would let the Apostolical Shekle pass as currant without bringing it to the Tally? That the inquisitive disceptators of this Age (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) who with their altercation and <hi>Ergo</hi>'s had turn'd out of their Creed the <hi>Amen</hi> of their Progenitors; would at the perswasion of illiterate persons, turn their <hi>Ergo</hi> into <hi>Amen</hi> to the Evangelical Philosopher? Durst the most learned of them St. <hi>Paul</hi> have challenged them to a dispute, with a <hi>Where is the disputer of this Age,</hi> had he not been well assured that he spake, that wisdom, and by that spirit, which none of them were able to resist? that Evangelical Prophecies, Divination, Oracles, Dreams, Visions, and Prodigies moved in a region above those blasts that had scatter'd all other such like things pretending to Divinity?</p>
               <p>§ 3. The Divine Sentences we read in the former Section are found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Porch of Philosophical Divinity: for Divination is no otherwise reducible to Divinity than as the Proem to the Discourse, as the portal to the house: we will in this repeat the Sermons <hi>ad Clerum</hi> that were preacht in the Church, take Notes of the Doctrine of the Schools that had Divinity for its Text, when it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to confound the wisdom of the prudent. In which juncture I find the whole body of Eminent Philosophers, (however Sceptical in most, and jarring in many) yet with one mouth consenting in this point, that, of all kinds of Theology, the Poetical and Fabulous is most destructive and dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Tusculan Questions, <hi>(Lib. 2.)</hi> speaking of this kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, calls those points he there mentions, the fictions of <hi>Homer,</hi> shaping God after the pattern of man; of which kind of Divinity he saith, <hi>[I thought, then when I wrote those Books, and am of the same opinion still, that I cannot do my self or friends a greater courtesie, than if I wholly eradicate and throw down to the lowest stone the foundations of it; (de Divinat. lib. 2. pag. 265.)</hi> In his <hi>de Natura Deorum, (lib 2.)</hi> he introduceth <hi>Lucillius Balbus</hi> thus discoursing. <hi>[Seest thou not how from natural things happily and profitably invented, Reason hath been forc'd aside</hi> (equivalent <hi>to</hi> St. Pauls <hi>[becoming vain in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)] to counterseit and feigned Deities? which thing hath produc'd false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, turbulent Errours, and most doting Superstitions. The Shapes, Ages, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, Ornaments, Off-springs, Marriages, Kindreds of the Gods are all drawn after the Copy of humane infirmity. Yea, the Gods are presented to us as men subject to passions of mind: We hear the Poets discoursing of their Lusts, Anger, Envy, Sickness, &amp;c. which things to believe or affirm of God is a thing full of vain and extreme folly and levity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his Book against Superstition, quoted by St. <hi>Austin, (de Civit. 6. 10.)</hi> but not extant (except some diligent hand have of late retriev'd it from the mothes) does boldly, copiously, and vehemently inveigh against Theatrick Divinity; affirming that the world, through Poetical delusions, worships them for Gods, who if they should animate, (and appear to men in) those Images in which they were worshipt, would be thought monsters. <hi>[Numina vocant, quae si spiritu accepto occurrerent, monstra haberentur.]</hi> Dost thou think (so <hi>Tully</hi> proceeds) the dreams of <hi>Titus Tacitus,</hi> of <hi>Romulus,</hi> of <hi>Hostilius</hi> ever a whit more true than Poetical Fables, or any thing more lewd than these? How they came to put their Gods into such monstrous shapes, <hi>Hyginus</hi> informs us <hi>(in his Poetick Astronomy tit. Sagittarius.)—[Ita Jovem fecisse, ut cùm omnia illius artificia uno corpore vellet significare, crura ejus equina fixisse, quòd equo multum sit usus; &amp; sagittas adjunxit, ut ex his, &amp; acumen, &amp;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43715:30"/>

               <p>But <hi>Tully</hi> is no where more unmannerly and sawcy with the Poetical Gods, than in his Morals, where forgetting the gravity of a Stoick, he pours out such like Sarcasms as these upon the Poetical <hi>Jove:</hi> Seeing <hi>Jupiter</hi> is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Poets pencil to have been so exceeding salacious, why does he not yet beget Children if he be alive? hath age gelt him? the Law of <hi>Papias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd him? or hath he obtain'd the priviledge of three Sons?</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Scaevola</hi>'s Doctrine, touching this point, St. <hi>Austin (de Civit.</hi> 4. 27.) giveth this account; That he maintain'd the Poetical stories of the Gods to be nugatory and trifling, feigning many things of them unworthy of them: making one a Thief, another a Murderer, another an Adulterer, Incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varro</hi>'s Assertion was (as the same Father <hi>(de Civit.</hi> 6. 15.) reports it) that in fabulous Divinity there are many things, not only contrary to the dignity and nature of God, but such as cannot, without great opprobrie and absurdity, be affirmed of the most debaucht and despicable man.</p>
               <p>I shall have occasion afterward of reassuming this point, and introducing more Testimonies: I will therefore let <hi>Cicero</hi> who spake first speak last; who writes to <hi>Atticus</hi> (his great familiar, and therefore this he spake under the Rose) that he would give his Daughter <hi>Livia</hi> that vertuous Education, as (if the world understood what he did) she should be worshipt as a Goddess, rather than either <hi>Juno</hi> or <hi>Minerva:</hi> for she is not (saith he) in any laudable thing inferiour to the best of the Poetical Goddesses. The greatest part of his third Book <hi>de Nat. Deorum,</hi> he spends in exploding the Stoical and Poetical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; <hi>If the Planets must therefore be concluded Deities, because of their regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion; let's take Tertian and Quartan Agues into the number of Gods. If</hi> Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Neptune <hi>be Gods, are not their Brethren so too;</hi> Orcus, Acheron, Cocytus, Styx, Phlegeton, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> why, next, are not <hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Cerberus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Gods? <hi>Nostri quidem Publicani, cùm essent agri in Boeotia deorum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalium excepti lege Censoriâ, negabant immortales esse ullos, qui aliquandò homines fuissent: Our Sequestrators, when the Law of the Censors had excepted the Lands in</hi> Boeotia <hi>belonging to the immortal Gods, would find no such lands; alledging that the Deities there having been once mortal men, could never turn into immortal Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, though <hi>Socrates</hi> his death over-awed those in whose memories the fate of that Philosophical-proto-Martyr was fresh, yet length of time having pretty well digested that cold flegm and crude fear, which <hi>Socrates</hi> his Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite had bred in former Ages; the whole company of the then modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers (except <hi>Epicurus</hi> his herd of Hogs) began, about our Saviours time, to prick up their bristles, and proclaim their dislike of that fabulous Divinity, that had in former times obtain'd credit in the world.</p>
               <p>In which Age, thus well secured from seduction by the most plaufible and insinuating fables, for the Apostles to assault the world with naked and plain stories, of one <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> King of the <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> and of things as much exceeding humane belief, as any the most unlikely fictions of the vainest Poets, would have been the most sottish attempt that ever was undertaken by the most insensate changelings, had not the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers been themselves throughly perswaded of the truth of those unlikely stories, and perfectly instructed with a power to demonstrate the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to others.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s disputing at <hi>Athens</hi> (the great Mart of Learning) concerning the Living God, his offering to prove to the Philosophers face, that <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is that God, by a bare telling (by babling over as they at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it) the History of Christ, had been ground enough for <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s charge, <hi>[Paul, thou art beside thy self,]</hi> if his own consciousness to its truth, and the irrefragable demonstrableness thereof to others, by Gods Hand and Seal set
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43715:30"/>
to it, had not animated him to that attempt. Could that chosen vessel hope to vend his commodities, had they been adulterate, among such cunning Merchants; his Gemms, had they been but <hi>Bristol-</hi>stones, among such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lapidaries? Would he have shown his Treasures of Wisdom to an Age so inquisitive, and so happy in its inquest, after Wisdom, had they not been such as would abide the severest scrutiny, even of them that had tryed all former stuffs of the same nature, in appearance, and exploded them as spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; of them, whom the authority of <hi>Homer,</hi> the antiquity of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> the reverence of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or the fear of Municipal Laws could not impose silence upon, when they saw the world imposed upon in matters of Religion by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular fictions? The light of Natural Knowledge, even in Divine things, had never shone brighter, neither had the windows of mens minds been ever set more wide open receive in the beams thereof, than when the Gospel was first exposed to the world: Had not therefore this Eaglet been the genuine Off-spring of supernatural light, it would not have ventur'd to out-face this noon-day-sun of Natural Knowlege. For that which we read <hi>[in them hath he set a Tabernacle for the Sun]</hi> the Ancients read <hi>[posuit in sole Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculum]</hi> he hath set his Tabernacle in the Sun; and some of them expound it to be a Prophecy of the Apostles publishing the Gospel (the summ whereof is the Tabernacling of God in man) in the clearest day of Humane Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that had till then shined out upon the world; or, as the Prophet para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraseth, when men should run to and fro, as dissatisfied with former science falsly so call'd, and by that disquisition and canvassing of old traditions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in Knowledge. Christ did not shuffle in his Doctrine in the dark, but produc'd it, when all kind of Humane Literature was improved to that Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antick stature, as none before that, reached to; and whoever since have stood Candidates for the repute of excellent Humanists, have not by a general vote obtain'd the honour they stood for, except they have been found imitators or emulators of that Age. Among Poets, he bears away the Laurel, even at this day, as the best Lyrick, Heroick, Satyrist, Comick, Tragick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who approacheth nearest those that then flourish'd, <hi>Horace, Virgil, Ovid, Juvenal, Terence, Seneca, &amp;c.</hi> Among Orators he hath the general applause, that shoots nearest the mark which <hi>Pliny</hi> set himself; who was so far from taking as an opprobrie what <hi>M. Regulus</hi> objected against him, that he was <hi>Tully</hi>'s Ape, as he gloried in his being esteem'd an emulator of so unparallel'd a precedent, protesting that the eloquence of his own Age was too low a lure for him to fly at, <hi>(Plin. secund. lib. 1. ep.</hi> 5.) Among Politicians he's reputed the craftiest that most resembles <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he the solidest that writes best after the copy of <hi>Augustus.</hi> Among Patriots, <hi>Cato</hi>'s, among Historians and Martialists, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s transcripts, are the only men of account, in our modern Calculations of mens deserts. As for Divine Philosophy the Platonick, which attain'd to its full growth about our Saviours time <hi>(Aristotle</hi> being then, and many hundred years after, scarce taken notice of, till (in the Reign of <hi>Severus) Aphrodisaeus</hi> brought him into credit) hath ever been in St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s judgement <hi>(de Civit. 8. 4.)—[non quidem immeritò excellentissimâ gloriâ claruit]</hi> of best esteem, and such as all other Sects must strike top-sail to in those Seas. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, justly carries away the name of <hi>Daemon</hi> (for his universal insight into all things) yet he must yield to <hi>Plato</hi> the title of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for his surpassing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in things Divine. Now it was against the Sun of Platonick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, shining out in his greatest splendour, that the Primitive Church held up the Gospel. It was in this Galaxie they shed the milk of the Word; had it therefore not been sincere, the whiteness of this milky way would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed the adulterate mixture. This observation <hi>Tertullian</hi> urgeth to the Gentiles in his Apology, <hi>(Apolog. 21. cap.)—[Christus non rapaces, &amp; feros ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc homines multitudine tot Numinum demerendorum attonitos efficiendo, ad humanitatem temperavit, ut</hi> Numa; <hi>sed jam expolitos, &amp; ipsae urbanitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptos in agnitionem veritatis oculavit.] Christ did not temper to humanity wild and savage men, by amazing them with a multitude of Deities, whose favour
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43715:31"/>
must be purchast as</hi> Numa <hi>did: but gave the faculty and means of seeing the true Religion to those that were already polisht, and deceiv'd with Urbanity it self:</hi> (Let me add) with Religion it self, and that Religion abetted by the greatest Champions that ever appear'd in its defence. What would Christ's squadron of Fishers have been in the hands of such <hi>Goliahs,</hi> had they not been the Army of the living God?</p>
               <p>§ 4. The world, in respect of its sentiments touching Religion, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured within another wall, a fourth defence against surprisal, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel made an on-set upon it, enough to have sunk the assaylants spirits into a despondency of obtaining the victory, had not that brazen wall, of their being not couscious to themselves of having any base design upon it, been their Royal Mount, and the Lord of Hosts their Leader: nothing less than this could have animated them to attempt, to impose a new, which the Learned party were so much prejudic'd against (as has already been shewed) and wrest the old Civick Religion out of its hands; at that time, when the vulgar through the sly insinuations of the Politicians had as great, if not hotter, zeal for it than ever: As is apparent, from the most illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Philosophers providing salvo's, for the securing the grandeur of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick Devotions, and the then establisht Religion, against the side-blows them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves seem'd to give it, in their commending of Natural, and decrying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Theology: though they quitted their hands of this (indeed impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) undertaking so awkly, joyn'd the Asses head of these salvo's to the Lions body of their preceding discourse, so unhandsomly, and thereby made the parts so incongruous, discoherent, inconsequent, nay, contradictory to one another, as they could not have devised, how to have more openly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the diligent Reader, that they set these pack-sadles upon the backs of their generous Palfreys, not for the ease or satisfaction of their own, but to gratifie the deluded consciences of the rabble, (who by this means might ride a cock-horse without galling in that most tender part (which they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Conscience) which their sharp-backt reasoning of fabulous Divinity into contempt, would otherwise have gall'd) and to make their own peace with the State, for paring its Religion too near the quick. These were the weights St. <hi>Austin</hi> observ'd to hang at the lines end, and pull the soaring <hi>Varro</hi> down again, when he was upon the wing, and flying aloft in pursuite of the Poets Fables, with as opprobrious language as ever came out of that grave mans mouth; <hi>Vide Aug. (de Civit. lib. 6. cap. 4. 5. 2.)—[Hic certè ubi potuit, ubi ausus est, ubi impunitum putavit, sine caligine ullius ambiguitatis expressit—Quid existimare debemus, nisi hominem acerrimum ac peritissimum—oppressum fuisse suae Civitatis consuetudine a clegibus?] Here indeed where he might, where he durst, where he thought his liberty of speech not punishable, he declares his mind without the darkness of the least ambiguity.—And when we hear him plead for that in our Temples, which he had condemn'd in our Poets, what can we deem but that this sharp-sighted, and most skilful Divine was opprest with the custome and laws of the City?</hi> This was it which clipt the tongue of <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he was hotly declaiming against Divinations, and made him eat his words, and seemingly to cross out all he had writ, with such dashes of his pen as these <hi>(de Divinat. lib. 2. 217.)—Quam ego Reipublicae causa communisque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis colendam censeo] As vain as it is, it ought to be retain'd for the sake of the Republick and Vulgar Religion.</hi> Again, <hi>[retinetur autem &amp; ad opinionem vulgi, &amp; ad magnas utilitates Reipublicae]—(de Divin. 2. 235.) Though in this Antiquity err'd, yet this errour is to be retain'd, to keep up in the vulgar an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Religion, and for the benefits that thence accrew to the Common-wealth. And therefore</hi> P. Claudius, <hi>and</hi> L. Junius, <hi>for sailing contrary to the Omens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, are worthy of the punishment they underwent; for they ought to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Rules of our Religion, and not with that contumacy have sleighted the manner of the Countrey: Tamen postea Reipublicae causa retentam, &amp;c. (Id.</hi> 237.) To conclude these Quotations with what he concludes his Treatise of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43715:31"/>
                  <hi>[Nec verò (id enim diligenter intelligi volo) Superstitione tollendâ reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio tollitur; nam et Majorum instituta tueri sacris, ceremoniisque retinendis, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis est.] Neither is Religion destroy'd in rooting out Superstition, (I would have you mark that diligently) for it is the part of a wise man, to maintain the institutions of our fore-fathers, in retaining sacred Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> Did ever words coming out of one mans mouth, at one breath, blow hot and cold, as these do.

               <p>This made <hi>Porphyry</hi> fetch so many doubles before he squatted down on his seat, before he came to a full point, in that discourse of his touching Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: one while affirming that all bloody Sacrifices are the food of evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and to be abstained from by wise Men. <hi>(Porph. de Sacrif. l. 1. 315.) [vir igitur prudens atque temperans cavebit ejusmodi sacrificiis uti.]</hi> And yet with the same breath making it necessary for Cities to make evil Spirits propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to them, by such sacrifices, hereby tying them (as it were by the teeth) not only from doing them mischief but to do them good. <hi>[Civitatibus fortè necessarium hos daemones conciliare.] (Id pag.</hi> 316.) Of which kind of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he had, in the precedent page, past this doom, that they never do good. <hi>Absurdissima opinio vel à bonis mala, vel à malis bona contingere posse, p. 312. firmiter credendum, neque bonum unquam laedere, neque prodesse malum daemonem; non enim caloris est ut inquit</hi> Plato <hi>frige-facere. (pag. 314.) It is a most absurd opinion that either bad can come from good Spirits, or good from bad: we must therefore firmly believe that a good spirit never hurts, that an evil spirit never profits any man; for it is impossible that heat should make cold, saith</hi> Plato. And that their malicious and libidinous natures are not tamed or allayed, but fed, and made more fierce by such oblations. <hi>[His pinguescere solet; vivit namque vaporibus &amp; fumigationibus &amp; nidore sanguinis, &amp; carnium vires assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.] (pag.</hi> 315) And yet at last granting a liberty, nay imposing a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity upon his wise man, to do as the vulgar do; that is, with bloody sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to cokes impure Spirits: (and this by the authority of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> and consent of Pagan Divines, and example of Philosophers,) and to mitigate their malignity by Sacrifices, Prayers and oblations: to which, saith he, as we partake of the common nature, we must be compell'd in order to the sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our bodies and estates from the destructive effects of their anger. <hi>[Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de meritò compellemur improbam potestatem demulcere.] Porph. de sacrificiis l.</hi> 2. 316.</p>
               <p>The freedom of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s speech in his book of Superstition, is such as he reprehends the Urban Religion more copiously than <hi>Varro</hi> did the theatrick and fabulous, saith St. <hi>Austin (de civit.</hi> 6. 10.) And so vehemently that the sharpest taunts, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> gave the civick worship, were not comparable to those bitter declamations of <hi>Seneca</hi> against it; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> himself testifies to the Gentiles face in his <hi>Apology (cap. 12.)

might not seem negatively superstitious to the world; he thinks with the wise, but walks with the crowd: and in the temple does what he sees others do; conforming himself to the Laws and Customs of the City, in the outward act; keeping his Philosophy to himself in the inward man.</hi> And seasoning his precedent reproofs of the madness of the Urban Religion, (that his Citizens might better relish both writing and writer) with these grains of Salt sprinkled upon them: <hi>[Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens servabit tamen haec omnia tanquam legibus jussa non tanquam diis grata.] Yet a wise man must observe all these things, as commanded by the Laws, not as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Gods.</hi> Than which Aphorism (bating his notion of more Gods than one) applyed to indifferent Rites, never any thing was uttered either of more truth, or more tending to peace: for the wisdom from above teacheth us to keep our faith to our selves; and in our external actions, conform to the Laws, where they enjoyn nothing that the supreme Law hath prohibited. But as he applies it, it is the most unsavoury expression that ever fell from his pen: for thus he proceeds. <hi>[Omnem istam ignobilem eorum turbam, quam lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go aevo longa superstitio congessit, sic adorabimus ut meminerimus cultum ejus magis ad morem quàm ad rem pertinere.] We should so adore this whole rascal company of these Gods, which ancient Superstition in a long tract of time hath scraped up on an heap, as to bear in mind that the worship of this crew be ascribed to custom ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be thought pertinent to true devotion.</hi> So heavy did the Vulgars dotage and the sanction of the Laws lie upon the loins of these most strong sinewed Philosophers, as it made them bend under it; one part of the discourse upon this subject <hi>interfere with another, and their life differ from their doctrine.</hi>

               <p>§ 5. 2. But this does only consequentially imply the common peoples, and the commanding parties zeal to the then establish'd Superstition. <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius maximus</hi> speaks it out directly in words at length, and not in figures; who writing to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> makes this use of all the stories he produceth of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the Religion of those times; that whatsoever mischiefs befel them or their posterity, though many Ages after the decease of the Promeritors, were inflicted upon them in revenge of that contempt.</p>
               <p>If the Army under <hi>Varro</hi> miscarry at <hi>Cannae,</hi> it is because he had not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the <hi>Circean</hi> Festivities with due Ceremonies <hi>(l. 1. cap. 2.

If the once noble family of the <hi>Potitii</hi> fall into decay, if thirty Youths of that house dye all within the compass of one year, 'tis because <hi>Appius Censor</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that Priestly Function, which Originally belonged to the <hi>Potitii,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a sordid abstract, thinking that office to be too mean for that then flourishing Family. If <hi>Turullius Antonie</hi>'s Lieutenant cut down the sacred Grove about <hi>Aesculapius</hi>'s Temple, and <hi>Caesar</hi> in that place discomfeit his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that is interpreted a divine revenge taken upon the delinquent and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient used by that reputed God, to vindicate his own honour and regain a greater veneration. If, on the other hand, the Roman affairs be more under the eye of indulgent Providence, than the concerns of any other people, 'tis in reward of their scrupulous care, and cautious observance of the least punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios in matters of Religion. If <hi>Posthumius</hi> have good success in the <hi>Affrican</hi> wars, he may thank <hi>Mitellus</hi> the Pontiff, who would not permit him to budg one foot out of the City, till he had obliged the God of War, by solemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to be on his side: and his own religious obsquiousness, in submitting the Fasces to the Mitre. Innumerable such instances might be produc'd, but what more can be required to demonstrate the devotedness of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his reign to the received Religion than that which this Author gives upon occasion of mentioning <hi>L. Furius Bibaculus,</hi> who, being <hi>Praetor,</hi> (notwithstanding that the privilege of his place exempted him from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that office,) at the command of his Father, (who was one of the Colledge of the <hi>Salii)</hi> condescended to go in procession, bearing the sacred <hi>Ancile</hi> before his father, with his six Mace-bearers before himself. Upon which story <hi>Valerius</hi> hath this note: Our City hath ever deem'd that all things ought to be set after Religion: wherefore the greatest Generals have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed

to officiate Divine Service, thinking they should then best manage Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs, when they did well and constantly serve the Divine Power. Hence <hi>Lucilius (in Ciceron. de nat. Deor. lib.</hi> 2.) [Pub. Claudii <hi>temeritas, qui etiam per jocum deos irridens &amp;c.] imputes</hi> P.

               </p>
               <p>In this posture lay the World, at the dawning of the day of the Gospel. enjoying it self in the warm and close embraces of her <hi>Sacred Animals,</hi> her Statues, into which were charm'd the Spirit of the holy Gods, as the <hi>Amora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> thought: and those thoughts so fixed, as, though the World knew they were <hi>Venuses</hi> of its own carving; and had explicite reasonings with its self answerable to those in the Prophet <hi>(Is.</hi> 44.) yet so had the veneration of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, the commonness of Custom lull'd it into a Lethean forgetfulness of its own handy-work, as the perswasion that they were Gods indeed, and that to their Religious Observances they were indebted; for all the benefits were powred down upon them, could not be eradicated by the closest and most convincing Arguments. The conceit, that they had found the Lips of those Statues warm, in propitious responds; their bosoms soft in gracious returns to their votaries; that they had felt the beating of their Pulses, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared liking or disliking of Persons and Actions proportionable to the Worlds Genius; had so far prevail'd with this Pigmalion, as his knowledge of the contrary is cast into a dead sleep, while he is entertaining himself with these pleasing dreams.</p>
               <p>Now had the Apostle attempted to interrupt the world, in those fancied enjoyments with fancies, had they instead of those <hi>Sacred Animals,</hi> thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bed a dead Image, or a Pillow stufft with Hair; what could they have expected, but to have been deservedly clamour'd against, as men upbraiding the World with the imputation of more insensate Stupidity, than can possibly seise upon a Rational Soul, what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave those Gods, under whose wings I have been brooded to this perfection of honour and happiness, whose present relief I have as often found as invocated; for one that was but the other day in Clouts, and could not save himself, when he was dared to do it to his face, nor be heard, in that fervent Prayer for releif he preferr'd to him, whom he called his God and Father?</p>
               <p>What reply could they have return'd to these expostulations, had they seen no more in Christ than Man? had they not known him to be the living (as well as express Image of the living) God? to be that eternal word, which by his power bears up all things, and of power enough to bear down before him those strong men, who had got such firm possession of the house, as none (no not among the most Rational Philosophers) could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Whence</hi> Ptolemy <hi>learn'd that curse he pronounc'd upon them that should add or take from the Seventy's Translation. Whence the fiction of three days darkness, and the application of</hi> Solomon'<hi>s text, there is a time to rend. § 5. The Legend of the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en letter'd</hi> Jehova. Ptolemy <hi>might be a bad man, and yet curious in point of Learning. He was a kind of Jewish Prosylite, and as good a one as</hi> Herod, Poppaea, &amp;c. <hi>God can make bad men Instruments of good. The Fathers and Primitive Churches esteem of the Septuagint. § 6.

               <p>§ 1. THis Age wherein the Gospel was first preach'd, had (besides all those fore-mentioned guards against surprisal) the advantage of a peculiar Expedient, to try the truth of what the Apostles publish'd even at their own bar, and by their own avowed Principles; and to have proved it false, had it indeed so been, to the Apostles own faces, themselves being Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: by means of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s having procured (some hundreds of years before our Saviours incarnation) the Translation of the Old Testament into that Tongue that had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles having been lock'd up from former ages in Hebrew, a Tongue barbarous to the Western World. So that it could have no knowledge of the Contents of those Divine Writings but what was communicated, by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tradition of Jewish Teachers. From whence, notwithstanding those most famous and incomparably knowing Philosophers, that travell'd for Learning into <hi>Judaea, Aegypt,</hi> and the Countries circumjacent, gather'd such Maxims as served them, like so many straight Rules, to discover, in a great measure, the crookedness and deviations of the commonly received opinions, touching God and Nature. The first Graecian Theologists, <hi>Pherecydes, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> and <hi>Thales,</hi> are acknowledged with one mouth to have been the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Aegyptians, Chaldaeans and Hebrews (as <hi>Josephus</hi> saith, <hi>contra Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. lib.</hi> 1.) for the confirmation of which, he alledgeth the authority of <hi>Hermippus,</hi> a Pagan Historian, who <hi>(in the life of</hi> Pythagoras, <hi>lib.</hi> 1.) writes that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did translate out of the institutions of the Jews, many things into his philosophy; and <hi>Clearchus, Aristotle</hi>'s Scholar, who, <hi>in his Dialogue of the Jews,</hi> brings in his Master, confessing he had learned the best part of his knowledge of a certain Jew. The Swarm, that hived in <hi>Plato</hi>'s mouth, came from Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and was a Call of the School of the Prophets there.

The Honey which that Attick Bee made, was gathered from the Flowers of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Paradise and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s garden; of which, his Philosophy so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relisheth, as many of our ancient Christian Writers, wondering at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of his Doctrine to Christian Verity, conceived he had conference in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy:</hi> of which opinion St. <hi>Austin</hi> sometimes was, but retracted it upon the account of that light which Cronology gave him to see his error, (it being thence apparent, that <hi>Plato</hi> was born almost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years after <hi>Jeremy</hi> was dead,) and pitcheth upon this, that this busie and industrious Bee suck'd that part of his Philosophy from the lips of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter (as he did the <hi>Aegyptian)</hi> as well as he could, <hi>(de civit. 8. 11. ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus.)

               <p>But what need I urge the Authority either of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> or <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> who in his Exhortatory to the Gentiles; or <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who in his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to the Gospel: or <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who in his Books of the Affections of the Greeks, write, that <hi>Plato</hi> did translate many things into his, out of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his Books.

               <p>God, planting his word in <hi>Judaea,</hi> the Center of the habitable Earth, left all men without excuse, who by natural Sentiments, finding a Dearth at home, did not travel thither to buy Corn: so that it is not to be wondred at, that inquisitive men should come out of all Nations, and hang upon the Skirts of the Jews.</p>
               <p>But towards the rising of the Sun of Righteousness, the day Star of the Septuagint arose in the sight of the Gentile Empire: Temple light, confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self no longer to that Kingdom of Priests, diffused its beams, not faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the Crannies of verbal Tradition to a few, but in their full Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre to all through its Windows, made by this Translation as wide on the out-side as the material Temples were on the inside. So that those Scriptures of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, to which the Apostles appeal'd for the proof of what they taught, had been, for some hundreds of Years, made common to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and in every man's hand that listed to read them; by which means the World is put into a capacity to try (by that Touch-stone) of what Metal the Gospel was.

Is it possible by false transcribing, to put a cheat upon that man, that has the Original in his custody? Why? the Old Testament is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal draught of the Messiah. The Gospel pretends it self to be the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of that Original. And therefore had the Serpent intended to have cheated the World by a false Copy, he would have taken Pen in hand, before the time of the Apostles, before the Original Deed had come to its hands.</p>

                     <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s First Objection.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hermippus</hi> (in <hi>Diogenes Laertius)</hi> affirms that <hi>Demetrius Phalereus,</hi> whom <hi>Aristeus</hi> brings in as the procurer of this Translation, was so far out of favour with <hi>Ptolemy Philadelphus</hi> (for perswading his father to dis-inherit him) as in the beginning of his Reign he banish'd him: what can therefore be more improbable than the report of <hi>Aristaeus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. Should we grant to <hi>Hermippus</hi> in <hi>Diogenes,</hi> an equality of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>Aristaeus</hi> in <hi>Josephus</hi> (which to him that considers the disproportion, either of time or place betwixt <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> will seem a very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Match,) yet this would not prejudice the story of <hi>Aristaeus,</hi> as to that Circumstance the learned Critick cavils at. If we weigh what <hi>Anatolius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laodicea</hi> affirms in <hi>Eusebius; (Eus. ec. Hist.</hi> 7. 31.) where commending <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> he saith, he was one of them who were sent to translate the sacred Scripture of the Hebrews unto the gracious Princes <hi>Ptolemaeus Philadelphus</hi> and his father, <hi>(Am. Marcellinus</hi> also useth the plural number, [Ptolemaeis <hi>regibus vigiliis intentis composita.] lib.</hi> 22.) which passages, as they fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the seeming contradictions of the Fathers, in their Computations of the time of this Version (St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> placing it in the beginning of <hi>Philadelphus, Irenaeus</hi> attributing it to <hi>Ptolemy Lagi,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> questioning to whether of them it should be referred; are not adverse, but divers expressions of the same date, <hi>viz.</hi> the later end of <hi>Lagi</hi> his Reign, in the two last years whereof his Son was his Colleague.) So it clearly solves the Objection, for after <hi>Lagi</hi> his death, (possibly) <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Reign alone, might bannish <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and yet in the beginning of his Reign with his Father, be so far from discovering his displeasure against him, as to hide his grudge from his Father's apprehension (whom he could not but think would stand betwixt <hi>Demetrius</hi> and harm) he might very well put him upon that imploy about his Library, which was like enough to take up all the thoughts of so bookish a Man, and to divert them from being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about the securing of himself from that fatal stroke he intended for him as soon as his Shield was taken away, as soon as the days of mourning for his Father should come. But to put it beyond all doubt that the Translation was forwarded by <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> under <hi>Lagi. Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> states it thus, the Scriptures of the Law and Prophets were translated as men say, in the Reign of <hi>Ptolemy Lagi;</hi> or as some say, in the time of <hi>Philadelphus, (cum maximam ad eam rem contulisset diligentiam</hi> Demetrius Phalereus, <hi>&amp; ut verterentur vehementer procurasset,) after that</hi> Demetrius Phalereus <hi>had (to wit under</hi> Lagus) <hi>used a great deal of diligence towards the effecting of that thing. (Clem. Storm.</hi> 1. 110.) As if this sagacious and most learned Father had so many hundreds of Years before smelt <hi>Scaligers</hi> Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> 2. But to answer thus, from the Allegation of this Laodicean Bishop, may seem to some, to have too much of the Laodicean temper in it, to be too luke-warm a Reception of so hot a Charge, against so great an Authority, as the story of the Septuagint comes armed with: to gratifie, therefore, the just Zeal of them that are of that perswasion, let us weigh the opposed Testimonies in an equal Ballance. In one Scale we find <hi>Hermippus,</hi> in the other <hi>Aristaeus:</hi> say they yet hang in an equal poyse, <hi>(jam sumus ergo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res)</hi> I can give free lieve hitherto to suspend assent. Let then the overweight that is cast into both these Historians, cast the Scales. 1. The voucher for <hi>Hermippus</hi> is <hi>Diogenes Laertius;</hi> who about the ear of Christ 145. wrote the Lives of the heathen Philosophers: an Author of good credit and judgment, where he writes intentionally, but every occasional dash of his Pen, as this was, touching the Septuagint, cannot seem with intelligent persons to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43715:35"/>
of credit sufficient, to dash out the authority of <hi>Josephus,</hi> who voucheth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristaeus</hi> his story, and not only lived nearer the time of this transaction, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an hundred years, but upon the place where the chief part of it was perform'd; a man so peculiarly qualified by all helps imaginable for the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a full and faithful account of the Jewish affairs; as he that knows how well skill'd he was in their Antiquities. and how free he stood under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Roman Emperours, and of his own Judgment (being a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee and Priest in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and therefore not of the Alexandrian Interest) of any temptation to flatter the Jew in general, much less the Alexandrian and Greecizing faction: and how accurately he discharged that part of the Jewish History the matter whereof fell under the ocular inspection of men then living when he put it forth: (in so much as <hi>Agrippa</hi> for his part gives him those Testimonies. (Josephi <hi>vita.) It appears by thy Writings, that thou needest no information in any of these things whereof thou writest,</hi> and again, <hi>I have read thy Book, wherein thou seemest to me to write History more accurately than any man else).</hi> And how strenuously he maintains, against <hi>Appion</hi>'s Cavils, his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Jewish Antiquities, (proving the truth of those passages against which <hi>Appion</hi> excepts, by the Testimony of those Witnesses, whom the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themselves esteem most worthy of belief, <hi>(Cont. App. lib.</hi> 1.) And the self-contradiction of those were alledged against the truth of this History): And how well he vindicates (against <hi>Justus</hi> his exceptions) his History of the Jewish wars; not only in retail, but in gross, appealing to common sence, to judg whether of them were more like to hit the mark of truth! <hi>Justus,</hi> who did not publish his History until twenty Years after the writing of it (when those <hi>Caesars,</hi> King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and Captains that managed the Wars, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased); or himself, who out of consciousness to the truth of his own Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, dedicated and delivered it into those Emperour's hands, through whose hands the Affairs had past which he wrote of, and in whose custody were kept the Journals of all those Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>He, I say, that knows these things, and hath the Art to judg of <hi>Hercules</hi> by his foot, or rather of his foot by his body, will think that <hi>Josephus</hi> came not short of the mark he set himself in his Writings, exprest thus, <hi>(at the close of the Jewish Wars.) Touching the truth of this History, it will never repent me, confidently to affirm, that that alone hath been the mark I aimed at in all my Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Nor that</hi> he overshot himself in that bold assertion, <hi>(at the end of his Antiquities) I dare add that no other Writer, Jewish or Forreign, could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted this Argument more faithfully than I have done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If <hi>Aristaeus</hi> had no other Second but <hi>Josephus,</hi> his credit would be strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er back'd than <hi>Hermippus</hi>'s is by <hi>Laertius:</hi> how much better armed then is he than his Antagonist, since <hi>Josephus</hi> brings with him the Jewish Archives, and makes himself a Principal in this Combat, by producing out of them the same Circumstances that <hi>Aristaeus</hi> relates: for thence he bringeth the Epistle of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Priest, and <hi>Eleazar</hi>'s to <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> wherein are contained the substance of what he quotes <hi>Aristaeus</hi> for, (and therefore imputes it to <hi>Apion</hi>'s want of reading, if he knew not of those Letters: <hi>Joseph. cont. Ap.</hi> 2.) Is it not strange that the Chambers of the Jerusalomitan Temple should be the Receptacle of those Alexandrian Records that were forged in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Greecizing Jews?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Add to this, that as <hi>Josephus</hi> is not only a Second to, but a Principal with <hi>Aristaeus;</hi> so he is not his only Second, but with him appear on <hi>Aristaeus</hi> his side, of Jewish Writers <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> who gives the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Seventie's Translation, <hi>(in his Book 2. De Vita</hi> Mosis, <hi>cirea initium.) And of Christian Doctors. Eusebius, Justin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> of the Validity of whose Judgments; to discourse severally would take up too much time, I shall therefore confine my self to <hi>Tertullian:</hi> who, had there been any weight in <hi>Hermippus,</hi> as <hi>Laertius</hi> reports him, to counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance <hi>Aristaeus</hi> his Testimony, would have as soon discerned it as the Eagle-eyed <hi>Scaliger;</hi> or at least suspected it, and that suspicion had been a caution to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43715:35"/>
him to forbear all edging an Author of a crack'd credit, to such circumspect Adversaries as he had to deal with: who, could they have found this flaw in <hi>Aristaeus, Tertullian</hi> would quickly have had it on both sides of his ears, and have been told, with a witness, what kind of fellow that <hi>Aristaeus</hi> was, whose Memorials (communicated to the Gentiles: for so I interpret his, <hi>(vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis)</hi> he had quoted, for the proof of the Ptolemean Version. Besides all this, <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions <hi>Menedemus,</hi> and therein confirms the story of <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> touching him, and appeals for the truth of the whole story to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hebrew Bible which the Seventy brought with them to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then to be seen in the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> when he writ his Apology, and those many Greek Copies of the Translatours at that day, openly in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Synagogues, which any man that pleased might go, and hear read; and lastly, refer all this, but especially, the preserving of the Hebrew Copy out of which the Translation was made, when so many Thousands of Secular Books were consumed by fire, to a gracious purpose in God, to make his sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health known among all Nations. The Tradition then, of the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint is strengthened with such Authority, as whatever is brought against it by way of inartificial Argument, is less considerable than the dust upon the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances. We will therefore proceed to his Artificial ones, and to</p>

                  <p>Drawn from the unlikelihood of every Tribe's yielding six men apiece, so well skill'd, both in the Hebrew Text, and Greek Tongue, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to translate the one into the other: and of <hi>Eleazar</hi>'s being in a Capacity, to summon every Tribe; ten of them being so long before dispers'd, and not under the High-Priests Jurisdiction.

                  </p>
                  <p>To the later Branch of this Argument I answer: that the dispersion was as much at the disposal and devotion of the great Council at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the Inhabitants of <hi>Judaea:</hi> not so much out of awe of its power, which could not reach so far; as out of an innate and inbred Ambition to be held, and kept a peculiar and distinct people from the Gentiles, among whom they convers'd: and out of their devotedness to their Law and worship. <hi>(Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.

Nay, in all probability, there was a better correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency betwixt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> after the scattering of <hi>Israel,</hi> than when they continued two distinct Kingdoms in their own Land; as having then no sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Authority, wherein they could center, but that Council to whom they made application, and whose determination they followed in all dubious and adiaphorous Cases: So as nothing more frequently occurrs in the Jewish sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, than Communications of Intelligence and Counsel betwixt them of <hi>Judaea</hi> and other Countreys; than Letters missive from the High Priest and Estate of Elders, upon all emergencies, to the brethren of the twelve Tribes dispersed (for there was a dispersion of the two as well as the ten Tribes, <hi>James</hi> cap. 1. 1.) in such forms as these, <hi>[To our brethren that dwell in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per South-Countrey, to our brethren that dwell in the lower South-Countrey, peace be unto you; We give you to understand.] [To our brethren of the Captivity of</hi> Babilon, <hi>of</hi> Media, <hi>of</hi> Greece, <hi>and to the whole Captivity of</hi> Israel, <hi>peace be unto you; We give you to understand, that since the Lambs are yet little, and the time of the first ripe Ears is not yet come, that it seemeth good to me and my fellows to add thirty days unto this Year. (Lightfoot harm. on act.</hi> 9.) and if they kept a correspondency in such trivial things, can we think they had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication together in a business of so great and general concernment to the whole Nation, as was the translating of their Scripture into a foreign Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The sound then of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Bells rang in the ears of the dispersion: and <hi>Eleazar</hi> power to cluck his farthest scatter'd Chickens under his Wings:

whether, in probability, six of them, in every Tribe, were sufficiently fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd for such a flight, abilitated for such a work, comes next to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as being the first branch of <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s second Exception.</p>
                  <p>Now that every Tribe was able to set out six men a piece, furnish'd with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to translate their Mother-Tongue, (which Religion constrained them to retain) into the Greek (which their Secular Necessities forced them to learn) seems to me a far less wonder than that a man of so large an heart, as he, should strain at it. Hebrew out of which Language the Translation was made, is the Tongue which that whole Nation speak among themselves to this day. <hi>Hammond. An. in Mat.</hi> 12. 27. For although the Vulgar at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Captivity, had forgot the old Character, (and therefore <hi>Ezra</hi> was fain to turn them to their A B C, to teach them to spell and understand the reading,) wherein was fulfilled that Prophecy, <hi>[Give the Book to him, and he shall say, I am unlearned, and cannot read it.]</hi> (A thing no more strange than that many among us that can read Latine exactly in the usual Roman Letter, when they are put to read their Neck-verse in an old Print, would lose the benefit of the Clergy, did they not beforehand con their lesson) yet to the end the book might not continually be lock'd up from vulgar know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge under a strange Character. It pleased God, when the affairs of that People were come to that settlement, as to allow time for that work, to stir up the great Council, by the appointment, and with the conduct of <hi>Ezra</hi> to transcribe the Bible into those Characters that were then and are now vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. From whence arose that dangerous opinion of some unheedful both Jews and Christians, that <hi>Ezra</hi> restored the Old Testament by a spirit of Prophecy, after it had been quite lost, and no where to be found. <hi>(Irenaeus</hi> lib. 3. cap. 25. <hi>Cont. haer.)</hi> upon the same Stone stumbled <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> speaking of <hi>Ezra.

I call this a dangerous Opinion, truly it deserves a worse Epithite, as that which wholly gives up the strength of <hi>Israel</hi> into the Enemies hand, and absolutely deprives us of the benefit of pleading in evidence to the supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralness of those Revelations, the wonders that <hi>Moses</hi> wrought. And that the vulgar Jews after the Captivity spake Hebrew, is manifest from the Testimony of <hi>Josephus (in his</hi> Antiq. Judaic. <hi>lib.</hi> 11. 5.) where he hath this story, that <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as he was walking before <hi>Susa</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Persia,</hi> overheard certain Strangers as they were travelling towards the City, discoursing among themselves in Hebrew; and drawing towards them, he asked, from whence they came? they answered him, from <hi>Judaea,</hi> and inform'd him in what bad state the Jewish Affairs were, which bad News was the occasion of his looking so heavily as the King took notice of it. Yea, that the Vulgar understood it at their Conquest by <hi>Titus,</hi> is manifest from <hi>Josephus</hi>'s speaking to them in the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> in Hebrew: that not only the Captain of the Rebels, but the vulgar might understand him <hi>(Bel.

                  <p>Against the common story of the Seventy is, that it stands not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> should have been so ready in propounding that Scripture form of Execration. <hi>[If any man shall add or take from this Book, let him be accursed.]</hi>

                  <p>If <hi>Eleazar</hi> and the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Sanhedrim had approved this Translation, why did the Hebraizing Jews so hate it, as to keep an Annual Fast, and day of afflicting their Souls in remembrance of it? why did they say there was three days of darkness when the Law was translated? and apply to this time and action that of <hi>Solomon (Eccl. 3.) [There is a time to rent.]</hi> Thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that learned Man to Catechise his Readers: If a Puny, whose ambition it is to sit at the feet of that great Oracle, may have leave to solve these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I would thus unty these knots with which he snarles this story.</p>
                  <p>The great Council appointed the Seventy to translate the Bible, to gratifie <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> but never intended that Translation should be used in Synagogues.

                     <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Sixth Objection.</head>
                  <p>The last Stone which <hi>Scaliger</hi> turns is <hi>Ptolemy</hi> himself: under this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he finds those Worms of Parricides committed upon his Brethren, those Moths of Incest committed with his Sister, as fret his Surname <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphus</hi> (till they change it from its natural Gloss, and make it look as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon him abusively) but not <hi>Aristaeus</hi> his Credit.</p>
                  <p>For first, these Immoralities hinder not, but that he might be ambitious to have his famous Library grac'd with Books so much commended, not only by publick fame and inkling of the Nations (speaking in the language of that Prophecy <hi>Deut. 4. 6.) [What Nation is there so great that hath statutes and Judgments so righteous as this Law?]</hi> but by the suggestions of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> that the Jewish Scriptures contein'd a most wise, sincere and divinely-inspired Law, and that <hi>Hecataeus Abderita</hi> assigned that as the reason why neither any Poet nor Historian made mention thereof, because 'tis sacred and not to be taken into a prophane mouth: How must this set an edge upon his curiosity, and incite him after the obtaining a sight, and coming within view of those Books, which, at a distance, cast so alluring a smell into his quick-scented nostrils!] <hi>Ptolemy</hi> was in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Judgment <hi>[Omni lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raturâ sagacissimus:] (Apol. cap.</hi> 18.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, had we learnt to extend the line of Christian Charity but half as far as it will reach, we should pass a milder sentence than that of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Weenobus,</hi> upon him, whom God anointed to be his Servant, to bring his Law from Jewish Captivity; and conceive him to have been almost if not altogether a Proselyte: for upon the assurance that <hi>Aristaeus</hi> gave him, that so far as he could find by most diligent enquiry, the best and highest God, the Maker of the World, whom he worship'd (under the name of <hi>Jupiter)</hi> was worshipped among the Jews, after a more excellent rite and form of Divine Service, than among any other people upon earth; that that God, who gave to him his Kingdom, had given to them their Law: he presently ordered the Manumission of all the Jews in his Dominion, at his own vast charge, in redeeming above 120000 out of the hands of those they were Vassals to. And upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> his suggesting to him, that the Jewish Scriptures contein'd a most wise, sincere and divine Law, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Embassadors to be sent to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Priest with Letters after this Tenure.<hi>—After, I had obtained the Principality, I set at liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred thousand Jews,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thinking that this would be an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, thank-offering to God, for that providence whereby it pleased him to prefer me to this Supremacy.—I have sent also Oblations for the Temple, twenty golden, and thirty silver Vials, five golden Flaggons, a Table of Gold, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents to buy Sacrifices with, and for other uses of the Temple.</hi> Those presents were as rich and curious as hands could make them, or Art, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated to do their best by the Kings diligent eye upon them while they were a working: and that the memory of this his Zeal for the House of God might be continued, he not only caused the Workmen to engrave their names upon the pieces which each of them wrought, together with the Donor's; but the whole procedure of this business to be entred in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Records. Of this <hi>Ptolemy</hi> thus writes <hi>Philo Judaeus (de vita Mosis, lib.</hi> 2.) Ptolemaeus <hi>fuit is</hi> Philadelphus, <hi>virtutibus regiis, supra omnes aetatis suae superiorumque seculorum principes, nobilis, cujus nunc quoque ex tanto temporum intervallo decus est inclitum, ob tot relicta per civitates regionesque monumenta magnificentiae, ut in proverbium abierit sumptuosa opera ab illo Philadelphea denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata.—Talis princeps captus nostrae Legis amore, in Graecam linguam è Caldai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca transferendam curavit.] This</hi> Ptolemy Philadelphus <hi>was for Kingly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues famous above all Princes of his and former Ages; who is now also after so long a space of time renown'd for leaving so many monuments of his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence in Cities and Countries, that sumptuous works are proverbially called</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphian.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43715:38"/>
                     <hi>This so eminent a Prince, being taken with the love of our Law, caused it to be translated.</hi> Lo here, what sooting our Charity may have, to hale us to the more favourable opinion, touching this great Instrument of conveighing the knowledge of God's Law out of <hi>Jewry</hi> to the ends of the Earth! And the same Charity may cover the multitude of Crimes laid to his charge, they being neither more nor greater than what may be observ'd even in <hi>Cyrus</hi> himself, who past in God's muster for one of his anointed ones, and (whose Proselytism stood him in as much, as his did <hi>Ptolemy)</hi> if we would permit the Bee to metamorphize it self into a Dung-fly, upon whom might she not find sore places to fasten and sit upon. <hi>Ptolemy</hi> slew his Brethren, but Brethren (if even <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Oracle <hi>Hermippus</hi> be infallible) whom their Mother sought to promote to the Crown before her Step-son <hi>Ptolemy;</hi> and was this any more than <hi>Solomon</hi> did to <hi>Adonijah,</hi> upon the same account? He married his Sister! But (to say nothing of those alleviations of its guilt, which from the Customariness of the thing, and Reasons of State might be pleaded) was not the Family of the <hi>Herods</hi> a proselyted Race, and yet intangled in incestuous Marriages? of one of whom (and he the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of them all for Judaism, <hi>Herod Agrippa)</hi> History records, <hi>(Lightfoot, Har. Vit.</hi> 25, 26.) that he succeeded his Brother-in-law-uncle <hi>Herod,</hi> and lived with his Aunt-sister <hi>Beronice</hi> in more familiarity than was for their credit. Of another of whom, <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> sacred Records report Cruelty and Incest, if not equalling <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s in all, yet exceeding it in this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that the one had the Baptist, the other <hi>Aristaeus</hi> to reprove him; who had he equal'd <hi>Herod</hi>'s Monitor in the share of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Spirit, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> perhaps would have repented. But that worse men than <hi>Ptolemy</hi> have past for good Proselytes, needs no other examples to be proved by, than that of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, for a Male; whom <hi>Josephus</hi> describes as a Monster in point of Morality, and yet so zealous a Jew, as the Building of the Temple cost him far more than the Translation of the Bible did <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> And <hi>Poppaea</hi> a Female; who for all that she had so much Debauchery in her, as to Nero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize <hi>Nero</hi> himself, yet could lisp out <hi>[The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord]</hi> with such a grace, as <hi>Josephus</hi> mistook her for a very religious Woman.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, should we grant the worst of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> that can be imagin'd; Is he the first bad man whom God hath made an Instrument of good? of whom that All-ruling Providence hath serv'd her self which useth to bring about her own wisest Counsels by foolish Instruments; her greatest Designs by the most unlikely means; the best Things by the worst Men: and would not permit evil Men, could she not make good Use of them? The truth is, the Argument from Persons to Providence, or from Providence to Persons, is like those Islands near St. <hi>Omer,</hi> of which <hi>Heylin</hi> (in his <hi>Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. pag.</hi> 367.) reports, that though their surface be so firm, that Cattel do graze upon them, yet for want of a solid foundation towards the centre, by fastning Cords to the Bushes which grow upon them, a man may draw them which way he will. And such an Island the Josephian History of the Seventy seem'd to be to <hi>Scaliger,</hi> no wonder, then that that Remover of Mountains (to borrow the Rabbies Paraphrase of an Almighty Wit) should tie his Cords to these passages therein; or that his sinewy Arm (able to roll the Earth about, if he had but a place whereon to fasten his foot) should give the Truth of it those Twitches, as make the whole Island seem to float, in those mens Eyes who ponderate his Authority more than his Reasons. But God be thanked, though he move, he cannot remove this firm Land, whose foundations are laid upon the Universal consent of all the Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to St. <hi>Jerome:</hi> and that consent pleaded as a Catachistical point by St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem (Catech. 4. titul.</hi>

[Septuaginta, quorum est gravissima authoritas—eis praeeminentem authoritatem in hoc munere sine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversia tribuendam existimo;] The Seventy, whose authority is most weighty—I think we ought, without all dispute, give them the preeminence of authority.</hi> And maintains it by such solidity of Argument <hi>(Epist. 10.) [Neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim parvum pondus habet illa, quae sic meruit defamari (quôd in multis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter se habet quàm Haebraeorum codicum authoritas) &amp; quâ usos Apostolos, non solùm res ipsa indicat, sed etiam te attestatum esse memini.] Can that Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be of small weight (although thou art pleased to defame it, as not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Hebrew Text) which that the Apostles used, is not only plain in it self, but acknowledged by thee?</hi> and <hi>(Epist. 19.) [Sed insinuare digneris, à quibus Judaeis, &amp;c.] Be pleased (I pray thee) to tell me, by what Jews this Translation could possibly be corrupted, so as to disfavour the Christian Cause? Not by those who before the Advent of Christ translated it, for they had no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. The Jews indeed, since the propagation of Christianity, may be thought to have had a good will, either to substract, or to adulterate those Texts in the Old Testament, out of which we fetch convincing Arguments, in defence of our Faith. But how is it possible they could have an opportunity? seeing the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Seventy is not only dispers'd through the World; but, by reason of Christ's and his Apostles making their quotations out of it, is so tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously adhered to by all Christian Churches, as they cannot endure to hear what recedes from it in the least tittle:</hi> Of which he gives this notable Instance <hi>(Epist.</hi> 10.) That a certain Bishop reading out of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Translation, in the History of <hi>Jonas, [haedera]</hi> instead of <hi>[cucurbita]</hi> the people were so incens'd, as they had like to have proceeded to the Deposition of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, for corrupting sacred Writ. By such Solidity of Arguments (I say) St. <hi>Austin</hi> maintains the preheminency of the Authority of the Septuagint against St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> as that learned Father pleads his own old age, for an excuse, for his not answering them. But the excellent <hi>Vossius</hi> hath lately so well managed this Province, so irrefragably maintained the Authority of the Septuagint, as all that can be said after him is but labour in vain. Neither indeed did I intend to stand by the Seventy any longer, than I might signifie to the Sheep of Christ, that they may without fear graze upon it, and find that pasture which greater Cattel (of a far larger size than the Modern breed, and whose weight would have sunk it down, had it not been firm Land) have found there: and may chew the Cud of that Observation, for the defence whereof we have made this too large Digression: Were it not that the allowing the matter to have fallen out, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> fancieth, rather than as <hi>Josephus</hi> relateth, would render the whole Story juiceless. For say, as he states the Case, that the Jews of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to a necessity of disusing their own tongue, and of learning Greek, procured this Translation for their own use; this will make little or nothing to the proof of that Position which the Patrons of the Christian Cause have with one mouth affirmed; <hi>viz.</hi> That the knowledge of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was the forerunner of the Knowledge of Christ, among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: to whom it would still have been a Book sealed up, had it been confin'd to the Cabinet of the Synagogue. But as <hi>Josephus</hi> tells the Story, it affords a most substantial <hi>Basis</hi> to that universally receiv'd Opinion, that the Day-break Glimmerings of the Law of God did (out of <hi>Judea)</hi> appear brighter and brighter to the Gentiles; till at last the whole Body of it arose visibly, (in the Septuagint) as the Day-star to the Sun of of Righteousness. <hi>[Volebat Deus gentes non multos post annos vocare per Evangelium—quocirca

                  <p>§. 6. Lo here! how candidly, how open-heartedly the Blessed Jesus dealt with the World! dispersing his Picture, before he came to call her beloved, that had not been beloved; that at his congress with her, there might not be <hi>error personae,</hi> or that the World might not have this to plead, that she had (or ever she was aware, or had well consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Person) suffered a surprizal upon her Affections; sending the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuagint as the Prologue to his and his Apostles Acts, to communicate to the Expectants the Argument of the ensuing Poem, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the old Grounds of that new Ditty, which was to be sung at his and their appearing on the Worlds Stage: an argument it was no newly devised Fable, but an old Plot; and a certain Expedient whereby the mistakes of the Actors might have been discern'd had they committed any. Would Christ have given the World an opportunity to take the length of his foot that was to come, by the Sandal of Moses, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether that Sandal fitted his foot when he was come, if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to delude it? I appeal to all Histories for an instance, of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but Christ's, that durst abide the Test, much less appeal to the Principles of another Religion, then in being, when it self stood for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and acknowledged by the Candidate to be in force. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pagan-Religion durst not stand a trial by the Books of its Founder, <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> but cried away with them to the fire, as soon as they were produc'd.

But our Jesus professeth, that he came not to destroy, but to fulfil <hi>(to fill up)</hi> the Law and the Prophets; that he would not dash one tittle out of them, till all was fulfilled: and yet he communicated the knowledge of them to the World some hundreds of years before he instituted his Royal Law, and requires the Worlds Vote for the passing of that Law, upon no other terms than its Conformity to what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets had writ. The greatest advantage imaginable for the detection of false Play, and such as he would never have given the World, had he intended to have put tricks upon it. How does <hi>Celsus</hi> in the Person of a Jew busie himself to find Lines and Features in our Saviour's Face not answering the Old Testament draught of the <hi>Messiah?</hi> Here he hath too much of God, there too much of Man; here he's to White, there too Ruddy.

               <p>§ 1. THese Arguments for the fidelity of the Apostles, drawn from the State of that Age wherein they made their report, will recieve that Accession of Strength, as will make them impregnable, by comparing it with those Ages wherein all false Religions have been hatched, No Religious Impostors having hitherto dared to peep out, but in Barbarous Times.</p>
               <p>To begin with those are next to us, both in time and place; those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Twins, of the Mahometan and Papal Impiety, chose the midnight of Cimmerian Darkness to be born in; an Age as infamous for Ignorance, as that of the Apostles was famous for Knowledg. The Pope, by the Decree of <hi>Phocas,</hi> obtained the Universal Supremacy over Bishops,—<hi>Anno. 606. Mahomet</hi> put forth his Alchoran,—<hi>Anno.</hi> 622. Urbanity was in its highest Exaltation when the Cedar of the Gospel was planted, in its lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression when these Tares were sowen; that an Age elevated above the Ela of common Humanity, this sunk down below the Gamut of the most brutish Bestiality. He that would make an equal partition of that Verse in the Psalms betwixt them, must assign the first part for the Motto of that <hi>[Man being in Honour,]</hi> the last clause for the motto of this <hi>[is become like a Beast that perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.]</hi> For, whether it hapned through the innate inconstancy of humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, in whose still-running Wheel, those Spokes which were then upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, were now become lowermost, nothing persisting in one Stay; but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flowing till it comes to its Spring Tide, or ebbing till it falls to its neep;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43715:40"/>
either waxing towards a full, or waining towards a change: Or whether the just hand of Heaven withdrew natural from them who made no better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of supernatural Light: Or upon whatever inscrutable reasons of incomprehensible Wisdom, it came to pass: such was the Genius of the World, when Hell drew out those her two Nipples, Turk and Pope, (those Soveraigns of Eastern and Western <hi>Babel,</hi> of the second Edition; <hi>(Herbert</hi>'s <hi>Church Militant;)</hi> when that <hi>Janus-</hi>Anti-Christ set back to back, and entred the Lists against Christ; the one antiquating, the other adulterating the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, by the Introduction of their new Religions; as there was none then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly appearing, but the Ass, to umpire the Contest betwixt Christ and them; to determine who sung best; these Birds of Prey, or that warbling Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, that Bird of Paradise. The Worlds Ears were never grown to a more Ass-like length, than when those <hi>Silvans,</hi> and barbarous <hi>Pans</hi> contended before it, for preheminency above our truly Divine <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That such was the face of the World then, when Papal Innovations, and Mahometan Blasphemies commended themselves to her, will best appear, by taking an impartial Survey of that Age, as it is limned out by the Pencils of Popish Historians, as 'tis measured by their own Chain.</p>
               <p>Touching the Ignorance and Immorality of which Age, <hi>(Cent.</hi> 6. 590.) <hi>Platina</hi> gives a shrewd hint, in his commendation of the then Pope, when the day was shutting in; telling us that <hi>Gregory</hi> the great had no Peer, for Learning, among all the Popes which succeeded him, good Literature was then on the decaying hand among the chief Bishops; much more therefore among the inferiour Clergy, whose preferment lay at their feet, and whose highest Ambition was to bear the Image of their Ghostly Fathers. If that great Luminary which God made to rule the Day (as the Italian Parasite brags) was eclipsed, how must Darkness needs spread it self over the faces of the lesser Stars? nay, which of them durst shew so little obsequiousness to them, of whom they borrowed light; as not to chuse rather to hide that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate knowledg they had, under a Bushel, than set it on the Table, to out-brave the Sun; having so fair an Item given them, that light offends weak Eyes, in the immediate Successor to the learned <hi>Gregory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rude and unlearned <hi>Sabinianus, (Platin. Sabinianus,</hi> 604.) upon whom <hi>Platina</hi>'s Pen lets fall these blots; that he was of so obscure Parentage, as the place of his Birth could not be traced out, but yet more obscure in good parts and manners; burning with that spightful Envy against his learned Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, as he attempted to burn his Books, to pull that Light, the Splendour whereof dazled the Eyes of this Owl, out of the Firmament. This was he that instituted the burning of Lamps on the Day time in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church: A charitable and seasonable work! to furnish the Church with corporeal and typical Light, when the substantial and spiritual Temple-Lamp was dwindl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out: and a kind of Prodigy portending the decay of Knowledg; as those other did of Humanity (all but the outward shape) which <hi>Platina</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to have appeared in the short Span of his Papacy? and than which (he saith) never any appeared greater: A fourfooted boy, and two Sea-monsters in a perfect humane Shape, manifestly representing the degeneracy of that Age; grown, even under <hi>Gregory,</hi> to a stupendious degree of Brutishness, If <hi>Ulric</hi> Bishop of <hi>Auspurg</hi> be to be believed (and they that doubt the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his Testimony, may find a solid and unanswerable Vindication of it in Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>'s defence of the Honour of the <hi>married Clergy, lib.</hi> 5. § 1.) who in his Letter to Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first, writing against the Decree of single life of Priests, produceth the practice of <hi>Gregory</hi> the first, who once condemned marriage of Priests, but when at the cleansing of a Pond (near his own Collegiate Church) he saw cast up, with the sludge, above 6000. Sculls of Infants, he condemned and retracted his former Decree. Good God! how had this Age lost the common Sentiments of Humanity; which could put this Sence upon St. <hi>Paul, [It is good not to marry,]</hi> as if he therein made the committing of Fornication, and (to cover the shame of that from

And if they of his own Colledg and Family, that lived under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, commenced to such a Degree of insensate Savageness, what may we think of others, that had not upon them the restraint of their Bishop's eye; yea, what can be deemed of so brutified an Age, but what <hi>Gregory</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thought of it? that it was next door to that, wherein Antichrist would shew himself: that now the way was strawed for the coming of that Son of Perdition: as he intimates in that Letter, wherein he returns to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (expressing how ill he took <hi>Gregory</hi>'s raising of so much Dust in oppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and advising him, that for so frivolous a Word, he would not give so great a Scandal) this Answer, <hi>I say boldly, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver desireth the Title of Universal Bishop, fore-runs Antichrist in Pride, and with the same Pride is brought into all Error.</hi> And in his Letter to <hi>John</hi> himself, who, I pray (saith he) before you ever used this proud word, but he, who despising the Legions of Angels, (sociably joyned with him) would needs burst out unto the top of singularity, and be alone above all. And in his Treatise on <hi>Job,</hi> saying, Now ere Antichrist himself come, some do preach him by their manners, and others by their words.</p>
               <p>The Trentish Anathema would fall heavy upon me, should I deny this Pope's infallibility in defining matters of Faith (as this is of Antichrists com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing): but I fear not those <hi>Bruta fulmina,</hi> those causless Curses: yet am led into the belief of this his Prophecy, by little less than Ocular Demonstration of the palpable Effect; for within a Year after <hi>Gregory</hi>'s decease (next after the fore-named <hi>Sabinianus.)</hi>

               <p>§ 2. It was an Age, we see, of gross Barbarism, when Mahometanism in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon the World; and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the Church, in the claim of Supremacy over his fellow Bishops, he came on the blind side of the Beast, when he skipp'd up into the Saddle. Let us now observe that as this Darkness grew thicker and thicker, he advanced his Power higher and higher, till at last he set his Foot upon the Necks of Kings, and obtained a Soveraignty over Secular Princes. And because it would be an endless work, here to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through the Histories of several Nations, and thereout collect the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Confessions that every where occur of the Worlds general deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, I shall consine my self to the History of the Popes (those reputed lights of the Church,) for if I demonstrate the Eye to be dark, he is a very weak Reader that cannot thence conclude, the whole body to be full of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                  <hi>John</hi> the tenth <hi>(John 10.

               <p>
                  <hi>Benedict</hi> the fourth was one; a man noted by <hi>Platina (Platina Bened.</hi> 4. 899.) for nothing, but his doing nothing worth noting: but of the then times he thus complains, <hi>Mens Industry in all kinds of Vertue waxed cold and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, for want of the Spur of Encouragement: they that sate still, or ran-counter, attaining to the Goal of Preferment, before them who pursued it, in a direct course of real Merit. Then did the Line of</hi> Charles <hi>the Great, by the slothfulness of succeeding Princes, lose both the Kingdom of</hi> France, <hi>and the Empire of</hi> Rome. <hi>Then did the Splendour of the Roman Name, by the negligence of the Roman No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Commons, sit in obscure Darkness. And we can affirm, that the very same Fate befell the Pontifical Dignity; for of Old, the Renown of the Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>waxed great by their Sanctity and Learning (even among the many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and obstinate Persecutors of the Christian Name.) But when the Church began towantonnize, the Licentious Liberty of sinning brought forth these Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who, by Circumvention and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That couragious Captain <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> proposed to himself, as the principal Scope of his Ambition, the execution of his Sensuality, and enjoyment of some matchless Beauty: but herein he shewed himself a man of stronger Nerves than Head-piece, and came to die like a fool, by the stratagem of a poyson'd Handkerchief, in the the arms of that Wench, for whose mortal imbraces he had yielded that Victory to the Florentines which they were ready to yield to him, <hi>(Lord Mountagne's Essays) Mark Antony</hi> was both a couragious Souldier, and a passionate Amorado; but for want of Wit, suffered his pleasures so far to make him forget the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his affairs, as he may thank <hi>Cleopatras</hi> dalliances, for his Ruin and loss of Empire.</p>

Do not they assent to <hi>Euemerus,</hi> who, not as a fabulous Tattler, but as a diligent Enquirer, hath drawn the Natural and Moral History of all those Gods, <hi>(de Civitate</hi> 6. 7.) But we will hear the Heathens tell their own Tales of what they had found concerning their Gods. <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> in his <hi>Aesclapius, (cap. 9. &amp;</hi> 13.) translated by <hi>Porphyry</hi> (that grand Pagan Adversary to the Christian Name) affirms, that men made all those Gods who are worshipt in Temples: a thing, saith he, that passeth all admiration, and argueth our Ancestors to have erred exceedingly, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of the Deity. Yea, he proves this by Induction of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. <hi>(Aug. de civ. l. 8. c.</hi> 26.)

Valerius Maximus,</hi> in his Epistle Dedicatory to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> saith, that <hi>all our Gods we have received of our Ancestors, but the</hi> Caesars <hi>we have handed down to Posterity, [reliquos accepimus,</hi> Caesares <hi>dedimus.]</hi> A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Confession of a Pagan, and that to the face of a Pagan Emperour, that the Gods they had received were of the same kind with those they gave, <hi>i. e.</hi> Mortals.</p>
                  <p>The Roman <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in his Tusculane Questions concludes thus; If I listed to ransack the Antiquities of the Greeks, I should find that the same Gods whom we esteem greatest, have had their Original among us Mortals: For the verifying hereof, do but enquire whose the Tombs are that are shewed in <hi>Greece,</hi> and consider with thy self what their Ceremonies and Mysteries are; for having access to them thou wilt without doubt understand far more than I averr.</p>

Indeed those parts of the Empire that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon <hi>Judaea,</hi> and wherein the Apostles of the Circumcision chiefly conversed, and spread the Gospel, were, long before that time, put into a posture for the most speedy conveyance of Advertisements, by <hi>Cyrus:</hi> who that he might have News brought him of all Emergencies from all the parts of his vast Empire, would have trial made how far an Horse could go out-right at full speed without bating: at which distance he caused Stages to be set, and fresh Horses to stand: which kind of posting, some (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith) affirm to be equivalent for swiftness to the flying of Cranes <hi>(Xenophon.

An Art perhaps conveighed thither out of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and communicated by <hi>Daniel,</hi> at what time he was set over the Presidents of the Provinces: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis certain, it was of old in use among them, for we read of <hi>Hezechiah</hi>'s sending his Proclamations by Post; and hear <hi>Deborah</hi> bewail the days of <hi>Shamgar,</hi> for that in them the Courriers were forced to take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By-ways: so that the Apostles could not be ignorant of that ready way of communicating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, which the Empire had then learnt. <hi>Palladius</hi> was able to ride post unto the furthest Bounds of the Roman and Persian Dominions, and back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in thirty days to <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> [Socrat. <hi>Scol.

               <p>§ 2. That Age was externally fortified against the assaults of Impostors, by reason of that universal Peace through the World, that ushered the Prince of Peace into the World; so as Intelligence might pass from Nation to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the Universe (as Blood by Circulation, through the Veins of an healthful Body) without the least Obstruction. Times of Distraction are the most promising Seed-times of Lyes: he who in fishing for men, dubbs his Hook with a counterfeit Fly, will chuse to fish in troubled Waters: he that has learn'd the black Art of inventing News, will chuse a Season to practise in, when an Embargo is laid upon the Packet-boats: when the Bridges are broken down, the High-ways unoccupied, when through the noise of Arms, men cannot hear, nor are at leisure to listen after, what falls out in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts of the World: as in the Battel betwixt <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Hannibal;</hi> at which, they that were present by reason of the Hurly-burly among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43715:48"/>
perceived not the most clamorous Effects of the then prodigious Earth-quake, that demolished the best parts of the chiefest Cities, diverted Rivers from their wonted Channels, and tumbled down with a hideous Fragor the tops of Mountains, <hi>(Plutarc.

Such Confusions are the fittest Seasons for the Father of Lyes to cast his Spawn, for Satan to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his poysoned Arrows: that before time, (the Mother of Truth) can give them a check, his fry may be of Age to shift for themselves; his stories may stick so fast in Mens Minds, as the hand of Truth, afterwards, will have much ado to pull them out, and not leave some Splinters, if not the pile head behind.</p>
               <p>The Apostles of the blessed Jesus used not this craft, his Fisher-men angled in calm Waters, his Seedsmen scattered the Gospel in those pacate days, as gave men leisure to ponderate every Circumstance of the News they brought: Men might then sit peaceably under their own Vines, and ruminate upon the fruit of our Royal Vine, that chears the Heart of God and Man. The whole Empire, at Christ's Birth, (brooding under the Dove-like Wings of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Eagle) enjoyed that Halcionian Calm, as she had not been blessed with the like, but once, in that large Tract of time betwixt <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Augustus;</hi> and that but for a piece of a Year; and yet that short breathing time from War reported as a Miracle: <hi>Numa</hi> (saith <hi>Livy) that erected</hi> Janus <hi>s Temple was the first, who, in token if Peace universally obtained through the Roman Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, shut up the Gates of that Temple;</hi> Manlius <hi>the second, and</hi> Augustus <hi>the third: Providence having bestowed this gift upon our Age, that we should see Peace setled, (after the Conquest of</hi> Mark.

[Vix, post tam multos annos ab urbe condita usque</hi> Augustum, <hi>unus post primum Punicum bellum pro magno miraculo commemoratur annus, quo belli portas Romani claudere potuerunt:]</hi> An Assertion, which St. <hi>Austin</hi> had ground enough for, (that the Atheist may not object that these are the <hi>Piae fraudes of Christians,)</hi> out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who writes, that the Temple of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did not continue long shut in the Consulship of <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Attilius: for forthwith, immediately after that it was opened again; a new War rolling in upon, and assaulting the Empire, (Plut. Numa.)</hi> [M. Attilio <hi>&amp;</hi> T. Manlio Coss. <hi>haud multum temporis clausum, deinde Continuo ingruente irrumpenteque bello apertum est.]</hi> Upon which, he there gives this Note: <hi>'Tis seldom, but that the Roman Empire is ensnarl'd in some or other War; It being so vast a body, and on all sides incircled with restless Barbarians, (Id.

               <p>And yet it was a time of the singing of this rare Bird, when our Prince of Peace exhibited himself to the World. <hi>This is that Caesar</hi> (saith <hi>Philo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi> speaking of <hi>Augustus) who, finding the World as a boisterious Sea, tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed every way with tempestuous Winds; charmed its Waves asleep, and restored to it such Serenity, as not only open Wars were every where exiled, but private

Robberies: this is he, who reduc'd that</hi> Chaos <hi>of Confusion, that the World had been buried under in former Ages, unto that well setled and comely order, which we see it in in ours: this is he that has moulded the most savage Nations into Mansuetude and humane Societies, (Phil. de legat. ad Caium.) [Hic est ille Caesar qui depul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis undiquaque ruentibus procellis serenitatem orbi restituit: qui &amp; aperta bella sustulit, &amp;c.]</hi> But <hi>Philo</hi> perhaps plays the Orator, and describes with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Flourishes the flourishing of the Imperial Olive; let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of <hi>Suetonius</hi> that uncorrupted Oracle of Pagan History; from whom we have this Respond. Janus Quirinus <hi>that had not been shut in but once and again from the first founding of</hi> Rome <hi>unto this Age, was in a far shorter space shut in three times By</hi> Augustus, <hi>peace being setled by Land and Sea, (Suet. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctav.</hi> 22.) [Janum Quirinum, <hi>semel atque iterum a Condita Urbe, memoriam ante suam clausum, in multo breviore temporis spatio, Terra Marique pace parta, ter clausit.]</hi> (for that is the true reading (not as <hi>Beroaldus</hi> would have it, the third time) as both <hi>Jasenius</hi> observes out of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and the Context imports.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustus</hi> was Christ's Cryer, to proclaim silence in the World, before the publication of the Gospel: that men might without distraction weigh what was told them. The worst Juncture that an impostor could have pitched upon to shew his Pranks in: when as <hi>Bullenger</hi> observes, <hi>Rust had riveted the Sword to the Scabbard. [Ipsa etiam rubigo obsignavit.]</hi> (Bulleng. <hi>In</hi> Daniel. <hi>par. 2. tab.</hi> 5.)</p>
               <p>§ 3. If exception be made against the Cogency of this Argument; that Christ indeed was born under <hi>Augustus,</hi> but what is that to the publication of the Gospel: seeing that began in the Baptist's preaching under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> till when, and some time after, Christ walk'd <hi>incognito.</hi> And therefore, the times might be grown turbulent enough for a Legerdemain's passing without discovery by that time the Apostles began to preach. I shall put by this Bar to Faith by making good this Assertion,</p>
               <p>That the Peace setled by <hi>Augustus,</hi> was continued under <hi>Tiberius, Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Claudius,</hi> and so much of <hi>Nero's</hi> Reign: as for thirty Years after the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel began to be preach'd, the World enjoyed Peace, so as any, who had a mind to enquire, might have informed himself of the truth of what had past in <hi>Judaea:</hi> the passage of Intelligence being no where interrupted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the peaceableness of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign, <hi>(Anno Christi</hi> 17.) let <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> speak <hi>(Philo de legatione ad Caium)</hi> who accusing the Alexandrians of extream madness, in giving that Divine Honour to <hi>Caligula,</hi> which they neglected to give to <hi>Tiberius:</hi> presents his happy Reign in these Words. <hi>In the three and twenty Years of his Reign he left no Seed, no not</hi> so much as <hi>a Spark of War, by Sea or Land among Greeks or Barbarians; but nourish'd Peace and the fruits of Peace to his dying day.</hi> And a little before, <hi>during his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the East, West, North, South-Provinces consented together in that calmness of Peace, that there was nothing to be seen in City or Countrey, but Festivities, Altars, Victims, chearful and pleasant Countenances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

So far did Providence here over-do the Prophecy of the peaceableness of the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> of which, that one tittle might not fall to the ground, God permitted those Diabolical and Damnable Traytors (for such perswasions come of Satanical Injections, and they that resist shall receive Damnation) <hi>Bessus, Sabinus,</hi> and their Confederates, to turn their Bodkins into Pruning-hooks, to pluck up this Cumber-ground-weed <hi>Caligula;</hi> when he was but intending to break the Peace, and deluge the Empire in Blood: having no other quarrel against the World, but its being over-happy through its abundance of Peace; looking on the Tranquillity of that Age with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil eye, as not made famous by any signal Calamity, and threatning to burn the Memory of this turbulent-spirited Monster in Oblivion, under that pile of Prosperities, which Peace had heaped upon it: the only thing he had to complain of, and ground his wish upon <hi>(that some such slaughter of Armies, Famine, Pestilence, Conflagrations, Earth-quakes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>might infest the World in his days, as might render them famous to Posterity)</hi> the only thing he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, was his seeing nothing to be bewailed. <hi>(Suet.

(reckoning Minutes for Years) wherein its preaching was fully known in all the World: there was an universal silence in the Heaven of the Roman Empire; no noise of War, no clashing of hostile Armour heard within its Precincts. (I here only allude to that passage <hi>(Revel. 8. 1.) [there was silence in Heaven about the space of half an hour,]</hi> I undertake not its Exposition.) Saving some dry blows in <hi>Judaea,</hi> where had been the Vision of Peace: nor in its Borders saving <hi>Armenia;</hi> Olive plants growing round about it, save on that Coast whither <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove brought the Olive Branch (If the Septuagint mistake not in translating <hi>Arrarat Armenia (Isa. 37. 38. 2 King. 19. 37.)</hi> A remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Providence! that God should prepare a place of rest for the reception of the Ark and Tabernacle of his own pitching, every where, but where the Arks of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> had rested: and a fair intimation to the Proselytes of the Gate, that rested on <hi>Noah</hi>'s seven Precepts: and the Proselytes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; who trusted in Moses, that that which they had taken up with was not their true rest.</p>
               <p>§ 4. It being thus evident out of the undoubted Histories of those times; that beside that thirty Years space of Peace through the whole Empire, from the birth of our Saviour unto the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> (wherein our great High Priest was officiating in the Temple, and within the Veil of his Flesh) (It is Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s Observation, that St. <hi>John,</hi> in that half hours silence, alludes to the People waiting silently at the Door, while the Priest was offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in the holy place.) Peace was then continued for other thirty Years e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the fourth of <hi>Nero:</hi> It remains now, that we prove, that during that last thirty Years of silence, the Line of the Gospel was drawn out, not only through all the Earth (the Land of <hi>Jury)</hi> but to the ends of the World (the utmost Bounds of the Roman Pale.) Would the Atheist, for proof of this, acquiess in sacred Testimony, I would alledge that of St. <hi>Paul, (Ro. 15. 19.)</hi> where he writes, that <hi>in his own line he had proceeded from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>(the Center) round about unto</hi> Illyricum, <hi>fully preaching the Gospel, so as he had no place left in those parts,</hi> over which, the Line of some Apostle had not been sttretch'd. And then leave him to compute (though St. <hi>Paul</hi> labour'd more than they all, and therefore must have twelve to one reckoned to his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) how far the lines of all the rest were stretched out before the general Peace was broke: seeing the single Line of one of them had reach'd so far in <hi>Nero</hi>'s second Year (as Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> dates that Epistle.) But to deal with the Atheist at his own Weapon, I shall urge him with the Testimony of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus;</hi> who having occasion thereof ministred to him, from <hi>Nero</hi>'s charging Christians with the setting <hi>Rome</hi> on fire; speaks of our Religion, as famously known, and by multitudes embrac'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> long before that bloody Edict in <hi>Nero</hi>'s twelfth. <hi>The common People</hi> (saith he) <hi>call them Christians, from one Christ; who in the Reign of</hi> Tiberius <hi>was put to death by</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of</hi> Judaea: <hi>whose Religion, though by Edicts suppressed, presently upon its appearance, yet grew under those Weights, and brake out again, not in</hi> Judaea <hi>only, where it had its Original, (i. e.</hi> the Center whence its Line was drawn) <hi>but even in</hi> Rome <hi>it self: having reached so far, and got so many Proselytes: as though the Vulgar looked upon Christians as Persons of an execrable Religion, as Enemies to Humane Kind, and deserving the Extremities of most inhumane Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Punishments; yet there was none of them so hard hearted, as not to relent, to see such huge Multitudes of them led to the Slaughter, grieving that so much humane (though as they thought Malignant) blood should be poured out.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Judean Stirs were the Empires Advantage against Surprisal.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>Objections from the Commotions in</hi> Judea <hi>answered and retorted: Those inconsiderable and not so great as that delicate and repining People would represent them. § 2. The Stirs that were in</hi> Judea <hi>put the Ministers of State upon a more diligent enquiry into what there fell out; whereby they got a more full information of the state of that great Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jews and Christians. § 3. The Judean Commotions drew the Imperial Eagle to fix her eye more narrowly upon Emergencies there, as things of highest State-concern; in respect of that then famous Eastern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of one to arise at that time in</hi> Judea, <hi>who should be King of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse. § 4. At that time when the Erection of an Universal Monarchy was (according to that Prophecy) expected, appeared Persons of a more Lordly Spirit amongst the Romans than any former Age had brought forth.</hi> Caesar <hi>and</hi> Pompey'<hi>s Ambition sprung from this Prophecy. The then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Spirits courted the Jews favour, and used means that they might be that</hi> oriundus in Judaea. § 5. <hi>The arts which the Roman Candidates for the Universal Monarchy used, to bring the World into an opinion that they were designed by Heaven to something extraordinary.</hi> Julius <hi>his Dream; his cloven-footed Horse; his Mules; his Triton; his pressing to have the Title of King, because the</hi> Sybils <hi>had prophesied one at that time would be King of all the World. The Fathers quotations of Sybils vindicated.</hi> § 6. Augustus <hi>had his Education amongst the</hi> Velitri, <hi>who had a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tendency with the Eastern Prophecy, that one of that City should obtain the Kingdom of the whole World. The Roman Prodigy before his Birth. His Mother</hi> Atia <hi>conceives him by</hi> Apollo. <hi>Her Snake-mole.</hi> Nero'<hi>s Bracelet.</hi> Atias <hi>Dream of her Entrals.</hi> Nigidius <hi>his Prognisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Prediction of the Thracian Priests. His Fathers Vision.</hi> Cicero'<hi>s Dream.</hi> § 7. Tiberius <hi>his</hi> Omens. Scribonius'<hi>s Prediction.</hi> Livias <hi>crested Chick. The Altars of the conquering Legions. His Dye cast into</hi> Apon'<hi>s Well.</hi> Galba'<hi>s Mock-prophecy.</hi> § 8. Titus <hi>and</hi> Vespasian'<hi>s Motto,</hi> Amor &amp; deliciae, <hi>in English, the desire of the Nations. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie of</hi> Mars <hi>his Oak. The Gypsies Prediction. Dirt cast by</hi> Caligula <hi>into his Shirt. The Dog bringing a Man's hand, The Oracle of the God of</hi> Carmel. <hi>His curing the Blind and Lame,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§ 1. I Would therefore here draw this Argument to a Conclusion, but that I am jealous, that the first Branch of it may possibly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against, and that Age we are speaking of denied to have been so calm, as we have reported it to be, and that because of the frequent mention of Troubles in <hi>Judea,</hi> made by <hi>Josephus, Philo, &amp;c.</hi> I shall therefore chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to incurr the censure of being tedious, than of omitting what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary towards the stopping the Mouths of unruly talkers, or depriving the Atheist of all possibility of Subterfuge from the force of this Argument, while I demonstrate that this Objection does not only, not diminish from, but adds to its strength.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Commotions in <hi>Jury,</hi> the uneavenness of that hilly Country, no more hinder the smoothness of the Universe, than Mountains (those Wens of the Earth) hinder the roundness of it; being no more considerable (in so vast a Body) than a few Nail-heads on the Rim of a Wheel: a point Mathematically demonstrable in the Moons Eclipse, upon whose Body the Earth (notwithstanding those Exuberances) casts the shadow of hers so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly circular, as the most piercing Eye cannot detect it of the least inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This is the highest account these Judean Stirs can amount to, though we cast into the sum, those (perhaps) over-weight Aggravations thrown
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43715:52"/>
into the Scales; either by <hi>Philo,</hi> on purpose to heighten <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Tyranny, and the Divine Indulgence to his Nation, in preserving it from ruine under his Oppressions. <hi>(Philo de legatione ad Caium) [Valeant igitur humana prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidia quae nos deserunt, modò in anima spes firma maneat Deum nobis servato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem non defore, qui saepe gentem hanc eripuit exitio] (pag.</hi> 637.) Or by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus;</hi> that he might present the sufferings of that People equivalent to their sin, which he equals to <hi>Sodoms;</hi> telling us, he believes, the Land was so polluted, as, had not the Romans purged it by the fire of that deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating War, God would have expiated the sins of it, by Fire and Brimstone poured down from Heaven upon it. <hi>(Joseph. de bel.

Towards the latter end of</hi> Claudius, <hi>and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of</hi> Nero'<hi>s Reign,</hi> Felix <hi>indeed with a servile Genius (as a beggar on horse-back) vapoured over them in all kind of licentiousness and cruelty; yet the patience of the Jews held out, and they did not make insurrection, until</hi> Florus <hi>became Governour of</hi> Judea <hi>in</hi> Nero'<hi>s 11. year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. This blustering in <hi>Jewry</hi> was so far from being an <hi>Euroclydon</hi> to overturn to the Packet-boats, or a cross Wind to stop Intelligence; as it proved as fair a gale as could blow, to wast over the knowledge of what fell out there touching our Saviour, into the rest of the Empire, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it still less possible to the Apostles to delude the World; to whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, had it been the wild Oats of their own Invention, these blasts would have proved a fanning Wind, and have scatter'd it as chaff before them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For these Stirs, being about Religion, <hi>(Christo impulsore)</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> states them, <hi>(Sueton. Claud. 25.)

While the Jew clamoured against the Christian, as unworthy to live, and impleaded him at the Bar of the Roman Ministers of State; and the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Law prohibited the proceding against the accused <hi>(indictâ causâ) [Lex Sempronia; nè quis indictâ causâ] (Cicero pro Cluentio)</hi> till he had been heard what he could say for himself: the Roman Magistrates, before whom these Contests were determinable, are necessitated to bring the Antagonists face to face, and to hear the Business in question disputed <hi>pro &amp; con.</hi> by Plaintiff and Defendant, by Jew and Christian. <hi>(Act. 25. 16.)

               <p>Thus <hi>Felix,</hi> though he had a mind to do the Jews a pleasure, and make St. <hi>Paul</hi> pay his old scores he had run himself into, by his pillaging that Nation, and cast him, as a <hi>bolus,</hi> into the mouth of that <hi>Cerberus</hi> which was open'd against him in complaints to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet so well does St. <hi>Paul</hi> manage his Cause before him, as he durst not deliver him up to their fury, having, by hearing St. <hi>Paul</hi> defend himself and his Religion in the presence of his Adversaries, attain'd <hi>to a more perfect knowledge of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian way than he had before; (Act.</hi> 22. 24.)</p>

(Philo Jud. de legatione ad Caium.)</hi> Yet this <hi>Agrippa</hi> (bribed for the Plaintiff by so violent a zeal) upon hearing <hi>Festus</hi> make report of the issue of the Trial before him, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s allegations in his own defence, had like to have given Sentence for Christian Religion against the Jewish, being almost perswaded to become a Christian, and did give Sentence for St. <hi>Paul</hi> against his Adversaries: <hi>This man hath done nothing worthy of bonds, much less of death: but might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.

For if we trace St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cause to the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thence to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal; the ratling of his Chain there makes the Gospel more famous, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12, 13.) alarms the Court to make more dilgent enquiry into those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies in <hi>Judea</hi> concerning Christ; for maintaining the Truth whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> was accused of the Jews and had appealed unto <hi>Caesar;</hi> before whom for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have stood in defence of what he had taught, had been an Act of most temerarious madness, if it had been in the power of the most viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vigilant Adversaries, by bringing his Doctrine to a scrutiny, (and that before Judges disaffected to it) to have fastened upon it the least imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or but suspicion, of Forgery.</p>

               <p>But what legitimate Historian did ever apply, to well-settled Princes, Prophecies that were not of undoubted Credit? (It could not but add to the esteem of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, that <hi>Jaddus</hi> should tell <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that a Grecian Prince should subdue the Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; which <hi>Alexander</hi> interpreting of himself, it fell out accordingly; <hi>(Joseph. Ant,</hi> 11. 8.) Or what Prince, that had a just Title to his own, was ever induc'd to grasp at a foreign Crown, upon suggestions taken up out of the high way. That Oracle, therefore, which this Pair-royal of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Historians (both for Prudence and Sincerity) do with joynt consent apply to such Royal Persons, the application of which to themselves those Persons shew no disgust against, but a relishing of; must have been a Nail fastened by Masters of Assemblies so deep in Roman minds, as rendred it a sure Nail, and able to bear all the weight they hang upon it; and of such repute and esteem, as to engage the Empire to cast a watchful Eye over the Occurrences in <hi>Judea</hi> (the place assigned for the appearance of this great King of Kings) even from the first dawning of of that time which they conceived the Oracle pointed at: and an evil and envious Eye upon the Preachers of the Gospel, from that time they began to publish the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it in our Jesus. Of both which points we have sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in those historical Tables, wherein we have the Complexion of that Age drawn by the Pagans Pencils.</p>
               <p>§ 4. First, That the Roman State had a strict Eye upon that Prophecy and (upon its account) on the Judean Affairs, from the time that the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it was suspected to bear Date, and its Effects to take place, may be gathered from the appearance of those great Spirits, in that nick of time, the like of whom the Roman Earth had not produc'd in that long Tract of preceding Ages, as to their Ambitions of settling an Universal Monarchy in their own persons. Is it not strange that the juvenile Age (as <hi>Florus</hi> calls it) of that State, which teemed with far braver Spirits in all other respects, brought not forth a <hi>Caesar</hi> or a <hi>Pompey,</hi> who could not brook either Superiour or Equal? but that Persons of that temper must be reserved for the confines of that season, wherein one was to be born who should Lord it over the World? Was it through the defect of favourable Constellations, or not rather through the Influence of the Prophecy concerning the the Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that the Blood of <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> ran down so many Generations, before it could make so happy a Conjunction with the Blood of <hi>Venus</hi> (running from <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> in the Veins of the Julian Family) as to produce a <hi>Caesar;</hi> one whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could content but to be (in <hi>Martial</hi>'s phrase) <hi>omnia solus,</hi> in plain English, King of the Company? Let the Star-gazer try his skill here, in Calculating the Nativities of <hi>Caesar</hi> and his Progenitors: and if, in compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Schemes, he find any so material Difference as this, that they were born before, but he after the divulging of this Propheey, he shall be my great <hi>Apollo.</hi> In the interim I shall take the boldness to opine, that that famous Oracle was the Soul of their Courage, the Mark of their Ambition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In which Opinion I am no little confirm'd, when I observe how these Candidates for the Universal Monarchy, <hi>Pompey, Caesar, Augustus, M. Anthony, &amp;c.</hi> courted the Jews good will (just as they did the Peoples of <hi>Rome</hi> when they stood in Competition for Offices at their disposal) with Indulgences un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual to be conferr'd upon Nations far better deserving (for all that fidelity
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43715:54"/>
and service of theirs to the Romans, upon which <hi>Josephus</hi> grounds those favours, being in that more partial to his Country-men, than in any other passage of his History; for of all Nations they bare the Roman Yoak with most Impatience:) and with such fawning obsequiousness, as was scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming either the Majesty of the Roman State, or the loftinefs of those Mens Minds, whom the ambitious hopes of obtaining the <hi>Penelope</hi> of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Monarchy spur'd on to those daring engagements against the whole World; and when their united force had conquer'd that, against one another: had they not conceived that the readiest Expedient to gain the Mistress, was to obtain the good Will of the Handmaid; that he who was to be King of Clubs in the World (to rule it with a Rod of Iron) must first be King of Hearts in <hi>Jewry,</hi> and sit upon the Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> with a golden Sceptre of Benevolence reached out as a Lure to their Affections, as a mean to obtain from the Jews an Opinion that he loved their Nation, and was therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the highest honours that could be heap'd upon him. And had not this Conceit been taken up and cherished, partly by their misinterpreting <hi>[Oriundus]</hi> in the Prophecy, as not importing that that King of Kings was to have in <hi>Judea</hi> a Natural Birth, as a man, but a Civil one, as a Monarch: This is manifest from their applying this Prophecie to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> who was not born Man in <hi>Judea,</hi> but only there proclaim'd, or (as <hi>Josephus</hi> more sutably to the Roman Notion stiles it) created Emperour. <hi>By this Oracle</hi> (saith he) <hi>was manifestly portended the Empire of</hi> Vespasian, <hi>who</hi> was Creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Emperour in</hi> Judea. <hi>(Bel. Jud.</hi> 7. 12.) For in very deed he was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Empercur before, by the Legion of <hi>Maesia</hi> which was sent to aid <hi>Otho:</hi> who hearing he had lost the day, and kill'd himself, march'd on neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, plundering and spoiling, as far as <hi>Apuleia:</hi> and fearing at their return they should be called to an account, they elect <hi>Vespasian</hi> Emperour; but this, saith <hi>Suetonius</hi> was not reputed legal: and therefore <hi>Vespasian</hi> would not date the beginning of his Reign from that, but from <hi>Tiberius Alexander</hi> his proclaiming him, and making the Legions take the Oath of Allegiance. <hi>(Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Vespasian.</hi> 6.) But this was in <hi>Egypt;</hi> how can he then be said to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Emperour in <hi>Judea? Suetonius</hi> helps us to unty this Knot, with a two-fold Note: First, his proclaiming in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi> were so near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, as the difference was indiscernable; that in <hi>Egypt</hi> being on the Calends of <hi>July;</hi> that in <hi>Judea</hi> the 5. of the Ides: or as <hi>Tacitus</hi> dates it, the Nones of the same Month <hi>(Histor.</hi> 2.) that is, but one day betwixt them; however, <hi>Aegypt</hi> got the start of <hi>Judea</hi> by so much. Yea, but secondly, the Egyptian Legions proclaimed him his absence; he was present and in the Head of the Judean Regiments, when he was proclaimed by them. <hi>(Suet. Vespas. 6.)</hi> Observe here what shifts the Writers of that Age were put to, that they might make the Prophecy fit <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as one that was born, not Man, but Monarch, in that place which the Oracle assigned for him, that was to be sole Lord of the World.</p>
               <p>The wresting of the Prophecy to this sence was one of those Wings which bore up the contenders for the Universal Monarchy, in their pursuit after the favour of the Jews and Jewish Legions. The other was the art the Jews had to dub any one a Jew, whom they pleased; to adopt into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Line, those that came not from the Loyns of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by that means to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him for the Rule of the Universe, who could creep into their favour. <hi>[Other men who are not Jews born, if they live after their Law, are called Jews:]</hi> saith <hi>Dion,</hi> an Historian, so far from favouring either Jew or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, as on the same page (speaking of our God) he saith, whatsoever God he be, <hi>(Dion. l.</hi> 37.) Of which Art they gave a notable Experiment upon <hi>Herod Agrippa;</hi> who bursting out into tears, at his hearing that passage of the Law read, <hi>[Thou shalt set one of thy brethren King over thee, and not a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger] (Deuteron.</hi> 17. 15.) was cheared by this general Acclamation of the Synagogue, Be of good chear, King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> thou art our Brother; <hi>(Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot harm.</hi> 130.) our Brother on the surer side, by Religion, though not by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43715:54"/>
Blood. A Brother of this Make was <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, whom some Jews took for the <hi>Messiah (Euseb. chronic. ex Epiphanio, lib. 1. tom. har.</hi> 20.) conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his being a Proselyte in Religion (though an Edomite by birth) did sufficiently qualifie him; and concluding that the Sceptre being now departed (as indeed it was in the Vulgar sence) from <hi>Juda,</hi> the full time of <hi>Messiah</hi>'s Exhibition was come, according to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy: a Conclusion cannot be avoided, except we take the two Clauses of that Prophecy <hi>conjunctim,</hi> and interpret the departure of the Sceptre, to denote the final Extirpation and Unpeopling of that Nation; that is <hi>Judah</hi> shall not cease to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, till <hi>Messiah</hi> come and the Gentiles be gathered to him. (But of this elsewhere.)</p>
               <p>Upon these two Principles, [It is enough to qualifie a person for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Monarchy, that he be created Emperour in <hi>Judea;</hi> or the utmost which the Prophecy requires is, that he who gains that prize be a Jewish Proselyte:] they that ran in this Race strain'd hard to obtain the good will of the Jews, andto be esteemed favourers of them and their Religion. To the obtaining whereof, how far those Roman Competitors proceded, <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> expresseth at large, in that whole Chapter, whose Title is, Of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours confer'd upon the Jews by the Romans <hi>(Antiq.</hi> 14. 17.) And how far <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> by name, had obliged that Nation, appears from <hi>Suetonius (Julius</hi> 84.) his ranking the Jews as chief Mourners, of all Foreigners, at his Obsequies, continuing many nights and days to frequent his Sepulchre, with grievous lamentations, as if the anointed of the Lord (shall I say) or their anointed Lord, the breath of their Nostrils; of whom they said, under his shadow we shall grow up into the promised Kingdom, had been snatch'd away from them. <hi>Augustus</hi> came not much behind him in this Race, nor <hi>Tiberius;</hi> witness <hi>Philo</hi> [Augustus <hi>jussit è suis ipsius reditibus offerri quotidie victimas, viz. tuurum &amp; agnos duos; sinebat Judaeos solos coetus facere, &amp;c.]</hi> Augustus <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the daily sacrifices should be offer'd, to wit, an Oxe and two Lambs at his own charge; he permitted the Jews alone liberty of publick assembling,</hi> &amp;c. Tiberius <hi>at the Jews intreaty caused</hi> Pilate <hi>to remove the consecrated Shields out of his Palace; and during his whole Reign protected the Religion of the Jews.</hi> [Julia Augusta <hi>ornavit Templum hoc aureis phialis, calicibus &amp; aliis donis plurimis &amp; pretiosissimis: cùm habeas tot exempla domestica optimae erga nos voluntatis—serva quae illi omnes ad unum conservarunt (Agrippae apologia:) (Philo Jud. legatione, pag. 647.) And</hi> Julia Augusta, <hi>adorn'd the Temple of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>with golden Vials, Cups, and many other most precious gifts seing therefore (saith</hi> Agrippa <hi>in his Apology) you have so many home examples of good will to the Jews, be you also benevolent to them, as every one of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. That those Competitors had in their Eye, and were animated to those stupendious Undertakings by, the Eastern Oracle; at least made use of the Worlds Credulity in that point, towards the establishing themselves in the Empire: grows upon me almost into an Article of Humane Faith, when I ponderate the Arts they used to bring the World into a perswasion, that they were men pointed at from Heaven, as more than men, and destined to Honours beyond humane Capacity.</p>

The Senate gave him the Title of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and ordered a temple to be built and dedicated to Liberty, with this Inscription on his Ivory Statue <hi>[The Unconquerable God]</hi> and that his Image should be erected in the Capitol by the ancient K. standing upon the Globe of the World, with this Inscription; <hi>Semideus est.

But <hi>Tully</hi> washeth the Ethiopian, while he seeks to eradicate the belief of this Prophecy out of the minds of the People; or to disswade the Great Ones from giving out themselves for the persons pointed at in this Oracle. For though <hi>Augustus</hi> rejected the Title of Lord (as also that of Emperour) and made shew, once, of deposing the Imperial Crown; yet in those pretensions to humility, this Politick Prince set his face counter to the Stairs towards which he rowed, and as to his ambition of the Universal Crown, his History is far more fertile of such like stratagems than <hi>Julius</hi>'s. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> reckons no less than 17 Prodigies, which spoke <hi>Augustus</hi> to be a person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by Heaven for that Universal Monarchy, or something equivalent to it.

               <p>The same <hi>Atia,</hi> while she was with Child of <hi>Augustus,</hi> dreamt that she saw her Entrails trailing round about the Earth, and the whole Circumference of Heaven: and her Husband, that he saw a Sun-beam dart out of her Womb <hi>(Suetonius Octav. 94.)

                  <hi>P. Nigidius,</hi> (on that Day wherein <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conspiracy was discust,) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his Father <hi>Octavius</hi> to come tardy to the Senate (as having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at home till his Wife was brought a Bed of <hi>Augustus)</hi> enquiring the Hour, and Calculating his Nativity, affirmed with much Vehemency, <hi>[Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum terrarum orbi natum.] (Sueton. ibid)</hi> that a Child born that hour would become Lord of the Universe <hi>(Nigidius,</hi> in Calculating the time of King <hi>Messiah</hi>'s Birth, shot not so wide of the Mark set by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as many of our commentators do, who have the Accomplishment of his Prophecy to give them aim: <hi>(Vide Meed, Daniels</hi> Weeks.)</p>
               <p>A like Prediction <hi>Octavius</hi> received from the Thracian Priests, of whom he asked the Fortune of his Son; and was confirmed in the Beleif of it when the Day following his Son (or the Devil in his shape) appeared to him, in a Form more August than that of a Mortal, with a Scepter, a Thunder-bolt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Jove's</hi> Accoutrements, as if he had been his express Image.</p>
               <p>I shall shut up the Legend of <hi>Augustus</hi> with the Dreams of <hi>Cicero,</hi> (an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my both to Dreams and Monarchy) yet he, the first time he took Notice of <hi>Augustus,</hi> (but then a Youth) affirmed he had, the Night before, seen such a Boy as that standing at the Gate of the Capitol, to whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave a Whip: And of <hi>Quintus Catulus,</hi> who saw <hi>Jove</hi> deliver to him the Seal of the Common-wealth, take him into his Bosom, present him to the Noble Youths as the Umpirer of all Controversies, and lifting his own hand up to his Mouth after <hi>Augustus</hi> had kissed it, Manifest Transcripts of those Texts, wherein the <hi>Messiah</hi> is presented as one whom we must hear, whom we must kiss; as one in the bosom of the Father, and to whom is committed the Key of the House of David, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherewith, if those Persons had not been preoccupated, and either read, or heard them in the Day, it could never have come into Mens Minds, in the Night, to dream at this rate: Neither can there be a better Reason given, why the Romans should feign, fancy, and fasten such things as these upon their Emperours; than that they might, by these Lures, draw the Eyes of the World to expect the fulfilling of the Eastern Prophecy in these Persons.</p>
               <p>§ 7. But of the same Mint came those Presages which were coyned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Such as that of the famous Mathematician <hi>Scribonius,</hi> who while <hi>Tiberius</hi> was yet a Child, promised great things of him; and amongst others, this, that he should be a King without Kingly Ensigns or Badges of Royalty. <hi>Suetonius (Tiberius,</hi> 8.) imputes the later part of this Prediction to the Author's not being acquainted with the Grandeur of the <hi>Caesars:</hi> but in reason it should be father'd upon his acquaintance with the Oriental Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which presents the King of Kings his coming without external Pomp.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43715:57"/>
And that of <hi>Livia,</hi> who casting many Figures to find out whether she was with Child of a Boy or Girl, among the rest, took an Egge from under an Hen, which in her own and Maids bosome she hatch'd, till there came forth a cristed Bird, a young Cock, that must teach the old ones to crow up <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> to be that white one, that Darling of Fortune, to whom the Fates had decreed the universal Crown: A Crown which the East held in her hand for him; of which he received an assurance, when the sacred Fire kindl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of its own accord upon the Altars at <hi>Philippi</hi> (dedicated to the memory of the conquering Legions) as he passed by them in his Eastern Expedition into <hi>Syria. (Suetonius ibid.)</hi> The likeliest piece of Leger-de-main the Serpent could possibly play, to fascinate that Region into a belief that he was their promised King; among whom, answering by Fire had formerly been reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a final Determination of the Contest betwixt God and Baal; and in whose Records, Fire is frequently mention'd as a Precursor to the Exhibition of their <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this that story is akin, of the appearance of Fire issuing out of his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick while he lay at <hi>Rhodes:</hi> an Omen far before the Eagles liting upon the top of his House, and not inferiour to the lucky chance he had at Passage, for the umpiring of that grand Question then in the World, which of the Pretenders was the true Heir to the Universal Crown? saving that those flash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were transient; but the Golden Die, which he cast into <hi>Apon</hi>'s Well, by the advice of <hi>Gerious</hi> Oracle, was in the days of <hi>Suetonius</hi> (as himself testifies) to be seen in the bottom of the Water, presenting uppermost the highest number.</p>
               <p>What needed all this ado to render these persons, in the repute of the World, fit to wear the Diadem, as being more than men; but that the World had learn'd, by the Eastern Prophecy, that he whose due it was, was to be God-man: or, in the Roman Phrase,—<hi>Chara Deum soboles:</hi> what need was there to draw the Lions Skin upon these Emperours, but to make them look like the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> to make the Pagan Emperour, that mock Christ; the eldest Son of Perdition, be taken for the Christ, the King of Kings. Let me here observe the policy of this <hi>Vafrous</hi> wit <hi>Tiberius</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Judaean Crown from the surprisal of others, but especially of the Jews themselves; after the History of our Saviour was come to light (for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> hints that Stratagem as laid after Christs passion) from whom, and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> (his <hi>Tiberius</hi> 36.) we learn, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> (notwithstanding the love he pretended to that Nation, commended upon that account by <hi>Philo,)</hi> practised to weaken the Strength, and abate the courage of the Jews, by distributing their Youth, under pretence of training them up in Martial Discipline, into Provinces far distant from <hi>Judaea,</hi> and colder Climates; four Thousand of which, for instance, were sent into <hi>Sardis:</hi> why this pretence? but to cloak his drift from the Jews Eyes, whose Favour he thought was necessary, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his being born King of the Jews when time serv'd: and why must that Nations strength be thus weaken'd by dispersing their Youth through the Provinces? but to prevent their snatching at the Eastern Monarchy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galba</hi> (for to produce the Arts which every Emperour used, of this tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would be an abuse of my Readers Patience) was invited by <hi>Vindex</hi> to the accepting of the Empire, in words as fully expressing the Eastern Prophecy, as the Tongue of man can utter: <hi>Ut humano generi assertorem ducemque se accommodaret (Sueton. Galba,</hi> 9.) that he would lend himself to Man-kind as its Saviour and Leader: And encouraged to undertake it, by an Oracle as like that of God's, touching his Christ, as if they both had come out of the same Mouth, but that the Drivel of the Serpent bewrays its Original in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scene, in putting <hi>Spain</hi> in the room of <hi>Jury.</hi> The sence of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (saith <hi>Suetonius)</hi> was this: That one was to arise out of <hi>Spain</hi> who was to be Prince and Lord over all. Observe, by the way, the Roman Sence of <hi>Oriundus,</hi> (of which before) for <hi>Galba</hi> came not out of <hi>Spain</hi> as a Native; but that being his Province, there he first erected his Emperial Standard: and

withal, the Craft of <hi>Galba,</hi> in taking the advantage of this utmost Western Province its distance from the East, to impose upon the Legions there resid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this gloss of the Oriental Oracle; that that Person, whose coming the whole World was expecting, was to come out of <hi>Spain.</hi> But to return to our Spanish Oracle; this was brought to him by an honest Maid, who came fortified with this Story; that a Priest of <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> admonish'd by a Dream, had haled it out of the Repository of that God's Temple, having been uttered two hundred Years ago by a Woman Prophetess. Perhaps <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> attempted to redeem <hi>Gallia</hi> with the aid of those ten Thousand Fanaticks, who esteemed that sordid Peasant a God: upon the Encouragement of the Fame of this Prophecy; his Story <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates <hi>(Histor. l. 2. pag.</hi> 310.</p>

Vespas.</hi> 5.) that is, in the Prophets Language; the Pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand: <hi>Heylin (Cosmography Syria, Phaenicia,</hi> 689.) thinks the Heathen called the Jews God <hi>Carmelus,</hi> from that Familiarity that <hi>Elias</hi> had with him on the Mount <hi>Carmel;</hi> and that miraculous Experiment by which he confuted <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prophets there, gave them the ground of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that Oracles were given there by God: If this was a Respond of the God of <hi>Israel</hi>'s; he answered <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and those Jewish Priests that consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Oracle, after their own Heart, and according to that Idol of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> they had set up, having rejected the substance.</p>

Jud.</hi> 5. 12.) which Presages he (being a Priest) father'd upon the spirit of God's Revelation to him: of these Predictions of <hi>Josephus Suetonius</hi> (in the same place) makes mention. As also of an Eagle coming from the East, and chasing away that, which had (in the sight of the Armies) conquered ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eagle in the Battel of <hi>Betrick;</hi> where <hi>Otho</hi>'s Army was discomfited by <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and a while after <hi>Vitellius</hi> by <hi>Vespasian.</hi>

Tit.</hi> 3.) the true Son of such a Father, as could not only counterfeit Mens Hands, but God's Arm, that Arm that rules for him!</p>
               <p>Whether these Stories were feigned, or true, as most of them, and those the unlikeliest, doubtless were; there being many Eye Witnesses of them alive and testifying the Truth of them long after his Death, when they had no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to lye, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirms <hi>(Histor. lib.</hi> 4.) and <hi>Suetonius</hi> his Father then serving in the Wars, as Tribune of the tenth Legion. Whether those strange things were the Effects of Satanical Power, or the Gifts of God to that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, marking him out for that signal Service he performed against <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> (as the excellent Doctor <hi>Juxon,</hi> if my memory fails me not, hath somewhere expressed) is not here to be discust: for it comes all to one, as to the use I make of these Relations: which I produce to prove, that by these means <hi>Vespasian</hi> came to be look'd upon as the Person pointed at in the orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prophecy: and this is no more than is with one Mouth asserted by all those three Historians, who, in a manner, were upon the place where these things were done.</p>
               <p>That Authority and Majesty (saith <hi>Suetonius) (Vespasian,</hi> 7.) that was wanting to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in respect of the obscurity of his Family; was by such Omens and Prodigies made up: <hi>Authoritas, &amp; quasi majestas quaedam, ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinato &amp; adhuc novo principi deerat, accessit haec quoque, &amp;c.</hi> Upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the many Signs fore-shewing his Reign (saith <hi>Josephus) (Bel. Jud.</hi> 5. 12.) it was thought that <hi>Vespasian</hi> came to the Empire by God's special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that a certain just order of Fate had brought about the whole World to his Obedience. And <hi>Tacitus (Ibid. lib.</hi> 4.) writes, that by those Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Contingencies, the Favour of Heaven, and the Inclination of the Gods towards him was manifestly declared; and by them <hi>Vespasian</hi> was so animated, as he thought nothing impossible to him, or without the Verge of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: <hi>Multa miracula evenere queis coelestis favor &amp; quaedam in</hi> Vespasianum <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio numinum ostenderetur—Igitur cuncta fortunae suae patere ratus: nec quicquam últro incredibile.</hi>

               <p>§ 1. THese were their secret Practices to wind themselves into the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eastern Kingdom; in all which they cast a corner of the eye, (and that which they took aim with) upon the Oriental Prophecy, and upon its account on the concern of <hi>Judea.</hi> We shall now give such Instances of their open and over-board Practices, as speak those great ones, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd with the hopes of the Universal Monarchy, to have had their Eye and Ear open to every Leaf that fell there, where the Throne was to be erected.</p>

                  <hi>Cleopatra</hi> expressed her extream desire of the Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> in her seeking to undermine <hi>Herod's</hi> Interest in <hi>M. Antony</hi>'s Affections: which when she could not effect, she attempts to ensnare <hi>Herod</hi> in the Cords of Love, sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting him to the use of her body, by all the Allurements which her Craft or Wantonness could suggest <hi>(Joseph. Ant. lib. 15. cap.</hi> 4.) But the old Fox smelt the Train, and escap'd the Trap, (though baited with that Flesh, for the enjoyment whereof, his Master <hi>Antony</hi> lost both Crown and Life) and withal so well perceived what thirst the Queen of <hi>Egypt</hi> had after the Waters of <hi>Israel,</hi> as he was once minded to have quench'd it in her Blood, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that nothing else, save the enjoyment of <hi>Judea</hi>'s Crown, could satiate her Longings; <hi>(Id. ib. cap.</hi> 5.) towards the obtaining whereof, when these Methods proved ineffectual, she betakes her self to the all conquering Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Tears and Prayers, beleaguering <hi>Antony</hi> with dayly Requests, and endearing Arguments that Wit or Love could invent to assault his Mind with, whose heart, she knew, lay already at her Feet. But <hi>Antony</hi> turns a deaf Ear to his <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Suit, bribes her to hold her Peace by giving her <hi>Coelo-Syria,</hi> but will by no means hear of parting with <hi>Judea</hi>'s Crown, no not to her that is dearer to him than his Life. <hi>(Id. Ibid cap.</hi> 4.) What makes him, in this Case, thus inexorable? had it been his Respects to <hi>Herod,</hi> his Affection to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> would more than have counter-ballanc'd that; was it the largeness of that Kingdoms Bounds? for Bulk it was the wreckling of all Kingdoms; too mean a Gift for <hi>Antony</hi> to bestow on <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> if in his Surveigh of it he had not taken in the Eastern Prophecy, and valued it according to the rate which that had set upon it. Whose Crown, while <hi>Herod</hi> held, he only held the Stakes, till the Game was up that <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> were a playing: had the Emperial fallen to his Lot, <hi>Herod</hi>'s Diadem would have been at his Devotion: he might, when he saw an Opportunity have taken it off his Head (who was but a Deputy King) and set it upon his own with a wet Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but not from <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s with dry Cheeks. But <hi>Antony,</hi> as a Man ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminated, doth but lisp out his Emulation of this Crown, his envying that any head should wear it as absolutely his, but his own.</p>

Contempt of Death, and Gallantry of Spirit could set them at: A War managed with a greater Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit than the Pregnant Wit of <hi>Homer</hi> could fancy in his describing the Wars of <hi>Troy:</hi> and (to say all in Word) answerable to the esteem which both Parties had of that <hi>Helena</hi> for whom they contended; <hi>(Joseph.

               <p>Particularly, that this was the Prize which the Jew ran for in that Race is manifest from the clear Testimonies of <hi>Josephus, (Bel. Jud.</hi> 7. 12.) saying, That which chiefly excited the Jews to this War was an Ambiguous Oracle found in their Sacred Books, that about that time some one was to arise in their Coasts that should obtain the Empire of the Globe of the Earth. And of <hi>Suetonius (Vespasian</hi> 4.) who, speaking of the Eastern Oracle, tell us, that the Jews applying it to themselves was that which occasioned and encouraged them to rebel. <hi>Id Judaei ad se trahentes rebellarunt;</hi> for our confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the truth of those Evidences, beside the Credit of the Authors, we have the Qualifications of the Persons who fomented this Rebellion, of the Ring-leaders of this Defection; who were those Impostors, that by Magical Tricks perswaded the unwary Multitude, that they were either the Christ or his Fore-runners: in this second Rank I martial them, who drew Disciples into the Wilderness; the Stage erected by the Prophets, for that Cryer that was to prepare the way for the <hi>Messiah;</hi> before whom these Anti-baptists plain the Way by levelling the Roman Power set over them by God, by with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribute, and surprising Castles, by excluding <hi>Caesar</hi> out of their Prayers and Sacrifices; which was, saith <hi>Josephus,</hi> the Seminary and <hi>Fomes</hi> of the

Ant. Jud.</hi> 10. 3.) The last of this Galilean's Sons that trod in his Father's Steps was this <hi>Menahem</hi> (of whom that Story may very well be intended that Doctor <hi>Lightfoot (Harmony</hi> § 9.) quotes out of the Gomarists) who, taking with him certain of the Nobility, went to <hi>Massada</hi> Castle, where was <hi>Herod</hi>'s Armory; and arming himself and his Company, marches to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> as a King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to this Point <hi>Josephus</hi> speaks home <hi>(Jud.

He question'd them about Christs Kingdom; where, and when, and in what manner it should come: to which they answering, It was not Earthly, but Coelestial, that it should be at the End of the World, when he would come to Judg the Quick and the Dead:</hi> he not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist them, as too mean Persons to be his Rivals, but stayed the Persecution formerly raised against the Church; perceiving he had no Ground to fear that the Christians would raise any Commotions in the Empire upon the Account of the Eastern Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Which yet he so much feared from the Circumcision, as when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that some of them lived <hi>incognito</hi> in <hi>Rome, he caused a privy Search to be made of all suspected Persons; among whom</hi> Suetonius reports, <hi>that when he was a Youth, he saw the Emperour's Attourney in open Court search one Old Man of Ninety Years.

               <p>Under <hi>Trajan, Simeon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was put to Death for no other Crime, but that he was accused to have been of the Blood Royal, and lineal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descended from <hi>David</hi>'s Loins: <hi>(Euseb. ec. hist.</hi> 3. 29.) an Argument that <hi>Trajan</hi> cast as envious an Eye as his Predecessors had done upon the Eastern Oracle; and upon that Account on Christians, but unjustly: Though he had Reason enough to be jealous of the Jews, who blustered in his eighteenth Year, <hi>(Dionis, Nerva, Trajanus)</hi> as if they had been possessed of a Raging, Seditious, and Fanatick Spirit, and kindled so Firie a Sedition at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> under their upstart Kings <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> as could not be quench'd, but by the Blood of many Myriads of them: with what more than Anabaptistical Cruelty the Cyrenians sought to establish their Mock-Christ King; <hi>Dion</hi> in the Life of <hi>Trajan</hi> declares, telling us that their Sword made no difference betwixt Romans and Grecians, that not content with their Swords drinking of Blood, themselves eat the Flesh of the Slain; with whose Skins apparell'd, and Entrails (yet bleeding) girt, they ran up and down like Furies, and birkened those whom they met with from the Rump to the Crown of the Head; putting to Death above twenty Thousand. The Cyprian Jews (as the same Author relates) at the same time, and upon the same occasion, used that more than Savage Cruelty in Butchering twenty five Thousand in that Island, as produc'd the enacting of a Law, that whatever Jew should thence-forward touch upon their Coast should presently be put to Death. This made <hi>Trajan</hi> jealous of the Jews of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> lest they should joyn Forces with their Brethren; as they of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had done, in defence of their home-spun

               <p>§ 4. In the eighteenth Year of his Successor <hi>Adrian,</hi> the Eastern Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ripens the Jews into another Rebellion, under the Conduct of another Changling-<hi>Messiah, Barchochebas;</hi> that Son of the Star (as his Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,) who gave out himself to be that Star of <hi>Jacob</hi> who was come from Heaven, as a Light to shine comfortably upon the Jews, and conduct them out of the Roman Bondage. It is not unworthy of Observation that this Antichrist was as virulent an Enemy to the Christians as Romans, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Quarrel, <hi>viz.</hi> their affirming that the Oriental Prophecy had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received its Accomplishment. For in that general Point they agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jew, to the utter vacating of <hi>Barchochebas</hi> his Claim: though they vastly dissented in their applying of it, the one to our Jesus, the other to the Roman Emperour <hi>(Spartian. Adrian.)</hi> The occasion of this Rebellion (saith <hi>Spartianus)</hi> was <hi>Adrian</hi>'s prohibiting them Circumcision; fearing, be like, that Nation would never suffer the Romans quietly to enjoy the Possession of the Universal Monarchy as long as the Seal of the Covenant of the <hi>Messiah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with them; as long as they were permitted to bear that mark in their Flesh, which was instituted as a Sign that the King of Nations was to come from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins: For why else should he forbid it to them, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, but because other Nations used it only as a Religious Mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Rite; but the Jews over and beside that, as a Political Badg, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from all others, as that Nation which God had singled out to this peculiar Privilege, that he who was to reduce the whole World to his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was to come out of that Stock, <hi>[Oriundus esset ex</hi> Judaea.] From hope of which that he might force them to an absolute Despondency; he erected a Temple to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> affronting the Ruines of that which had been the Temple of the God of <hi>Abraham;</hi> upbraiding them with the Imbecillity of that God whereon they depended, as not able to preserve his own Sacrifices from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Prey to the Roman Eagle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Insurrection</hi> (saith <hi>Dion) caused a Concussion in the whole World:</hi> indeed, as the contending Parties stated the Case, the whole World was concern'd in it, the Question being whether <hi>Barchochab,</hi> or the Roman Emperour, was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son specified in the Eastern Tradition? which Question, though it was in the Effect and Issue of that War, determin'd against the Jew; who was not only routed in that Fight, but had five Hundred of his most eminent strong Holds dismantled, nine Hundred eighty and five of his most Populous and Famous Towns sack'd and burn'd down to the Ground, and fifty Thousand of men of Arms slain, and a very great Multitude consum'd with Famine, Fire, and raging Maladies; insomuch as almost all <hi>Judea</hi> was turn'd into a Forrest (a Desolation answerable to the Presages of it: <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sepulchre fell flat to the Ground without hands: Wolves and Hyenas were heard howling up and down their Cities, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Yet for all this <hi>Adrian</hi> thought not himself suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently secured against his Fears of a new King arising in <hi>Judea,</hi> that might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess him of his Empire, till he had buried the Memorial of their Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis in its own Ruines, and out of them built a new City hard by the place where that had stood, calling it after his own name, <hi>Aelia:</hi> and wiped the whole Land of its Natives as a Man wipeth a Dish, making it capital for any of them so much as to look back upon their Native Soyl, no not afar off, from the Tops of Hills, as if he had been jealous that their Eye might glance and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43715:61"/>
inject the Spawn of Rebellion into that King-teeming Soil, except it were pitch'd with the foot of Strangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nerva</hi> was the only Emperour from <hi>Julius</hi> to <hi>Trajan,</hi> whom Pagan Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paints not looking asquint on <hi>Judea:</hi> the reason of that may be; either the shortness of his Reign, wherein he had scarce room to look about him, and learn the Concerns of the Empire: or the Fearless Habit of his Soul, and his Contempt of the most formidable Pretensions: having that Confidence in his own Integrity, as to assume <hi>Virginius Rufus</hi> to be his Colleague in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship, whom the Roman Legions had proclaimed Emperour; to cause <hi>Crassus Calphurnius,</hi> with the rest of his Fellow-Conspirators, to sit down by him on the Stage, and put Swords into their Hands, bidding them try whether they were sharp enough; signifying (saith my Author) he had not much cared if they had slain him upon the Place: And as to offer his naked Throat to the drawn Sword of <hi>Aelianus Casperius,</hi> accused to him of Treason, <hi>(Dion. Cos. Nerva.)</hi> How be it there is one Passage in his Story may confirm us in this Opinion; that it was a Maxim of Roman Policy, to keep a Jealous Eye over <hi>Judea:</hi> to wit, <hi>Dion</hi>'s reporting his prohibiting any of the Jewish Sect to be medled with, as the chief ground of <hi>Fronto</hi>'s Speech, that it was of evil Consequence to the Commonwealth, to have him to Reign, under whom nothing is indulged to any; but of far worse to live under him, under whom all men were wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at: in which Sarcasm <hi>Fronto</hi> reckons his Connivance at the Jews, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Act, and the Effect of his Natural Oscitancy, aggravated with dull Old Age. The Consul is the Eye of the Republick; his Eye, we see, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Judea</hi> though the Emperour's be not.</p>
               <p>We have seen the Emperours for almost, two Hundred Years, handing down to their Successors this Principle of State. Every Motion in <hi>Judea</hi> is narrowly to be observed; for from thence the East does, with the highest Confidence, expect the arising of one that shall Lord it over all States; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Time the Gospel was dayly brought under Examination before the Roman Tribunals; where the Church asserts, the Synagogue denies Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be that King: Is it possible then that in discussing that Question, and those Contingencies in <hi>Judea,</hi> which the Church alleadged in Proof of her Assertion, Interest of State should not sollicit the Agents of the Empire to the Exercise of so much more Diligence in this than other Cases brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as they apprehended the great Interest of the Empire to be more concern'd in this than in others: (the Trial of the Title to that Crown which the Eastern Prophecy made promise of, cost more Blood than has been shed in umpiring the Titles of all other Crowns:) So that upon this Account the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in <hi>Judea</hi> occasioned that severe Scrutiny of what the Church reported, as would have dash'd her out of Countenance, had those Reports been false; and have render'd it impossible for her, to shuffle any thing into the Story of Christ, which would not abide the severest Test. This Medium we have seen attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Hands of Secular Historians, of that Disaffection to Christian Religion, as it could not but be far from their thoughts, wittingly to let any thing fall from their Pens, that might be interpreted or applied to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Christian Cause: yet he that guided the Asse's Mouth to rebuke the madness of the Prophet, hath order'd the Pagan's Pen to draw that Image of those Times, as it will puzzle the most daring Atheist to invent any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Salve for his absurd Hypothesis, that possibly the Apostles (as well as the Promoters of other Religions) might impose upon the World; a Conceipt grounded merely upon his Ignorance of those Times, and especiall the then great Interest of the Empire: which that it put the Empire upon a strict Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into what the Evangelists preached: if what hath been observed be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince his Reason, I shall demonstrate it to the Atheists Sense, from matter of Fact, in the Instance of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Appearance and Apology before <hi>Nero;</hi> the only Emperour (except that short liv'd Beast <hi>Calignla,</hi> and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living Fool <hi>Claudius)</hi> whom I have omitted in my Discourse of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Jealousie the over Judean Assairs relating to the Eastern Prophecy; and

Besides, <hi>Festus</hi> could not be ignorant that <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Jews Advocate, had laid this to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Charge in open Court, <hi>that he was a Ring-leader of the Sect of the Nazarens;</hi> that is, them that held Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the promised King of the Jews. Now this having been the declared Sence of the Jewish Antagonists before <hi>Pilat,</hi> and the urging of that upon him, the thing that forc'd him, against his Conscience, to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against our Saviour: and <hi>Festus</hi> having had so fair a Warning of the Jews watching Opportunities of accusing the Roman Deputies to <hi>Caesar,</hi> by their accusing his immediate Predecessor, <hi>Foelix;</hi> would not, sure, give them that Advantage against himself, which his concealing so main a point of their Accusation, and an Article so nearly concerning <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Crown, would have administred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lysias,</hi> at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apprehension, <hi>perceiving he could speak Greek,</hi> that is, was of the Grecizing or Alexandrian Sect, questions him whether he were not that Egyptian (that is, Alexandrian Jew) who the other Day made an Uproar: For under <hi>Foelix,</hi> this Egyptian among many others) by Pretext of Miracles and Inchantments, did seduce the unwary Multitude into an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he was the Christ. Now this Question, <hi>[art not thou that Fellow who the other Day gave himself out to be the promised</hi> Messiah <hi>the King of the Jews?]</hi> coming first out of the Captains Mouth, argues what lay uppermost on his Heart, as to the faithful Discharge of his Service to <hi>Caesar:</hi> this being either particularly given in Charge, or concluded on by his own Rational Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (from that Juncture of Affairs) that the Roman Ministers of State should chiefly fix their Eyes upon such like Emergencies as boaded the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43715:62"/>
of the Eastern Prophecy: We may therefore, without offering Violence to our Reason, from the Method of <hi>Lysias</hi> his proceeding, in the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at his Attachment; calculate the Order of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Process, at his Argument; and draw this Conclusion.

               <p n="3">3. Those Expressions in the Predictions of the Fortune-tellers in <hi>Suetonius [ut destitueretur &amp; destituto ei &amp;c.] (they told</hi> Nero, <hi>that after he had been deserted of his own Subjects, and deprived of the Emperial Crown, the Crown of</hi> Judea <hi>should be set upon his Head, and with that the Sovereignty of the World.)</hi> are so exactly like the Language of the Prophets, fore-telling that the great Shepherd must first be smitten, and his Flock scattered from him, before he was to gather all Nations into his Fold; that the great King must first suffer, before he was to enter into his Glory. As the Suggestion of such like hopes to <hi>Nero</hi> could hardly proceed from any but a Jew: and a Jew well read in their own Prophets (or in the Satyrist Phrase.)

               <p n="2">2. How wide a Door to the Emperour's Ear was then opened for these Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickling Prophets, by means of that Love <hi>Nero</hi> bore to <hi>Poppaea,</hi> A zealous Jewish Proselytess, with whom it was but yet Honey-Month; <hi>Nero</hi> being but newly fallen into acquaintance with her; who would, no doubt, improve the Interest she had in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Affections, to the advantage of her Religion, some (at least) pleasing Principles whereof ('tis probable) that Night-Raven would croak into his Ears, and gain Access to him for those that professed it. Of whose Zeal for the Jews, and Influence upon the Emperour in the Motions she made in their behalf, <hi>Josephus</hi> gives Proof in two Stories.</p>
               <p>The first of himself, in these Words: (Josephi <hi>vita circa initium,) When I was twenty six Years old I went to</hi> Rome, <hi>upon this Occasion, when</hi> Foelix <hi>was Governour of</hi> Judea, <hi>he sent certain Priests my Acquaintance and very good Men, for a small Cause to</hi> Rome, <hi>to appear before Caesar; for whose Deliverance, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to find some means, went to</hi> Rome; <hi>where (by the Help of a certain Jew, great in</hi> Nero'<hi>s Favour,) coming into the Acquaintance of</hi> Poppaea Caesar's <hi>Wife,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

The other, of some Jewish Agents, that went to <hi>Rome</hi> to obtain of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that that Counter-Wall which they had built to hinder <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Prospect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, might not be demolished, as <hi>Festus</hi> had commanded; whose Suit was granted by <hi>Nero, at the Entreaty of</hi> Poppaea, <hi>a Religious Woman, and their Mediatrix (Joseph.

If it seem strange, that a Charge of this Nature could be unexpected, and not fore-thought on by them, and that they should not come armed by preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated Resolution to receive it. I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were under a peremptory Prohibition to premeditate (in this Case) what to answer: <hi>When ye are brought before Kings and Rulers, for my Name's sake, settle it in your Hearts not to meditate before, what ye shall answer; for I will give you a Mouth and Wisdom, which all your Adversaries shall not be able to gain-say or resist:</hi> (Luk. 21, 12, 13, 14, 15.) <hi>and</hi> (Mat. 10. 18.) <hi>You shall be brought before Governours and Kings, for my sake; but when they deliver you up, take no Thought, how or what to speak; for it shall be given you in that same Hour, what ye shall speak.</hi> And therefore, how obvious soever the Conjecture was, that <hi>Nero</hi> would object to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> his preaching of Jesus to be King of the Jews to be of dangerous Consequence to the Civil State; yet the Disciples were bound up from premeditating what Answer to give to that Charge: so that both Charge and Answer could not but be unexpected, and render them obnoxious to Surprisal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit intending these Tryals for a Testimony against those before whose Tribunals they were brought, did not suggest to them those kind of Answers, which were likeliest to allay the Rigour of the Charge, to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the supposed Crime, by informing the Adversaries in the Nature of Christs Kingdom (as those before <hi>Domitian:)</hi> but such as were of most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Tendency, towards the convincing of their Judges, that that Jesus was indeed, (what they were accused to preach him,) the Emperours Lord. Let the Emperial Law make it Treason to proclaim any Man above <hi>Caesar,</hi> they will not mince the Matter by Distinctions, but stand upon the Proof of what they assert; that the Man Christ is higher than the highest; and are content to undergo the utmost Penalties, if they cannot make Demonstration of this, so as <hi>Nero</hi> himself shall not be able to gainsay or resist: No Wonder then that the Disciples (having, perhaps, not yet heard of that Promise of immediate Divine Assistance, (to be sure,) not yet seen an Experiment of it,) should, as soon as they heard St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyn Issue with his Adversaries in this Point, slip away from him, as not daring to abet him in this Apology.</p>
               <p>§ 2. 4. That the great Crime which the Christian Doctrine was charged with, at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Appearance before <hi>Nero,</hi> was its applying the Eastern Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> may be evinc'd from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. 17.) stiling <hi>Nero [The Lion,] [The Lord delivered me from the Mouth of the Lion.]</hi> Which Compellation, why the Apostle should fasten upon him, I cannot, in my shallow Apprehension, fancy any other more probable Reason, than that he did it in an holy Triumphant Mockage of those Figure-flingers, by whom <hi>Nero</hi> was induc'd to hope that he should prove that Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah:</hi> His Hope not being able to bear up it self against the Evidence brought in by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in open Court, that the Throne of the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was full already, being possessed by Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> King of the Jews: From which Title of Christ, the Gospel is usually stiled <hi>the Kingdom of God:</hi> for Instance <hi>(Act.</hi> 1. 3.) where our Saviour is said to instruct his Disciples, in his forty Days Converse among them betwixt his Resurrection and Ascension, <hi>(in things concerning the Kingdom of God: (Luk. 9. 11. he spake unto them of the Kingdom of God:)</hi> not touching external Rites and Modes of Discipline, (as his pretty Petit-deputy Kings, the Disciplinarians, give us in hand.) No, St. <hi>Luke</hi> flies an higher Pitch, and means the very Gospel it self; so called, because the Sum of it is comprehended in asserting Jesus to be the Christ, the anointed King of the Jews. The Truth of which, how they should demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, from the Miracles he wrought, from his Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was the Subject of Christs then Conference with them; for that he did not so much as explain to them then the Nature of this Kingdom, but reserved that for his Vicar-general, the Holy Ghost, appears from their yet palpable Ignorance of it expressed in that Question which with one Mouth they propounded to him

In all reason, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Agrippa</hi> bare to the Roman Emperour would invite him to give the new Governour, he had sent into <hi>Judea,</hi> a visit, as soon as his occasions would permit; which, if not very urgent, must give place to his waiting upon the mouth of his Lord Paramount, to receive Instructions from <hi>Festus,</hi> as well as to congratulate his preferment: And good manners would hardly permit him, to make a burden of a visit, by any long stay with him. However, at this visit, <hi>Festus</hi> acquainting him with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Case, he desires to hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself: and on the next morrow, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is brought forth, and pleads his own Case; upon hearing of which, <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Festus</hi> consulting, it is determined that he should go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon that Determination he is forthwith sent: where, <hi>early in the Spring (after he had winter'd at</hi> Maltha) <hi>he arrives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That his first Answer before <hi>Nero,</hi> was soon after his arrival at <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> he gives <hi>Timothy</hi> an account of it, who was then at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> desiring him <hi>to come to him before winter, (2 Tim.</hi> 4. 21.) In order to which, we must allow some time for the carriage of the Letter (it being sent not by Post, but <hi>Tychichus,</hi> (whose frequent visiting the Churches in his passage would retard the delivery of it;) some to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s providing for so long a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and some to his setting things in order at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> before he could possibly leave his Charge there. Now this Episte Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> dates reasonable early, in the 5. year of <hi>Nero,</hi> and that was before he had initiated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in open and avowed Cruelty, by his Mothers blood. For the <hi>Quinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi> (at which Feast <hi>Nero,</hi> pretending a desire of reconciliation with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his flattering Letters invited her to the <hi>Baiae,</hi> to celebrate that Feast with him) was about the latter end of <hi>March, (Sueton. Nero</hi> 34) when one half of <hi>Nero</hi>'s fifth was expiring, he beginning his Reign the 13. day of <hi>October, (Sueton. Claud.</hi> 33.)</p>
               <p>And <hi>secondly,</hi> his Adversaries must have an incredible degree of Patience, more than they exprest at home, if they did not hasten his trial, that they might return home before Winter, but suffered him to stand at the Bay with them in that free custody (wherein with his Keeper <hi>he was permitted to dwell in his own hired house, and to receive all that came in unto him) (Act. 28. ult.)</hi> If those Dogs of the Circumcision gnasht their teeth at him, through the Grates of that Custody he was in, under <hi>Lysias, Felix</hi> and <hi>Festus:</hi> being so
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43715:66"/>
ragingly mad, that they could not fasten their Teeth upon him, as they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to take him, by force, out of the Guards hand, that <hi>Lysias</hi> had set upon him, to prevent their tearing him in pieces, <hi>(Act.</hi> 21. 3. and 23. 10.) set twenty Couple of Blood-hounds in lurch, to kill him, if they can but inveigle him out of the Castle-gates <hi>(Act.</hi> 23. 13, 15.) and (25. 3.) They would certainly bark at the length of his Chain, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to shorten it; and bring him to a speedy Trial, to make his Answer very early in <hi>Nero</hi>'s fifth year, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> states it. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> puts this past all doubt, when, speaking of the Acts of the Apostles, he saith, <hi>[Cujus historia usque ad biennium</hi> Romae <hi>commoranti</hi> Paulo <hi>pervenit, id est, usque ad quartum</hi> Neronis <hi>annum: ex qua intelligimus in eadem urbe librum esse compostum.] (Jeron. de viris illustribus, Lucas) [St.</hi> Luke'<hi>s History reacheth to St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s two years imprisonment at</hi> Rome, <hi>that is, to the fourth year of</hi> Nero: <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we understand that that Book of the Acts of the Apostles was writ at</hi> Rome.]</p>
               <p>§ 4. Which being premised, it remains that in the Second place I show, that at that Time St. <hi>Paul</hi> appear'd before <hi>Nero,</hi> he was so far from being visibly stain'd with Acts of Cruelty, as his <hi>Quinquennium</hi> (for the Justice of it) past into a Proverb. The Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> was wont to say, that the best Princes exceeded not <hi>Nero</hi>'s first five years. <hi>Seneca</hi> (in his Book <hi>de clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia)</hi> gives him, during those years, this <hi>Encomium: [Potes hoc,</hi> Caesar, <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare audacter, omnium quae in fidem tutelámque venerunt, nihil per te, neque vi, neque clam Reipublicae ereptum; &amp; nulli adhuc principum concessam concit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisti innocentiam; nemo unus homo uni homini tam charus unquam fuit, quàm tu populo Romano: magnum longúmque ejus bonum.] Thou maist boldly</hi> (Caesar) <hi>publish this; that of all those things which have been committed to thy trust, thou hast not either by violence or fraud robb'd the Common-weal of the least of them; and thou hast coveted (a thing which hath not been granted to any of thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors) to carry thy self innocently; neither was any one man so dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of one man, as thou art of all the people of</hi> Rome, <hi>being their great and lasting good;</hi> during which time, though he was a bad Man, yet he was a good Emperour. The Circean Cup of Court Delicacies had early metamorphos'd him, into a beast of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Stie, wallowing in all manner of Bestial Sensuality: but he was not, as yet, grown up into so fierce, tearing and bloody a Beast, as to merit the name of a Lion. He was suspected indeed to enter like a Fox, to have been acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorie to his Mother <hi>Agrippinas</hi> poysoning of <hi>Claudius,</hi> (in that he was wont to call Mushroms, <hi>the meat of the Gods;</hi> because by them, impoyson'd, his Predecessors had been translated into the number of the Immortals:) And he was principal in the Murther of <hi>Germanicus;</hi> but was so far from avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Act, as he would have the Poyson prepared in his own Closet, <hi>[Cubiculum</hi> Caesaris <hi>juxta decoquitur,] (Tacit. annal.</hi> 13. 180.) and obliged his Shee instrument to secresie, by the trible Bond of Donatives, Threats and Promises: <hi>(Suet. Nero</hi> 33.) and cast over it the Cloak of this Pretence, <hi>That the suddenness of his Brother-in-law's death was to be laid to the charge of an Apoplexy, which, to his knowledge, he had been troubled with from his Cradle, (Tacit. annal.</hi> 13. 181.)</p>
               <p>Nay, so far was <hi>Nero</hi> from reigning yet (visibly) like a Lion, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the death of <hi>Julius Silanus</hi> was procured by his Mothers craft without his knowledge; and <hi>Narcissus</hi> his, against his will: the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (besides <hi>Germanicus)</hi> whose death, as unjustly procured, is bewail'd by the Historians of that part of his Reign: <hi>[Ignaro</hi> Nerone <hi>per dolum Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinae.] [Ad mortem agitur invito Principe.] (Id. ibid.</hi> 176.) Yea, so tender would he then seem of shedding Blood, as he never signed the most just Condemnation of any Malefactor (till the last of his five first years was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most expired) without regret, and repeating his wonted Wish <hi>[Vtinam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scirem literas] Would God I had never learnt to write, (Sueton. Nero</hi> 10.) So
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43715:66"/>
artifically did he dissemble, or his Tutors <hi>Barrha</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> divert, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination to Cruelty (which they perceived would not be tamed by love of Vertue) by giving way for the more free vent of his amorous Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; laying his bloody <hi>Mars</hi> asleep in the bosom of his bucksom <hi>Venus, (Tac. ann. 13.) [quo faciliùs, si virtutem aspernaret, voluptatibus concessis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinerent;]</hi> as all men conceived good hopes of him, that after he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid the Edge of his juvenile Salacity, he would prove an excellent Prince. This was the sence which the World then had of <hi>Nero:</hi> and thus the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Primitive Church, exprest by <hi>Eusebius, (Eccles. hist.</hi> 2. 22.) that St. <hi>Paul</hi> made his first Apology before him, in that first part of his Reign, while he was milder both in Affection and Carriage, than he proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And St. <hi>Jerome (de viris iliustr.)</hi> is right in that Note he makes; <hi>[Sciendum autem in prima satisfactione, necdum</hi> Neronis <hi>imperio stabilito, nec in tanta scelerae irrumpente quanta de eo narrant historiae:] St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before him was, when his Empire not being establish'd, he had not run into those wickednesses which Histories tell of him,</hi> that is, it was before he grew so outragious, as to deserve the name of a Lion, for his Cruelty, or upon any other imaginable account; but for his being, in his own Conceit, an Anti-Lion to the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can we then imagine that <hi>Nero</hi> would let go his hopes, so deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, before he had canvast and heard, what the Jews could say against what St. <hi>Paul</hi> alledged, for proof of this, that Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is King of the Jews, Would not <hi>Poppaeas</hi> Zeal ingage her to muster up all the force she could possibly raise, of malicious Jews, to enter the lists, and confute Christ's Champion on this ground which if they let him win, and make good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they must bid an eternal <hi>Vale</hi> to their admired Law and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bow their stubborn knees to that crucified God, whom they so much despised? And if that command she had over <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Affections (so sovereign as <hi>Tacitus</hi> undertakes, from that Topick, to vindicate him from the Aspersion cast on him by some, that he wilfully kick'd her out of his, to make her bed in the Grave) <hi>(Tacit. an.</hi> 16. 246.) [Poppaea <hi>mortem obiit fortuitâ mariti iracundiâ, à quo gravida ictu calcis afflicta est; neque enim ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenum crederem—quia amori uxoris obnoxius erat;]</hi> had not been fee enough to bribe him against St. <hi>Paul;</hi> yet sure the pleasure he took in rolling that sweet morsel of <hi>Judeas</hi> Crown under his Tongue; which he had in his hope swallowed, and must regorge, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> carry the day, would set his wits on work to seek evasions and starting-holes in every corner of his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; in the whole Web of whose Discourse, upon that subject, how glad would his own dear interest have made him, could he have found one Wemb through which he might have seen the least glimmering of a possibility, that those emergencies in <hi>Judaea</hi> (then under contest before him) were not such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> reported them to be. Can we think that Christian Apologist could satisfie <hi>Nero</hi> in that point (as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in the place forecited insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, by his <hi>[in prima satisfactione])</hi> which he so much desired to disbelieve, till he had throughly weighed and canvas'd all St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s and his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Pleas, and found the Apostle to be irrefragable?</p>
               <p>Briefly: To sum up the whole of this Argument. A man may without any violent elevation of his mind, fancy <hi>Judea</hi> (that Navel of the Earth) to have been a Stage erected for the Actors, in the midst of the Theatre of the World; and the Inhabitants of the Empire sitting in a round, as spectators and observing what was there acted, with the greatest silence imaginable. <hi>We are made,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, a theatre to men and Angels.</hi> What hinders but we may interpret that Text by <hi>Daniel</hi> (10. 13.) <hi>the Prince of the Kingdom of Persia,</hi> and Vers. 14. <hi>Michael one of the chief Princes,</hi> and (Chap. 12. 1.) <hi>Michael the great Prince that standeth for the children of thy people:</hi> and by Angels, understand the Angel-presidents over Nations, those Eyes of the Lord (according to Mr. <hi>Mede)</hi> that run through the Earth. To be sure they might at that time have seen all the World sitting still and at rest; yea,

themselves then resting from impeding, withstanding, opposing, deteining one another, in behalf of their several Jurisdictions, and had leisure to sit down, for company, with their Pupils, and fix their running Eyes upon that strange sight was a showing in <hi>Judaea,</hi> upon that one Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands. However this Text can imply no less than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Stage, Tumultuations in <hi>Judea,</hi> with silence among the Spectators, Peace in all the World about: and that Peace allowed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, without the least distraction, to trie to the bottom the grounds of those Commotions; and those grounds being of highest concern to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators <hi>(res tua tunc agitur.)</hi> It must needs be morally impossible, that the Christian Church could, by any the handsomest Legerdemain, delude that Eagles Eye, so fixedly pitch'd on these Occurrences, and so steadily pearch'd upon that Olive-plant of an Universal Peace: an attempt to cheat the Spectators in such a Juncture would have been such an Act

as he that had but half an Eye would swear to be the undertaking of scarce half-witted men.</p>
               <p>I am now come to a Period of this tedious and toilsom Pilgrimage through the holy Age (if I may call the Time so, as well as the Place, which Christ separated from all other Ages, wherein to manifest himself in the flesh, and divulge his Royal Law) undertaken not out of curiosity, to see Fashions; but upon the same account which I have observed many of the Ancients to have travelled to the holy Land, to inform themselves more explicitly in the Evangelical History: to confirm themselves more feelingly by ocular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration in the truth of that History; or to delight their inamour'd Souls with the Contemplation of the places where the Blessed Jesus convers'd: here he wept, here he pray'd; here he fasted; this was the place of his Birth, this of his Baptism, this of his Transfiguration; on this Hill he gave his Royal Law, on this he foil'd the Tempter, on this his sacred Feet printed their farewel-kiss to the Earth; such Meditations could not but deeply affect &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Religious Pilgrim. This put me upon enquiring whether the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Use might not be made of travelling through the holy Age, and this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry upon making trial; aiming at the informing my self (as it were by ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inspection) whether it was an Age likely to be imposed upon, as our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Scepticks insinuate. In which travel I have been forc'd to take Secular Writers for my Guides; that I might frame my Journals in a Language which they, whose couviction I endeavour, profess themselves to understand, and to take pleasure in the sound of; entertaining my self with those hopes, that Secular History, as well as

And that our great Criticks in Humanity may deign to peruse a Discourse that hath cost the Author so many weary steps, and not think him immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in this request, that they would, in order to their own satisfaction, with him (who for their sake hath travell'd over the Mountains of the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, that he might take and give them a prospect of that Age) vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to take one view of it from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and mark one Bulwark more it had against treacherous surprizals, grounded upon the Candour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of its Assailants; enough to have secur'd it, had it not been intrench'd and without which all the Fortifications, we have seen the remains of, would be but so many Monuments of the Subtilty and Stratagems of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. It will therefore be necessary, in order to a full sail Assurance of the truth of our general Proposition, to turn our sail to this Wind, our thoughts to this Observation.</p>

                  <p>As no Age was less like to be Cheated than that wherein the Apostles flourish'd; so no Generation of Men was less like to put a Cheat upon the World than the Apostolick and Primitive Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>The Apostles and Primitive Churches Veracity evinc'd, by their chusing Death rather than an Officious Lye to save their lives:</hi> Pliny's <hi>testimony of them. § 2, 3. They hide not their imperfections; nor the Truth to please Parties, or to avoid the Worlds taking offence. The offence which Heathens took at some Gospel-passages. § 4.

               </p>
               <p>§ 1. 1. THeir avowed Principles touching making a Lye (though with an intention to serve God by it) were, That the Devil is the Father of it <hi>(Joh.</hi> 8. 44.) That whoso love or make a Lye shall be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heaven, and detruded into the society and torments of Devils, <hi>(Apocal.</hi> 22. 15.) Now, had Men of this Profession abused the World, with false Stories in a matter of so high a concern as Religion, it would have render'd them, in the opinion of all men, the veriest miscreants that ever liv'd; would certainly have allayd that confidence they used in justifying the truth of their Reports to the faces of men, who were upon the place where the things reported were done. If you say this was but a colour and mere pretence, to gain the repute, of men hating a lye, that so they might more easily insinuate the belief of their Stories into their credulous and prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd Hearers; that surmise will be answer'd, beyond all possibility of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Reply, by producing clear Evidences of their actual conforming and pertinacious adhering to those Principles, against the strongest Temptations to wave them, that could possibly be laid in their way. <hi>[Vide quàm sollicitè</hi> Paulus <hi>distinguat quae à se sunt, &amp; quae à Domino,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 10, 11. <hi>quàm for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midet dicere, quae vidit, in corpore an extrà corpus viderit!]</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2.) <hi>Grotius.) [Quam probabilitatem habet, talium documentorum auditores suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari mentitos, quaecunque suum praeceptorem effecisse testificati sunt? aut quàm credibile faciant si putent illos omnes sibi inter se consensisse in mendacium, &amp;c.]</hi> (Euseb. demonst. Evang. 3. 7.) <hi>Observe,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius, how carefully the Apostle distinguisheth betwixt what he saith and what the Lord saith; how fearful he is to determine whether he was in the body or out of the body when he was rapt up. Have we the least reason</hi> (saith <hi>Eusebius) to suspect that the hearers of such instructions did feign whatsoever they testifie their Master to have done; or is it in the least probable that they should all conspire together to lye.</hi> But let us here what Pagan Writers give in evidence here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny,</hi> being appointed by the Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> to take special cognizance of the Causes of Christians, and to give him the best information there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, which his utmost diligence in enquiring could arrive to, gives him this account of them; That in their Assemblies for Divine Worship they used <hi>so solemnly to bind themselves (at the receiving of the holy Sacrament) not to falsifie their word, but to speak the truth; as he could not induce any of them (by any methods of either cruelty or flattery that he could invent) to say they were not Christians, (Plinii Epist. lib. 10. ep.</hi> 103.) In so much that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> gave order, that from his Ministers of State should procede in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Causes of Christians upon this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That if any of them that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43715:68"/>
were accused, being ask'd whether he were a Christian, should say he was not, he should forthwith be dismist, as not guilty of the charge laid against him, (Trajanus Plinio, epist.</hi> 104.) And this grounded upon <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Observation, <hi>[Nam ad hoc cogi non possunt qui sunt reverà Christiani;] for they that are so indeed cannot be forced to deny themselves to be Christians:</hi> but would persevere to the last gasp in the midst of the greatest torments to roar out, this good Confession; <hi>I am a Christian; I tell thee (bloody tormentor) who I am; thou wouldst, by the rack, force me to deny my self to be what I am: I cannot, I dare not lye, I am a Christian. Tear off my flesh with hooks, break my bones with strappadoes, pull asunder my joynts with skrews; while thou leaves me a tongue in my head, I must speak the truth, I cannot but tell thee to thy face, I am a Christian, I worship God through Jesus Christ, (Tertul. apol. 21.) [dicimus &amp; palàm dicimus, &amp; vobis tormentibus dicimus, lacerati &amp; cruentati vociferamus, Deum colimus per Christum, &amp;c.]</hi> Could a more feeling proof be given of their abominating a lye than this? They who would rend their Garments, at Acclamations made to themselves, as Gods; that would not take to, but spurn at divine honours laid at their feet; will rather have the skin torn off their flesh, their flesh off their bones, their bones by continued and lingring pains drain'd of marrow, than suffer the most exquisite tortures to rack from them that self-officious Lye, (or so much as a consent by silence, to them who would have them say) that they were not Christians. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est testimony of a tenacious love to Truth that ever was exhibited; what could tempt them to recede from it, whom assurance of Life, exemption from the torturing Rack, and the horror of the most grim-fac'd Death that wittiest malice could contrive, could not tempt? <hi>Balaam</hi> put in a good Caution for his speaking truth, when (for all his love to the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness) he assured <hi>Balak,</hi> That if he would give him an house-full of Silver and Gold he durst not speak more or less than what God should put into his mouth: But the Primitive Church put in a far greater pledge, limb and life it self, for her Veracity. And yet this was all the inducement they can possibly be imagin'd to have, to persist in their Lye (if the Gospel be a Lye) as <hi>Eusebius</hi> excellently <hi>(Demonst. Evang. 3. 7.) [Non enim exiguum erit hujus audaciae proemium; siquidem non vulgares nos pro tantis certaminibus manent coronae, sed quae supplicia videlicet à legibus omnium hominum, ut par est, contradicentibus injuncta est, vincula, tormenta, carceres, ignis, ferrum, cruces &amp; boluae, ad quae omnia promptissimo animo est accedendum: iisque malis eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum obviàm intrepidè quae praeceptorem nostrum nobis pro exemplo ostentant: quid enim pulchrius quàm nulla ratione, &amp; diis &amp; hominibus fieri inimicos, &amp;c.] We have reason sure to persist thus inflexibly in asserting this truth of the Gospel; for we know we are to reap no small reward of this boldness, to receive no vulgar Crowns for such strivings; but those punishments (to speak plainly) which by the Laws of all men are adjudged meet to be inflicted upon those that contradict them, bonds, racks, goals, fire, sword, crosses and wild beasts: To all which we come with a most ready mind, and without all fear go to meet those evils that present our Master to us for an example; you must think sure we take a great deal of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in making our selves without all reason enemies to the Gods and men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If we had not assurance of the Truth which we profess, and did not so far abhorr to conceal, much more to deny, what we know is Truth, as, rather than do so to save our lives, we persevere to our last breath in bearing witness to it.</hi>

               <p>It was a truly Christian and Heroick Answer (well beseeming the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Champion and Defender of the Apostolick Faith) which our late King of blessed Memory, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, gave to a person who counsell'd him to temporize with his Rebels, in a dissembling compliance with those their not only unjust but impious Proposals, which his truly tender and rightly informed Conscience disgusted; telling his Majesty, he might, after he had reestablish'd himself in the possession of his just Rights, and the Affections of his then abused Subjects, watch an opportunity of retracting those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted Concessions. Oh Friend, replies the King (laying his hand upon his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43715:68"/>

                  <p>Yea, whereas in Cases of Fact and Practice (as private men) they might warp aside from the Truth of the Gospel: and it would have been, in such Cases, a promoting of their private Interests, either to have said nothing, or to have divertised their Reports so, as might have rendered the Business most plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on their own Partie's side. Yet we find that even where their particular Interests clash and interfere, their Reports agree, and are as full in what makes against, as for that Party, with whom themselves sided in that Case of Fact.</p>
                  <p>To instance in the Case of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.) That E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, who convers'd with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and was appointed to be his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the Circumcision <hi>(Gal.</hi> 2. 9.) St. <hi>John</hi> writes his Gospel so, as it favours St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Case more than St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s; commemorating more at large than St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Christs Intensions to cast off the Jewish Nation, to abrogate the Ceremonial Law; describing that Nation as a People not to be temporiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, opening their Malice, Pertinacy, and insatiable Thirst after Christ's Blood; extenuating the Sin of the Romans in putting him to Death, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Crime of the Jews in rejecting, betraying, delivering up, and bartering away the Lord of Glory.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (who wrote by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Direction to the Hebraizing Jews) writes as much in dis-favour of that Nation which St. <hi>Peter</hi> favour'd and sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in his Contest with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as any other Evangelist: reporting that <hi>John</hi> the Baptist warned them, not to claim Propriety in, nor Privilege from <hi>Abraham.</hi> That Christ preferr'd believing Gentiles before mis-believing Jews to the Honour of being related to him in Consanguinity. That Christ found more Faith in some Gentiles, than he did in <hi>Israel.</hi> That Christ should say that many should come, from East and West, and sit down with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and the Children of the Kingdom be thrust out. That Christ urged the Law of Charity, as vacating the Law of Cermonies, (even of Old, in the case of <hi>David,</hi> eating the Shew-bread.) And lastly, Christs Doom upon such like as St. <hi>Peter</hi> temporized with, to the scandalizing of believing Gentiles, (that is, they that had swept the House, and emitted the unclean Spirit by an accepting of Christ for a <hi>Messiah,)</hi> but did afterwards suffer him (by their Judaizing) to return, and bring them into a worse Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the Ceremonial Law than they were in before;) that their last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, that of Judaick Christians, should be worse than their first, of Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</p>
                  <p>It were easie to multiply Instances, and to point to those Passages in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> (who wrote his Gospel to the Grecizing or Alexandrian Jews (whose Bishop he was) from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Mouth;) that make clearly for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and against St. <hi>Peter:</hi> but for Brevities sake I wave that, and come to shew, that on the other Hand, St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Amanuensis in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel (of his writing but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s inditing) challenging therefore a Propriety in it, and calling it his Gospel, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 2. 16.) does no more favour St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s than St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cause; presenting St. <hi>Peter</hi> as the Mouth of the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Apostles, in confessing Christ to be the Son of God, the King of the

Jews: and receiving from Christ, upon that Confession, the Privilege of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first-laid Stone in the new <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> upon which, Christ would build his Church. And in his History of the Acts of the Apostles, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating how Christ made good that Promise to him. For though all the Twelve were so many Pearly Foundation-Stones, upon whose Persons and Preaching the Gospel-Church was built; and though all of them were Doors in the City of God, and had the Keys given them to open the Door of Faith to the Jew and Gentile: Yet St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives the Preheminence to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in order of Time; reporting him, with his Brother <hi>Andrew,</hi> to have had the first explicit call to Christianity, and after that to the Apostolical Office; and and so his Person to have been laid as the first Stone in the House of God, and in the Foundation of the Apostles: and informing us how his Key of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, after Christ's Assension and assuming of his Kingdom, did at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> on the Day of Penticost; and some while after, at the House of <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> first open the Door of Faith both to Jews and Gentiles: how his Sermons were the first Pearly Foundation-Stone, upon which the Catholick Church of Jew and Gentile was built. Nay, St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates those Passages with such Circumstances as are of greatest Tendency towards the heaping of Honour upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Person; presenting him, not only as the Stone, upon which those individual Converts were laid, but in their Persons (as their Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives) the whole Church of believing Jews gathered from every Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven to his Sermon on the Day of Pentecost: and of Gentiles, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a Roman: a Name (in the Idiom of that Age) equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a Citizen of the World: God, the King of the Jews (his peculiar He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage) and <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Emperour of the Romans, sharing the World betwixt them.

St. <hi>Luke</hi> reports St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have been so well instructed, as the Synod ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its Decree touching those things upon the Evidence which St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave <hi>(Act.</hi> 15.)

                  <p>This is such an Argument of Impartiality in the Evangelists as hath no Peer. <hi>Alexander</hi> laid his Finger upon his Scar while <hi>Apelles</hi> was drawing his Picture. <hi>Aelian (Var Histor.</hi> 2. 23.) would not give <hi>Nicodorus</hi> the Mantinean his full Praise, because he was affraid, thereby, to honour the Memory of <hi>Diogoras</hi> (a reputed Atheist) who help'd <hi>Nicodorus</hi> to frame his excellent Laws: and <hi>Virgil</hi> because the <hi>Nolanes</hi> would not permit him to draw their River over his Grounds expung'd the Name of this City out of his Verses, placing instead of that <hi>Ora: (A.

Hence they have not suffer'd the Life scarce of one Martyr or Virgin to pass without the Intermixture of such like Lyes. Pious Lyes! As if (forsooth) there were, otherwise, danger that Truth could not support it self, and stand on her own Legs, except she were underprop'd with Lyes: neither have they been affraid to contaminate that Religion with Figments which Truth it self insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and intended should consist of naked Truth; nor did they see, that such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are so far from promoting it, as nothing can more prejudice Religion: for (as St.</hi> Austin <hi>testifies) as soon as Men smell-out the intermingled Lye, they suspect the Truth it self: whereupon I often grow jealous, that the greatest part of such Tales was devised by some Paultry Fellows and Hereticks, who had a Design to make Sport with the incautions Credulity of simple (rather than prudent) Men; and to take away Credit from true Christian Histories, by interweaving them with feigned Fables; wherefore (saith this ingenious Authour) undoubted Credit must be given to those Histories which the Divinely-inspired Scripture commends unto us; but for others, let us (having, with Judgment, applied them to the Doctrine of Christ, as unto</hi> Critolaus <hi>his Rule) receive or reject them: if we would be free from vain Credulity, and superstitious Fear.</hi> How soon would there be an end put to most of the Controversies betwixt us and the Modern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were all of that Communion, of the truly Catholick Judgment of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, in this Particular.

Neither art thou ignorant of the Nature of that God whom we preach. <hi>Deus bonus est, Deus benefacit: God is good,</hi> and <hi>God does good,</hi> are Words of thy own framing: are Phrases of Speech thou usest in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sense. And on the other hand thou hast taught us to say <hi>[an evil Man]</hi> thereby taxing, obliquely and figuratively, such a Man to be therefore evil, because he is departed from God that is good. Again, because it is, among us, the great Mystery of Mortification and Conversation, to believe that the Blessing of Goodness and Bounty is at God's Disposal; thou pronouncest this Prayer <hi>[God bless thee,]</hi> as plainly as a Christian need do. And when thou turnest that Blessing into a Curse, thou thereby confessest (with us) that God's Power is wholly above us; that whom he curseth, are cursed: whom he blesseth, are blessed. There are some that do not altogether deny the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of God, but they do not think, that he either minds what Men do, or will judg them according to their Works; (in which Point, they exceedingly differ from us, who betake our selves to the Discipline of Christ, that we may escape Judgment to come,) but they think it a Dishonour to God, not to be discharged from the Care of Inspection, and the Trouble of Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, or to have Anger ascribed to him: for if God (say they) can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; he is corruptible and passible. Yet when the same Men, elsewhere, confess the Soul to be Divine and conferr'd by God, they become obnoxious to have the Testimony of the Soul retorted against their other Opinion. For if the Soul either be Divine or Gods Gift, without doubt, she knows her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and if she knows him, them she also fears him, at least wise, as her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: Doth she not fear him whom she would rather have Propitious than Angry? Whence then proceeds this natural Fear of God in the Soul, if God knows not how to be angry? how can he be feared, that cannot be offended? What in God can be feared, but his Anger? how can he be angry at Mens doing amiss, if he mind not what we do? Why does he mind, if he will not judg? How can he judg, if he want Power to execute? and who hath Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power but God alone? Hence therefore it is, that the Soul (out of her own Conscience) is ready, within Doors and without, (without any bodie's deriding or hindering her) to cry out <hi>[God seeth all things; I appeal to God; God will requite it; God will judge betwixt us.]</hi> Whence hast thou learned these words, seeing thou art not a Christian? How comest thou to use such expressions, oftentimes, even while thou art impaled with <hi>Ceres</hi> her Hair-lace, clad in <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Scarlet Pall, or <hi>Isis</hi> her Linnen Garment? Who taught thee to implore the Judgment of God, in the very Temples of Idols; stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Esculapius</hi> his Feet, trimming <hi>Juno</hi> in the Air, and putting a black Case upon <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Helmet, thou in vocatest none of the Gods there present: In thy own Court, thou appeal'st to a Forreign Judg: in thy own Temples thou liftest up thy Eyes to Heaven, and call'st upon the God of Heaven: how great is the Evidence of that Truth which procureth Witnesses for its self, (and in behalf of Christians) under the Noses of those Devil-Gods whom Pagans Worship. The Christian <hi>Cicero, Lactantius, (de falsa Religione, l. 2. cap.</hi> 1.) hath the same Observation: <hi>Nam &amp; cum jurant, &amp; cùm optant, &amp; cùm gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias agunt; non</hi> Jovem <hi>aut Deos multos, sed unum Deum nominant: ità veritas ipsa (cogente natura) etiam ab invitis pectoribus erumpit: si qua necessitas gravis presserit, tunc Deum recordantur; si belli terror infremuerit, si morborum pestifera vis incubuerit, si alimenta frugibus longa siccitas denegaverit, si saeva tempestas, si

So the Truth (by the Impulse of Nature) break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of those Breasts, which would imprison it. If any sad Calamity oppress them, then they remember God: If the Terror of War roar upon them: If Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Sicknesses sit upon their Skirts: if a long Drought withdraw Nourishment from the Fruits of the Earth: If raging Tempests, Hail or hot Thunder-bolts invade them, then they fly to God; then they beg Aid of God; then is he beseech'd that he would deliver them: hereby confessing, that such Punishments are inflicted upon the World by that provoked Deity; who takes notice of Mens Sins, and therefore punisheth them: of Mens Prayers and Repentance, and is therefore made propitious by their humble Addresses.</hi>

That self-consciousness to the closest Villany binds the Malefactor over to the general Assize? that the guilt of innocent Blood, though never so secretly shed, looks so gastly in the face of the Murderer, rings so loud, speaks so articulately in the ears of Conscience; (as some have conceived the very Birds of the Air, nay, the callow Sparrows in the Nest, to reveal the matter, as it befel to <hi>Bessus)</hi> should be such a load, such a weight upon the Soul, as to make it melt in its own grease, with struggl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it? <hi>[Mentem sudoribus urget.]</hi> What makes them most stubborn and contumeliously set against entertaining the thought of Eternal Judgment, tremble at the voice of Thunder; as if in that rumbling noise they heard the sound of the Judges Charriot-wheels; and in the Lightning, saw a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of that fire shall go before him and consume round about him? <hi>Caligula</hi> out-braved God, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> slighted him; yet <hi>[ad omnia fulgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra pallent,]</hi> when they heard his voice they were afraid.

Would <hi>Scoevola</hi>'s Hand, if it had not laid fast hold of Eternal Life, have been kept so steady in that Fire wherein he sacrificed it for his Countrey's Service (then which, as my Author saith, the immortal Gods never saw a more noble one laid upon their Altars, nor more bespeaking the Attention of their Eyes.)

She then imbraceth them, falleth upon their neck and kisseth them; bids them heartily welcome when they deign to come under her roof; though she could not reach them (to hale them in) nor so much as imagine she had any such kindred in being, till they exhibit themselves openly to her. Indeed she could not sit down till they came, her <hi>Mensa Philosophica</hi> wanted her best Guests; there were set empty Chairs, at the upper end of the Table, but what personages they were reserved for, she no more knew, than the modern Jews understand, who that <hi>Elias</hi> is, for whom they set a Chair at their Festivals. She suspected there was some <hi>Elias</hi> not far from her, who when he came would resolve all her doubts; and gropes in the dark in the mean while, if happily she might stumble on the reason of these things: hence <hi>Suarez [Unde etiam fit, ut illuminati seu roborati lumine fidei, multas ex his veritatibus intelligamus ut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentas in principiis naturalibus, quas fortasse non assequaremur si in pura naturali ratione philosopharemur.

                  <p>NO less clearly does every Man's Conscience eccho to our Christian Morals, than we have heard it resound its assent to these our Placits and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems.

                  <head>§ 2. The Poets <hi>Jove</hi> was not vulgarly reputed a God.</head>
                  <p>The only valuable Exception against this Argument, is the Instance of the Pagan Idols; who being the worst of men, were yet prefer'd (in the opinion of the World) to the honour of Gods; which gave occasion to that Sarcasm of <hi>Euripedes,</hi> That <hi>Jupiter, Neptune</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the rest of the Gods, deserv'd to be banish'd Heaven, as being guilty of those Debaucheries would render men unworthy to tread upon Earth: and to <hi>Menippus</hi> (in <hi>Lucian)</hi> to declaim against their Rapes, Incests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> to flout the great <hi>Jove,</hi> for giving encouragement to <hi>Chaerea</hi> to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate that Rape upon his Mistress, in imitation of <hi>Jove</hi>'s upon <hi>Danae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In answer to which (and to clear the World from the imputation of dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the most debauch'd Persons that ever lived; (by which Act it would have confounded all Principles of Morality) let it be considered:</p>
                  <p>That the Poets <hi>Jove</hi> had not, so much as among the silly Rable, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of a Deity: for had they indeed esteemed that Letcher a God, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample would have had influence enough upon it, to have turn'd the whole World into a Brothel-house, in spite of all Laws to the contrary. For, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes, <hi>[Magis intuentur quid</hi> Jupiter <hi>fecerit, quàm quid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuerit</hi> Plato, <hi>vel censuerit</hi> Cato:] <hi>(de civit. 2. 7.) They that took those Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Monsters for Deities, must needs have been more swayed with their example, than with</hi> Plato's <hi>precepts, or</hi> Cato's <hi>practice.</hi> Now there being so few that pleaded the authority of <hi>Jove</hi>'s Example to patronize their own Crimes, and they that had the face to do it, being universally badged with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of impiety; for making that Plea, is evidence enough, that he was not cordially worshipp'd, under that form which the Poets presented him in. What needed those adulterous, covetous, ambitious Suiters, in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> have whisper'd into his Ears their impious Prayers; if they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted him worse than that most corrupt Judge <hi>Statius Albius,</hi> who (as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43715:83"/>
bad as he was) had any man begg'd his favour in such like Cases; would, with expressions of amazing horrour, have rejected the motion? Might they not have avowed and justified their impure and unjust Requests, as much as, nay rather than, those that other men pour out openly, for a sound Mind, a good Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as tending more than these towards the conforming of those Votaries to the God whom they invocated; had they indeed deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Letcher, to have been God-<hi>Jupiter.</hi> The most audacious of them durst not thus have pull'd him by the Beard, had they thought him, whom the Poets painted, to have been a living Lion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis too manifest, that the Poets charming Style did insinuate those <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Gods (that they drew) into the minds of many, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of such Persons, as were preoccupied with inclinations to those Vices: (for <hi>facilè credimus quod volumus)</hi> and that out of that <hi>Pondora</hi>'s Box issued those Debaucheries that over-spread the Pagan World. When I was a Boy (saith <hi>Menippus</hi> in <hi>Lucian (Lucian</hi>

                     </gap>,) and heard <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od</hi> singing the Warrs, Seditions, Adulteries, Rapes, Incests of the Gods, I was verily perswaded that all these things were good and comely: for I could not imagine that the Gods would have done them, had they not they look'd upon them as vertuous. <hi>Who would not</hi> (saith St. <hi>Austin) think that course of life to be followed, that is presented in Stage-plays, instituted by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divine Authority; rather than that that is commended to us by Laws, that are but of humane Institution: [Quae actitantur ludis, authoritate divinâ institutis, quàm quae scriptitantur legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus humano consilio promulgatis:] (de civit.</hi> 2. 8.) And therefore he concludes that the Devil's grand Design, in setting abroach the Poetical Divinity, was to ingulph the World in those beastly sins the Poets feign'd the Gods to be Actors of: he by this device, <hi>(de civit.</hi> 2. 20.) furnishing wicked men with a Cloak for their most sordid Immoralities (borrowed from the Wardrobe of Heaven) spurring them on to all manner of lewdness, that they might grow up into a Conformity to those whom they worshipped: and putting a check to all vertuous Motions, for fear of seeming therein to outstrip their Gods, and thereby to incurr their displeasure: <hi>[Quibus nihil aliud actum est, quàm ut pudor hominibus peccandi demeretur, si tales Deos credidissent:] (Senec. de beata vita cap. 26.) This would be the effect of mens believing the Gods to be such as the Poets describe them,</hi> viz. <hi>that men would not be ashamed of vitious living.</hi> This was the Ravishers Cloak. <hi>[Ego homuncio id non facerem, quòd Deus qui templa coeli summo sonitu concutit? Ego verò illud feci &amp; lubens:] (Ter. Eunuch.)</hi> This was the fewel of Lasciviousness.

Alledged to this purpose by St. <hi>Austin (de civit.</hi> 2. 7.) Hence the Authour of the Book of Wisdom, <hi>(Cap.</hi> 14. 24, 25, 26.) imputes it to Heathenish I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, That men kept neither Lines nor Marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by Adultery: so that there reigned in all men promiscuously, Blood, Manslaughter, Theft, Dissimulation, Corruption, Unfaithfulness, Tumults, Perjury, disquieting of good Men, forgetfulness of good Turns, changing of Sex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> tells <hi>Caligula,</hi> That should he, by his slaughters and impieties, gain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of being a God, it would eternize the repute of those Villanies, and perpetuate the practice of them as laudable: <hi>(de legat. ad Caium, fol.</hi> 629.)</p>
                  <p>So that it is beyond the reach of human Apprehension to conceive, that the Poets Creed should be universally embrac'd; and that belief not turn the World into a mere <hi>Chaos,</hi> in point of Morality. And therefore the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Mankinds retaining some Sentements of good and evil, is a plain Demonstration, that the Belief of the Poets was not Catholick; that the far greater part of Heathens dissembled with the Poetical Gods, as most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains

                  <p n="2">2. Now the first <hi>Jupiter</hi> (for instance) being succeeded by so many of his name (but not Vertues) as in process of time the <hi>Joves</hi> amounted to 300 as <hi>Tertullian</hi> (out of <hi>Varro)</hi> counts them: [Romanus <hi>Cynicus</hi> Varro <hi>tricentos</hi> Joves <hi>(sive</hi> Jupitores <hi>dicend.) introduxit:] (apol.</hi> 14.) and at last, the true History of him growing as much out of the Memory of men, as the History of the Creation was, when he was first made a God; this latter brood was brought over his shoulders, to share with him (as he had done with the only true God) in the honour of being esteemed Deities: each Nation contending that their own was the ancient <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ascribed to their own, all that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in others of that name; and fastned upon foreigners the Vices of their own <hi>Jupiters:</hi> So that it was the Vertue of the first <hi>Jupiter</hi> that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all his Name-sakes to divine honour. And when the Crimes of the younger <hi>Jupiters</hi> were by the Poets fastned on him, this was so far from add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his credit; as, with those that believ'd the Poetical Stories, it lost him the repute of being a God: and with those that believ'd him to be a God, the Poets lost the repute of being faithful Historians, upon that very account, because they presented the Gods in the form of beastly immanities; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the God-born to have perpetrated more vile Enormities than ever were acted by the off-spring of most wicked men: not only charging them with Thefts and Adulteries, but with the devouring of their own Children, gelding their Parents, Incest with their Mothers, and many other fedities; as <hi>Isocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes (Busirid. laudat.)</hi> observes, calling Poetical Theology, Blasphemy, and affirming the Divine Vengeance to have pursued most of them, for those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Fictions: many of them becoming Vagabonds and Beggars; others being struck blind; others, being exil'd, lived in perpetual fewd with their own Kindred: and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the chief Author of such like Fables, being mangled alive, and torn in pieces. Wherefore (saith he) if we be wise, let's not follow their dotages; nor endure (since we make Laws that one man should not slander another) that this lawless liberty be given, of babbling what comes at Tongues end concerning the Gods: but let us think that both Thief and Recetter, the Reporter and Believer of such Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are grievous offenders. For my own part (saith he) 'tis an Article of my Creed, that not only the Gods but the God-born are not only exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Vice, but have all Vertues so naturally implanted in them, as they become Leaders and Masters to us Men, in all honest and praise-worthy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Hence <hi>Pausanias</hi> cautions his Reader, not to believe what the Athenian Temples represent concerning the Gods; as grounded on Poetical Fables.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, where the Poets fictions were imbraced and applauded, the Gods that they presented were exploded: while they muster the Gods (saith <hi>Tertullian Apol. cont. gentes)</hi> into two adverse parties standing the one for <hi>Troy,</hi> the other for <hi>Greece:</hi> while they present <hi>Venus</hi> wounded by a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hand, while she's fetching off <hi>Aeneas</hi> from <hi>Diomed</hi>'s pursuit: while they bring in <hi>Mars</hi> pin'd almost to death, by undergoing a three-months penance in those Chains <hi>Vulcan</hi> had caught him in with <hi>Venus:</hi> while they sing, how <hi>Jupiter</hi> was secured by the help of a Monster, from being taken with his Curtizans, in the like snares: while they chaunt his lamenting <hi>Sarpedon</hi>'s mishap, his dalliances with <hi>Juno:</hi> while, through the connivence of Princes, they take liberty to feign <hi>Apollo</hi> a Herdsman under <hi>Admetus; Neptune</hi> a Mason to <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and defrauded of his wages; <hi>Aesculapius</hi> to have been struck with <hi>Jove</hi>'s Thunder-bolt, for taking too large Fees for a Cure: (sure it was not of the French Disease, that amorous God would have thought half a Kingdom a Fee small enough for that:) while the Mimick perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates <hi>Anubis</hi> playing the Adulterer; <hi>Diana</hi> making love to the Swain <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimion</hi> (and lash'd soundly for her offences;) the Sun lamenting <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s

Fall; <hi>Cybel</hi> (the Mother of the reputed Gods) puling at the feet of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful Shepherd; the Boy <hi>Paris</hi> umpiring the Contest for the golden Apple, betwixt three Goddesses. While (I say) the Poets publish in their ears, while the Mimicks present to their Eyes, the obscenities of their Deities, the vulgar conclude them no Gods: and instead of making them the Objects of Devotion and Religious Fear, esteem them Objects of Scorn and Derision. <hi>[Dispicite utrùm Mimos an Deos vestros in jocis &amp; strophis rideatis?] Do you, when you hear joques and quirks put upon your Gods, laugh at the Jeaster's wit, or at the folly of your Gods?</hi> Durst ye make a sport of <hi>Phaebus</hi> his tears, and laugh, while he's presented weeping, if you really believ'd the Mimick-<hi>Phoebus</hi> to be a God. Had they esteemed the Mimick Gods, Gods indeed, they would have reverenc'd their presence more than <hi>Cato</hi>'s, before whom the Romans were ashamed, in their celebrating the <hi>Floralia,</hi> to call forth the Mimicks to act their parts; confessing (as <hi>Valerius Max.</hi> observes, <hi>lib. 2. cap.</hi> 10.) that they had more respect to that one Man, whom Vertue had made vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than to all the Spectators, yea, than all those Gods who were there personated.</p>

                  <p>Hence <hi>Plato</hi> (in his 2. and 10. Books of his Commonwealth) would have that kind of Poetry, that sings the flagitiousness of the Gods, expelled out of every well-constituted Republick; as tending to the effeminating of mens Minds, and corrupting of Manners. And the ancient Romans (to prevent that evil Opinion of the Gods, which they foresaw people would readily take up, from such Premises) forbad the use of Stage-plays in their Laws of the Twelve Tables; a Law in force 500 years after <hi>Rome</hi> built. And when in the Consulship of <hi>Sulpitius</hi> and <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the Pontiff, by direction of <hi>Sibyls</hi> Books, instituted them to asswage the then raging Pestilence: to secure the Vulgar from the dint of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to Atheism, that was laid before them, in those scenical Prostitutions: they were admonish'd of the baseness of those fellows, by a Decree prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Stage-players to be free of the City <hi>(In Aug. de civit. dei,</hi> 2. 13.) as <hi>L. Vives</hi> affirms out of <hi>Livy.</hi> A Decree which speaks that Generation of men to have been (in the Opinion of the Senate) Persons of most debauch'd man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and profligated honesty (seeing that privilege of the City was granted to many thousands of flagitious men;) and therefore not to be credited by the People, in what they prated or presented, either concerning God, or Man. To this Constitution alludes <hi>Cicero,</hi> Roscium <hi>ità peritum dixit ut solus esset dignus qui in scenam deberet intrare: ità virum bonum ut solus esset dignus, qui eò non debeat accedere:] (Orat. pro Roscio, referente Augustino, de consensu Evangel. lib. 1. cap. 23. Tom.</hi> 4.) who said, <hi>That</hi> Roscius <hi>was so skilful an Actor, as of all others he deserv'd to come upon the Stage; but so good a man, as it was pity he should ever come there.</hi> And this Constitution (perhaps) they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to make, upon their reflecting on that mischief which the <hi>Grecian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary custom, of honouring Stage-players, had introduc'd; for it was early in the Age of Poetry, and before the <hi>Roman</hi> Name was known out of the confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> that the liberty of the old Comedians, back'd with the esteem they had in that State, had prejudic'd the <hi>Grecians</hi> against the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-received Gods. Briefly; St. <hi>Austin</hi> has drawn, into this short Syllogism, the Sum of what both Grecians, Romans, and Christians assert touching this business.

A Conclusion most necessarily flowing from the Premises; but yet the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sages, fearing that the Vulgar might not have natural Logick enough to gather this consequence from their excluding Stage-players from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the City, they openly avowed and published this, as a sound point of their Divinity; That <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Scene, was not the same with him in the Capitol. Thus <hi>Varro,</hi> quoted by St. <hi>Austin (de Civitate</hi> 6. 5.) expresses the sence of his Country-men. <hi>[In Poetical Divinity there are many things feigned, against the Dignity and Nature of the immortal Gods: for here we are taught, how one of them is born of</hi> Jupiter'<hi>s Head, another of his Thigh, another of drops of Blood; how one play'd the Thief, another the Adulterer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lastly, this Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy attributes those things to God, which connot befal the most despicable and wretched Man.]</hi>

                  <p>Yea, fearing this might not prove Antidote strong enough against that deadly Poyson of their Religion that was propined from the Stage; (for as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes, <hi>Jupiter</hi> was presented on the Stage, in the same posture and accoutrements, he had in his Temple:) at last they came to this shift, That the Poetical descriptions of the Gods, were nothing less than they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Title-page and common Notion: but onely Schemes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy, under their borrowed Names, (that none might appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Mystery of that Science, but their own Scholars to whom they communicated their Key) calling the Skie, <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the Air, <hi>Juno;</hi> the Sea, <hi>Neptune;</hi> the Earth, in its central parts, <hi>Pluto;</hi> in its superficial, <hi>Ceres, &amp;c. Thinkest thou</hi> (say the Patrons of the Pagan Cause in St. <hi>Austin (de civit. 2. 24.) that our Ancestors were such arrant fools, as not to know that the Poetical Gods were not Gods, but only the Gifts and Creatures of God.</hi> That this was the old Subterfuge of the Romans, and of an elder Date than St. <hi>Austin</hi> (and therefore not invented as a <hi>Salvo</hi> against the Objections of Christians, but of common Sense) appears, from that passage in <hi>Philo Judaeus (de leg. ad Caium,</hi> 630.) where deriding <hi>Caligula</hi> for attempting to monopolize the honour of all the Gods to himself; and shewing how little he resembled <hi>Mars: I mean not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that fabulous one, but him by whom we understand natural Fortitude.</hi> (A trick that <hi>Philo</hi> himself had learn'd and (without any appearance of need) practis'd, in his turning those passages in sacred History into Allegories, wherein the Philosophers objected any shew of improbability or <hi>indecorum:</hi> and therefore I wonder not at his seeming allowance of this shift in them.) And secondly, from that speech of <hi>Lucius Balbus</hi> (in <hi>Tully's de nat. deorum, 2.) [Videtisne igitur ut à physicis rebus, benè &amp; utiliter inventis, ratio sit tracta ad commentitios &amp; fictos Deos: quae res genuit falsas opiniones, errorésque turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentos, &amp; superstitiones planè aniles: Et formae enim nobis Deorum, &amp; aetates, &amp; vestitus, &amp; ornatus noti sunt, genera praetereà, conjugia, cognationes, omniá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que traducta ad similitudinem imbecillitatis humanae; nam &amp; perturbatis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis inducuntur: accepimus etiam Deorum cupiditates, aegritudines, iracundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: haec &amp; dicuntur &amp; creduntur stultissimè, &amp; plena sunt vanitatis, summaeque levitatis.] You see therefore, how from Natural Philosophy, well and profitably invented, Reason was drawn by head and shoulders to fictitious Deities: which thing hath produced false Opinions, turbulent Errors and most doting Superstitions: For the Shapes, Ages, Apparrels, Ornaments, Lineages, Marriages, Alliances, and all other things of the Gods, are presented to us and drawn after the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of humane frailty: They are moreover introduc'd with troubled Minds; and we learn their Lusts, Sicknesses and raging Passions: which things either to say or believe of them is a point of the extremest folly, vanity and levity: and therefore Piety forceth us to put a mystical interpretation upon the Poets,</hi> &amp;c. But what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they to have cover'd the nakedness of their Poetical Deities from vulgar eyes with this Mantle, had they not suspected the avowing them, for such, would

have hazarded the bringing of their people into an opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who in contempt of that <hi>Jove,</hi> instead of swearing by him, chose rather to swear by a Dog, a Goat, a Goose; conceiving the most contemptible Creature of Gods making, to have more Divinity in it, than that monstrous God of the Poets framing.</p>
                  <p>So deeply are the Principles of Vertue and Vice (and among those vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones) that of honouring Vertue, radicated in the minds of all men (not debauch'd) as, rather than Vice shall supplant Vertue of its due reward of honour, <hi>Jove</hi> himself if he appear in its garb, shall be ungodded, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosed (in the opinion of Mankind) into a Devil: for such the Pagan Philosophers themselves do (with one mouth) proclaim all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Gods to be, that delight in Blood-shed, in Filthiness, <hi>&amp;c. Jamblicus (de mysteriis pag.</hi> 98.) in answer to what <hi>Porphyry</hi> propounds to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priest, touching the Opinion of those who thought all presages to procede from evil Spirits confesseth, that some do; to wit, such as for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements are conformed to impure <hi>Daemons,</hi> to prophane and dissolute Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And to his other Question, How come the Gods, upon wicked mens intreaty, to inflict unjust pains upon good men? he gives this in answer, <hi>(Id. Ibid. pag. 105.) If upon mens imprecations pour'd out to the Gods, some adverse things be observ'd to fall out unjustly: we must impute it to other Causes; which if we cannot find out, we must not (for all that) so much as suspect any thing of the Gods, unworthy of the Divine Nature, or of that certain science of their goodness which is inbred in our minds, and wherein all both</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Barbarians <hi>agree with us</hi>—and a little after; <hi>If what we have said of Idols and evil Spirits be true—they counterfeit the presence of God, and therefore command their Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to be just, that themselves may be thought to be good: but because they are in their nature bad, they are prone to do evil and to lead us to evil.</hi>

                     <hi>Porphyry (de sacrif. pag.</hi> 314, 315.) out of <hi>Plato</hi> tells us, that as heat cannot cool us; so the Divine Nature (that is all Justice) can do no unjust thing: and therefore concludes, That all those Spirits, that either themselves commit, or tempt us to commit immoralities, (though they would make the World believe they are Gods, and their Prince the highest and holiest God) are no better than Devils. <hi>Plutarch</hi> (in his <hi>Pelopidas)</hi> reports, That while the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> Army lay encamp'd in <hi>Leuctra,</hi> resolved to give battel to <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> and the <hi>Spartan</hi> forces; <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was terrified with a Vision of <hi>Scedasus</hi> Daughters there ravish'd and slain by certain <hi>Spartans;</hi> against whom when their Father could not obtain Justice at the hands of the <hi>Spartan</hi> State, pouring out dreadful execrations upon them, he slew himself upon his Daughters Grave. These <hi>Pelopidas</hi> thinks he hears, groaning about their Sepulchres, and cursing the Spartans; and their Father commanding him to sacrifice a yellow-hair'd Virgin, if he desired to obtain victory over the <hi>Spartans: Pelopidas</hi> communicates this Vision and Command to his Prophets and Associates: by whom (notwithstanding the allegations of the examples of <hi>Menaeceus, Macaerias, Pherecides, Leonidas, Agesilaus</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it) that Command was judged so barbarous, as it was impossible it could procede from, or the fulfilling of it be acceptable to any of the Gods; for those that delight in human blood and slaughter are infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fiends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Salacus</hi> King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> is commended for interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Dream, wherein he was counsel'd to assemble the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests, and to cut them off by the middle; as proceeding from the diabolical inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of some Demons that envied his happiness, and desired to make him obnoxious to the just displeasure of the Gods, for so sacrilegious an Act: chusing rather to lay down the Egyptian Crown, which he had then wore 50 years, and return into <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> than to hold it at that price the Vision set upon it, <hi>(Herodot.

                  <p>Lo here, the point of this Objection turn'd against those that framed it: for <hi>Jove</hi> was so far from gaining by his Viciousness the repute of being a God, as the Vices of his Namesakes (imputed to him) dethron'd him from that

Would God this Christian Age had not too sad experience of the truth of this Aphorism! For since the Pulpit hath been made a Stage for Mimicks, who are train'd up to no other Art wherein they are more dexterous, than that of making Mows and wry Faces upon the Establish'd Religion; of misrepresenting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith and the Authour of it (by fathering upon the Spirit their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical uncharitable blasphemous Prattlings; upon God the Father such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and bloody Purposes and Decrees, as make him look, out of their Dress, more ill-favour'd than the blackest Fiend; upon God the Son, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Religion more barbarous than the Worship of <hi>Moloch:)</hi> this Stage-play Divinity hath brought in Atheistical Contempt of God and the Ministery.

                     <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origen</hi> contends earnestly, that whatsoever was solid in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion was borrowed from the Philosophers: by whom it was better and clearlier delivered. He instanceth in our affirming God to dwell in light inaccessible; this (saith he) is no more than what <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>[that the first Good is ineffable.]</hi> In our Saviour's commending Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This is <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine (saith <hi>Celsus)</hi> teaching in his Book of Laws, that <hi>[He who would be happy must be a follower of Justice with an humble and well-composed mind.]</hi> In Christ's saying, <hi>'Tis easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> what is this (saith he) other than that of <hi>Plato, [It is not possible that a man can be very rich and very good.]</hi> From the fame Fountain <hi>Celsus</hi> will have Christ to draw that saying, <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto life, and few there be that find it;</hi> and that our Doctrine of the fall of Angels, and their being reserved in chains, was derived from the Poet <hi>Phere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi> and <hi>Homer, (vide l. 4. col.</hi> 9.)</p>
                  <p>The Patrons of the Christian Cause, on the other hand contended that the waters of the <hi>Academy</hi> were drawn from the wells of the Sanctuary: that the Sun of knowledg arose in the East, and thence displayed its Beams over the World. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> proves that <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Psalm.</hi> 35. And upon that in <hi>Isaiah 40. [For she hath received at the Lords hand double to her ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,]</hi> saith he [Plato <hi>eruditionis gratiâ, in</hi> Aegyptum <hi>profectus, ut</hi> Mosis <hi>gesta, Legis praecepta, &amp; Prophetarum dicteria cognosceret, &amp;c.] (in psalm. 118. serm.</hi> 18.)

                  <p>The same Father <hi>(Origen contrà Celsum lib. 1. cal.</hi> 13.) in answer to <hi>Celsus</hi> objecting <hi>Moses</hi> his Juniority to the Heathen Theologues, saith: that <hi>Hermip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> (in his first Book of Lawgivers) declared how <hi>Pythagoras</hi> translated his Discipline from the <hi>Jews</hi> into <hi>Greece:</hi> and that there was extant a Book of <hi>Haecateus,</hi> in which he so approves of the Jewish Philosophy, as <hi>Herennus Philo</hi> (in his <hi>Commentar. de Judaeis)</hi> questions whether it be the genuine Book of <hi>Haecateus,</hi> whose name it bears; it seeming to him improbable, that an Heathen Philologer would write so much in their commendation. St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his eighteenth Book <hi>de Civitate,</hi> from Chap. 2. to the end of that Book, demonstrates by Chronology that our Prophets were elder than their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.

                     <hi>Christian</hi> Cause return'd to it hath forc'd me to this Digression, from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of that Argument I was producing, to prove the consonancy of our Faith with the approved Maxims of Philosophy; drawn from each sides claiming the Primogeniture and pleading that theirs was the First-born. It being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore manifest, by the confession of both parties, that Christianity and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy agree in their Maxims: I shall take this as a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> from that toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som labour of collecting the several parcels of Christian Verity, out of the vast Ocean of Secular Authors, on whose surface they lay scatter'd: the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up whereof is compared by <hi>Clemens Alexand.

A Province so well administred by St. <hi>Clemens</hi> of old, and the incomparable Lord of <hi>Plessai</hi> of late, as renders it a needless work for me. I shall therefore only instance in two or three such heads of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine (which I have not observed others to have spoken of) as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearest to the Foundation, and are vulgarly reputed opposite to the Dictates of Philosophy, yet have been attested to by Philosophers.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. 1. That man in order to his being happy must be restored to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and Conformity unto God is the Assertion of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> as well as us <hi>Christians. Plotinus,</hi> that most refined mouth of <hi>Plato</hi> (as one <hi>(St. Austin, lib. 3. Academ. quest.)</hi> stiles him, who had more insight into Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy than a thousand of our modern Blatterers.) In his first Book, <hi>de dubiis animae,</hi> writes thus; Father <hi>Jove,</hi> pittying labouring Souls, made the bonds wherein they were held, solvable, and allowed them some interval breathings and intermissions, wherein they might live from their Bodies, and from that of themselves which they had contracted by converse with their Bodies: and sometimes be there, where the Soul of the World is always: taking no thought of these inferiour things, <hi>(vide</hi> Jamblicum <hi>de mysteriis: tit. Via ad felicitatem.)</hi> The ground of this Sentiment he might have had from his master <hi>Plato,</hi> who, (in his <hi>Timaeus)</hi> distils from his pen these golden drops: <hi>while the soul lives below God, she meets with nothing but turbulency and uncertainty</hi> (the perfect print of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s seal, of his <hi>[vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirit:]) She must therefore fly to her native Countrey</hi> (expressed to the life in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s) <hi>[having our conversation in Heaven.] But where shall we have a Passage-boat? How shall I make my flight thither? There is but one expedit and certain way; to wit, becoming conformable unto God.</hi> A main point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Philosophy: which his foresaid Scholar thus comments upon <hi>(Plotin. de contemplat.) [All beatitude flows from our contemplating that best and fairest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby our souls (bidding farewel to the body, and freed from drudgery) enjoys, in that mean while, that happiness, which the soul of the Universe enjoys eternally and without intermission.—No man can attain to an happy life, that does not, in the purity of chast love, adhere to that one best Good the inocmmutable God.]</hi> With the like Doctrine <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Convivio</hi> feasts his guests ears. <hi>[A blessed man, by the inspection of the Divine Pulcritude, not only produceth, but nourisheth in himself, not only appearances and shadows, but real and substantial Vertues such as lively express him whom we contemplate.]</hi> Was ever any thing said by <hi>Christian</hi> Theologues more resembling our Philosophy than these <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> Dictates? Compare those with the Evangelical Notions, of <hi>[being changed into the same Image by beholding the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c.] and then say, if they make not as perfect an harmony, as if these lessons had been set by the same Master. Now whether God did ever hang out to the World a more lively Picture of himself, than him whom the Apostle stiles the express Image of his Father's Person? or did ever throw out a stronger cord of love,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43715:89"/>
to knit men's affections to himself, than the Son of his love? I dare refer to the determination of Philosophy it self, after I have discussed some other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, common to that and Christianity.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. 2. The Original Tradition of the all-comprehending Evangelical Promise, <hi>[The seed of the woman shall break the head of the Serpent:]</hi> that grain of Mustard-seed, whence grew the tall Tree of the whole Gospel: that Rose of <hi>Sharon</hi> in the bud, which in process of time dilated its leaves to their full dimensions; deliver'd to the World by <hi>Noah,</hi> that Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, was not wholly obliterated out of the memory of the Gentile-World. That it still retain'd the Tradition of Man's Apostacy from God: appears from <hi>Celsus (In Orig. lib. 6. cal.</hi> 20.) his quoting <hi>Pherecides</hi> for bringing in the Serpent <hi>Ophioneus,</hi> as heading a Party against <hi>Saturn,</hi> the father of all the Gods; and therefore cast down with his followers out of Heaven, and bound in chains. From <hi>Aelian</hi>'s reporting <hi>(Var. hist.</hi> 3. 1.) that the Serpent which <hi>Apollo</hi> slew, had usurped the place of the Divine Oracle: a plain intimation of his presuming to wrest Gods Oracles; and of his setting up his own in their room, in his conference with <hi>Eve.</hi> The same Author in his description of <hi>Tempe,</hi> in the story of <hi>Python,</hi> gives us a perfect prospect of <hi>Eden:</hi> into which the Serpent had insinuated himself; and where he received his deaths wound, his fatal doom. <hi>Erithraea</hi> (quoted by <hi>Lactantius (de orig. erroris lib.</hi> 2.) the greatest part of whose writings are repositories of the old Tradition:) turns this part of <hi>Moses</hi> his History into Verse.</p>

Though, through the vanity of men's minds, and the craft of those who made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Lords over their Faith (on purpose that they might settle themselves in a more absolute Dominion over their persons) that Tradition was in time so corrupted; as it requires a more than ordinary sagacity to scent out the foot-steps of it (and I hope the candid Reader will take that for my Apology, if in hunting after it, I come not always within so full a view of the game, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so hot a scent, as to have the whole pack of Readers, with one mouth, cry (<gap reason="foreign">

Howbeit I despair not, but that (by the help of the Fathers pricking out some of the prints before me, and with the assistance of his Spirit whose cause I am pleading) I shall trace out the remains of this Tradition in secular Authors, so near its scent and first Original: as to make it probable, if no more, that what the Apostles delivered in <hi>Thesi</hi> touching the blessed Jesus, is suitable to what is taught in <hi>Hypothesi</hi> by the Philosophers: especially those of them, who (to vamp and furbish the sullied and almost worn-out knowledg thereof) travell'd into those parts where the Original of that Tradition was preserved.</p>
                  <p>I will begin with that of <hi>Plato</hi> in the <hi>Phaedra</hi> pointed out by (the best versed in humane Learning of all the Fathers) <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, (Stromat.</hi> 1. 98.) who quotes that travelling Philosopher reporting this to have been the Opinion of those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> of whom he learn'd his Philosophy; as also of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43715:90"/>
the <hi>Brachmans, Odrysians, Getes, Aegyptians, Arabians, Chaldaeans,</hi> and all that inhabit <hi>Palestine:</hi> That certain blessed Souls (or Daemons) leaving their supercelestial place, vouchsafe to descend into this earthly Dungeon, and, in assumed humane Bodies, to undergo all the miseries that man is obnoxious to in this life: and undertaking the care of Mankind, to give Laws, and teach Philosophy. This, <hi>Origen (Contra Celsum, l.</hi> 5.) reminds <hi>Celsus</hi> of, charging it upon his Epicurean blockishness and want of reading, that he should need be told, that it is the common sentence of all Philosophers (who held the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, and his Providence over man,) that some Gods have been manifested in humane flesh, assumed humane shape, that they might deliver Oracles, and bring releif to mankind. <hi>Jamblicus</hi> writes after <hi>Plato</hi>'s stile <hi>(de myster iis, tit. quando alia numina, &amp;c.)</hi> making the <hi>Heroes</hi> or <hi>Semidei</hi> to unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel the Snarls which the <hi>Cacodemons</hi> make: assigning to these last, that they oppress and distemper the Body, that they draw the Soul downward, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in its motion toward Heaven: to the first, that they stir us up to good Actions, that they enliven and enlighten us, provoke us to great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Vertues, that they watch over our Souls, and loose them from corporeal and terrene Intanglements. and in the same Treatise, <hi>[tit. quae ratio sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum, &amp;c.]</hi> he lays down this as a Principle, that we cannot attain to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the incorporeal Deity but by the Mediation of the corporeal or incarnate.

§ 4. All these Quotations faulter under the weight of that Vulgar Error, which had the chief hand in corrupting the Original Tradition, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the multiplicity of God-saviours. An Errour (I suppose) at first taken up in Policy, by the Heads of the first Schisms from the Patriarchal Church; who, forsaking the one Body, cleft the one Head, the one Seed, into many, to serve their own Interests: teaching their several Colonies to expect (each Faction in their particular Separations) the Birth of the promised Seed in their own Conventicle: (Just as our modern Separatists from the Unity of the Catholick Church teach their several Parties to believe, that they are that peculiar Society, out of which must procede those more than men who must effect those strange things of which they dream waking.) And when upon these suggestions, each Schismatical Confederacy had brought forth Saviours of their own flesh and bone, the Politicians were forc'd to allow this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, for peace sake, to suppress their otherwise-endless contendings, about the priority of those several Saviours, which each Nation, before mutual Commerce, had made to it self: and the Meliority of those various Religions, wherewith those Gods were worshipp'd. To prevent irreconcileable wrangl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this diversity (appearing still more and more, as the Nations of the World came acquainted with one another: So as not so much as the Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that stands upon <hi>Hydras</hi> back to tantalize the Crow, but was contended about: some affirming it to be, that wherein <hi>Matusius</hi> presented to <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> his Daughters Blood mixt with Wine; others, that wherein <hi>Icarius</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Wine to the Ligurians, <hi>&amp;c. (Hygini poetic. astronom. tit.

This point of Gentilism <hi>Joshua</hi> disswaded the Israelites from imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, in his sarcastical allowing them to chuse, whether they would serve the Gods of the Nation, from whence they came; or of the Nations of of whose Land they had got the possession: or of the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jocob:</hi> of whose Faith this was the Crown, that coming into a strange Country, they neither brought their <hi>Penates</hi> with them, nor received the Gods of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but adhered to the true God who appeared to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whereas <hi>Nahor</hi>'s Family was tainted with the vulgar Error of Local Deities: so far, as <hi>Rachel</hi> (not daring to trust her self in a foreign Country without the salvifick presence of her Fathers Gods) stole away those consecrated Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them, into which she conceiv'd the Spirits of those Gods were entred: The purging his Family of which, and erecting an Altar, and adhering to the worship of that God appeared to him, was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s commendation.</p>
                  <p>The Mixture of Religions in <hi>Samaria</hi> grew up of the same seed; as also the fearful Apostacies of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> both while they were one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and after they were divided into two Kingdoms. For, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in their own God, they called in, as it were to his aid, the Gods of <hi>Egypt</hi> (the golden Calves) the Gods of <hi>Moab, Baal-Peor, &amp;c.</hi> whom while they sought to please, with services sutable to each Deity, they fell to these barbarous immoralities (of open Fornication, of Sacrificing Children, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as ripened them for Transportation and Captivity. In which School of Affliction they so profitted, as after that they could never be induc'd, by the severest torments, to invocate the names of any foreign Gods. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Philosophers.</p>
                  <p>From this Distribution of Countries (saith <hi>Celsus)</hi> among Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, and their disposal of Religious Affairs, congruously to the Climates which fell to their lots; it comes to pass, that diverse Countries have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Funeral Rites: some by burning, some by interring, some by bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Kindreds Maws: each affirming their ownway best for themselves, and most pleasing to their Local Deities. So as the <hi>Scythians</hi> esteem <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balism</hi> a sober and religious Custom; and some <hi>Indians</hi> account it an act of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43715:92"/>
Piety to kill and eat their decrepit Fathers. Of which different Sentiments we have a famous Example in the Story of <hi>Darius;</hi> who calling together his <hi>Grecian</hi> Companies, and asking at what price they would be hired, to devour their defunct Friends? received this answer from them, That they would not by any means be hired to commit so savage an Act: then calling his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Soldiers (whose Funeral Ceremony was, with a great deal of solemnity, and ostentation of Piety, to devour their deceased Parents) he propounded to them what wages he should give them to burn the Bodies of their dead Kindred? They holding up their hands, as Men astonish'd at the horror of this Motion, beseech him he would not pollute his Tongue and their Ears with such a more than barbarous proposal.</p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Celsus</hi> can allow the <hi>Jew</hi> to adhere to the Religion of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but that he should impose upon all other Nations the God of <hi>Israel</hi> (one of the least and most contemptible Provinces of the World) this he can by no means digest. Hence <hi>Josephus (contrà Appion, l.</hi> 2.) is so shie of condemning the Religions of other Countries; that to the calumners of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> he promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he will not recriminate; it being sufficient for him to maintain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of his own Country, without taxing others: their Law forbidding them to speak evil of the Gods. And that therefore what he should speak in disparagement of the Grecian Deities, should be no other, than what had been formerly said by their own most approved Authors. Though he was grosly mistaken in his interpretation of that Sentence <hi>[Thou shalt not speak evil of the Gods:]</hi> (that being intended of Magistrates, as his Contemporary St. <hi>Paul</hi> rightly applied it <hi>(Act.</hi> 23. 5.) Yet this argues how tender that great Politician was, of breaking the Bond of common Peace, which tack'd upon this Pin; Let every Nation abound in its own sence, as to Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

There also I read, that God the Word</hi> was not born of flesh or blood, nor of the will of man, or the will of the flesh, but of God: <hi>Item ibi legi, quià Deus Verbum</hi> non ex carne, non ex sanguine, non ex voluntate viri, ne<expan>

               <p>To spare the labour of particularizing; the Thessalian Hag in <hi>Lucian (lib.</hi> 6.) boasts, that she could charm what Gods she pleased, to whatsoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary acts she pleased: 1. Not only the bad Spirits, from doing the ill they are inclin'd to, or to do the good they are averse to (with power the Saviour of Mankind must be invested in, or those malicious Spirits (of whom the Platonicks make frequent mention) would prove too hard for him.) And therefore sacred Records inform us: That God bound up the lying, and forc'd a true Prophetick Spirit upon <hi>Baalam,</hi> contrary to the grain of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous inclination; from which he could not extricate himself, by all the sacrifices he could offer, or shifting of place; (supposing, belike, the Daemon that bound him, might possibly be some God of the Vallies; or, if of the Hills, his Territories might not reach to all those upon which he sought for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments.)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43715:96"/>
And that our Saviours substitutes (his Ministers sent forth for the good of his people) <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Michael. (dan. 10. 13, 20, 21.) (vide Bullingerum in locum &amp; in decadibus,)</hi> though for some while impeded by the Princes of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> and other Nations (that is those Caco-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to whose lot, by their own choice (and Divine Justice saying <hi>Amen</hi> to their choice) they were fallen:) yet at last cast off those bonds, and break through the thickest files of their united force, to bring relief to <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s people. 2. Nor the good spirits to exert their salvifick Powers; as <hi>Moses</hi> detain'd the Angel of Gods presence, and <hi>Jacob</hi> the Angel that wrastled with him. 3. But the very best, fairest, and most beneficial of their Gods, from granting the just desires of their most religious Worshippers, and to gratifie the most impious requests of malicious Conjurers. A clear confession, that the best and greatest of those reputed God-saviours, were so far from being able to purge Souls, as themselves stood in need of being purged, from the pest of fear. St <hi>Austin</hi> ingeniously, <hi>[Mirum est autem quòd benignus ille</hi> Chaldaeus <hi>qui Theurgicis sacris animam purgare cupiebat, non invenit aliquem superiorem De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, qui vel plus terreret atque ad benefaciendum cogeret territos Deos, vel ab eis terrentem compesceret, ut liberè benefacerent: sic tamen Theurgo bono sacra defu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt, quibus ipsos Deos quos invocabat, animae purgatores prius ab illa timoris peste purgaret.] (de Civitate, 10. 10.) It is strange, that that</hi> Chaldean <hi>did not find out some superiour God; who could, either by greater terror force the terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods to do good, or to drive from them him that terrified them: and yet so far was that good conjurer destitute of sacred Rites, by which he might purge those soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purging Gods themselves of the Plague of their own fear.</hi> A passion which he who undertakes the rescue of men's Souls; if he be not absolutely exempted from, he is render'd utterly incapable to perform the office of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Upon these Considerations <hi>Porphyry (de sacrificiis)</hi> grounds this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. That as these reputed <hi>God-presidents</hi> had no power of releiving, but within their own respective Jurisdictions; so the purgation of the humane Soul was wholly out of their reach. <hi>The spiritual part of the Soul</hi> (saith he) <hi>which takes in the Images of Corporeal things, from the Fantasie, inform'd by the common Sense, may (by the cooperations of those</hi> Daemons) <hi>with certain Magical Consecrations, be made capable to receive the Images of those Spirits, and to see those kinds of Gods: But the Intellectual Soul, wherein is received the Verity of intelligible things, that have no resemblances of Bodies, cannot receive, by such Consecrations, any such Purgation, as renders it fit to see its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per God, or those things that are true.</hi> Yet <hi>Porphyry</hi> (in the same place) takes down the efficacy of these Saviours one Pegg lower, and leaves them nothing to put forth their salvifick power upon, but Temporal Concerns, and the goods of the Body, or Fortune; and therefore counts it madness, in Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, to make any application to them; though perhaps (and but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) it be necessary for Cities to procure their favour, and make them, by material Sacrifices, propitious to them; for the sake of that external and corporeal good, they may confer upon those, who place their well-being in the affluence of such things. (The fairies may drop a Teaster into the good huswise's shoe, and that's the summ of their rewards.) And yet these Saviours cannot save to themselves this poor pittance of power; denied to them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who (in his five first Books <hi>de Civitate)</hi> not only proves, but proves out of Pagan Records, that those Saviours can neither do good nor hurt. But by the most sage Philosophers, and Philosophizing Poets, there quoted by him; to which quotation I refer my Reader, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to another Argument, for the proof of the agreement of the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks with us Christians in this Point, That none of those (by the Vulgar reputed) blessed Spirits, who became incarnate to redeem Mankind, were qualified for that Work: which was therefore to be laid upon one more mighty than them all; able to grapple with all opposite Infernal Powers;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43715:96"/>
an undauntable Lion, who would not faint nor be discouraged by Lions in the way; a Passion to which all their known God-saviours were subject, and thereby rendred incapable to accomplish the end of their supposed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Porphyry</hi> (in his first, <hi>de regressu animae)</hi> professeth himself of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>[That God was not so deficient in his care of Man, as not to provide as general a way of Purgation, as the Infection was; and make the Plaister as broad as the Sore:]</hi> which universal way of Redemption he confesses, had not been communicated to the World, as far as he could learn, either by the Customs of the Indians, the Disciplines of the Chaldeans, or the Philosophical Schools: there being something of what, in common Reason, was required, in order to the effecting of the Cure, wanting in all those ways of Soul-purgation, to which the most inquisitive Persons had applied themselves. Upon which that great Light of <hi>Africa,</hi> St. <hi>Austin (de civitate,</hi> 22. 27.) hath this Note: <hi>[Had</hi> Plato <hi>and</hi> Porphyry <hi>compared Notes, they would have turn'd Christian,]</hi> that is, had <hi>Plato</hi> dared to have spoken, as freely as his Scholar did, for an Universal Saviour: and had not <hi>Porphyry</hi> forsaken his Master in that point of Truth, which he asserted, touching the Incarnation and sufferings of the Saviour, they would have joyned hands with the Christian, and have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to his <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> This very Notion was the ground of their erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Altars and preferring Prayers to the unknown God. Hence the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners call every man upon his God; and lest they might all mistake the true God-saviour, they awaken <hi>Jonah</hi> to call upon his God for help in that exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>(Jonah</hi> 1. 5.) hence they were wont to close their petitions with <hi>[Dii Deaeque omnes:] (Servius in Virg.

                  <hi>Messias;</hi> but had that done to her hand by other Heathen Divines, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they had respect unto him, that was to be born <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For though I believe the more ancient Times look'd upon them <hi>[as deliramenta]</hi> as little better than the dotages of old Women; because of their denouncing certain monstrous Miracles, without describing either how, or when, or by whom, those things were to be effected (of which deficiency both <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> after, and <hi>Cicero</hi> before Christs Birth, take notice:) yet when the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> Prophecy touching the <hi>Messias</hi> came to light (by means of the <hi>Septuagint)</hi> those Scripture-oracles, by their punctual describing of every circumstance, gave that light to those more general <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles, as they grew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to that party, that could not endure to hear of a change of the Worlds Government, into that form which both of them foretold the rising up of. And when the general ones in <hi>Sibyl,</hi> and the more distinct ones of sacred Scripture, came to receive their accomplishment, their sense grew more plain, and the application of them more obvious, which till then was unintelligible. The voices of the Prophets sounded in the ears of the Jewish people for above fifteen hundred years; and yet were not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, till Christ's Doctrine, Actions, and Passion had commented upon them.</p>
               <p>I do not at all wonder, with the learned <hi>Dalaeus (de usu patr. lib. 1. cap. 3.)</hi> that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (in zeal to <hi>Origen)</hi> should forge an apology for him, under the name of <hi>Pamphilus;</hi> nor that he should father a Treatise of <hi>Sextus,</hi> the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean</hi> Philosopher, upon <hi>Sixtus,</hi> the holy Martyr: nor that he of whom St. <hi>Jerom</hi> complains, should forge a Letter under his name, wherein he makes him confess, the Hebrews had by their delusions perswaded him to translate the Bible, after that maner he did: But rather at his ranking the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers among Forgers, for their quoting the Sibylline Oracles; and most of all at the reason he gives: [because <hi>Celsus</hi> objected that against Christians.] For had he consulted the place, he might have taken notice of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Reply; That, if <hi>Celsus</hi> his Epicurism would give him lieve to put himself to the trouble of examining the Authors, out of which they made their quotations, he would find, they did not forge them of their own heads, but found them in Authors of high esteem among all Philosophers but those of <hi>Celsus</hi> his Sect: <hi>(Origen contrà Celsum, lib. 7. Calum.</hi> 16.) Besides, it is not like that such holy men would support so strong an edifice, with so weak a prop of a pious fraud; or borrow help from a falshood, to evince the Truth. If they durst have been so impudently ventrous, how easie had it been for their learned Adversaries to have detected the Imposture, and silenced the Christian Advocates with reproach and shame? (as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in answer to <hi>Casaubon (Geogr. Marmoricâ, pag.</hi> 931.)</p>
               <p>If it be question'd, how they came into the Christians hands? <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> inform us, out of their own Writers; That the Books of all the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> save <hi>Cumana,</hi> were vulgar, and in every Man's hand that would reach for them.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Augustus</hi> caused a thousand <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles to be burnt (which by the number seem to be those very Verses of <hi>Erythraea</hi> which the Roman Legats collected;) against which he might (perhaps) have a pique, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of State, because of their agreement with that Eastern Oracle, which had put the World into those expectations of a change, as that wise Prince thought ought not to be cherished; as tending toward the keeping of the Empire from a perfect settlement. Upon the same account <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in his Edileship, the year before <hi>M. Anthony</hi>'s overthrow) banished Astrologers and Prestigiators <hi>(Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 49.) perhaps, because upon their instigation, <hi>Anthony</hi> had caused the <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrians</hi> to give to <hi>Caesarion</hi> the Title of King of Kings. Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Manuscripts, out of which the copies were transcribed, were still in Being.</p>

said but this: That the Fathers made no quotations out of those Books of <hi>Cumena</hi> which <hi>Tarquin</hi> bought (the only Books there laid up, and into which alone it was not lawful for any to look, but the <hi>Quindecim-viri,</hi> to whose custody they were committed:) and had they been as common and vulgar as the rest were, out of which the Fathers made their allegations, it is like the Church would have made little or no use of them. For, from the time wherein that Prophetess liv'd, and the use which the <hi>Romans</hi> made of them, I guess she wrote in another strain, and by another spirit, than <hi>Cumaea</hi> and the rest did. <hi>[Quod ex Cumaeo carmine se fassus est transtulisse</hi> Virgilius, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam fortassis etiam ista vates eliquid de unico Salvatore in spiritu audierat, quod necesse habuit confiteri.] (August.

As for other <hi>Sibyllines</hi> they were burnt afterwards indeed (by the Arch-traytor <hi>Stilico:)</hi> but before that time, the best part of them had been quoted by, and transcribed into other Authors, out of which, what is now extant of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> is for the most part gathered, <hi>(Heylin Geogr.

               <p>§ 4. But to put it beyond all possibility of a rational Doubt, That the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byls</hi> were preexistent to the Apostles, as to those their Oracles which the Church made use of: <hi>Virgil</hi> had out of them (before our Saviour's Birth) composed his <hi>Genethliacon:</hi> wherein, as he interprets them to portend the greatest change and restoration of the World, by the procurement of one to be born about that time; so he comprehends all, in effect, which the Fathers quoted the <hi>Sibyls</hi> for: all which are not applicable to any person, that has yet appeared in the World, save the blessed <hi>Jesus.</hi> So that both Song and Descant <hi>(mutato nomine)</hi> were made to the Churches hand. See <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Speech (in <hi>Eusebius)</hi> chap. 20. where that religious Emperour comments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Virgil</hi>'s 4. Eclog, and shews, That he (who was contemporary with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus)</hi> in that Oracle, translated out of <hi>Sibyl,</hi> wrote so truly and aptly of Christ, <hi>[Ut nec his veriùs quicquam, nec ad Servatoris virtutem aptiùs dici pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:] That nothing could be said either more truly or more properly of our Saviour, than the contents of that Poem.</hi>

               <p>Add to this the diligence used by the Romans, to prevent the taking of forged Oracles into the <hi>Sibylline Canon;</hi> exprest by <hi>Tacitus (Annal.</hi> 6.) in the case of <hi>Quintilianus</hi> the Tribune, his putting it to the Senat's Vote, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a certain Book of <hi>Sibyl</hi> (which <hi>Caninius Gallus,</hi> the <hi>Quindecim-vir,</hi> had requested might be received into the number of the Sibyllines) should be put into the Canon? Of which <hi>Tiberius</hi> hearing, chides the Tribune, as too young to understand how business of that consequence ought to be managed: but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely rebukes <hi>Gallus,</hi> for that he being an old Master of Ceremonies, should so much, as put it to the question, before he had (as the manner was) caused the Book to be read and canvas'd by his <hi>Colleagues</hi> and other persons skill'd in such Affairs; withal admonishing him, how <hi>Augustus</hi> (for that many vain things went under the famous name of <hi>Sybyl)</hi> had decreed, That it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, that those Verses should pass (though but in private hands for <hi>Sibyls,</hi>

that had not been first legally examin'd. <hi>The like caution our Forefathers used</hi> (saith he) <hi>after the burning of the</hi> Capitol <hi>in the</hi> Social <hi>war, making search in</hi> Samos, Ilium, Erythrae, <hi>through</hi> Africk <hi>also and</hi> Sicily <hi>and the</hi> Italick <hi>Colonies, for the Verses of</hi> Sibyl, <hi>[dato Sacerdotibus negotio, quantum humana ope potuissent, vera discernere:] (Tacit. ib.) and committing to the Priests the charge of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which were true, as far as by humane strength it was possible.</hi> I observe here by the way, that no <hi>Sibylline</hi> Verses were permitted to be, even in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hands, but such as were approved to be such; and that therefore those <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles which the <hi>Quindecimviri,</hi> after approbation, had received into their custody, remained (in other Copies) in private hands, and were not (as those of <hi>Cumena)</hi> lock'd up from vulgar inspection. But that for which I directly alledge this discourse of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is, to prove, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> State would allow nothing for <hi>Sibylline,</hi> that would not endure the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest scrutiny. And therefore had those Verses which the Church quoted, as such, been spurious, (or but under the least suspicion thereof) we should have heard of it by otherwise Persons than <hi>Celsus,</hi> we should have heard not only the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Hogs grunting it, but the Lions roaring it against us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> indeed excepts against the divine Original of those <hi>Acrostick Sibyllines</hi> (out of which <hi>Caesar</hi> procured some body to pick the name of <hi>[a King]</hi> as a Title which the <hi>Universal Monarch</hi> should assume; which Title he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would have had the Senate to confer upon himself:) for that such curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous versifying savour'd too much of the Lamp, and father'd those Poems rather upon humane Industry, than divine Inspiration. But first, this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be of no force with us, who know what excellent Poems <hi>Moses, Deborah, David, Solomon, Hannah, &amp;c.</hi> made, by divine Inspiration: Nor with those eminent Philosophers, who queried how <hi>Apollo</hi> came to lose his versifying Vein? of which they could not have had any scruple, if they had not believed his Oracles were at first given out in Verse: nor with himself, if he had not forgot, since the Father whipt the Son for extemporizing in that Vein

Or not coneiv'd the Divine Mind not able to do that, (when it would) which his did (against his will.) Secondly, had they been the result of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, it could not be of those men that were not in Being till after he was in his Grave, as the Christian Name it self was. And lastly, had he had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on his side (which is the main proof in matters of fact) he would rather have produced Witnesses to depose, who was the suspected father, by what Legerdemain they gain'd the repute of being <hi>Sibyls</hi> (and that among the <hi>Romans,</hi> where none could be canonized for such, till they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the severest censure that humane Wit could invent, to try their legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy by:) than attempt to prove them Bastards by such weak reasons, as have not force enough to repel the single Testimony of any one person that is not of profligated credit, much less the united Vote of the uninterrupted succession of the whole <hi>College</hi> of the <hi>Quindecim-viri</hi> and most knowing <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Divines:</hi> who (before <hi>Tully</hi> was born) upon serious examination, had past them for Sibylline: and (after the divulging his reasons to the contrary) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in the Opinion, That they were not of humane Invention, but divine Extraction. Briefly, I shall despair of ever disputing those men out of their preoccupations, with whom the Rhetorical flourishes of one Orator, or the Fancy of one <hi>Augur</hi> (and he prejudic'd by interest) is of more weight; than the joynt authority of so many Sages, and the general Voice of all people, who had no temptation to be too favourable, but rather over-severe, in their sentencing those Books to be <hi>Sibyls,</hi> which imported, not only such alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in general, as the forethought of, is naturally sormidable to all honest men of settled and composed spirits, (that love not to fish in troubled waters:)

I proceed to shew that all they who imbraced those Oracles (and they were the far greater part of the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated World) were of opinion (if not faith) that the Universal Redeemer could not be any created blessed Spirit, but the Eternal God himself, who to that end was to be incarnate; this being the Respond of those Oracles they held to be divine.</p>

Besides, <hi>Isocrates,</hi> in comparing him with <hi>Theseus,</hi> observes that <hi>Theseus</hi> his gests were (in their own nature) behoofful to the several Countries wherein they were perform'd; and yet he was not deified. A manifest Argument, that the World, in its <hi>canonizing Saviours,</hi> consider'd not, so much, the present beneficialness of mens Exploits, to them for whom they were perform'd; as their expiatory painfulness to them that perform'd them. And therefore that strenuous and philosophizing Oratour did, contrary to his wont, put in a Bar against <hi>Euagoras</hi> his obtaining the honour of being esteemed a God, in that very Argument he presseth for his deserving of it, as well as, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than, the best of the reputed <hi>Semidei:</hi> for that their lives were incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with bitter afflictions, but his (like that of the Gods) freed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances. For, by his favour, this was the Worlds sense; That who so would redeem the World from misery, must, while he abode in this Rule (to which he descended for Man's relief) undergo misery, be (in the Prophet's Language) <hi>a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;</hi> I say acquainted with it; grief must dog them, and tread upon their heel. Hence it was that <hi>Q.

               <p>§ 2. This Doctrine the World wrote in the blood of her Sacrifices, which was universally accounted Expiatory, at the first, in reference to that which was to flow from the bruised Heel of the Womans Seed. <hi>[Vide Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (de ratione Circumcisionis) hujus oblationis doctrinam sacrificia continebant antiqua.]</hi> To whom <hi>Calvin</hi> assents; <hi>[Ipso more sacrificandi, quamvis adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino, convictae fuere gentes propriae indignitatis, ut agnoscere deberent, humano generi non aliter propitium esse Deum quàm reconciliatione interpositâ—dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus quicunque unquam Deum verè quaesierunt, litationem in sanguine tulisse, ità ante Legem latam semper victimis sancita erat Religio:] (Calvin in 2. praecept.) Sacrifices of old contain'd the Doctrine of the oblation of Christ's Blood</hi> (saith St. <hi>Cyprian.) By the very manner of sacrificing</hi> (saith <hi>Calvin) though adulterated, the Gentiles were convinc'd of their own unworthiness, and that they ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that God is not made propitious any other way, than by the interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reconciliation wrought by the Blood of the promised Seed: we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learn, that whosoever sought God truly, offer'd bloody Sacrifices. So that Religion was always (even before the giving of the Law) ratified by Victimes.</hi> Though in process of time, the Gentile, that had the Institution of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing only by oral Tradition, grew as vain as (and no more vain than) the Jew (who had that Tradition in writing) did, in a shorter tract of time; both of them misconceiving the Blood of Bulls and Goats to be in themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations for sin, without relation to that which it typified Yet as God hath beaten the Jew from that conceit, ever since the final demolishing of that Temple, wherein alone it is lawful for him to offer bloody Sacrifices; so the Gentile argued himself out of it by degrees: in so much as in those parts of the World, that have continued Pagan to our memory, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43715:106"/>
the time ('tis so long since) when any Blood was offer'd (as propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) but humane. <hi>(Heylin America) The Inhabitants of</hi> Nova Gallicia <hi>are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of the Sun, and Cannibals (pag. 1041.) They of</hi> Nova Hispania <hi>think the Gods are pleased with the blood of Men, which they sacrifice to them (pag. 1044.) The Men of</hi> Peru, <hi>at the death of their great men use to kill and bury with them one or more of their Servants: (pag. 1065.) They of</hi> Brasil, <hi>on high Festival days, have publick assemblies, and make merry over the roasted Body of a fat man, whom they cut in collops and eat (pag. 1079.) This makes me think they are</hi> Cannibals, <hi>not in respect of their common Meals, but their Religious Festivals; or if they eat mans flesh ordinarily, they contracted that Custom (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations did that of eating the flesh of Beasts) by using to eat it, at Sacrifice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feast: however I find not any sacrifices in use in that new found World but of men.</hi> And where the blood of Beasts was sacrificed of old (as old as any Secular History reaches to) there also was offered the blood of Men, in order to the pacifying of divine Wrath; a clear evidence that the World durst not trust to any, but the Blood of the Womans Seed, to make its peace with Heaven.</p>
               <p>For the inforcing of this Argument it will be requisite that I prove these three Points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, so far as Secular History reacheth, it hath been the universal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the Pagan World, to sacrifice men for the appeasing of the divine Wrath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Custom was not taken up in imitation of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offer to sacrifice <hi>Isaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But upon the Worlds Experience of the ineffectualness of the Blood of Beasts, after it had lost the true Institution of bestial Sacrifices, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rest in the <hi>opere operato</hi> of sacrificing, without respect to the blood of the Womans Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the first, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus (protreptic.)</hi> instanceth in the <hi>Messenians,</hi> among whom <hi>Aristomenes</hi> sacrificed, for the appeasing of the Gods, three hundred men. The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> among whom <hi>Theopompus</hi> did the like. The <hi>Tauri</hi> (a people inhabiting the Taurican <hi>Chersonesus)</hi> who sacrificed all the Strangers they could lay hands on to <hi>Diana</hi> (quoting for this <hi>Enripedes.)</hi> (That pair-royal of Friends, <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> had died no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death; if they had slain their Keepers, and stolen away the Goddess: <hi>(Lucian.

And to sacrifice to the same God their own Children. After whose Dialect <hi>(Micah</hi> 6. 7.) the Prophet introduceth apostate <hi>Judah</hi> querying, <hi>[Shall I give my first born for my trangression? the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?]</hi> to which the Spirit returns this pat answer: <hi>[He hath shewed thee, O man, what

Of the same bran (saith he) are the Rites of the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> whose Priests attone her with the Blood of their Genitals, and of <hi>Bellona</hi> wherein her Priests lance and slash their own shoulders, with Swords which they carry in both their hands, as they run like frantick men about her Altars: the very same Oratory which the Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> used, who in their contest with <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he lent a deaf ear to the sound of their Prayers, lifted up to him the voice of their blood, as that, they doubted not but would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for them a favourable audience. <hi>Herodotus</hi> (in his <hi>Euterpe pag.</hi> 128.) relates; how at <hi>Busiris,</hi> in the Festivals of <hi>Isis,</hi> after the Sacrifice, the whole Company (being many thousands) lash themselves till blood come: and that in <hi>Papremis,</hi> the Company that assemble (to worship the Deity of that place) fall together by the ears, and wound, yea kill one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion (Roman. histor. lib.</hi> 43.) reports, that <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> to propitiate <hi>Mars,</hi> caused to be sacrificed to him two of those Mutineers, who raised a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in the Camp, because of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Prodigality in his exhibiting showes and Plays to the Senate and People (grudging that so much water should run beside their Mill:) for which (he saith) he had neither <hi>Sibylline,</hi> nor any other express Oracle, but only Custom.</p>

                  <hi>Pliny (lib.</hi> 36.) writes, that the <hi>Moors</hi> sacrificed Men to <hi>Hercules:</hi> others say to <hi>Saturn</hi> (as <hi>Plato,</hi> by name, in his <hi>Minoe,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassus;</hi> as also <hi>Theodoritus Cyrenaeus.)</hi>

                  <hi>Tacitus (de moribus Germanorum)</hi> saith, That the <hi>Germans</hi> do on certain stated days appease <hi>Mercury</hi> with humane Sacrifices. That the <hi>Semnones</hi> (the most ancient Stock of the <hi>Suevians)</hi> on certain anniversary holy Days, meet together in a sacred Grove, and begin the solemnity of the day with sacrificing a man for the Common Good; (for so I translate his <hi>[caeso publicè homine.]</hi> That the <hi>Reudigni, Aviones, Angli, Varini, Eudoses, Snardones, Nucthones,</hi> in the service they perform'd to the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> (whom they call <hi>Hertham,</hi> that is <hi>Earth,</hi> the very English of the <hi>Grecian</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The same Historian <hi>Tacitus (an. 14. fol.</hi> 207.) tells us that <hi>Suetonius Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> (at the taking of the Ifle of <hi>Man)</hi> found Groves devoted there to bloody Superstition: for they used to sacrifice Captives at their Altars, and to look into their inwards by way of <hi>Auguration.</hi>

               <p>This Custom reached to the farthest Western Nations (as <hi>Plutarch (de su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitione)</hi> observes) who, if they had Children of their own, sacrificed them to <hi>Saturn,</hi> if not, bought other mens Children, to that purpose, as men buy Lambs or Chickens. While they were sacrificing their Mothers were to stand by and look on, who if they shewed any sign of sorrow, they were ever after accounted opprobrious persons.</p>
               <p>Yea, as far as (the then reputed World's end) <hi>Hercules Pillars</hi> (as <hi>Timae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Historian affirms, in his <hi>rebus Deliacis;)</hi> for the Inhabitants near to those Pillars (saith he) use to sacrifice their Kinsfolks, if they reach the seventieth year.</p>

               <p>These two last I report upon the Credit of <hi>Natalis Comes (Mytholog. l. cap. 17. de victimis:)</hi> not out of penury (for to the best of my knowledge there is not an old Historian extant, that gives not many Examples of this inhumane Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:) but because I would not let this part of my Discourse pass without the honourable mention of his Name, who hath taken such <hi>Herculean</hi> pains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject: to whose Labours I refer my Reader for fuller satisfaction; if he require any; after he hath heard <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Judgment, <hi>(Apolog. 8.) [à vobis ostendam fieri, partim in aperto partim in occulto; per quod forsitan &amp; de nobis credidistis,]</hi> to wit, That the commonness of humane Sacrifices, through the Pagan World, induc'd them to believe that Calumny raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Christians, <hi>[That in their Coventicles they sacrificed a Ghild, whose blood they mingled with crums of Bread, and so did eat it.]</hi> (A Calumny rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their mistake of the Christians Commemorative Sacrifice, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body and Blood of Christ.) A thing so abhorrent to Nature, as no man could deem it possible for another man to grow so inhumane, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he who was himself grown so inhumane. And therefore saith he of all things, our sacrificing Children should not be objected to us as a crime, by the Heathens; who themselves did immolate Infants to <hi>Saturn,</hi> openly and without controul, till <hi>Tiberius,</hi> being Proconsul of <hi>Africk,</hi> nail'd the Priests themselves to those Crosses upon which they used to crucifie Children: and now secretly, notwithstanding the Imperial Edicts against it.

deaths? or of those who in the prime and flower of their Age do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Victimes, for the benefit of Man-kind: since a few more years will put them beyond their choice, and bring them under a necessity of dying: whereas that Blood, which we affirm to have been shed for the sins of the World, was the Blood of a spotless Lamb: offer'd by Christ himself; (he was Priest as well as Sacrifice,) and laid down his Life; for no man could take it from him against his will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>§. 3. Touching the second branch of this argument, That this custom of propitiating the Deity with the oblation of Human blood, was not in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the corruption of the old Tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though I find great names muster'd against this Assertion, yet when I consider that they march under the conduct of the Jewish Rabbins (who are ambitious of having the whole World in debt to them) this Army of Lions grows less formidable, as being led on and headed by such sheepish Captains, as <hi>R. Salomon Jarchi,</hi> who (upon <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 7. 31.) bringeth in God speaking concerning <hi>Molech</hi> after this manner <hi>[When I spake to</hi> Abraham <hi>to sacrifice his Son, it entred not into my heart that he should sacrifice him, but to make known his righteousness.]</hi> having first fancied, that the Heathen, in defence of their practice, objected the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham.</hi> A thing which no more enter'd into the Pagan's heart, than it did into God's to have <hi>Isaac</hi> sacrificed; nor was ever objected to the Jews; of which this (I conceive) is proof sufficient: That neither <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> nor <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus,</hi> nor his Adversary <hi>Appion,</hi> make the least mention of the Heathens imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating <hi>Abraham,</hi> or pleading their imitation of him in their own defence. A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny from which those great Patrons of Judaism would certainly have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Religion, had it then been objected, when they wrote of that Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Josephus (Jud. antiq. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 14.) most copiously: and <hi>Philo (de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugis)</hi> allegorically: neither can it stand with reason that <hi>Appion</hi> (who scraped up whatsoever he could find in Books, or invent of his own Brain against the Jewish Religion) should omit so material and plausible a Plea, if the World had then thought of it.</p>
               <p>The first clear intimation of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering his Son that is met with in Pagan Writers is in <hi>Porphyry</hi> (as he is quoted by <hi>Eusebius) (praeparat.

If I may call that clear which the two eyes of Learning, <hi>Grotius (in dent.</hi> 18. 10.) and <hi>Vosstus (de idol.</hi> 1. 18.) cannot see how at all it concerns <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber of <hi>Eusebius</hi> meeting with [<gap reason="foreign">

But that he was not elder than <hi>Gideon</hi> doth necessarily follow from hence: (see <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet, Orig. l. 1. cap. 2. sect.</hi> 3. 4.) and indeed 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest he was much younger than <hi>Gideon:</hi> from which Chronological Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those that are of opinion that the Heathens sacrificed Children in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I argue against that opinion thus: If the story of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Fact had not till that time arrived, by Oral Tradition, at their next door neighbours (the Phaenicians) but must be fetch'd out of Hebrew Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, till then unknown (to the greatest Antiquary the Heathen World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords;) how can it be imagin'd that the report thereof should reach all over <hi>Canaan,</hi> so many hundreds of years before that; wherein children were made oblations, so long even before <hi>Moses,</hi> as he speaks thereof as of ancient use among them. <hi>Even their sons and their daughters have they burn'd in the fire to their Gods.] (Deut.</hi> 12. 31.) In which particular God himself is so far from suspecting the Gentiles would or did follow <hi>Israel,</hi> as he gives <hi>Israel</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to follow the Gentiles: <hi>[Thou shalt not enquire after their Gods, saying, How did these Nations serve their Gods? even so will I do likewise.] (vers.</hi> 30.) which would have been to small purpose, had the Gentiles in those oblations followed <hi>Abraham;</hi> for the Jew might then have replyed (to the Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking him for that practise) that therein he followed the Nations, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wherein they followed <hi>Abraham</hi> (whom those very Prophets bid them look to, who were sent to rebuke them for sacrificing their sons and daughters to <hi>Molech.)</hi> It would have been more seasonable in that case (had the case been as our Opponents imagine) to have warned them not to look to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to the intentions of God to try <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Love and Faith, in his tempting him to offer his only Son and his Son of Promise. But the Psalmist <hi>(Psal.</hi> 106. 35.) hath determin'd it beyond all doubt, that the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in sacrificing their Sons and Daughters served the Idols of <hi>Canaan</hi> and learned their works, that is, those abominations which the Canaanites had practised (as <hi>Moses</hi> saith) before <hi>Israel</hi> came among them: and for which <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> should have rooted them out.

As far west as <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars: that is, through all the Nations of which ancient History gives us account. For this custom, of sacrificing men to appease the divine wrath, will appear to have been in a manner universal (almost, if not altogether) as early as that Age wherein the most critical Computers affirm <hi>Sanconiathon</hi> to have lived: If we cast a diligent eye back upon those quotations that have been already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.

               <p>§ 4. Touching the third branch of this argument, That the custom of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing children is to be father'd, upon the corruption of the old Tradition, of sacrificing Beasts, after the world (having lost the ground of the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of sacrifices) thought the bestial Sacrifices, of themselves (without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the blood of the womans seed, which they typified) were propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and found them, by after experience, in-available, This is in it self so rational an Hypothesis (upon the grant, that it is not to be father'd upon the Example of <hi>Abraham)</hi> as, that, being disinherited, the estate must fall to this, as heir at Law. Yet, because that hath carried it by so long a Prescription, I shall not move for its total Ejectment; till I have proved the Title of this to the Child whose Parentage is in controversie. To wit, that God having made promise of the Woman's Seed, and instituted Sacrifices as Types of that blood: <hi>(Grotius</hi> reck ons the custom of Victimes among those which were not taken up by natural Instinct, nor the Collection of Reason, but by divine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: a custom retain'd in all Places and Ages <hi>(de verit. Christ. rel. lib.</hi> 1.) the World corrupting that Tradition, came to this point: that humane Blood must be more effectual, than bestial, to attone the divine Justice.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Agathocles</hi> had subdued <hi>Affrick</hi> (with the remainder of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which when it was intire, was routed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> by the Carthaginians) and laid seige to <hi>Carthage:</hi> the Inhabitants imputing the disaster to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of the Gods, betake themselves to all manner of Supplications, and see the Gods whom they supplicate with large donatives; for they thought (saith <hi>Diodorus)</hi> by this means to deprecate the anger of the Gods, <hi>[If to their prayers they join'd sacrifices and donatives.] (Diodor. Sicul. bibliothec. l.</hi> 20.) But suspecting all this would not pacifie the enraged Deity: at last they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to humane Sacrifices; and immolate, for the publick Good, two hundred of the choicest Sons of the most Noble Persons: to whom two hundred more of Voluntiers joyn'd themselves; and so march'd four hundred in a Body to the Altars of <hi>Saturn,</hi> as Victimes for their City. 'Tis easie to observe, in this story, That the Carthaginians looked upon the sacrifices and other gifts they dedicated, as Bribes to blind the eyes, and appease the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their (before that) neglected Gods: But that the suspicion they had (when they considered the imminent danger they were in, and the grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43715:110"/>
of their Crime, in wholly neglecting; and of their fore-fathers, in cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Saturn</hi> with Changlings, instead of Noble-men's Sons) that their Silver and Gold, that their bestial Victims, would not expiate so great a guilt, nor procure Redemption for them from so great a danger; prompted them to make all sure by the oblation of humane Blood: when they revolved these things in their minds, and saw the enemy before their walls, thinking to make up all former breaches with their Gods, and to supply the defect of other applications; they betook themselves to this course of Expiation, saith <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi> To which eminent Act of Piety (as they thought) they imputed the safety of their City and recovery of their Countrey: as on the contrary that Historian in the same Book chargeth <hi>Agathocles</hi> his overthrow upon his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing his Friend and Landlord <hi>Ophella,</hi> to his own ambition. For (saith he) on the same month and day whereon he slew <hi>Ophella,</hi> and drew his Army to himself, he lost in <hi>Sicily</hi> his own Army, and both his Son's, and which is most worthy of note (in his opinion) for slaying one Friend, he not only lost two Sons, but lost them by the hands of <hi>Ophella</hi>'s Souldiers. In which passage my Author seems to compare <hi>Agathocles</hi> his Immolation of <hi>Ophella</hi> to his own lusts, with the Carthaginians Oblation of their Children to <hi>Saturn:</hi> that, the meritorious cause of his ruine: this, of their deliverance. Hence <hi>Philo, [immolandos exhibuisse filios, vel pro incolumitate patriae, velut averterent bella, siccitates, inundationes, pestilentias:] (de</hi> Abrahamo, 243.) <hi>the Gentiles sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced children for the common safety, for the averting of War, Plague, drought,</hi> &amp;c. Hyginus <hi>(Poetic. Astronom. tit. Hydra)</hi> reports that the Plague raging at <hi>Phla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusa</hi> (near <hi>Troy) Demiphon</hi> enquired of the Oracle what course he should take to pacifie the incensed Deity; <hi>Apollo</hi> commands they should every year sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a Virgin of noble Parentage. <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> amongst the most trite and obvious things, in Classick Authors, reckons. <hi>[responsa in pestellentiam data, ut virgines tres aut plures immolentur.] (Satyric. pag. 1.) Responds given, for the removal of the Pestilence, that two or three or more Virgins should be sacrificed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we review those Instances of humane Victimes that have already been quoted, we shall find, they were applyed to (as their sacred Anker) when all other ways of supplications were found inavailable, and their distress such as required immediate redress and would admit of no delay. Thus when the Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> found their God to lend a deaf ear to their Prayers, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him with the voice of their own Blood. When the Grecians in their expedition to <hi>Troy</hi> at <hi>Aulis,</hi> cannot, by their Hecatombs of bestial Victims, obtain the favour of their angry Goddess, they immolate <hi>Iphigenia:</hi> and when in their return home, at the Taurick <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> they cannot by any other means attone <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Ghost, or engage a fair wind homeward, they with joynt consent sacrifice <hi>Polixena.</hi> When the <hi>Marcomanni</hi> invaded the Empire, <hi>an.

               <p>§ 5. But we need no better evidence, that men fled to humane Blood in those extremities (out of which they found no <hi>exit</hi> any other way) than what the sacred Scriptures afford: where it is recorded, that the King of <hi>Moab</hi> being besieged in <hi>Kirharraseth,</hi> &amp; seeing that he could neither hold out against the assaults, nor with his select band make his way through the Forces of his Enemies: and being resolv'd not to yield, till he had tryed the last means of invoking and engaging the divine aid; took his eldest Son (that should have reigned in his stead) and offered him up for a Burnt-offering upon the wall. (2. <hi>Reg. 3. 26.) [And when the King of</hi> Moab <hi>saw that the battel was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men to break through, even to the King of</hi> Edom: <hi>but they could not.

It will be sufficient for my turn, to prove their second not overwise (except in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sence:) being part of them grounded upon their correcting the Text as themselves translate it: the Text <hi>[Accepit filium suum primogenitum:]</hi>—The Margin, <hi>[Corrigendum, [Ejus,] id est, Regis</hi> Edomoeorum.] Such is their conceipt that the King of <hi>Moab</hi> sacrificed the King of <hi>Edom</hi>'s Son: for the framing of which, they turn <hi>[Suum]</hi> (which clearly carries it to the King of <hi>Moab)</hi> into <hi>[Ejus]</hi> to which they make the King of <hi>Edom</hi> the antecedent; whose Son (they would make us believe) the King of <hi>Moab</hi> took Prisoner, in that fruitless sally he made to break through the King of <hi>Edom</hi>'s Forces; a thing in its self ('tis true) possible, though very improbable; that he, who could not break through to the King of <hi>Edom</hi>'s Forces (sor the safety of his life by flight) should be able to carry off such a Prisoner, who, doubtless, was near his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Standard) in his retreat to the City, through the Forces of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> which lay betwixt the City and the King of <hi>Edom;</hi> as that expression does more then imply, <hi>[to break through even unto the King of</hi> Edom;] strange that he should venture back again, through two Armies: with the incumbrance of a Prisoner, rather than through one, for his own safety. <hi>However</hi> the Argument <hi>[à posse ad esse]</hi> can be of no validity here, where the consequence is as manifestly impossible, as it is for God to lye: for the Text saith the King of <hi>Moab</hi> took <hi>[suum primogenitum]</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

and burning them to Chalk; things no more like one another, than Chalk is to Cheese: and all this (as themselves confess) contrary to those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and the authority of good Authors, upon which they had some time been of another Opinion: and (so far as my small reading reacheth) to the current of Expositors, who thus express their judgments touching this Text of <hi>Amos [quando id factum non constat:]</hi> So <hi>Emmanuel Saa [quando hoc fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum sit nusquam legitur:]</hi> So our learned <hi>Gualter.

But that it was the King of <hi>Edom</hi>'s son that was sacrificed in the seige: or that he that was sacrificed, the same man whose bones were burnt to Chalk (according to the tenour of <hi>Amos</hi>'s discourse) neither they nor any considerate man ever thought, before <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Treme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> And now from the clear Text in the book of Kings, and the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of <hi>Josephus</hi> upon it, in order to the clearing of the point, for the proof whereof I alledge this Text: I observe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the King of <hi>Moab</hi> offered his son as an holocaust, as a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifice, to appease the wrath of God. <hi>[Scilicet deo suo, ut sic placa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret:] (Em.

               <p n="2">2. That he betook himself to this way of supplication, when all other means of safety fail'd him, when he was at the utmost point of extremity and despair; <hi>[quod, ubi praeter spem, non successit: rem extremae necessitatis &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperationis aggreditur,] (Joseph. antiq.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That, for the safety of himself and Crown, he sacrifices the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oblation that was in his power (as he thought) to give, his son that was to reign after him; an argument that the Heathen imputed the prevalency of their oblations, to the worth of them and their preciousness in the esteem of those that offer'd them.

               <p>§ 6. To think that God would eat the flesh of Bulls and drink the blood of Goats, to allay his thirst of Revenge, was a most brutish Fancy. But it was most inhumane and barbarous to conceit, such horrid Parricides (as the immolation of Innocents) to make atonement for sin: a fact exceeding in Immanity the savageness of Brutes, who cherish their Off-spring: and pawn their own lives for the safety of their young ones: so as it were better to live after the manner of Beasts, than to worship such impious, tetrical, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary Gods (saith <hi>Lactantius:) (de fulsa Relig.</hi> 1. 21.) yea to deny the Being of God, rather than think him to be such an one as is pleased with such sacrifices; as who so offer, address themselves to Temples; as if they were going to the Caves of Bears, the Dens of Dragons, the lurking places of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Beasts (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> argues) <hi>(de superstitione)</hi> who wonders, that men should account those impious, that deny there is a God: and yet should not esteem them such, as affirm him to be such an one, as the superstitious believe him to be: for my own part (saith he) I would rather chuse, that men should say, there is no such man as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> than that they should say <hi>Plutarch</hi> is so prone to anger, so desirous of revenge, so blood-thirsty as nothing will appease him but the torture of innocents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had it not been more expedient for the Galls and Scythians, never to have taken into their mind any conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption at all of a Deity) than to think those to be Gods, who joy in the blood of butcher'd men; and that to be the most perfect sacrifice? Had it not been more profitable for the Carthaginians, to have had (at first) such Law-givers as <hi>Critius</hi> or <hi>Diagoras,</hi> who would have determined there is no God: than to sacrifice their children to <hi>Saturn?</hi> Say, some <hi>Typhons</hi> or Giants (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profligated the Gods) should in their room, have Dominion over us, could they desire other kind of Rites or Sacrifices?

               <p>But yet as barbarous as these Immolations (of humane, of innocents Blood) were, they had clearer prints of the Original Promise, then bestial Victims, seperated (as in time they grew to be) from that blood of the Womans Seed, of which in the divine Institution) they were to be Types; the scent of which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43715:112"/>
Blood in bestial Sacrifices. The Gentiles having once over-run, and being at a loss, ran counter, till they took the scent of it again in the first Promise: and then, not being able to follow it down that train of bestial sacrifices that God had laid; (it being through length of time, grown cold, and they having no Huntsmen (no divinely inspired Interpreters) to set them on) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it had not gone that way.

               </lg>
               <p>And then becoming vain in their Imagination they pursue a fresh scent of it in the Blood of humane Victimes, of innocent Children: missing that one Seed (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles Christ) and falling upon the many, which (as their occasions served them) they ran down one after another, and made Oblations of, as propitiatory Sacrifices. In which mistake of the <hi>Individuum,</hi> they yet pitched upon 1. The Woman's Seed, 2. The most innocent of the Woman's common Seed, Children. 3. And that Seed, which was to the offerers most precious, their own Children; acknowledging hereby that nothing could redeem humane kind from the extremest suffering, but the most precious, spotless, Humane Blood, that could be thought of, or procured. Wherein as they perfectly agreed with the Christian <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> so I have the suffrage of the happiest Searcher into the Original of Idolatry, that ever undertook that task, to my position, the great <hi>Vossius: [Nec quicquam in mundo est excellentius homine: nihil parentibus carius est quam liberi. Sic igitur judicarunt, non me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liùs summum posse Deum demereri, quam si immolarent liberos suos, etiam in maximarum divitiarum ac potentiae spem natos. Haec vera est illius sacrificii ratio.] (Vossius de orig. idololat. lib. 2. cap. 5.) Nothing in the world is more excellent than man; nothing more dear to parents than Children: the Gentiles therefore, thus judged, that they could not by any better way procure the favour of the high God then if they sacrificed their children, especially such as were born to the hope of great fortunes and power. This is the true reason of this kind of sacrifice.</hi> And yet the Gentiles wrote the Christian Doctrine more plainly and fully in the blood of humane Sacrifices at the first Institution, than in their later Customs and degenerate use of sacrificing Captives, in stead of Natives, Natives grown instead of Children, Children instead of First-born, First-born of Subjects in stead of First born of Kings, First-born of royal Females (in use in the Trojan Wars) instead of the First-born Sons of Kings, either heirs to (as in the case of the King of <hi>Moab;)</hi> or possessors of their Father's Crown (as was the custom of the Aethiopians.) And First-born Sons of Kings in stead of their only begotten Sons, possessed of Royal Power after their Fathers death, which was the most ancient Custom; as appears from the Phaenician Story. To which Observation, if we add that which we have heard <hi>Macrobius (in Som Scip.)</hi> deliver, as the common Opinion <hi>[that all Kings are God-born,]</hi> we may without labour of brain collect, this to have been the Opinion of the World <hi>[That nothing can propitiate the Deity for the sin of man, but the blood of his only begotten Son, made man.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, as the great Debate, in point of Sacrifices, betwixt us and the Jew, was, Whether the Blood of Bulls and Goats, or of the promised Seed of the Woman, be propitiatory: so the Original Contest betwixt us and the Gentile was, whether that Blood of their Sons and Daughters (which they offer'd) was that propitiating Blood of the Woman's Seed; or the Blood of the Cross? Wherein they came nearer to us than the Jew, in the state of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43715:112"/>
Question, and put us to no farther labour, in confuting theirs and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Assertion, than to prove that Blood to be the most precious and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and therefore the most salvifick that ever was paid as a Ransom; compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending in it self alone, all that was requisite towards the redemption of the whole man. <hi>[Haec via totum hominem mundat &amp; immortalitati mortalem ex omnibus quibus constat partibus praeparat: ut enim non alia purgatio quaerere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ei parti, quam vocat intellectualem</hi> Porphyrius: <hi>alia ei, quam vocat spirita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; alia quae ipsi corpori: proptereà totum suscepit, veracissimus potentissimús<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Mundator &amp; Salvator:] (St.</hi> August. <hi>de Civitate, 10. 32.) The most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Gentile Sacrifices could not purge the Soul; but Christ our Sacrifice cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole man and prepares mortals for immortality, in all the parts of which they are made up: for to the end we should not seek one kind of purgation for that part of man that</hi> Porphyry <hi>calls intellectual; another for that he calls spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and another for the Body: therefore hath our most faithful and powerful Purifier and Saviour taken whole Man.</hi> In which Point, the Heathen World saw itself labour under that great disadvantage, as at the first starting of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, the Roman Empire would, by an Edict prohibiting humane Sacrifices, have wiped her mouth (with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Whore) and denied the Fact: had not the Patrons of the Christian Cause made palpable Demonstration of it, by pointing to those Humane Victims to the Latian <hi>Jove,</hi> that were openly sacrificed in <hi>Rome</hi> it self: and to other Deities through the whole body of the Empire; <hi>(Tertul, Apol.</hi> 8.) Upon which disappointment, those Philosophers which enter'd the lists against the Church, (or wrote in defence of Natural Theology, (not daring, for very shame, to deny the fact) turn it into all imaginable shapes, but of its natural Form, that it might not serve the Christian's turn. Hence <hi>Plutarch</hi> decries humane Sacrifices as barbarous (and well he might, for so they were.) <hi>Porphyry</hi> explodes the Vulgar Opinon that the blood and steam of sacrificed Animals was the food of the Gods; affirming that none but <hi>Cacodaemons</hi> can delight in such food: wherein the Christian does more cordially concurr with him, than <hi>Jamblicus</hi> (his Fellow-philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher:) for he, though he give him his say in gross, yet takes it away by retail: or rather consents to him in general words, but opposeth him in deed, and in particular Conclusions. <hi>(Jamblicus de mysteriis, tit.

The second Branch of the last general <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> common to us and Philosophers <hi>(viz.</hi> That God-saviour incarnate must work Man's restauration into Communion with God, by communicating divine Oracles to the World) lies more bare-fac'd in their Writings; and that it does so, is not disputed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (that I have met with:) and therefore I shall quickly dispatch that point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jamblicus</hi> affirms, that the Law of Religion was given by divine inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the first Father of the World, from whom were all Symbols in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, signifying some invisible thing, <hi>[Quae lex data est divinitùs à primo patre mundi, a quo &amp; omnia symbola in sacrificiis significantia aliquid occultissimum;] Jambl. (de myster. tit. de providentia, pag.</hi> 31.) that is, from the supream God by the middle Deities; for the same <hi>Jamblicus</hi> speaking of the Rites used in the Worship of the Gods, <hi>(de myst. tit. quae ratio sacrific. pag.</hi> 135.) lays this down (as the common Opinion of all their Theologues.) <hi>[That these Ceremonies are not the Inventions of Men, nor obtain'd Authority by Custom and Prescription, but were divine Revelations, communicated to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, by those Deities to whom God had committed the care of those Nations:]</hi> (these are those local God-Man-Saviours, concerning whom we have spoke already.) Of the same tendency is that fore-quoted Clause out of <hi>Celsus;</hi> where he saith, that these Presidents did appoint the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions (that obtain'd place in their respective Cures) congruously to the Tempers of the Climes and People committed to their trust; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Religions were all good; and that the very best <hi>(quoad hic</hi> and <hi>nunc)</hi> for every particular Nation, which their local Praesidents had instituted.

                  </gap>] Apuleius <hi>(de daemonio Socratis)</hi> calls them Interpreters on both sides, and bearers of Salutations. (St. <hi>Austin</hi> has a whole Chapter upon this Subject: <hi>[an daemonibus nunciis &amp; interpretibus dii utantur;] de Civitate, lib. 8. cap.</hi> 21.) And that of <hi>Jambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus (de mysteriis titulo de ordine superiorum: quaesunt in diis &amp;c.) [quae sunt in diis ineffabilia, &amp; occulta, daemones exprimunt, atque patefaciunt.] Those things that are ineffable in the Gods, the Demons declare and reveal to us.</hi> Hence we find this clause (he gave Laws) inserted in the Histories of all the Heroes <hi>(vide Lact. de fal. rel. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 10. 11.) But to spare the labour of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Instances, that place of <hi>Plato,</hi> I mention'd at the beginning of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is abundantly sufficient (where those blessed spirits that descended to take care of Mankind, are said to have given them Laws:) neither that of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> against <hi>Celsus (lib. 5. cap.</hi> 1.) whom he charges (in his affirming, that never any God or Son of God came down from Heaven, to reveal divine Counsels) to oppose the Vulgar and received Opinion of Philosophers: and proves that charge by many clear instances; one of which we have <hi>(Act.</hi> 14. 12.) when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had by a word speaking, presently and perfectly cured the man, that was born lame: the <hi>Lystrians</hi> conceived him to be <hi>Mercury</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in humane form) because he was the chief speaker: clearly expressing this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43715:113"/>
to be their Opinion, that the healing God was to be the great Gods Messenger, and to restore men's discomposed Minds, (as well as Limbs) by his word: the very Office which the Prophets assigned to the <hi>Messias,</hi> and the Apostles and Evangelists applyed to Christ; <hi>A prophet shal the Lord raise unto you of your brethren, like unto me</hi> (as touching his humane) but infinitely superiour to me (in respect of his divine Nature.) And that's the scope of that so much abused Text <hi>[all thy children shall be taught of God;] (Isa.</hi> 54. 13.) if Christ be better at expounding Scripture, than our new illuminates. Who, when the Jews excepted against his affirming himself to come down from Heaven, (because they knew his Father and Mother, supposing him to be the Son of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph)</hi> as they said) <hi>(Joh. 6. ver.</hi> 42.) gives them this reply. That no man could come to him (that is as one that came down from Heaven, and whom they were bound to hear under pain of extermination) except the Father drew him <hi>(ver.</hi> 44.) not as a log by main force of hand; but as a man, by strength of Argument: by teaching him the meaning of that Text in the Prophet, <hi>[and they shall all be taught of God] (ver.</hi> 45.) which cannot be understood of the person of the Father, <hi>for no man hath seen the father but the son, (ver.</hi> 46.) Nor of the Spirits teaching; for that the Church had from the beginning (thou gavest them thy good spirit) <hi>(Nehem.</hi> 9. 10.) But of the Person of the Son, who was in the Fullness of Time, to assume Flesh, and dwell among us, and teach not only Jews but Gentiles, what they must do to be saved: So as, in the last revelation of the divine Will, God will no longer deal by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy: but himself in the Person of the Son, will speak face to face, which you might have learn'd, in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> had you diligently weighed that Text: <hi>(of Isa.)</hi> and though I, in respect of my humane Nature, am the son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and as you suppose, of <hi>Joseph,</hi> whom you know: yet, at my Baptism, you might have learn'd that I had another Generation: for then my Father bare witness by a voice from Heaven, that I was the son of God: and at my transfiguration (having avouched me to be his well beloved Son) he gave command that I should be receiv'd, as that Prophet whom all are to hear: every man therefore that hath heard and learn'd this of my Father concerning me; that I am that great Prophet that was to come into the World (like to my Brethren, as to my Manhood: but equal to the Father, touching my Godhead) will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to me, and learn of me: as to those, whom my Father (by these clear convictions, and furthermore, by that Seal he hath set to my Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to teach, in those Miracles I work) does not draw into a full perswasion; 'tis impossible that they, while they are under that obstinacy, should come unto me. Hence it is that our Saviour so much presseth, and layeth so much stress upon the believing, that he was he, that should come to tell men all things; hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> begins his Epistle to the Hebrews with the proof of this, that Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was that divine Person, the express Image of the Fathers person; by whom (according to the Prophecies that went before) God hath spoak in the last, that is, the Evangelical Age.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Humane Laws (we say) are Nets, which small fish escape through and great ones break; but Christ's Law is so framed, his Gospel net so knit, as the Vulgar fry stick in it by the Finns and Gills of common Sentiments: And the greatest disputers are intangled in it by strugling. It takes the poor of this World by the compliance with their innate Notions; and the wise, in their own craftiness. By it</p>

so (I fear) there is a more discerning spirit of Prophecy expressed therein, than in all our modern golden Dreams, and Comments upon <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation:</hi> these Predictions being but guessings at (if not perversions of) the sence of dark Texts: his the applications of as clear menaces, as any are in the whole Bible: and these (too) commented upon, by the constant method of Providence in the World; which usually so shapes its rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, to mens demerits: as for our knowing what will betide our selves, we need not consult ambiguous Oracles, but such plain sanctions of the royal Law, as have been made good upon, and befallen other Churches, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to us: for if we will not be diverted from following <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi>'s steps: we must arrive at their dismal end, if we, by our debaucheries of mind or life, put the Gospel from us, and draw upon our selves strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions; a <hi>Revelation-Criticism</hi> will not secure the one to us, nor us from the other. But to return from this Digression. The constitution of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion is such, as it finds all that is of man, left in man, a party for it, in the Market; and all true Philosophy, a party for it, in the Schools of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers (saith <hi>Clem. Alexandr. Strom. l. 1. pag.</hi> 94.) whether of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or <hi>Grecians</hi> (I mean) not the <hi>Stoick, Platonick, Epicurean, Aristotelian:</hi> but, whatsoever any Sect rightly taught; whatsoever they taught Pious or Just, is but a Branch of eternal Truth, pluck'd from the Tree of Life (the ever-being Word.) An observation grounded upon these Prophecies: <hi>I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches of it,—and build it as in the days of old,—build the old wasts, raise up the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, the foundations of many generations (Amos 9. 11. Isa. 61. 4. Isa.</hi> 58. 12.) and this to the end, that the residue of men (that is the Gentiles) might seek the Lord <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 16.) as St. <hi>James</hi> expounds the Prophets: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth us to interpret those Prophecies, not of Persons only, but Doctrines. For the Gentile was grafted in, not only upon the cutting off of the Jews, but upon the raising up of those Foundation-truths; which not only among the Jews, but the many Generations of the Heathens, had been buried under the rubbish of humane Vanities built upon them. This interpretation induc'd the Apostolical Synod, to reestablish the Precepts of <hi>Noah,</hi> as an Expedient to gain upon the Gentiles. The <hi>Platonicks</hi> conceived all knowledg to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but <hi>[reminiscentia]</hi> an awakening of the mind to see innate Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The Notions of the Gospel were not innate, yet so imprest (by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) upon all mens minds; as the embracing of it, is call'd a man's coming to himself. <hi>(Psal. 22. 27.) All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and turn to the Lord.</hi> And therefore true Philosophy is so far from being a Prejudice against, as it is an Introduction to, a Preparation for the Gospel. <hi>When the Philosophers</hi> (saith <hi>Isidore Pelusiota) saw, in that grain of Mustard-seed, all that Truth Vertually laying, which they had been seeking for; how many of them, bidding adiew to their own Opinions, betook themselves to the shady Branches of the Tree of life, and there found rest: how many</hi> Pythagoreans, <hi>(formerly the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of pride and disdain) became the Scholars of our meek</hi> Jesus? <hi>How many</hi> Platonicks <hi>(letting fall their Crests, proudly lifted up through an opinion that they excell'd all men in the Art of Discourse) sat down at Christ's feet under the shade of the Mustard-tree? How many</hi> Aristotelians, <hi>how many</hi> Stoicks <hi>(scorning that Wisdom whereof they had made greatest boast) thought themselves happy if they could be enter'd among those Disciples of Christ, who observe his word?] (I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidor. Pelusiota. lib. 4. ep.</hi> 76.) Our Religion is nothing else, but the last and best Edition of that, which was either writ on mens Hearts, or promulg'd in Paradise, to the old; and by <hi>Noah,</hi> to the new World (who is therefore stil'd <hi>the Treacher of Righteousness)</hi> which being <hi>Pentheus</hi> like) pull'd Limb from Limb by the several Sects (each party getting some relicks and scraps of it) the Apostles gather'd up its scatter'd Limbs, and fram'd them into a perfect and compleat Body of Divinity again; (clothing its Bones with the Flesh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

was no Nation so <hi>barbarous,</hi> but if they came near and felt it, they might find something in it, of which they might say: This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone: whatever I retain (either of right Reason, or solid Religion) is comprehended in this. This is that express Image of the Father, of which I had the rough-draught: All the Wisdom I have retain'd, or learn'd, I meet with in this foolishness of Preaching. of this the Apostle was so confident; as to the Jew, he became a Jew; to the Gentile, a gentile: (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 22.) not by a sycophantick and temporizing compliance with the least of their Errours, but by taking advantage of the truths they held, as <hi>Mediums</hi> by which he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued them into an assent to the Gospel: dealing with every man at his own suresby-weapon, and upon his own sound Principles. He did not flatter them as <hi>Clisophus</hi> did King <hi>Philip;</hi> who when the King's Eye was wounded, bound up his; and when the King had received a hurt on the shin that made him halt halted with him, as if he had been lame: and never saw the King make sower faces, but he look'd as if he were eating the same sharp sawce. Nor conform to them as the <hi>Arabians</hi> did to their King; who if he were lame of any Limb, they mutilate that Limb of their Bodies: Or the <hi>Dionisiocolaces</hi> to that Tyrant; who (because he was purblind) groped about for the Dishes that were set before them, till he had got his hand into his <hi>(Athen. dipnosoph.</hi> 6. 6.) But St. <hi>Paul</hi> conform'd to Jew and Gentile in their seeing Eye and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Limbs. Pleading with the Jew, from old Testament-texts: With the <hi>Gentile,</hi> from the Law of Nature, and the common Traditional Religion: that in the Jews mouth and heart, before the giving of the Law by <hi>Moses;</hi> that Word whose sound went into all the World by oral preaching, the seed of the Christian faith <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10.) With the Philosopher, from his most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Verities: Such as the several Sects, with whom the Apostle had to do, could not deny (without contradicting those Notions, they were most assured of the truth of:) and yet were not able to defend (against the assaults which their other erronious Opinions made upon them) upon any other but Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds, the only <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and City of Refuge for all divine Truth: in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from which, like a Beam, cut off from the Sun: a Stream, from the Fountain: a Branch, from the Tree: a Limb, from the Body; it cannot subsist. This Tent-maker so contriv'd his Tabernacle, wherein he plac'd the Sun of Righteousness, his Gospel, wherein he exhibited Christ; (give me lieve to lisp and stutter now, with those I am opposing (who speak of the Gospel as the device of men:) for I shall hereafter demonstrate it, to be the Contrivement of God:) as it excludes all bad Airs; takes in all the Light, (that was before scatter'd among several Sects) So as Christ keeps open house in it, for all comers; the way-faring man, though a fool, may turn in hither, and find lodging (where his Soul may be at rest) a Table furnish'd with plain Cates, suting his Countrey-palate. The wise man may here be entertain'd, in as much state as heart can wish. In the <hi>Muse</hi>'s Chamber, in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room; his vast Soul cannot have that room to expatiate her self in: as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Curtains, in <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Tent: nor find that satisfaction in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy,</hi> in <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Porch, in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Walk; as in our King's Galleries, in the Prophets Schools, in Christ's upper Chamber: nor meet with that abstruce Learning in the <hi>Egyptian Hierogliphicks,</hi> as in the embroidered hangings of Christ's Presence-chamber. Now how men of crazy Intellects, could frame so excellent a Model of Wisdom, so perfect a Mirrour of all Metaphisical Science (truly so called:) we may sooner strain our Brains out of joynt, by stretching our mind to imagine, then imagine, with the least shew of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.

THe Gospel is so fram'd as it exhibits to us the Substance of the Law's Types; wherein the things pertaining to the Person, Office, and Kingdom, of the <hi>Messias,</hi> were umbrated; without reference to which, most of them are such childish and beggerly Toys, as the instituting of them is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly unworthy of infinite Wisdom, and that solemn pomp (of signs and wonders) that went before them, as inducements to the Israelites to receive them with due reverence, would be in the most candid Interpretation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reason) no better than the Mountains swelling, and going in hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring forth a ridiculous Mouse. From which imputation of folly (observed, and objected by the Heathens, against their Lawgiver) the most learned <hi>Mythologist Philo Judaeus,</hi> though he attempt to vindicate <hi>Moses,</hi> yet missing <hi>Moses</hi> his Scope, (and not looking to the end of his Law) he falls far short of his purpose; and makes worse work of it, than a Novice-Christian would, that has but learn'd this Principle <hi>[the Law was a shaddow of good things to come, but the body (that casts those shadows) is Christ;]</hi> A Tast where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he gives us (in his Treatise of Circumcision) wherein (having premis'd how unlikely it is, that so severe a Ceremony should be taken up upon weak Grounds) he lays down these wise reasons for it. 1. <hi>[The prevention of the growing of the Carbuncle in that part:]</hi> (Just as if a man should advise to have the Head chop'd off, to prevent the aching of it. 2. <hi>[That that Membrane might not be a receptacle of uncleanness:]</hi> upon the same reason they must not only, with the Egyptian Priests, shave off their hair (which he grounds upon the same reason) but slit their Noses, and crop their Ears, and dismember themselves of other Vessels receptory of Excrements. 3. For the procuring of Foecundity, of which he saith it is a necessary Cause <hi>[aiunt enim ità semen rectà ejaculari integrum, nec diffluit per sinus preputii:]</hi> As if Nature could not frame her own Tools, in a form fittest for the use, she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them.

It hath indeed abolished the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law; but without clashing with the Sanction of that Law) and upon clear and indubitable Old Testament-principles, where we hear God saying; <hi>[he would make a new Covenant]</hi> with them, not according to the Covenant he made with their Fathers, when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they brake: and promising to erect <hi>[a new Priest-hood</hi> not after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> From both which common places, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle argues strenuously; <hi>(Heb. 8. and 7.) [when he saith the new, he maketh void the old;] [where the Priesthood is changed, there must of necessity be a change of the Law.]</hi> The Old Testament points out him that is to be a Priest for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after the order of <hi>Melchisedech)</hi> as to come <hi>of the Tribe;</hi> not of <hi>Levi,</hi> but <hi>Judah:</hi> which Topick the Apostle pursues and applies to the blessed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who according to the Prophecies that went before of him, sprang of the Root of <hi>Jesse,</hi> came from the loins of <hi>David,</hi> and was the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> of which Tribe, none by the Law, were to be made Priests, but of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> and that therefore the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was prescribed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, in the Prediction of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in the preheminence of this <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dokian</hi>

Preist before the <hi>Aaronical,</hi> hinted by <hi>Melchisedech's Blessing</hi> and <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithes</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> while <hi>Levi</hi> was yet in his Loyns; almost four hundred years before that Law, which assigned <hi>Levi</hi> to the Priest-hood. And lest, this Law which assigned <hi>Levi</hi> to that Office, might be interpreted as vacat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Melchisedech</hi>'s: the Apostle observes that long after <hi>Aaron</hi> had been made a Priest, and that without an Oath, that <hi>Kingly High Priest,</hi> after the order of <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> was made a Priest by Oath: <hi>(Hebr.</hi> 7. 17. 18.)</p>
               <p>In the Old Testament, <hi>(Malac.</hi> 1. 11.) God expresseth his dislike of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi> Sacrifices and Ordinances, in comparison of another Sacrifice and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was to be exhibited. A point acknowledged by the Jewish Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies; who upon these Texts have these reflections, <hi>Psal. 69. [Laudabo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men dei—&amp; placebit deo super vitulum novellum, cornua producentem &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulas.]</hi> This is the <hi>new worship,</hi> that shall be given to God, <hi>in diebus Christi</hi> (saith <hi>Aben Ezra.)</hi> A worship, will please God better, than the <hi>Oxe</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> sacrificed; <hi>[Qui perfectus erat de terra creatus:]</hi> a perfect Oxe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to one, three years old) the day he was created: having hoofs and horns (saith <hi>R. Solom.)</hi> Than that three years old <hi>Oxe</hi> of the <hi>Peace-offering;</hi> or so large as he can push with his horns, or so great and comely as he makes men contend about him (saith <hi>R. David:)</hi> all center here, that the most choice Legal Sacrifices are not comparable to that spiritual Worship which should be introduc'd in the days of the <hi>Messias.</hi> Without relation to which, legal observances were not good, nor such, as by which they should live <hi>(Ezeck.</hi> 20. 25.) God protesting he never spake to their Fathers, touching Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Oblations, abstracted from that end of the Law <hi>(Jerem.</hi> 7. 22.) and chiding them for treading his Courts, for making many and fervent Prayers, for offering Incense, for bringing their Oblations and burnt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; without having an eye to the spiritual part of worship, and to Christ (the Life and Spirit of all acceptable Worship;) <hi>(Isa.</hi> 1.) Of which imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and faultiness of the first Covenant the Apostle takes notice; as that which made way for the second <hi>(Heb.</hi> 8. 7.)</p>
               <p>In the Old Testament God promiseth that, under the Kingdom of <hi>Messias,</hi> he would take <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> out of <hi>all Nations (Isa.</hi> 66. 21.) that stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers should be <hi>Israel</hi>'s Pastors, Plough-men, and Labourers in the Vine-yard <hi>(Isa.</hi> 61. 5.) What must then become of the Law, prohibiting any, but the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> to approach the Priest's Office, to minister in the Sanctuary? <hi>Levi</hi> must lose his Plough, when <hi>Messias</hi> makes <hi>Gentiles</hi> put their hands to his, and therefore there is much more of ingenuity, and correspondency to their own Prophets than in modern Jews, in that story of the <hi>Jerusalem Gomarists,</hi> told by <hi>R. Judab:</hi> of a certain <hi>Jew,</hi> who being at Plough, and hearing an <hi>Arabian</hi> telling him, that <hi>Messiah</hi> was born; presently loosed his Oxen, and sold his Plough and Gears <hi>(Lightfoot Harm. pag.</hi> 9.)</p>
               <p>Lastly, (for to instance in all the Topicks of this tendency would put me upon transcribing the greatest part of the Prophets, and the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:)</hi> in the Old Testament we are told, That <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the place elected by God for <hi>Legal</hi> Worship, should become a perpetual desolation, within a few years after the coming of Christ; That Rook's Nest (as they had made it) should be pulled down <hi>(Dan.</hi> 9. 26.) and then sure the whole brood of those callow and imperfect Rudiments (annex'd to it) laid in it, must fall to the ground. That a time would come, when the true <hi>Jove</hi> would shake that his lap, wherein his grand Seer, the Eagle-eyed <hi>Moses,</hi> had laid the Eggs of his Ceremonial Laws. <hi>Haggai. 2. 6. [I will shake not the earth only, but the heavens:]</hi> that is, as St. <hi>Paul (Heb.</hi> 12. 27.) expounds that Text; not only the Vanity of the Gentiles, but the Jewish Religion, though of Divine Institution, so far as it is to be shak'd. Or which comes all to one, <hi>[The heaven,]</hi> that is, the heavenly Sanctuary, the Temple, God's Court, the place of his Residence, where he dwelt between the <hi>Cherubims.</hi> That <hi>Sion</hi> would be ploughed up <hi>(Micah 3. 12.) [Sion shall be ploughed as a field and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the Lord's house as the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43715:116"/>
high places of the Forrest.</hi> This the Chaldees alledg in behalf of <hi>Jeremy (Jer.</hi> 26. 10.) and the Rabbies observe the accomplishment of it, then, when <hi>Turnus Rufus</hi> ploughed up the place of the <hi>Temple</hi> (Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, Vespacian 2. paragr.</hi> 1.) and what must become then of the whole Crop of the Temple-Ceremonies which had been there sowen, and of the Eggs there deposited? That <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the dish wherein <hi>Levitical</hi> services were to be served up, should be turned up-side-down, and wiped as a man wipes a Dish, (2. <hi>King.</hi> 21. 13.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>It shall be turned upside down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face thereof.</hi> What can that portend but the spilling of the Cates? So that, to a considerate Spectatour, it cannot but be matter of highest admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to see that blinded Nation groping for the door, when the house is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len flat to the ground; and like a company of dispersed Ants, whose hill is digged up, carrying their Eggs in their mouths above this sixteen hundred years; not knowing where to lay them, but expecting still their old Ant-hill should grow up again, out of the dust, wherein it has lain all that while; not considering that, by this time, their Eggs must needs be grown addle. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what a spirit of slumber hath divine Vengeance powred upon them! see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they still persist in denying that <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Just</hi> One, after <hi>Moses</hi> hath so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and palpably denyed them; after God hath pull'd them from him and hedged up their way to his Law, by an absolute impossibility of observing it! The Temple wherein the greatest and most eminent part of that Law was only performable, being by his irresistible hand demolish'd, and kept from being again erected (in spight of all the attempts of the most daring enemies of our Jesus) and the Nation, to which they are peculiarly calculated, being dispersed, and ceasing to be a Nation. Nay after themselves have (in effect) renounc'd the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and betaken themselves to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> which yet is unpracticable among them in the point of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: so that they worship God in a way, which neither their Fathers, nor their Fathers-fathers knew: A way taken up by themselves, since the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of their Temple, and dispersion of their Nation: wherein they add and take from their own Law, contrary to the Divine Sanction.</p>
               <p>In vain do they urge those Texts that seem (in the Letter) to import the perpetuity and irrevocableness of <hi>Moses</hi> Law: such as <hi>(Deut. 29. 29.) Things revealed belong to us and our children for ever. (Lev. 23. 14.) First fruits a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for ever; and, the passover a statute for ever, (Ex.</hi> 12. 17.) For, if they will allow <hi>David</hi> to speak in <hi>Moses</hi> his Language, when he applies ever to the Temple <hi>(Psal. 132. 13.) [This is my rest for ever;]</hi> and allow their own eyes to interpret <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>[ever]</hi> (now they see the place of his residence for ever demolished:) the Chain, wherein they think themselves still bound to <hi>Moses,</hi> will fall off of its own accord: can the <hi>[ever]</hi> of Oblations, possibly, be stretched beyond the <hi>[ever]</hi> of that Sanctuary to which they are limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>As vain is the exception against the cogency of this Argument, from the Instance of the first Temples laying waste, during the Babylonish Captivity: during which time, though the Law, as to the practise of it, was, in some points suspended, yet it was not abolished. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law had a shrewd shake, and was loosen'd in its sinews, by the ruine of the first Temple: Gods withdrawing then the <hi>Ark</hi> of his Presence and Covenant from them, was a sign he would quickly grow weary of sitting on Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> now, that his foot-stool was removed: his not vouchsafing to give them <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> for their Sacrifices in the second, as he had done in the Tabernacle and first Temple, and yet accepting their Offerings made by strange fire (so directly contrary to the Law) was an Argument, that he stood not so much upon <hi>Levitical</hi> punctilios, as he did at first, when he punish'd <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> with suddain death, for offering with strange fire. If the Jews will avouch their own story upon <hi>(Dan. 6. 4.) [Ut invenirent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionem</hi> Danieli <hi>ex latere regis;]</hi> (where interpreting <hi>[latus regis]</hi> to be the Queen, or the King's Concubines, they tell us, that <hi>Daniel</hi> was an Eunuch;)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43715:117"/>
they must be forc'd to a confession, that God stood not much upon the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, when he preferr'd an Eunuch (who by that Law was not to come into the Congregation) into that intimate Communion with himself, as to reveal to him more of his Counsel than he did to any Prophet beside <hi>Moses: (Jerom. in locum:)</hi> I urge these Instances as Arguments <hi>ad hominem</hi> (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jews concessions, though in themselves not true, as I shew else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.) It is from their own Premisses, I infer this Conclusion. That God weaned them by degrees from <hi>Moses,</hi> antiquating one Ceremony after another; till at last Christ cancell'd the whole Hand-writing of Ordinances: breach upon breach was made in that wall of partition, till Christ took it wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and rac'd it to the ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God promised to return that Captivity, to restore to them their own Land, and to repair the ruines of the first Temple; but this Captivity will never be return'd, the second Temple will never be repair'd: but both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Place are to be perpetual Desolations. Of this I make proof else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and therefore here shall propound this only Argument to evince the truth of it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That during the desolations of the first, the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was not with-held from them, God raised them up Prophets in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> he then set them up Way-marks, guides to their Cities again; he whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Flock, scatter'd in that gloomy and dark day of their wandring, to prevent their total dispersion, and to keep them within the hearing of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Proclamation: But since the desolating of the second Temple, they have had no Voice, no Vision, none to answer how long; no Prophets have risen up among them, but false ones, as themselves acknowledg: such as <hi>Ben Coz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> of whom their <hi>Taba</hi> (in <hi>Taanith per 4. halac.</hi> 6.) and <hi>Maymon (in Taanith per.</hi> 5.) quoted by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot (Vespacian 1. Sect.</hi> 1.) thus write. <hi>[It was on the 9. day of the Month</hi> Ab, <hi>that the great City</hi> Bitter <hi>was taken, where were thousands and ten thousands of</hi> Israel <hi>who had a great King over them; whom all</hi> Israel, <hi>even their greatest wise men, thought to have been</hi> Messias.] And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s fall (according to our Saviour's Prediction) the many false Christs, of whom <hi>Josephus</hi> in the History of that Age, gives many instances.</p>
               <p>§ 3. As the Ceremonial Law fell with its own weight, was disannull'd by its own Vote, and cancel'd by vertue of its own Ordinances: So that Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament-law, which cannot be shaken, 1. Is confirm'd and establish'd, in the Gospel, upon better Principles, and more powerful Motives: 2. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by our Royal Lawgiver, in many branches of it, that budded not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Testament: 3. And in the whole of it, to the utmost heroick degree of Christned Morality, 1. That an humane Soul cloathed with Mortality is capable of, 2. Or can be drawn to by the most powerful Attractives of the Spirit of Grace, 3. Most plentifully poured forth upon all that sincerely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Gospel. Of all which points I shall speak distinctly; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they demonstrate that Christ came, not to destroy, but to perfect and fill up the Law, but do also present Christ and the Gospel to us, in a quite other form, than the faithless Solifidian draws them in; whose Models of Christianity look. as if they were designed to shame Religion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Salvifick</hi> Grace teaches us, in the Gospel, <hi>to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, to live godly, righteously, and soberly;</hi> with more masculine and strenuous Motives, than were propounded under the Law. The Argument then was <hi>[I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;</hi> but that which was but implyed in that, is in the Gospel clearly expressed, and obedience prest from our deliverance from the bondage of Satan, the vassalage of our own Lusts, the chambers of eternal Death. The motive expressed there was: <hi>That thy days may be long in the land, a land slowing with milk and honey:]</hi> here the darkness of Type (that was upon the face of that earth) is dissipated; the waters (that overwhelm'd it) are divided from it, and the dry Land made to appear, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43715:117"/>
Land that is very far off, far above all visible Heavens. The Childrens Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Nats being laid aside, the Gospel openly hangs out Prizes, becoming men of full age to run for, in that Race of Holiness that's set before us. This they that would, might have received as their encouragement then; they that took the pains to crack the Nut, found this Kernel of heavenly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Shell of those earthly, inducements. In Christ's Manger there's clean Provender, fann'd and winnowed to our hand: in the Crib of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Corn was in the Chaff; yet so, as they that had their senses exercised to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, did seperate the Corn from the Chaff. Now the framing of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motives so, as they clash not with, but are superordinated to, yea extracted out of those of the Law (as their spirits) speaks the Compilers to have been men of well composed Minds. To take at that hint which <hi>Moses</hi> gave, of God's intending some better thing than <hi>Canaan,</hi> in his informing us; that the whole earth (whereof <hi>Canaan</hi> was a part) was accursed for Man's sake: and <hi>Canaan</hi> not only actually under the effects of that Curse; (for it bore Briers and Thistles;) but the most cursed part of the whole Earthly Globe then, when the promise of it was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> (as being contaminated with the abominations of its Inhabitants, more than any other Countrey. Or at those hints which the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> gave, of their looking beyond an earthly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> in that promise; in their confessing themselves to be pilgrims and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, even when they were setled in <hi>Canaan: [I am a sojourner as all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were,] (Psal.</hi> 39.) In their not taking those many opportunities which were offer'd them of returning thither, after the end of the Famine, during the whole time of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Presidency, or of those Kings who knew <hi>Joseph:</hi> but chusing rather to stay in <hi>Goshen,</hi> than to go back into <hi>Canaan:</hi> where, for all its fertillity, they had been famish'd, if <hi>Egypt</hi> had not releiv'd them: (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough singly to have convinc'd them, that some better thing was involv'd in the Promise.) To take (I say) at such hints, and thence to conclude so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably as they do, that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> saw, by faith, a <hi>Land beyond that,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an heavenly. Their presenting the Church in such a posture, as Christ's left hand is under her head, while his right hand doth embrace her: (as St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> from the Fathers, expounds that place <hi>(Can.</hi> 2. 6.) in his comment upon <hi>Zachary) (cap.</hi> 4.) So as the two Olive-trees; (Law on left, Gospel on right hand) pour Oyl into the golden Candlestick, the Church, argues the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's discoursive faculty to have been very sound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which may be further evidenc'd, by their giving such an account of Christ's improvement of <hi>Moses</hi> his Morals, in some Branches (that were virtually in the Bole or Root, though they did not actually put forth, till they fell under the vegitating influence of the Sun of Righteousness) as neither speaks <hi>Moses</hi> unfaithful in his omitting of them, nor Christ austere, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring some things that under <hi>Moses</hi> were dispensed with. <hi>[Christus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta supplendo &amp; conservavit &amp; auxit:] (Tertul.

Upon this reason, our Saviour to that lower degree added an higher; that he who had already been taught, that he must not take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, beyond the demerit of the injury: might have joy in himself, if he could with a pacate mind forgive the whole: which even in the Old Testament the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet commends saying:</hi> [Oh Lord if I have done this thing, if I have reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evil to them that are mine enemies:] <hi>And another Prophet speak thus, of one who suffer'd such like injuries, and bare them patiently:</hi> [He gave his cheek to him that smote him:] <hi>From whence we learn that</hi> Moses <hi>did well in setting

These Precepts of Christ do rather appertain to the heart than the outward man: that the Soul may possess it self with patience within, and the Christian do that openly, which he thinks will be most profitable to those, to whom we are bound to do good. Thus I have heard some say, that our Laws, touching Usury, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it unlawful by the Law of God, and damnable in his Court; yet seeing that most men had so little of the fear of God before their eyes, as (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing God's excluding Usurers out of his holy-hill) they would be dabling with the accursed thing) that they might set bounds to men's avarice, make it extortion, to take more consideration than the Law allows: that by this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, the covetous (whom God abhors) that are resolved to run the hazard of their own damnation, may bring it upon themselves, with as little detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others as may be: and that the Christian indeed, that dares take God's bond and suretiship, for the poor borrower, may lend <hi>gratis</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other consideration, than that hundred-fold Reward which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.

This forced St. <hi>James</hi> to demonstrate the falsity of that <hi>Thesis,</hi> in the <hi>Gnostick</hi>'s sence of Faith; and to infer that <hi>a man is justified, not by Faith only</hi> (as Faith signifies our Act) from those very Instances (of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rabab:)</hi> whence St. <hi>Paul</hi> concluded Justification by <hi>[Faith only</hi> (as it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Object of Christian Belief) <hi>without Works;]</hi> that is, by a faithful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to and practice of Christian Religion, without the help or observance of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law: That having been the ancient and catholick way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherein eternal Life was attainable, before Judaism was in being; and whereby they that were true to it, in all Nations (to whom the sound of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>

Thence this Religion was called <hi>[Faith,]</hi> and the Professors of it <hi>[Believers;]</hi> names whereby, in common use, they were sufficiently discriminated from all others; and therefore used by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his History of the propagation of Christian Religion; and by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his disputations about Justification (without the addition of any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithete) to signifie, The whole and entire Oeconomy of that Religion, or way of knitting God and man together) which Christ propounded; and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herers to, And expectants of Salvation in, that Way. Of the same impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and equipollency, are the Notions, of <hi>[anointing]</hi> and <hi>[Christian;]</hi> the first importing that <hi>Religion</hi> which Christ was anointed to preach, and the later, <hi>persons</hi> imbued with that <hi>Religion:</hi> as also <hi>[master,]</hi> (or <hi>[teacher]</hi> sent from God) and <hi>[disciple]</hi> but not so free from ambiguity as these of <hi>[faith]</hi> and <hi>[believers.]</hi>

Christ and his Apostles denyed not, but plainly affirmed, That Salvation had been of the Jews; (that is) that Salvation was attainable in the Jewish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by all those that in observance of it, look'd to the end of it, Christ. But the Question then was, <hi>[Whether the great Prophet (that is in the bosom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) being come, and his Law being gone out of Sion, and the word of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from Jerusalem; that old Religion had not lost its salvifick Power?]</hi> which, that it had, the Apostle maintains and proves by many Arguments; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which this is not the least; That God expected more now from the sons of men, to testifie the sincerity of their Love to him, and to make them capable of his acceptance of them, as sincere, than he did, during those dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Revelations of his Grace, and more sparing allowances of divine Aid. In the demanding whereof the old Religion coming short, was thereby disina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and become uncapeable to save; it being possible that a man might, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the coming of Christ, perform what it required, on condition of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet not make those returns to God (for the rich Revelation of his Grace by Christ) as he would accept of, for good payment; or as might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate him, an honest man, a man keeping a good Conscience towards God, and not dealing fraudulently with him: As he must do, if he pay no more Rent of Thankfulness and Obedience, now that his Farm is improv'd (and manur'd with the Lamb's Blood) then was by Contract payable, before that Improvement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that therefore Justification by Faith implies God's demand of a greater rent, now under the Gospel, than would have passed for good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the first Lease, or Law of Works. Not as if, either then or now, that Righteousness of Heart or Life (that was, or is required) could, or was intended to be paid, as the least part of our Ransom: as a Fine, for our Forfeiture of the original Contract betwixt God and us, in a state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency: No, it cost more to redeem a Soul, by way of price, than all the Righteousness of Angels and Men (summ'd up together) can amount to: that must be let alone for ever; and wholly exterminated from the limits of our discourse touching Justification, when the Question is, <hi>[Whether we are justified by faith or works?]</hi> But Christ having stood to, and fulfill'd the Terms of that Covenant, whose Condition was Perseverance in Innocency: and paid the Forfeiture that we had made; in both which he supererrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; exhibiting that active and passive Obedience, which infinitely exceeds in worth what was required of us: (For that Law demanded man's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Death; but he tender'd both, and in both, not only man's, but God's; the Person subjecting himself to Obedience being God-man;) upon which consideration our <hi>Kinsman,</hi> not only redeem'd the Inheritance that we had lost, but purchas'd a better for us: It were therefore against all Reason and Equity, that he should be denyed a power to dispose of his own Purchace, to whom, and upon what Terms, he pleaseth: which his good pleasure he hath (from time to time, by some means or other) revealed, and at the last in his own person communicated; wherein it hath pleased his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to proceed in this Method, that in all other former dispositions of the good things he had undertaken to purchase for us, he accepted of less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment from us, than in this his last will and Testament, made after his actual Purchace: bequeathing Himself and Benefits upon different Terms and Conditions (suitable to the Revelations of his Grace, the Emanations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, and the Obligations he hath laid upon us.) Hence is that observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> (on <hi>Gen. 6. 9.)

But the account of the difference betwixt <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ, as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> casts it up, is as monstrously unjust, as <hi>John Scotus</hi> his partition, of the two great Fishes, to himself (who was a little man) and the one little one to the two tall Persons that sat next him, at the <hi>French King</hi>'s Table: giving this Reason to the <hi>King,</hi> accusing him of making an unequal division, contrary to his order; that he had exactly perform'd his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Injunction: for here (meaning himself, and the two great Fishes, upon his own Trencher) is one little one, and two great ones; there (pointing to the two proper and corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Person's, and the little Fish he had laid before them) are two great ones, and one little one.

And I must sit down, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in silence at this strange sight: that God should be presented (with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of any that are not unman'd) as conniving at those Immoralities, Immanities, Debaucheries in the New: (wherein he has afforded more Light to discover the exceeding sinfulness of them, more Assistance against them, stronger Motives to avoid them, and threatned a much more grievous Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against them that do them) which he would not connive at, under the Old Testament: As if God had sent his Son into the World to set Hell loose, and enlarge the Devil's Kingdom: to proclaim impunity to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Licentiousness; to give men Passes to go to their own place (to that that <hi>Judas</hi> went to) without stop, molestation, or trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Whereas the difference lies point blank on the other hand (as has been proved) the Law of Faith demanding so much more Work, than the Law of Works did: as our Vails are more, our Reward greater, our our Helps of all sorts more plentiful, and our Obligations more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining, then theirs were to whom that Law was given. So as in this diversity of Terms or Conditions, the same general Rule is laid down in both (as their <hi>Basis</hi> and Summ) <hi>[Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, with all thy soul and with all thy strength:]</hi> which last Clause being a qualification of the Precedent, renders this Proposal, a fit <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> for any Covenant that God ever made, or can make with Mankind; for Justice can require no more, nor mercy less, in general, than that we love God, and express our love to him, according to our strength; than which Angels cannot do more, nor the weakest Christian less: whose lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God with all his strength, argues as much sincerity as Angels show, in their loving him according to theirs: the Gnat moves with as good a will, though not with so great a force as the Eagle; and therefore its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry as commendable as his. And the Ant is as laborious in carrying a grain in her mouth, as the Elephant is in carrying a Castle upon his back. Angels that are mighty in strength; and, according to that, fulfil God's Commands; reap no greater commendation from Christ than the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> did; who had but a little strength, and kept Christ's word. For it is according to what men have, and not according to what they have not, that God and man expect returns should be made, by them whom thay oblige. God, therefore, having given to Man a power not to sin, demanded his perseverance in Innocency, or a sin-less Obedience in our first Parents: In which they faising, and God inflicting as a penalty upon them and their Off-spring (naturally descending of them) the withdrawing of that power (which he was not bound to bestow at first, much less to restore after they had forfeited it) he was pleased to make another Covenant with them, of his mere Grace and Bounty: That as to Satisfaction of his Truth and Justice, in the Expiation for the breach of that first Covenant; he himself would provide a Lamb, in the Merits of whose Blood, every man should have a share, that did but love him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43715:123"/>
with all that strength which God had left him, or should afford him. From which different Degrees of afforded Strength, arose the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Love and Obedience to God, required (as Conditions of God's accepting our love to him, as sincere) in all the After-Covenants which he made with Man. Now for the Apostles to fit these super-added strings to the Polycord of the Old Testament; to tune the still voice of the Gospel, to the shrill tones of the Law; to make <hi>Christ</hi>'s Pipe accord with <hi>David</hi>'s Harp; the Trumpet on Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> with the Law that went out of <hi>Sion;</hi> to set their new Song, to the old Tune, was not the work <hi>(Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiarum)</hi> of every trivial Ballad-singer; but of minds well set, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harmonious.

the Issue of the whole Cause to this trial; that if he did not express, to the life, that Model, which the Prophets had drawn of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he would be content they should disown him, and esteem him an Impostor. No less earnest were the Apostles to have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets umpire the Controversie; making with their Hearers such candid Expostulations as these: <hi>[We preach no other things</hi> of Jesus, <hi>than what Moses and the prophets said would come to pass:]</hi> if you can find one line in the face of your <hi>Messiah</hi> (as 'tis drawn by their Pencil) which we cannot shew you in Jesus Christ's, we will give you leave to spit in our faces. A Point wherein the Jews joyn'd issue with the Christians in the Primitive Times; but were as often foyl'd, as they provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this way of determining the great Question in Controversie; Whether Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the promised <hi>Messias? [Itaque dicunt</hi> Judaei, <hi>provoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus istam praedicationem</hi> Isaiae 7. <hi>&amp; faciamus comparationem, an Christo, qui jam venit, competat, &amp;c.] (Tertul. adv.

This Exposition, as it clears the Text from those difficulties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Question of the Scepters departure is intangled and perplexed (to the hardening of the Jew in his mis-belief) so it clearly states the time of its Departure, <hi>(viz.)</hi> at the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Jewish State, by <hi>Titus;</hi> when both these things were come to pass: Christ being come, and the Gentiles converted unto his Obedience.

That by his resurrection God declared him to be that Person whom he had appointed to that Kingdom. 2. His actual entring upon the Exercise of his Royal Power, over the Gentiles in the Call of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> was his taking livery and seisure; and his rejecting the Jews, after that, as it is an argument, that he first provided himself a People among the Gentiles, before he outed the Jews; so his calling of the one, and rejecting of the other was not plenary but initiatory, or in part: the very

               <p>Doubtless we have too much gratified the mis-believing Jews, and laid Stumbling-blocks in their way, by our conceiving, that the departure of the Scepter implies primarily a change of the external Form of their Government, or deprivation of liberty, to use their own Laws, and to enjoy Judges of themselves; things but accidental to that <hi>[Theocraty,]</hi> Government wherein God presided more immediately and specially over them, than other Nations; which was exercised under several Forms, and with such variety (as to those Circumstances and external Privileges) as sometimes they enjoyed, sometimes were deprived of them. <hi>Grotius (de jure pacis &amp; belli l. 1. cap. 4. par. 7. pun.</hi> 5.) proves, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> taking up Arms against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by no Plea, but that of extreme necessity; not from the Jews <gap reason="foreign">

that the Scepter be departed. For if <hi>Shilo</hi> be to come after that, he may possibly come a thousand years hence, for all that the Scepter departed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and an half ago.</p>
               <p>§3. That we may therefore beat the Jew from those Subterfuges, that we have made him, It will be necessary that we hold to that Exposition of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, which hath been premised <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> and those of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Posterity, who (in the defection of the ten Tribes from God and the house of <hi>David)</hi> adhered to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> should continue one Body-politick, govern'd by their own Municipal Laws of divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as God's peculiar Lot, till he should set his only begotten Son <hi>(his King)</hi> upon the holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and give him the Heathen for his inheritance <hi>(Psal.</hi> 2.) That God would not cast <hi>Judah</hi> off, as he did the ten Tribes (the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> those of his Father's Children that would not bow to <hi>Judah</hi>'s Scepter; but cryed, <hi>[To thy tents, O Israel: look to thine own house David; what portion have we in the son of Jesse?]</hi> dissolving their whole Body Politick, and scattering it piece-meal over the face of the Earth, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>[Loammi] ye are not my people,</hi> long before <hi>Shilo</hi> came. That (I say) <hi>Judah</hi> should not thus be rejected, till she had rejected her <hi>Messias,</hi> and the Gentiles should be gather'd to him. That, for all their provoking of their God to Jealousie (in the mean while) by them that were not Gods, he would not provoke them to Jealousie by them that were no people; till that <hi>no people,</hi> should become the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>'s <hi>God;</hi> till then the Jews should be a Nation of Kings and Priests to God. In order to his keeping of which Promise to the house of <hi>Judah,</hi> though that Kingdom (before the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity) had corrupted it self with abominable Idolatry, more than the Kingdom of <hi>Israel;</hi> yet God took not that advantage against them: &amp; it pleased him (in remembrance of his promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that the Line of our Saviour might be more discernable) to purify them in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Furnace from all Propensity to Heathenish Idolatry. Insomuch as since then No torments have had the power to warp them in the least towards it, (Dr. <hi>Heilin</hi>'s <hi>Judea.)</hi> Yea so far did this Zeal of theirs against the Gods of the Gentiles carry them (when their zeal grew into dotage, and became to be without knowledg) as they would not acknowledg their own God, manifest in the flesh, upon this reason, because he was given out to be the God, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles; but at the hearing of it, rend their Cloaths, cast Dust in the Air, and cry, Away with the speaker from the Earth, he is not fit to live <hi>(Act.</hi> 22. 22.) So that from thence forward <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> did never directly, cast off the God of their Fathers; nor in gross, their <hi>Thearchy,</hi> though they vacated many of the Moral Precepts (by their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) and the whole Ceremonial Law (in not looking to Christ the end and Substance of it.) Wherefore God continued their King, and they stood in relation to him, as his peculiar Inheritance; till they refused the Scepter of his Son; and by consequence his, who had set him up King. And then the Scepter departed by consent of both parties; The Jews saying, of the King's Son, <hi>This man shall not reign over us:</hi> and God, upon this their rejectment of his Christ, saying of them, <hi>I will not feed you, I will not be your shepherd,</hi> the ancient compellation of Kings. Thus the Angel comments upon <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy <hi>(Dan.</hi> 9. 26.) <hi>[After the threescore and two weeks Messiah shall be cut off and not for himself,]</hi> as Master <hi>Mede</hi> expounds that Text. That is, not from life: for that had been done before the end <hi>(viz.</hi> in the middle of the last of those weeks: but from reigning as their King, cut off, from sitting upon that Throne of the house of <hi>David,</hi> by their refusing him to be theirs, and his casting them off from being his. God indeed had often (before this) sould them into the hands of their Enemies, into the hand of <hi>Jabin, Sisera, Eglon</hi> and at last of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> but that was not an absolute sale, but a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for years; redeemable, after the Assyrian had received his pay of them, for the service he had done God, against <hi>Tyre</hi> and other of his proscribed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43715:126"/>
that being all the consideration mention'd in that Bargain: wherein God did not pass away his Propriety in them, but entred a <hi>Proviso</hi> of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in that command to <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Unckle, to preserve the Evidences, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that that Captivity should return <hi>(Jer.</hi> 32. 7.) The equity of which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi> was grounded upon the insufficiency of that Consideration, as to God's passing away his Right of Inheritance, pleaded by the Church in that Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity <hi>(Psal. 44.) [Thou sellest thy people for nought, and hast not encreased thy wealth by their price.]</hi> They were not sold absolutely for nought, either in respect of their Demerits and Provocations; or altogether, in respect of Gods Truth (for he thereby saved the credit of his promise to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> that he should have his hire:) but comparatively they were sold for as good as nought in that God did not thereby increase his wealth, add to the heap of the Riches of that Grace he had made over (by Covenant) to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; in respect of which former Bargain (contracted with the Father of the Faithful) he could not <hi>(salvâ side)</hi> without suffering his Faithfulness to fail, without impairing his Truth; as well as in respect of his great name, <hi>[King of Saints]</hi> cast off the Carnal Seed wholly from being his Kingdom, till he had taken his Spiritual Seed into their room. And indeed God's punishing of his Rebels with total Rejection, before he had erected his Kingdom of Grace in the midst of his Enemies (the Gentiles) would have been the punishing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with the forfeiture of his Visible Kingdom of Grace, and the stripping of himself into the bare Kingdom of his Providence. So far would God have been from encreasing his wealth by their price, as he would have made a losing Bargain, and bankrupt himself of a peculiar People; if he had cast off <hi>Judah</hi> before the accession of the Gentiles to his Scepter of Grace: which did not happen, till their flocking in to Christ's Standard; As is manifest from their Prophets speaking of this gathering of the Gentiles to <hi>Shilo</hi> (even to the last of them) as of a thing <hi>de futuro. [He shall lift up an ensign to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,] (Isa. 11. 12.) [Thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not: and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that knew not thee shall run unto thee,] (Isa. 55. 5.) [My name shall be great among the Gentiles,] (Mal.</hi> 1. 11.) So that at the Expiration of Old Testament Prophecy, this gathering was yet to come, It was yet in the shell of the Promise. And since <hi>Malachy,</hi> there hath not been any gathering of Gentile Nations to the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> to make his name great in all the Earth saving that of the Christian Flock, to that Shepherd whom the God of <hi>Israel</hi> is not asham'd to call his Fellow, his Equal; and of whom the Prophets have foretold, that <hi>he should bring forth judgment to the Gentiles,</hi> Hitherto therefore that Plea was prevalent; <hi>[We are thy people save us, thou never bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rule over them.]</hi> If thou destroy this people <hi>[What will become of thy great name?]</hi> what will become of thy Promise to <hi>Abraham?</hi> of thy Kingdom of Grace? For God was obliged, by the Interest of his Glory, and by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to the Patriarchs, not to remove the Scepter from <hi>Judah</hi> till <hi>Shilo</hi> come, and the Gentiles were gather'd to him.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Shilo</hi> was come, the Baptist forewarns <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, not to trust any longer to that Plea, as their security against approaching vengeance <hi>[Think not to say</hi> (when you are consulting how to escape wrath to come) <hi>we are Abraham's children;]</hi> That Plea is now growing out of date: <hi>[For God is able to raise up children to Abraham</hi> (and a People to himself) <hi>of stones;]</hi> that is, out of the obdurate Gentile World, men as hard as Stones; and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, in respect of Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and pre-ingagement, as uncapable as Stones, of becoming the People of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> in your room, of becoming, as you are now, the Kingdom of God: or (as <hi>Ireneus (Advers. her. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 16.) renders it) of them that worship Stones (as the Gentiles did) it being usual in the holy Dialect to call Nations, by the name of the Idols which they worship (as <hi>Bell boweth down,</hi> &amp;c.) This God was ever able to do in respect of his absolute Power: but that Power being (as to the exercise of it) bounded by his Will (for it were Impotency in God to do what he will not) and his Will declared to <hi>Abraham;</hi> he became Debter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43715:127"/>
to his own Faithfulness and Truth so far, as he had not a Moral Power to do it; that is, could not do it without impeachment of his Truth, before this Fulness of Time came; wherein God is to raise up a new Seed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to call them a people that were no people; to make <hi>Japhet dwell in the tents of Sem, [ejecio scilicet</hi> Israele:] (St. <hi>Jerom in Gen. 9. 27.) i. e.</hi> to take the place of <hi>Israel,</hi> to graft the wild Olive Branches upon the Root and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful; implied (as <hi>Isidore Pelusiota</hi> well observes) in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>[Now is the axe] (lib 1. epist. 64.

                  </gap>] to wit, of this acute and evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Decision (that every Tree that brings not forth good Fruit be hewen down:) <hi>[laid to the root of the tree;]</hi> not a Mattock to dig the Roots up, to make the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> touching his Seed, void; but an Axe, to cut off witherd Branches, after the Gentiles that were grafted in had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en root.</p>
               <p>By which Axe or two-edged Sword (as the Apostle stiles it <hi>(Heb. 4.) Is cut in pieces;</hi> that double <hi>Dilemma,</hi> whereby the carnal Jew deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and thought to intangle God:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If we be rejected, who have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, God breaks the Covenant he made with him; And</item>

               </list>
               <p>The Reply which the Apostles gave to this first Objection was; That the prime Article of God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was <hi>[That he should be a father of many nations, that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,]</hi> and therefore, should he not take the Gentiles into his Kingdom, (now that one Seed, that is, Christ was come) he would have broke Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> As to the Jews, he sent Jesus Christ first to bless them: but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they refused to be blessed upon those Terms of Faith, upon which God blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> (thereby declaring themselves to be the Devil's Children; quarrelling with that Covenant (as the Devil did with that which God made with <hi>Adam)</hi> and not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s; who without Hesitancy, tergiversation, or making his own terms with God, simply and unreservedly submitted to God's;) and seeing the Gentiles accepted of them; (thereby becoming the Children of faithful <hi>Abraham.)</hi> It was not consistent with God's Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to leave him childless (as they, so far as lay in their power, had made him) much less would it stand with his Oath <hi>that he would bless them that blessed him, and curse them that cursed him,)</hi> not to bless those Heathens, (with the adoption of Sons, and reception into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family) who bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Abraham</hi> with a spiritual Seed, and acknowledged themselves his Children (by becoming of his Faith, and treading in his Steps:) and that in favour of that fleshly Seed, which would have left him no Seed of the Promise, no Seed of his Faith; but have brought upon him (if they might have had their will) the Curse of Sterility, in that juncture of Time, wherein God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to multiply it as the Stars of Heaven, and to make him a Father of many Nations. <hi>(Act. 13. 46.) [It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken unto you</hi> (Jews) <hi>but seeing you put it from you, and judg your selves unworthy of everlasting life, loe we turn to the Gentiles: for so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth; (Isa. 49. 6.) and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord.]</hi> And <hi>(Rom. 4. 16.) [That the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the faith of</hi> Abraham <hi>who is the father of us all (as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations.) Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel</hi> or answerable to him whom he believed, even God, who quickneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were; who against hope, believed in hope that he should become the Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43715:127"/>
                  <hi>[answerable to him;]</hi> that is, as God is not the God of the Jews on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also of the Gentiles; so should <hi>Abraham</hi> be the Father both of Jewish and Gentile-believers: the believing of which as to the Gentiles, was as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a degree of Faith as that whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> believed the Promise that in <hi>Isaac</hi> his Seed should be blessed; when he was about to sacrifice him, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more against hope, than that God would raise up a seed to him of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles dead in Sins.</p>
               <p>And to the second they answered; that the Jew need not trouble his head with contriving how or where God would find Subjects, if he were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Gentiles were flocking in apace to the Standard of <hi>Messias,</hi> and ere long the Fulness of them would be come in, and so all <hi>Israel</hi> be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that is, (Dr. <hi>Ham. annot. in Rom.</hi> 11. 12. 25.) they should (every where act the Call of the Gospel) come in, in such numbers as they would (in every City and eminent Town) afford matter enough, for the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of Evangelical Churches, or visible Assemblies of Christians there: by which means the Jews will, at length, be provoked to believe; and so all the true Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> (Jews and Heathens both; but particularly, the Remnant of the Jews) shall repent and believe in Christ. And for them that will not be gain'd by these Methods, God may cast them off, upon gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Terms; having, in lieu of them, a great multitude of Subjects, which no man could number; of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues; <hi>(Rev.</hi> 7. 9.) Christ foretells that (upon the Builder's rejecting the precious Stone, and its becoming a Corner-stone) the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to another Nation; <hi>(Mat.</hi> 21. 42. 43.) And according to this Prophecy of Christ, and Application of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy, which Christ and his Apostles made to the time of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s final Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God did, then, remove his Scepter from <hi>Judah:</hi> that ceasing then to be God's Kingdom, and the Kingdoms of the World becoming the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of God and of his Christ, within a few Centuries afterwards, when Christs Royal Law came to be established and protected by the Imperial San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the Edict of Princes become Christian. In whose Territories (in the mean time) God had his imperial Cities, his Cities on Hills that could not be hid; Christian Churches so visible and conspicuous, as spake him to be King of all the Earth, in the same sence that he had been King of <hi>Judea;</hi> that is, in respect of his Kingdom of Grace, of his golden Scepter. Briefly there was such a gathering of the Gentiles to <hi>Shilo,</hi> before that rejected King's coming to destroy miserably those bloody Rebels, and to root out their Place and Nation; as he need not be to seek for Subjects, when he cast off <hi>Judah</hi> and chose the Gentiles: any more than when he refused the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and chose the Tribe of <hi>Judah (Psal.</hi> 78. 67. 68.) for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel had then been preach'd to, and brought forth fruit in, all the World. God manifested in the Flesh had been preach'd to the Gentiles, and believedon in the World, as hath been formerly shewed.</p>
               <p>§ 4. But then this being laid for a Ground, that the Scepter's departure imports, properly and firstly, the Removal of the <hi>Thearchy</hi> from the Jews, and translating it to the Gentiles: and the time of its departure being thus stated, to have been in such a Juncture as wherein God might, and did, break up his Court in <hi>Judea,</hi> without impeachment of his Truth or Honour, which he could not do before. It will be obvious enough, that that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; (consequentially to this) implies (as the effect of it) a gradual with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of their outward Polities, Liberties, and Privileges, thereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; as the Sun being set, the light of it departs by degrees till it wholly disappear. Of which, though we can make no Demonstration, while it is in Motion (it takes such minute and insensible steps) much less from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an obstinate and captious Adversary, that the Sun is set (if it be not seen at its going down) till the Light of it be impair'd to a degree, beyond what the most gloomy Sky, the thickest Mist, or the most dismal Eclipse, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43715:128"/>
it to; yet when its Light is dwindled into such a degree of privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis a palpable evidence, that the Sun (its Fountain) is departed our Horizon. As therefore I have been forc'd to prove that the Scepter (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any loss of Light it did, or could sustain, before the Gentiles flock'd in to our Saviour's Standard) was not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, departed, there having been from <hi>David</hi> to Christ no greater diminutions of its Light, then had been from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>David:</hi> and therefore the Jew, upon the same reason that he will not look downwards, in <hi>Judah</hi>'s Line for <hi>Shilo</hi> as low as our Jesus: must look upwards for him beyond <hi>David;</hi> for if those castings down of the Crown to the ground which it sustain'd, by the Apostacy of the ten Tribes, the Babylonish Captivity, the Persecution of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Dictatorship of the <hi>Macabees,</hi> or what else occurs in the History of that Interval, speak the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Scepter; much more must it be departed in the interval before <hi>David,</hi> in the Egyptian Bondage, or under the Judges, of which time their own Scriptures affirm that there was then no King in <hi>Israel.)</hi> Nor till our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's time (which is my Herculean Argument) was there any such concourse of a new People to <hi>Israel</hi>'s God, as could have justified him, from the imputation of making a losing Bargain, should he have cast off his far more numerous old, and have adopted that new People. Though I confess that great access of Proselytes in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign (said to be an hundred three and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his <hi>Parergon</hi> of the fall of <hi>Jerusalem, cap.</hi> 12.) might occasion the Jew to think it was the Gentiles gathering to <hi>Shilo;</hi> and boaded the departure of the Scepter in the falling away of the ten Tribes: and doubtless those Gentile Converts (together with the Levites and those that feared God adhering to the house of <hi>Judah,</hi> being so numerous, as in the worst of times there were seven thousand of them) fill'd up the rent that was made in <hi>Judah</hi>'s Royal Robe, by tearing off ten of its Skirts. But to return As I have been forc'd to prove, that before our Saviour the Scepter was not departed: and therefore this Prophecy of <hi>Jacob</hi> is not applicable to any before him. So I shall now shew it is not applicable to any since, by demonstrating the Scepter to have departed at that time; by such Effects of its departure, as are acknowledged for such by the Jew himself, and pointed to as such by his own Scriptures, and invelop that Nation in a Darkness that may be felt, and far exceeds the blackest Darkness which befel that State in its greatest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses.

Beza</hi> (on <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 24.) makes the same Description of that Shekel, which was given him by <hi>Ambrose Blaucerus.</hi> And <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> saith, that while he was at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> there was brought unto him by a friend an ancient piece of Jewish Coyn, with the very same Figures and Characters: weighing half an Ounce; <hi>vide Aster. sol.</hi> (in <hi>numb. cap.</hi> 3. 40. 47.) which soever it was in which they paid that Tribute for their Lives, it was Gods Coyn, and bare upon it God's Claim, and their Acknowledgment, of his peculiar Supremacy over them: and therefore, as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s demanding of that Tribute of the Jews would have been, in truth, a taking away from God what was God's (as <hi>Goodwin</hi> well observes) so the Jews paying of it to <hi>Caesar,</hi> would have been a giving of <hi>Caesar</hi> what was Gods. This Tribute which <hi>Caesar</hi> exacted and Christ ordered them to pay, was not the Half-shekel due to God; for then Christ would have bid them give it to God, <hi>Weems:</hi> which I wonder they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served not as well as <hi>Weems;</hi> there being so near a relation betwixt taking and giving, and their scruple propounded to and determination of it given by Christ, not respecting <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Act in demanding, but their own in giving; that what was God's (as this Half-shekel was) must be given to God, not to <hi>Caesar.</hi> In which resolution of their Question, as Christ cleaves the hair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt not only God and <hi>Caesar,</hi> but the two extream and vitious Opinions touching Tribute, (the one of the Pharisees, Galileans, and Zealots, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied all Tribute to <hi>Caesar:</hi> The other of the Herodians or Court-party, who held all kind of Tribute to be <hi>Caesar</hi>'s due;) so this very prudent and equal partition of his, is afterwards by malicious Persons improved into an accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him at his Arraignment before <hi>Pilat,</hi> (St. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 2.) as if he forbad to give Tribute to <hi>Caesar.</hi> A most false and groundless Suggestion; for he did not only pay that Tribute himself, but punctually determined <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Right to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Penny.</p>
               <p>3. As to that other Tribute (of the Half-shekel due to God) neither he nor his Countreyman paid it to (nor was it demanded of them by) <hi>Caesar;</hi> till their City was demolished, their Temple burnt, the Race of their Priests made unuseful (as <hi>Titus</hi> told them;) and the Lineage of <hi>David</hi> cut off by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian;</hi> but was paid to their own Collectors, for the use of the Temple: as is manifest not only by the Arguments before hinted, but these supernumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Saviour's Plea for Exemption from payment of that Tribute <hi>(Mat. 17. 25.) [The children of Kings are free,]</hi> cannot, with any colour, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any other Tribute, but that of the Half-shekel, which that holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid to their holy King, whose Son Christ was (and not of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:) and therefore by the Rule of common Custom, was not lyable to pay that Tribute. It being the use of all Kings, to exact Tribute of Strangers (that is, of the children of other men (their Subjects) not their own.) For that by <hi>[Aliens</hi> and <hi>own]</hi> in Christ's Speech, is not meant Subjects and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, is apparent, from Kings exacting Tribute from their own native Subjects, as well as from them that are become their Subjects by Conquest; yea from their own (that is) Subjects, and not from Forreigners. Christ pleads not here the privilege of being a Roman; or had he done so, that Plea would not have exempted them from paying the Tribute due to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown; had he indeed been the Emperour's Son, he had been exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from paying it. From which Analogy he argues, that he being the Son of God, the Collectors of Gods (his Fathers) Tribute, should not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that Tribute of him. Notwithstanding he being Man also, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Obligation to fulfil the Law, rather than offend, in not paying his Church-duties, he fetched Money out of a Fishes mouth,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:43715:129"/>
Briefly, the Tribute then demanded of, and paid by Christ, was both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for, and paid to that King whose son Christ was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Had that been a Roman Tribute it would have been gather'd by the Roman Collecters, the Publicans, who in all probability would have been here named; whereas on the contrary, the persons are here stiled (as by a known Title) they that received the <hi>Didrachma</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Hence I draw these Corrolaries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their reasoning is too short; who, from <hi>Tullies</hi> mentioning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to have had the Tribute of Land in <hi>Syria,</hi> paid by way of Tythe; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that God's Tythe of <hi>Jewry</hi> was by <hi>Pompey</hi> diverted from his Treasury to the Roman Coffers A conclusion which as it wholly subverts the grand Foundation of Christian Religion (to wit, the Verity of the old Testament by asserting the Departure of the Scepter before the coming of our Jesus, (that is <hi>Shilo)</hi> (for what greater evidence of that, than their paying their King's (God's) Tribute unto any other, but himself;) so it appears to be without ground: for grant we the Assumption, That the Roman State tyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Judaea,</hi> yet it will not follow that they paid those Tythes in kind, which were due to God; but only that the Romans (at their Conquest of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) finding it under the Government of the High Priest (to whom the Tythes were payable by the Law of God) might demand a Tribute, in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and yet not the same <hi>in specie</hi> that was paid to the Temple: but leave that still to be received by the High Priest, for his maintenance, and those uses to which their own Law had appointed. Which that they did is manifest from the Decrees of <hi>Julius Caesar (Joseph. ant.</hi> 14. 17.) made when he was second time Consul; <hi>[that</hi> Hircanus <hi>and his Sons should enjoy the High Priesthood, with the same Rights and Privileges that his Ancestors had done:]</hi> and, when he was the fifth time Consul; <hi>[that</hi> Hircanus <hi>and his Sons, High Priests, should receive the Tythes, as till then their Ancestors had done:]</hi> A clear Testimony, that whatever Tribute <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> had imposed upon the Jews (albeit it were in proportion of Tythe) it was not the Tythe which belonged to the Priests; for that (saith <hi>Caesar)</hi> had, till then been paid to the High Priest.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though the Jews had paid a yearly Tribute to the Emperour, bearing Proportion to that <hi>Didrachma,</hi> which they were by Law enjoyn'd to pay to God; yet it was not that <hi>in specie:</hi> the <hi>Didrachma</hi> being paid to the Temple, when that yearly Tribute was paid to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as hath been proved already so fully as no more need be added; only, because I am now in <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> I shall, out of him, produce one unanswerable Argument to evince, that it was not the intention of the Romans (in the Tribute they imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Jews) to encroach upon God's Right, or to impede their payment of Church or Temple-duties. <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (after he was created perpetual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator) writes in his own, and Senate, and People of <hi>Rome</hi>'s name to the Magistrates of the Parians, telling them how ill he resented their prohibiting the Jews to keep their sacred Conventions, and to collect Oblations and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys for their Sacrifices; and lays before them the Decree of <hi>Sex. Caesar,</hi> who when he was Consul (though he interdicted all other <hi>Fraternities)</hi> yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Jews to hold Religious Meetings, and to gather Collections in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the maintenance of their Religious Services: and his own Example, who permitted the Jews to live after the custom of their Forefathers, and their own Laws; <hi>(Josephus Ibidem.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dolobella</hi> (after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murder) writes to the Ephesians and all the Asians, that it was his pleasure (as it had been of all the Emperours his Predecessors) that the Jews should be permitted to use the Customs of their Fathers to meet for holy Exercises as their Law commanded, and to confer their accustomed Oblations towards maintaining their Temple and the Services thereof <hi>(Joseph.

antiq.</hi> 14. 17.) and (to spare other instances) <hi>Titus</hi> aggravated the Rebellion of the Jewish Priests (whom he charges to have been the Incendiaries of the War) from the favours which the Romans had shewed the Jews ever since their Conquest; amongst which hereckons this for one of the chief, That they had always been allowed to receive the Tribute which by their Law was due to God, and to collect free gifts for the use of the Temple: <hi>[Quódque maximum est,</hi> Tributum <hi>capere Dei nomine, ac donaria colligere permissimus:] (Joseph. Bel. Jud. l. 7. c.</hi> 13.) There is no convincing of him that shuts his eyes against this Light.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Jews therefore till <hi>Vespasian,</hi> were not commanded to pay the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drachma</hi> to any but their own Collectors for the use of the Temple; which he, ordering to be paid to the Capitol, made a greater Incroachment upon their sacred Privileges than any former Conquerour had done, even to the utter subversion of their holy State; making (as much as in him lay) the God of <hi>Judah</hi> a Tributary King to the Gods of <hi>Rome.</hi> Not that he himself was conquer'd by those Gods (as <hi>Vespasian</hi> blasphemously implyed by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his Tribute to them) in the Conquest of his people the Jews <hi>(August. de consensu evang. l. 1. 14.) [Non quòd ipse sit victus in Hebraeo populo suo, qui Regnum ejus Romanis expugnandum delendúmque permisit:]</hi> whose Kingdom he permitted the Romans to carry away by force: For though the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours at the present triumph'd over him, and made their Idols set their seet upon the subjugated Neck of this sleeping Lyon; yet it was not long ere he rouzed up himself, and having taken his Kingdom from that Prophetick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (because then he was come who was promised by it) he (by Christ) sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to his name that Roman Empire, by which that Nation had been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: and converted it, by the Force and Devotion of the Christian Faith, to the Overthrow of Idols: an admirable thing (saith St. <hi>Austin, de consensu evangel. lib. 1. cap. 14.) [That he whom the conquered had so offended, as he would no longer reign over them, and the Conquerours would not then receive for their King; is now worship'd of all Nations, and manifested to be that very God of</hi> Israel, <hi>of whom so long before was prophesied:] (Isa. 54. 5.)

In the Babylonish Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity they had that constantly in their mouth, <hi>[The Gods that made not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall utterly perish from under this heaven,] (Jer.</hi> 10. 11.) and were so far from falling down before their Idols, as they chose rather to be cast into the Lion's Den, into a fiery Furnace. Or in what sence, during this last and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Dispersion, they have been induc'd to serve Gentile-Gods of Wood and Stone, but in their being forc'd to pay that homage of Soul-tribute to the Capitoline Gods, which was the holy one of <hi>Israel</hi> his due, while he stood in that relation to them: which being ceased, they as Slaves, become tributary not only to a foreign State (for that had been their frequent portion, without impeachment of God's peculiar Sovereignty over them, even then when he ruled over them in fury; that being a gracious Dispensation to bring them back into the Bond of the Covenant: they that formerly led them captive and tyrannized over them, were but as their Shepherd's Dogs to fetch them in again when they strayed away, and would not be reclaim'd by their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's Whistling to them in the Ministry of their Prophets) but forreign God's.

               <p>The Tribute now imposed upon the Jews is that which comes from their Temple consumed with fire; that is (saith <hi>Scaliger)</hi> the Half-shekel (which formerly they used to pay to the Temple, while it stood) they were injoyn'd after it was demolished, to pay to the Capitol. To which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that Inscription of the Jewish Coyn (after this Tribute was released, and the Capitoline Gods turn'd out of doors.) <hi>[CALVMNIA FISCI JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAICI SUBLATA:] the reproach of the Judaical Tribute remov'd:</hi> Had God spit in their faces it would not have been a greater reproach than their paying this Tribute was. How did God in this retaliate their scornful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of his Son at thirty Pieces; that goodly price was cast to the Potter: But here God appoints the price of their Souls to be cast to Devils, as long as there were any in the Capitol to receive it. By that he provided a Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place for Strangers in the Land of Promise (a <hi>Dormitory</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> for those of the East and West in whose eyes Christ was more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than in theirs, that with them they might rest in hope of a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Glory.) By this he declared his Rejection of the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the disimparking of that Nation, and turning it into the Wild and Common of the World, the Demesnes of the God of this World. And that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43715:131"/>
according to the plain Exposition which their own Scriptures make: For this Tribute being formerly payable to God as a Ransom for their Souls <hi>(Ex.</hi> 30. 12.) what can their not paying it to God (but to him, out of whose hand God had ransom'd them) import less, than his turning them over into the hands of their old Lord? What could have been a clearer Evidence of God's casting up his Royalty over them, of his unwillingness to stand any longer engaged to protect them; than his ordering them (in his adorable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) to pay the Rent for their Lives to a strange God? As their Tythes were the Hedg of their Estates, and God stood bound by his gracious Promise, while they paid them duly by his appointment, to protect and prosper the Fruit of their Labours. <hi>(Mal. 3. 8, 9, 10.) [Ye are cursed with a curse, ye have robbed me in detaining Tythes: bring your Tythes and prove me herewith whether I will not open the doors of Heaven unto you, and pour you out a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and I will rebuke the devourer for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground, neither shall your Vine be barren.]</hi> So this holy Tribute was the Hedge of their Persons, and demanded of God to be paid to himself, that they might, by vertue of his Covenant, oblige him to secure them from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential Diseases; <hi>[that there be no plague amongst you:] (Exod.</hi> 30. 11.) And therefore the non-payment of it to God, was a casting down of the Fence of his special Providence, and a laying them open to the Dominion of Evil Angels. <hi>Israel</hi>'s Watchman, by appointing his Stipend to be paid to another God, bid them in plain English, look to themselves: for he would take no farther care of them, or charge over them; his gracious Eye should be no longer upon them. <hi>[I will no more pity you, I will no more deliver you; that that dieth, let it die.]</hi>

Jud. lib.</hi> 7. 16.) Except some chosen young men of goodly Complexion and proper Bodies, whom he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Triumph: some Boys under sixteen, of which he sold as many as he could get money for; for there were more sellers than buyers <hi>(Haumer. in Euseb. Eccles. hist. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 8.). And some boysterous Carles, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted through the Provinces for Spectacles and the Teerh of wild Beasts. Partly by the voluntary flight, of those who escaped the Conquerour's hands unto <hi>Alexandria</hi> and the Egyptian <hi>Thebes;</hi> at both which places, by men of their own Nation, there residing, they were either slain or delivered up to the Roman Sword <hi>(Joseph. Bel. Jud. l. 7. c.</hi> 29.) And partly by <hi>Adrian,</hi> who (after he had made it death for any Jew to look towards the place where <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (then <hi>Ardianople)</hi> had stood) sent all the Jews he could not find Chapmen for, into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to sell themselves to their old Enemies for Bond-men bondwomen; but the price of a Jew then ran so low as they sold themselves <hi>gratis,</hi> for want of Chapmen (St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.) Time was when that Prayer of <hi>Onias,</hi> Sirnamed the Just, was look'd upon as Canonical: <hi>[Oh God, the King of the whole World, seeing these that are with me are thy people, and those of the opposite Party are thy Priests; I beseech thee hear not the Prayers of either side against the other;] (Joseph. Antiq. l. 14. c.</hi> 3.) A Jew then could open and stop God's Ear, his Prayer was the <hi>Key</hi> to the divine Treasury of Mercies and Judgments. Nay God was wont to hear before they call'd; to see their Afflictions, and hear their Groans, under their Pressures, before they made their complaint to God. But since their Fathers God hath turn'd them off, to the Gods of the Capitol. (Though the Earth received the blood of 3024730. of them in the Jewish Wars (those Wars wherein Christ came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43715:132"/>
that Blood, at the Father's and Children's hands, the guilt whereof they had invoked upon their own heads at his Passion.) Though 970000. of them were in those Wars taken Captive; <hi>(Joseph. Bel. Jud.)</hi> yet neither the cry of the Prisoners, nor the Voice of the Blood of the Slain hath enter'd into the Ears of the Lord of Hosts; except it be to make Musick in them, while God laughs at their Calamity.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Time was when <hi>Israel</hi>'s God awoke to avenge himself upon <hi>Belsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> for alienating the Bolls of the Temple from that sacred use to which they had been dedicated; and making them either carowsing Cups at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Instruments of Libations to <hi>Babel</hi>'s Idols at a sacred Feast: for the Jews (saith St. <hi>Jerom, in locum:)</hi> have this Story. That <hi>Belshazar</hi> observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the seventieth Year of the Captivity (that is of the first Captivity) being come, that yet the Jews were not redeem'd, thinking <hi>Jeremies</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to have been wind (in a Triumph over the Jews hope of Deliverance) made a great Feast, where he and his Nobles <hi>[Insultantes Deo</hi> Judeorum <hi>quòd, &amp;c.]</hi> insulting over the God of the Jews, as too weak to grapple with their <hi>Bell,</hi> made Drink-offerings of thanksgiving to the God of <hi>Babel,</hi> in the Bolls sacred to the God of <hi>Judah,</hi> whom he blasphemed (in <hi>Rabsheca</hi>'s curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Dialect) as being no more able, than the Gods of other Nations, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his People out of the hands of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But this despised, God chalked him up a Reckoning upon the Wall, before he rose from Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and made him pay it that night, at the price of his Life and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; both which he was deprived of, before he went to bed. Which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance <hi>Xenophon (Cyri, institut. l. 7. c.</hi> 22.) thus relates. <hi>[When</hi> Cyrus <hi>his men entered the Royal Palace, they found the Guard tippling, by Candle-light, in the outward Room; against whom the Invaders using hostile force, the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour being heard within, the Doors are instantly open'd by the Kings Command, to see what was the Cause of that Bustle; upon which advantage</hi> Cyrus <hi>his men rushing into the King's Chamber, found the King standing with his Sword drawn, whom they forthwith slew.]</hi> God then stirred up the Spirit of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <hi>Cyrus</hi> to avenge <hi>Judah,</hi> upon <hi>Babel,</hi> while he was but his Unkle <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axeres</hi> (called in <hi>Daniel Darius)</hi> his General; and to order the Return of God's Captives, and the Rebuilding of his Temple as soon as he came to the Imperial Crown.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Vespasian</hi> carried captive the holy Utensils of the second Temple: The Table of Shew-bread (whereon the twelve Tribes in the Tipe of twelve Loaves, had stood day and night under the favourable inspection of <hi>Israel</hi>'s God:) The sacred Lamps (Emblems of that manifold and marvellous Light of divine Revelations which that Nation peculiarly enjoyed:) The holy Veil (that which fignified God's discriminating them, in point of special favour and intimate Communion, from all the Nations of the World.) And lastly, the Book of their Law of the Covenant that God made with their Fathers.) These, (saith one of their own, <hi>Josephus (Bel. Jud. l. 7. c. 25.) Vespasian</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Triumph, after the Images of the Roman Idols, to the Temple of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> Capitoline, and reposited them either in his Palace, or in that Temple of Victory, which he built in Memorial of his Conquest of <hi>Judah.</hi> And as Trophies of his Victory, not only over the Jews, but the God of the Jews, if their own Rabbies be to be believed, who (as they are quoted by <hi>Vicars</hi> in his <hi>Decupla in Psal.</hi> 94. 2, 3.) Compare <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> with <hi>Titus,</hi> and affirm, that as the first gloried over the desolation of the First, saying, <hi>[Who is that God that can deliver you out of mine hand?] (Daniel</hi> 3.) so this second insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the desolation of the Second Temple, saying, <hi>[The God of the Jews is gone a Voyage by Sea, let him land and give me Battel.]</hi> My thoughts are here distracted through plenty of Matter, and cannot tell where to begin to pitch their dazell'd Eye: whether upon that miraculous Providence whereby, in the midst of these Conflagrations, (which Massy Pillars of Brass could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the violence of) were preserved such combustible things as the Veil, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43715:132"/>
Book of the Law: by whose contrivance it came to pass, that in the vast Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and Rubbish of the Temple, should be found the Table of Shew-bread and the Lamps, where so many things were buried of more bulk, of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, both in common esteem, and in the opinion of the Jews. Or upon that secret (and to him unseen) guidance of the everlasting Counseller, that directed <hi>Vespasian</hi> to single out for his Triumph such sacred Utensils, as (of all others) were most lively Representations of the peculiar Privileges which that Nation had enjoyed under her great King; and altogether, the perfect Hieroglyphick of that holy State (a Corporation, consisting of twelve Tribes, (upon which the Eye of God was always fix'd) seperated from all other Kingdoms to be holy unto God, (as the Holy of Holies was from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Veil:) Living under the fruition of divine Light (and in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, in black and white.) Or that all-ruling Power that guided the Scribe's hand, to give the World an account of the so solemn cancelling of the Bond between God and his sometimes Covenant-people, the taking away of the Veil of Partition betwixt that and other Nations; the removal of his Lamp from them, and them from his favourable Inspection. So that henceforth the Shew bread-table (whereon they were wont to be presented before the Lord) must stand before a God that hath Eyes, but sees not; their <hi>Jehovah</hi> having turned over his care for them to the <hi>Latian Jove:</hi> From henceforth the Veil of the Temple (whereon were painted Cherubims, those Eyes of the Lord that run to and fro through the Earth:) A Type of that difference which God put betwixt them and the rest of the Inhabitants of the Earth, must be hung up in the Capitol: as if, in scorn, God had sent the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol-watchmen upon that Hill: this Type of his, to help their eyes; that they might look to their new Charge; or intended to signifie, that now the Capitoline Gods should peculiarly seperate these their new Clients, from all their old Worshippers: as in truth they did. For all other Nations gave them divine honour, thinking they were God's: But the Jews are forc'd to homage them, whom they knew were no Gods: and therefore were holy to these their new Lords, after a peculiar way of seperation. and different from all the People in the World. Henceforth their holy Lamps and Book of their Law must be deposited among the Gentiles, in their <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and perhaps, in the Emperour's Palace: that all Nations upon the Earth might vindicate God's severity against the Fedifrages, and proclaim the Equity of his Ways, after a Perusal of the Covenant betwixt God and them. That the Gentiles might be lighten'd to the acknowledgment of that Lord Christ, whom the Jews had rejected, to whom Lamp and Law would be more useful, than they had been to that blind Generation, which by malicious Ignorance had put out its own Eyes.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But these wonders (that these Utensils should escape the Fire, should be singled out for Triumph; and a Jewish Priest's committing all this to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Memory; which so clearly expresseth God's cancelling his Covenant with the Jews, and his calling the whole World to be Witness of his giving them so full a discharge) have nothing worthy of admiration in them, in comparison of that, for which principally I made the premised Allegations, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Judah</hi>'s God should all this while hold his peace, if indeed he were at that time <hi>Judah</hi>'s God; and had not renounc'd all Relation to those some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times holy Things, holy People, nay and holy Name too: For the Roman Eagle flutter'd in Triumph equally over all these, That he should suffer the Actors of these Tragedies to reign in honour, to depart in peace: one of their own Priests urgeth this Argument; <hi>(Joseph. Bel. Jud. l. 6. cap. 11.) God was wont to avenge you on your Adversaries: but</hi> Vespasian <hi>may thank the Jewish Wars for the Empire: these Fountains (and for instance that of</hi> Siloam) <hi>which were dry to you, run so plentifully to</hi> Titus, <hi>as to afford Water enough for his Men, for his Cattel, and the flowing of the Grounds he has gain'd. Therefore, I believe, God hath left the Temple, and is fled from you, and takes part with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43715:133"/>
them with whom ye war.]</hi> I shall therefore prosecute this Argument more particularly. This, I say, can never be sufficiently admired, that <hi>Israel</hi>'s <hi>(quondam)</hi> God, should suffer the great-Instruments of their Misery; to live applauded as the Delights and Darlings of Humane Kind, to die bewailed with no loss sorrowful resentment of the Publick, than that which men feel for, and express at, the loss of their own dearest and most intimate Relations, and to be followed to the Funeral Pile, with more Praise than Flattery her self could pour out upon living Princes, [Titus, <hi>cognomine paterno amor &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae humani generis—Excessit, quod ut palàm factum est, non secus atque in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestico luctu maerentibus publicè cunctis, Senatus tantas mortuo gratias egit laudés<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, quantas congessit nè vivo quidem unquam atque praesenti:] (Suetonius: Titus, cap. 1. &amp; 11.) Vespasian</hi> had no <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> writ against him: for that Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he saw in his sleep (of a pair of Ballances hanging up in the Porch of the Palace, with <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> in one, and himself and Children, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scale) was a Vision of Peace, importing the Translation of the Imperial Crown out of the Julian into his, the Flavian Family; and the continuance of it in that Family, as long as it had remain'd in the former during the Reigns of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero;</hi> and that with such Felicity, as the happy and beneficial Reigns of him and his Sons, should counter-ballance the Mischiefs which the World receiv'd, by the male-administration of those two last degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Branches of the Julian Stock. By which Vision and other Portents, he was so well assured of his Son's Succession, as he was wont to ascertain the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>[That in spight of all treasonable Attempts to the contrary, he was sure, his Son, or no body, should reign after him (Sueton. Vespasianus, cap. 25.)] Titus</hi> indeed complain'd at his death, that he had done one act for which he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and but one: <hi>[[Neque enim exstare ullum suum factum paenitendum exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto duntaxat uno.] (Sueton. Titus, cap.</hi> 10.) So far was God from writing such bitter Bills against him, that might make his Countenance fall, his Joynts shake, and his Knees smite against one another (as he did against his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blasphemer:) as he with hands stretched out to Heaven, and a naked Breast, complain'd to the God of Heaven almost in <hi>Job</hi>'s Phrase; <hi>[I am cut off, but not for my iniquity; for I do not remember that ever I did any Act to be repented of except one:]</hi> What that Fact was, he neither discovered (saith mine Authour) nor is it easie for any man to tell: some thought it was his too much intimacy with <hi>Domitia,</hi> his Brother's Wife: but if that had been so, that impudent Woman would have boasted of her being nought with so great and good a Man; for she was a Woman not shy of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own Counsel in such Cases. If I may give my Conjecture, I suppose, it might probably be his seeking to obtain the Judaean Crown for himself; a Design which his Father was jealous he had in his head; and for which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd hatred and blame, while he served his Father in the Judaean Wars. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it could not be his slaughtering and captivating the Jews, his sacking their City and Temple, his carrying away the holy Spoils; for here were such a Multiplicity of Acts, as to have confessed himself guilty in those things, had been to have accused the greatest part of his Life, after he came upon the the open Stage: which was, in a manner, spent in Actions of this tendency. And had God, for vindicating the Glory of his sometimes-great Name, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Conscience the guilt of his challenging the God of <hi>Judah,</hi> he would have charged it so home as to have made him confess and give glory to God. And to speak the naked Truth, though the Rabbies put a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Gloss upon the words of <hi>Titus,</hi> yet he did not thereby intend to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front that God who sometimes had been <hi>Judah</hi>'s God: but knowing that he came against <hi>Judea</hi> at the call, and by the conduct, of that God: to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten them and encourage his own men, he told them; <hi>[Their God was put to Sea,]</hi> that is, he had forsaken the protection of them and their Land; their strength was departed from them: upon which account he subjoyn'd; <hi>[Let him come and give me Battel;]</hi> that is, try if (with all your strongest cries) you can engage him to take your part, who, I am sure, takes mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43715:133"/>
you. The words indeed sound like <hi>Nabsheca</hi>'s or <hi>Nebuchadnexxar</hi>'s, but the difference of the times make their sence as different from theirs, as Light from Darkness. The God of Heaven was then God of the Jews, and those Nations indivisible: and therefore they, in the name of their Idols, defied the God of Heaven, under the name of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But now the Relation of the God of Heaven to the Jews is ceased: so that that relative Title is not applicable <hi>(de praesenti)</hi> to him; and the thing signified by it is a mere Idol. And therefore <hi>Titus</hi> might in the name of the true God (who sent him) defie that Relation, and trample upon the Jew's Confidence in a bare and and (then) insignificant Name, the Relation being now out of doors. Which if it had not been, Divine Vengeance would not have slept all that while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving some hints, at least of God's displeasure, not only against these Emperours, but the Empire it self, for killing and dissipating his sometimes flock: As he manifestly did for its killing the Lord of Life; whose Blood he vindicated upon the Roman State, in his permitting <hi>Tiberius,</hi> after the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, to vent those, to the Commonwealth, destructive Vices, which till then he had palliated, in his setting over the Empire that raging wild Beast <hi>Caligula,</hi> that noted Brute <hi>Claudius,</hi> that Monster of men <hi>Nero;</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving the Empire in those bloody civil Wars under <hi>Galba, Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius:</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, as if their shedding the Blood of the Jews, had expiated the Guilt of Christ's, the Empire was never happier in any Succession of its Emperours, than of those who were Instruments of the Jews ruine, and their Successors.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Lastly, where have been God's Mercies of old, where the sounding of his Bowels towards his ancient People (these so many hundred years) while they have been scatter'd, as Chaff before the Wind, to all the Points in the Compass, and made a Prey to the several Nations of the World, among whom they have been sojourning all this while: (If that be not improperly called sojourning, out of which that bewildred and benighted People shall never find Out-gate.) Would their Plea <hi>[We are thine, save us,]</hi> have been thus long unanswered, had not the old Relation betwixt God and them been out of date?</p>
               <p>Ever since [Libanus <hi>open'd her doors that the Fire might devour her Cedars,] (Zach. 11. 1. &amp;c.)</hi> since the Temple (built of the goodliest Cedars of <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus)</hi> opened its doors, on the night, on its own accord <hi>(Joseph. de Bel. Jud. l. 7. c.</hi> 2.) to which Prodigy (happening a little before the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Ruine) <hi>Rabbi Jochanan</hi> applied this Text of <hi>Zach.</hi> (Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> on the Fall of <hi>Jerusalem:)</hi> and the sober Jews interpreted it to import the burning of the Temple: ever since this Prophecy and Prodigy took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. There has been <hi>[an howling of the Fir-trees,]</hi> (the Vulgar Jews;) <hi>[of the Oaks of</hi> Bashan,] (their Heads and Chieftains;) <hi>[of their Shepherds,]</hi> their Priests, Levites and Princes;) <hi>[a roaring of the young Lions,]</hi> (the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the Seed Royal; (St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.) The whole Nation high and low have been crying mightily to <hi>Judah</hi>'s God; to return their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to avenge their Blood. [But <hi>Ego non sum ego,] I am not I,</hi> their Father's God will not now own the name of [Judah's <hi>God:]</hi> that Title is a mere I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, a Nothing in the World; there's no such God in Heaven, as <hi>Judah</hi>'s God; and they gain no more by invocating that Name, than if they were blessing an Idol, than if they were censing one of the Vanities of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who have Eyes and see not, Ears and hear not; there's no voice, no hearing, no returns of answer: but the eccho of that fatal and seal'd decree <hi>(Zach. 11.)

And if Judgment be not speedily executed: <hi>[defertur non aufertur,]</hi> 'tis not forgiveness, but forbearance till their Punishment may be of more advantage to the Republick. So that whereever they have been allowed to reside, they have been kept (as Poultrey in a Coop) only till they were fat enough to kill and pluck, to have either Life or Estate taken from them; Christian States use them only for Spunges (as our King <hi>Henry</hi> did <hi>Emson</hi> and <hi>Dudley)</hi> permitting them to suck in great Estates (by Usury and Brokage) and when they are full, squeasing them into the Exchequer.

At the hand of what Nation, of what Man, of what Beast, hath God required their Blood.

And no less wide of the Prophets sence falls the Jews Application of these Menacies to the destroyers of their second ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Temple, which manifestly belong to their own Nation, for destroying that Temple wherein the Godhead dwelt bodily, and which was raised up in three days; <hi>[for their gathering together against the soul of the righteous, and condemning innocent blood,] (Psal.</hi> 94. 21.) This cannot, with the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Reason, be charged upon the Romans; for their Eagles (in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Wars) gather'd together <hi>[to the Carcase,]</hi> to a People, whose high provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious and rebellious attempts render'd them, fit to be a Prey to publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, deservedly the Objects of the Revenger's Sword.

Bel. Jud. l. 6. c. 16.) I will not refuse to speak what grief compels: I think verily if the Romans had not come against those guilty Varlets that</hi> Jerusalem <hi>would either have been swallowed up off the gaping Earth, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with a Flood, or destroyed with Fire and Brimstone as</hi> Sodom <hi>was; for it harbour'd a Generation of men far more wicked than the Sodomites.]</hi> Briefly, the Romans were neither unrighteous in the vengeance which their Sword of Justice brought upon that Place and Nation; Neither hath God, or will God cut off that Empire as long as the World stands. But in the mean time, we have seen the Jews gathering together, against the soul of the righteous, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the life of the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> (their Righteousness, while they were in the Bond of the Covenant) and we have seen the Lord cut them off; yea the Lord (sometimes their God) cut them off in, and for, this their wickedness. It is not therefore to be thought strange, that they should thus long, without audience, bellow out their second <hi>[quousque?] [how long?]</hi> that hitherto they have had no return of their Prayer to the <hi>[God of Revenges:]</hi> for while they stir him up to revenge his People, to render a reward to the proud, they do but mind him of their own sin and demerits, and solicit him to prolong their just sufferings, and never restore to them the departed Scepter.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Of the departure whereof, as God hath given them all these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations; So almost immediately before its removal, he gave them so fair a warning; as not only their own, but Gentile-historians took notice thereof; in that voice, [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43715:136"/>
the Gentile Idiom) miscalling them Gods, who were only his Courtiers: and therefore foreknowing that their King was about breaking up his Court there, they prepare to depart with him. For what should they (whose Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is always to stand before, and behold the face of God) do there, when he withdrew his Face from the Ark of the Covenant, and that was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the Ark of his Presence? By all this it is apparent, that the Prophecy of <hi>Jacob</hi> (concerning the departure of the Scepter from <hi>Judah,</hi> after that the <hi>Messias</hi> should be exhibited, and the Gentiles be gather'd to him) received its accomplishment at the demolishing of God's House; the place of his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, amongst the Jews, while it stood;) and that therefore the Apostles were well advised in the account they give us of such Circumstances as relate hereunto: An account which so perfectly suits the mind of the Prophecy, as to the time prefixed; that our fixing it there hath the evidence of Reason, the Suffrages of Jew, Gentile, and a Voice from the Oracle, to warrant and confirm it.</p>
               <p>§ 7. If yet the Sceptick will cavil, that not the Apostles, but the Statists of after times (who made a political use of their Simplicity) accommodated the Evangelical History, and the Occurrences of the Christian Age to this Prophecy, I can stop his mouth with these two Animadversions upon this surmise.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Application was made (as appears by the Testimonies alledged out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus)</hi> before any of the Politicians own'd the Gospel; while the Statists of the World did, with all their might, endeavour the suppression of the Christian Religion. as conceiving it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable, destructive to Political Communities, and repugnant to Maximes of Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Evangelists and Apostles themselves (before <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther furnish'd with Humane Learning, had commented upon the Apostolical Writings) did, in the plain Text of Scripture, apply the accomplishment of this Prophecy, and assign the departure of the divine Scepter from the Jewish Nation, to that Period of Time, when the Gentiles being gather'd to Christ, the fall of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should happen. St. <hi>Matthew (chap.</hi> 24.) reports from our Saviours Lips, amongst the Signs of his coming to destroy the Jewish State and the Place of God's Residence among them (a thing to be fulfilled within one Generation, and therefore not applicable intentionally to the day of general Judgment:) this for one <hi>(vers.</hi> 14.) that, <hi>[the Gospel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should</hi> (before that) <hi>be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then shall the end come:]</hi> And this for another <hi>(vres.</hi> 15.) <hi>[When ye shall see the abomination of desolation stand in the holy place;]</hi> that is, as it is explain'd <hi>(ver.</hi> 28.) the Roman Ensigns, the eagles (let fly upon their Prey that Nation then ripe for Rejection;) or as St. <hi>Luke</hi> more clearly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Trope, lays down this Sign <hi>(Chap. 21. 20.) [When ye shall see Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem compassed about with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh:]</hi> Immediately after the Tribulation of which days (of Siege) the Jewish State is to be dissolved. Which Catastrophe of their Polity, Christ, in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew (ver.</hi> 29.) expresseth in such Prophetical Phrases, as the Old Testament Prophets constantly used in their Descriptions of the Ruine of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Republicks; Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken;]</hi> that is, that heavenly Polity establsh'd among the Jews shall wholly be dissolved. When the Gospel shall be preach'd in the Gentile World; or (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains this Text;) (1 <hi>Timothy,</hi> 3. 16.) when Christ shall be <hi>[preach'd to the Gentiles, and believed on in the world:]</hi> then shall <hi>Jerusalem</hi> be destroyed; and immediately after that, the Scepter departs from <hi>Judah;</hi> then shall <hi>Israel,</hi> after the Flesh, cease to be God's Dominion; and whosoever of them after that shall boast of the Covenant of Peculiarity, will, upon trial, be found Liars, not Jews (the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43715:136"/>
Portion of God) but the Synagogue of <hi>Satan (Rev.</hi> 3. 9.) they having left the <hi>Blessing</hi> of that name to another People of God (gather'd to their <hi>Messias</hi> out of all Nations, and called by a new name, <hi>[Christians]</hi> reserve the sound of it only, for a <hi>Curse</hi> to themselves, <hi>(Is. 65. 15, 16.)</hi> Could the Apostles, (in their assigning the time and other Circumstances of the Dissolution of the Jewish State) have thus comported with old <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy thereof, had they been, such silly Animals as the Atheist pretends, and not persons of the deepest Reach, and solidest Judgments. Let the whole Tribe of them, who deride the Apostles for their Simplicity, put all their Heads together (and call in a Legion of Demons to be of their Council) they may study till they split their <hi>dura mater:</hi> and spill those few Brains they have, before they shall be able to make so solid and irrefragable an Application of this Propecy, to the time of any other <hi>Shilo,</hi> and the gathering of Gentiles to him, as the Apostles have made to the time of the Gentiles gathering unto Christ.</p>

               <p>§ 1. THat Prophecy of <hi>Daniel (chap. 9. 24.) [Seventy weeks are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon thy people and the holy City, to finish transgression,</hi> &amp;c.] doth so precisely calculate the Time of the <hi>Messias</hi> coming, and so exactly (in every Circumstance) sutes our Saviour, as it cannot, with any shew of Probability, be applied to any other; nor be denyed to have received its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment in him. From which Text the Primitive Church made such clear Demonstration (to the Gentiles) of the Divinity of the Old, and (to the Jews) of the Divinity of the New; as <hi>Porphiry</hi> was forc'd to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to this Reply to the Christians Arguments, <hi>[That these Prophecies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd upon</hi> Daniel, <hi>were writ long after his death (about the time of</hi> Antiochus) <hi>by some Jew; and are not Prophecies of things to come, but Naratives of things past:] (Jerom prefat. in Danielem.)</hi> Of which Surmise <hi>Eusebius, Appollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and other Champions of the Christian Cause, shewed the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by a two-fold Argument, (related not only by St. <hi>Jerom, in locum,</hi> but by our Sir <hi>Walt. Rawleigh par. 1. l. 3. cap.</hi> 1. § 2.) of the History of the World) <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Seventy, above an hundred years before <hi>Antiochus,</hi> translated <hi>Daniel</hi> amongst the rest of the Jewish Prophets. And, 2. <hi>Jaddus</hi> the High Priest shewed to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great that Vision of <hi>Daniel, (chap. 11. 3.) [A mighty King shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion,</hi> &amp;c.] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Alexander</hi> is presented as the Subduer of the Persian and Erector of the Grecian Empire, as himself applied it, <hi>Joseph. Jud. ant. l. 11. c.</hi> 8.) It had been to small purpose to have shewed <hi>Alexander</hi> the Book, had it been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translated. I therefore, upon these Testimonies, rest so well assured, that the Seventy translated the whole Old Testament; as I conceive the discussion of that Question needless: and cannot strain my Invention, to find out, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince that Generation of men, who have Ignorance or Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough to resist the force of these Authorities, the least whereof
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43715:137"/>
is able to weigh down all Prejudices to the contrary. Howbeit though the Churches Champions had hus baffled <hi>Porphyry;</hi> yet the Jew was glad to take take the like Subterfuge from the dint of this Prophecy, by ascribing to <hi>Daniel</hi> less Authority than to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets; reckoning his Book among the <hi>Hagiographa</hi> composed by <hi>Ezra</hi> and his Synagogue. And when he was beaten thence, he had no way to ward off the force of the Christian's arguing, from this Prophecy, that our Jesus is the Christ: but by this distinction, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy (as also <hi>Zachary</hi>'s) points to a <hi>Messiah</hi> in all points like to our Jesus. A Shepherd that was smitten, and not able to save himself, or Flock: a <hi>Messiah</hi> that was cut off, and ejected out of his Kingdom; not able to hold that Kingdom he usurped, <hi>(In Dan. vis. 8.) [—&amp; non erit ejus popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, qui eum negaturus est: sive (ut illi dicunt) non erit illius imperium quod pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabat se retenturum:]</hi> whereas Christ the Son of God (whom they yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) is described by the Prophets, as asking long Life of God, and obtaining it for ever; as asking, and receiving the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession; as one that will make his people willing, in the day of his power; and will come in that Majesty, as shall bear down all opposition before it. This Jewish Evasion <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> quotes out of the <hi>Talmud</hi> (in his Concent of Sacred Scripture, <hi>anno mundi,</hi> 3535.) A clear acknowledment, that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Text prescribes the Time of the <hi>Messias:</hi> and that that time so exactly sutes the coming of the blessed Jesus as neither Jew nor Gentile durst stand a Dispute with the Christian upon that ground: but, after some Bravadoes and light Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishings, retreated to such Boggy and Quagmire-fastnesses as these. Why do you urge us with the Authority of <hi>Daniel</hi> a spurious Prophet? (whose Book was not writ by him whose Name it bears; but by some false Jew (saith <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry)</hi> by <hi>Esdras</hi>'s College of Elders (say the Jews:) and when the Jew is beaten hence, he grants the Argument, yields the Christian his Conclusion, and so leaves himself no way to escape a total Rout, but over the narrow and slender Bridg of this sorry Distinction: Our Scriptures foretell of two <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asses;</hi> one base and mean, like your Jesus (the Son of <hi>Joseph</hi> the Carpenter;) another high and mighty, the Son of <hi>David</hi> the King; who shall repair the decayed Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> and sit upon his Throne for ever. These were the desperate shifts, which the Defenders of the Christian Faith put the Jews to; by their demonstrating (out of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks) that the Fulness of Time (for the appearance of the <hi>Messiah)</hi> was then come, when our Saviour exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited himself; being put to this plunge, that they must either confess the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ, or deny the Divine Authority of their own Prophetick Books, or split in two their <hi>Messias,</hi> whom those Books foretell.</p>

To shew the unreasonableness of both these Evasions would fall in, more methodically, in another place: yet that my Reader, while he is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with me (through this Prophecy) in search of the Christ, may not fall under the least discouraging doubt of the Canonicalness of this Book, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the least fear of finding here a <hi>Messias;</hi> who is not the Son of <hi>David,</hi> as as well as the Son of <hi>Joseph;</hi> and the Son of God, as well as the Son of <hi>David:</hi> I shall now remove these stumbling-blocks.</p>
               <p>As to the first Evasion <hi>(viz.</hi> the debasing the Authority of <hi>Daniel)</hi> it was a mere Pretence, taken up to blunt the Edge of that Prophecy, the Dint whereof the Jew was not able to avoid: For before the Christian took that Sword into his hand for the Defence of Christ, the Synagogue had as high an esteem of him as any other of the Prophets: of whose Faith, touching this part of the Old Testament-canon, <hi>Josephus</hi> (who lived to see the last hour of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks expired) is an impartial Witness; who makes this clear and full Confession: <hi>(antiquit.</hi> 10. 12.) <hi>viz. Daniel</hi> was a most happy man, and a most excellent Prophet,—and after death obtained eternal Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for his Books, which he left writ, are at this day read among us: (this was in the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> after the accomplishment of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks;)
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43715:137"/>
being such as give full proof of Gods vouchsafing to have familiar Conference with him. For he did, not only as other Prophets, foretell things to come, but define the precise time, when they were to fall out: which have had that Effect (in the certainty of Events) as hath procured him credit among all sorts of mortal Men; there being those Circumstances in his Writings, from whence the certainty of his Prophecies may be more clearly gather'd, than from any other of our Prophets. For the proof of which, having instanc'd in his Vision of the four Beasts, in his Prediction of the rising of the Roman Empire, and the desolations it was to bring upon the Jewish People; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus. All these things being reveiled to him by God, he committed to Writing, and left to Posterity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed had <hi>Josephus</hi> been silent, the Book it self speaks <hi>Daniel</hi> to be the Pen-man of it, where the Angel bids him seal the Prophecy; which sure was not a Blank, which <hi>Ezra</hi> and his Companions were to fill up! Nay the Jews silence <hi>(Mat. 24. 45. Mar.</hi> 13. 14.) when Christ quoted <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, gave Consent that he was the Author of that Book; which had they conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have been his Writing, but the Tradition of the Elders, they would not have failed to have bid our Saviour (who had so frequently rebuked them, for adhering to Tradition) wash his own hands of that Crime, which he objected to others.</p>
               <p>Touching their other Subterfuge (their distinguishing of <hi>Messias)</hi> a man (inferiour to <hi>Solomon</hi> in Wisdom) may judg it a sufficient Evidence that that Child is none of theirs, whom they would have divided. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This halving of Christ wholly destroys him, whom their Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe; to be Mortal, and Immortal; a Man of Sorrows, and the impassible God, in one Person; and to be exhibited in both Natures, at one and the same Fulness of time. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecies of the Nation's gathering to <hi>Shilo</hi> as their King, and of the tying of a Foal the Colt of an Ass (upon which this meek and lowly King was to ride in Triumph) are utter'd with the same Breath, and bear the same Date <hi>(Gen.</hi> 49. 9.) The servant of God (in <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah)</hi> who (in regard his Visage was mar'd more than any man's, and his form more than the Sons of Men) was to be looked upon with astonishment and to be rejected of men, as one smitten of God: was notwithstanding to be extolled and exalted as the most High; was to be so full of resplendent Majesty, as Kings should shut their mouths at him <hi>(Isa. chap.</hi> 52. 13. 14.) The same <hi>Messiah</hi> (in <hi>Daniel)</hi> that within 70 Weeks is to make Reconciliation for Sin, by his Death; is to bring in everlasting Righteousness, by his Life the same individual Person, that within that Term of Years is to be cut off, is <hi>Messiah</hi> the Prince, and the most holy <hi>(Dan.</hi> 9. 24. 25.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Messiah</hi> that came, at the time described by <hi>Daniel,</hi> gave as full proof of his Divine Majesty, as he did of his Humane Infirmity; was as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly declared to be the Son of God (by the Miracles he wrought in his own Name, by his raising himself from the dead, by his visible inflicting his threatned Sentence upon his Crucifiers, and by his subduing the World to his Obedience;) as he was declared to be the Son of Man, by his hungring, thirsting, fainting, weeping, sorrowing, and suffering death. So that, he whom the Jews reject as an abject Christ, hath left nothing to be done by him, whom they yet look for, of all those glorious and stupendious works which the Prophets assign to the <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If that <hi>Messiah</hi> (that came according to Time limited by <hi>Daniel)</hi> be not that very same, of whose Glory and Greatness the Prophets speak; when is he to come? what Prophet can say how long the World must travel in expectation of him? can any thing be more incredible, than that the Spirit of the <hi>Messiah</hi> (that was in the Prophets) should (so punctually) foretell the time of the appearance of this Puny and Dwarff-christ (as they blasphemously stile the blessed Jesus) and never communicate one word to any of them, touching the time of the coming of that Gyant-christ, that they look for.</p>

§ 3. Thus having proved the Authentickness of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy: and the Subject of it to be the <hi>Messias;</hi> and that <hi>Messias</hi> whom it presignifies, to be Prince <hi>Messias.</hi> and having heard both Jew and Gentile confess that what <hi>Daniel</hi> foretells, both as to Time and Thing, is applicable to our Jesus, and none but him. I shall supercede any farther prosecution of this Argument, saving what this Observation may contribute towards the strengthening of it. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Terms of this Prophecy are not capable of any rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but what is applicable to our Saviour, and impossible to be applied to any other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we understand the Decree from the going out whereof <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks commence, to be the Decree of <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspis</hi> for the building of the Temple, the last of them will fall at our Saviour's Passion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Computation of <hi>Vossius,</hi> grounded upon the Chronology of <hi>Josephus (Vossii Chronolog. sacra.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If we conceive this Decree to have been the Decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, as <hi>Calvin, Broughton, Finch, Piscator, Allen, &amp;c.</hi> imagine; and reckon the years of the Persian Monarchy after a middle rate with <hi>Allen (i. e.)</hi> 130. years, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks end about the death of our Saviour: <hi>(Allen's Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Chain, period</hi> 7.) If with <hi>Finch</hi> we follow the Rabinical account of the Durance of the Persian Monarchy, <hi>i. e.</hi> 70. years, the <hi>Septimanes</hi> expire at the Fall of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If we interpret the Decree to be the Decree of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> with Bishop <hi>Hall, Constantine L' Emperour, &amp;c.</hi> and assign the first seven to the time of the cessation of Temple-work, betwixt the Decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great and <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> the middle of the last Week falls at our Saviours Passion, saith <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine L' Emporour (Annotationes in Paraphrasim</hi> Josephi Jachiade <hi>in</hi> Danie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem) and that upon probable Chronological Grounds, though out of the common Road.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If We begin the Account at the Decree of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon</hi> (assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first Septimane to the time of the Cities Walls lying ruinous) and follow the common Chronology from the Era's of <hi>Salmanasser,</hi> the <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> built, the last week's middle falls at our Saviour's Passion. See <hi>Functius, Perkins, Powel, Pontanus, Lydiat, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If with <hi>Scaliger, Mede, &amp;c.</hi> we interpret <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>[seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy City,]</hi> to import the duration of the Second Temple (which that clause does so manifestly, as every Child may perceive it; saith <hi>Scaliger, de emend. temp. l. 6. pag.</hi> 608.) and begin the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at the fixth year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> when the second Temple was finish'd; following the most commonly received Chronology, we shall find saith Master <hi>Meed</hi> (upon <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks) that in all probability the Second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's desolation fell out precisely on the very middle of the last Week of the Seventy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, If with Master <hi>Mede</hi> we make two <hi>Epochas</hi> in this Prophecy: the first of 70 Weeks beginning and ending with the Second Temple, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of 62 Weeks and two Half-weeks; that is, 63 Weeks, beginning at the going forth of the Commission granted to <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the middle of the last ending at our Saviour's Passion, we shall find an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Correspondency betwixt the Prophecy and the Accomplishment; and and that Christ's Ministry began at the last of these Weeks, and continued precisely 3 years and an half: <hi>vide Meed</hi> upon <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks.</p>
               <p>§ 4. The probability of which Conjecture appears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the bounds here fixed as to the beginning of this <hi>Epocha: [The going forth of a Command or Commission, to cause the Jews to return or reinhabit and to build: not the Temple (that part of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>whence in the former</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocha, <hi>of 70 Weeks, it is stiled the holy City) or some few houses only, but the whole</hi> Area, <hi>or Street, and the walls about it.]</hi> From such a Commission must
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43715:138"/>
this second Computation be reckon'd; and that not only granted (for then we must begin the account at <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, who by Decree built not only the Temple but the City: <hi>(Isaiah</hi> 44. 28.) but taking effect as the Angel explains the former in the later words, <hi>[the street shall be built, and the wall.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From the End or Period of this time, <hi>[unto Messiah the Prince;]</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>(Luk. 23. 2. Mar.</hi> 15. 32.) or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Angel stiles him: for the Angel in this Text was the Precentor to that Choire, and put that Name of Christ into the mouth of the Angel, that declared his Birth to the Shepherds; there being no Prophecy (but this) in all the Old Testament. where that Name is directly given; or whence it could be ascribed by the Jews unto him, they looked for: and therefore <hi>Jerom</hi> deservedly taxeth that Whimsey of <hi>Eusebius</hi> (touching his <hi>Christos duces)</hi> as a singularity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the Angel's note of Attention prefix'd: <hi>[also know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that from,</hi> &amp;c.] which as it speaks its passage to another Aera; so it implies that to be of more special note; the observation of that to be of more concern than the other; and that, not because it divides the gross Summ into parts (as some have thought;) but because, the Period there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of falling earlier than of the former, it will sooner be accomplish'd, and prevent (if diligently observed) men's suspending their believing in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> till they see the other fulfilled (in the Ruine of <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> and therefore, that before the accomplishment of the first Prophecy (that ends there) men might have time to look about them, and to provide for their own safety (against that time) by embracing him that was to come: the Angel assigns a shorter Period, that should terminate in the mean while (to wit) at the Death, Coronation, and Covenant-tendring of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah;</hi> that men, by the Calculation of the time of this Branch of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, being convinc'd and throughly perswaded, that he that was to come, was come; might (by getting into the Ark) avoid wrath to come, save themselves from that untoward Generation, that was to be swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with that flood and inundation of Judgments upon the unbelieving Jews.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the Duration of Time intervening <hi>[shall be seven weeks; and sixty two weeks,</hi> &amp;c.] that is (as Judicious Master <hi>Mede</hi> paraphraseth.) As from the building of the Temple, to its Destruction, there are to be many sevens of Weeks, even 70 Weeks; so from this After-<hi>Epocha</hi> (here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) to wit, the Commission to build the Walls, and reform the Laws; unto <hi>Messiah</hi> there shall be likewise sevens of Weeks; even 62 Weeks. So that 62 Weeks are the full Measure of that time, that shall intervene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those Terms; and the preceding Number [7 <hi>weeks]</hi> is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a part of that Time: but to be taken distributively. For the Hebrews wanting distributive or divisive Numbers, <hi>(terni quaterni, &amp;c.)</hi> supply their want thereof, most what, by Repetition, as <hi>septem septem;</hi> but not always; as may appear 2 <hi>Sam, 18. 4. [and all the people came out,</hi>

For multiply 62 Weeks of years, <hi>i. e.</hi> 434 years, by 11. which is the overplus of Days in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, beyond what the Lunar Year hath (that consisting of 365, this, but of 354 Days) and the Product will be 4774 Days; which divided by 365, the Quotient will be 13 Years, and the Remainder 29 Days: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other number of Weeks but 62 can (possibly) be pitch'd upon; in whose compass, the difference betwixt Solar and Lunar Years will not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceed, or come short of 13. the space of these two Commissions: which admirable Concordance cannot be ascribed to Chance, but to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, so ordering it, that these two Commissions might (in point of Chronology) be one and the same: For there are as many Lunar Years from <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Commission (in the 20) as there are Solar from <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s (in the 7 of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon)</hi> unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> to wit, 434. He that cannot see what is the Angel's mind, by the help of this confederate Light both of Sun and Moon, he that misseth it, in measuring the time here specified; when 'tis so manifestly lined out by the Courses of both those Luminaries, which God hath set in the Firmament for Signs and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: must be a person either of so low a Capacity or strong Prejudice; as renders him uncapable of learning what he knows not, or of unlearning what he has been mis-taught: and therefore here is the end of my Travel to give such wayward Idiots satisfaction. To them that are piously, or but humanely disposed, the Demonstration of the accomplishment of the Angel's Prophecy, upon our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> will be evidence sufficient of the truth of it; for which I refer them to the excellent Treatise of Mr. <hi>Meed</hi> upon <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks.</p>
               <p>To be sure, none of these forenamed Prophecies can receive accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any other; as <hi>Origen</hi> told <hi>Celsus</hi> his Jew, affirming that many Phanaticks (who said they were the <hi>Messias)</hi> alledged the Prophets appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableness to them, as well as to Jesus; <hi>(lib. 1. calum.</hi> 24.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles in framing the Gospel so, as the History of it jumps thus exactly (in point of Chronology) with these Prophetick Weeks: wherein they present Christ's Passion, and the Preaching of the Gospel falling out,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43715:140"/>
at the very points of Time prefix'd so long before; and give us an account of Christ's foretelling the Fall of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the time allotted by <hi>Daniel</hi> (which accordingly took effect.) This (I say) speaks them to have been Men in Understanding; that, of that Understanding, whereby they were led, there is no number <hi>(Psal.</hi> 147. 4, 5.) that they who could thus find out Number, had found out Wisdom <hi>(Eccles.</hi> 7. 25.) Wisdom it self joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together Number and Wisdom as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes out of those Texts, <hi>(de libero arbitr. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8.)</p>
               <p>§ 5. No less applicable to any but our Jesus are those Prophecies of <hi>Haggai; (cap. 2. 7.) [The desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory:] [The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the glory of the former.] (Malachy, 3. 1.)

               </p>
               <p>That this Prophecy denotes the coming of the <hi>Messias;</hi> is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Jews, but manifest from the whole series of the Texts.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

That he was the Expectation of the Jews, is clear, from the Question of <hi>John</hi>'s Disciples <hi>[Art thou be that should come, or do we look for another?]</hi> from <hi>John</hi>'s Hearers being in an expectation and a muse, whether he were the Christ or not: <hi>(Luk.</hi> 3.) by the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>'s Speech to our Saviour <hi>[we know that the Messiah cometh, and when he cometh he will tell us all things:]</hi> from the Rulers sending to Christ, to enquire; whether he were not he that was to come? and from that posture wherein the Religious stood at Christ's Birth <hi>[waiting for the consolation of Israel,]</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by <hi>Simeon</hi>'s Revelation, to be the Lord's Christ, and that in their waiting for him, they expected to see him come into the Temple, is as clear, from <hi>Hannah</hi>'s waiting for him there, and from Christ's Brethren advising him to go up to the Feast, if he had a mind to be acknowledged for the Christ.</p>

               <p n="3">3. From his explaining, how the Glory of this should be greater than the Glory of that; <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by his exhibiting himself in it, and filling it with Glory. For, in all other things, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Temple transcended this; being so far superiour to it, in point of Magnificence, as the old men who had seen that, wept bitterly at the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundations of this; as not taking up an equal proportion of ground; for that was all the then apparent difference betwixt them:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43715:140"/>
                  <hi>[ampliore ambitu &amp; huic conveniente celsitudine, Joseph.]</hi> though had they lived to see the Top-stone laid, that would have renewed and augmented their grief (if their Hope, grounded on this Prophecy, had not suppressed it:) for it was as much inferiour to the other in height, as in breadth (full 60 Cubits as <hi>Herod</hi> the great told them. <hi>[Templo huic desunt ad priscam altitudinem 60 cubita:] (Jos.</hi> 15. 14.) It's true indeed, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Herod</hi> pull'd down this Second Temple, and built another answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> both in Circuit and Height: but as this was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted another Temple from the Second (by reason, not only that the same Utensils, were in that he built, as were in that he pull'd down; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did not quite pull down the Second <hi>(Vossii Chron. Sacra;)</hi> for <hi>Josephus (Antiq.</hi> 15. 14.) tells us, that the Tower of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> (by name) was only repair'd and built higher; and so (doubtless) were other parts of the Temple, that were strong enough to bear his Superstructures, and did not stand in his way to straiten the Circuit.) I humbly conceive, that <hi>Josephus</hi> his saying, that <hi>Herod</hi> pull'd down the Foundations of the old Temple, is commonly stretch'd too far beyond his meaning; which is no more than this; the Out-side being corroded by the Teeth of Time, especially in the upper part of the Wall (that being most weather-bearen) he did not only lay new Stones, in the room of the decayed ones, upon those that were found (as the repairers of Bow-steeple did after the Fire:) But pull'd down the out side of the Wall with the very Foundation; and at that end where he lengthen'd it, the whole Wall and its Foundation was demolish'd. But to pull down the Inside, that was as good as hands could make it: (except where it hindred his enlargement of the Length;) as it would have been a fruitless expence, so I question, whether the Jews would have permitted it; and more how we shall maintain that House, into which the Desire of all Nations came, to have been the Second House, if we have no better Foundations to build upon than those of <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s laying: <hi>(Joseph. ant.</hi> 15. 14.) So notwithstanding all these costly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs; which God, in his gracious Providence, put <hi>Herod</hi> upon (he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making out that Propriety he here challengeth in Silver and Gold: <hi>[the silver is mine, and the gold is mine]</hi> and providing for the more august enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the <hi>Messias</hi> therein.) This second never grew up to the state of the first: for beside that 20 Cubits of the height (by the yielding of the Foundation) fell, by that time <hi>Herod</hi> had finish'd his Repairs; the first was inlaid with Gold, thence stiled Gold; <hi>[How is the gold become dim, the most fine gold changed;] (Lament.) [The stones of the sanctuary are powred out]</hi> (by melting) as if they had been all Gold: the second had only golden Doors, which set <hi>Titus</hi> his Souldiers Teeth a watering after the plunder of the Temple; supposing it had been within all of one piece: but they found it only cover'd with Silver; <hi>(Joseph. B. J.</hi> 7. 9.) Much less did it equal the first in internal Endowments and spiritual Privileges (as the Rabbies say;) the First being filled with a Cloud at its Dedication, having its Altar-fire kindled from Heaven, the Ark of the Covenant with all its appurtenances, the holy Oyl, the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, &amp;c.</hi> as the Jews themselves say: From their Concessions therefore we assume, that these Glories of the First were not in the Second, till Christ (in whom the Godhead dwells bodily; in whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom; that precious Corner-stone; anointed with the Oyl of gladness, above his fellows) presented in his own Person, the Substance of all those in that Temple: in respect of which his coming into it, and honouring it with his blessed presence, it exceeded the former House in Glory, the coming in of this King of Glory hath lift up the Gates of the Second Temple, in Glory, above the first. <hi>[Rex gloriae, id est, Arca, quia super eam habitabat Dominus gloriae inter Cherubim.]</hi> When the Ark removed, <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>Arise,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43715:141"/>
O Lord,</hi> and when it stood still, he said, <hi>Return, O Lord; (R. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid in Psal. 24.) Aben Ezra</hi> observes, that by that Repetition is intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the coming of the Ark into the First, and restoring the Ark (the true Ark of God's presence) unto the Second Temple, by the coming of the <hi>Messias:</hi> who is therefore called (in the later answer) <hi>[the Lord of Hosts,]</hi> without the addition of <hi>[mighty in battail,]</hi> because in the Reign of Christ men are to learn War no more <hi>(Is.</hi> 2.)</p>
               <p>§ 6. But where is now this Second House that the Prophet points at (and even toucheth with his Finger) in this Prophecy? is it not long since laid in the dust, and made so desolate, that Travellers by, can discern no sign, that ever there was any such Fabrick?

It is absolutely impossible, it should be fill'd with Glory, now that 'tis emptied of its self, of its very Being and Existence, I know the Jews expect the rising of this <hi>Phaenix</hi> out of its ashes, and dream of a Third House; wherein this Prophecy shall receive its accomplishment: <hi>[in domo tertiâ stabunt ad honorem Dei in aeternum:] (Aben Ezra, in Psal.</hi> 24.)</p>
               <p>But 1. The Comparison here (in point of Glory) is betwixt <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple (called the First House) and this of the return'd Captives build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, called the Later House.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Say a Temple should again be erected in the place of this, it would not be this the Prophet speaks of, any more than this, was that which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> erected; but another (a Third House) essentially differing from this Second: for as this was called the Second House, because that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s was utterly destroyed and brought to annihilation by the Babilonians, and this built anew from the lowest Foundation; <hi>[The hands of Zorobabel
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43715:141"/>
have laid the foundation of this house:]</hi> this word (saith <hi>Isidore Peleusiota)</hi> of <hi>[laying the foundation]</hi> demonstrates, that the Babylonians, had razed the Foundation of the former <hi>(Epist. lib. 4. epist.</hi> 17.) So it being as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the Romans have not left one stone upon another, in this House; whatever House shall be built upon the Premisses, will be a new House, and specifically different from it, the Second being never to have a new birth as the same <hi>Isidore</hi> saith: [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. After such ploughing, the Jew hath no ground to hope for such a Crop: for the Prophets stile this <hi>[the last]</hi> and, that which is to continue for ever; that is, the ever of their Law: and that wherein the Sons of <hi>Aarou</hi> shall stand ministring, during the limited Eternity of Mosaical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: till <hi>Messiah</hi> comes and renews all things, makes all old things pass away, introduces a new World, a new Heaven, and new Earth: [<gap reason="foreign">

And therefore <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Reply to the Jewish Priests (suing for their Lives, after their Temple was sack'd) was more pertinent, and pat to the Idiom of the Old Testament, than (I believe) he was aware of: when he told them, that now their Temple was gone, it was fit they should perish with it; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become wholly useless Creatures; that being destroyed, for whose sake only, they could desire to live: <hi>(Joseph.

               </p>
               <p>These Arguments are commonly urged to prove the Divinity of our Religion; and they might pass for good <hi>Mediums</hi> still, in that Question; were not our modern Atheists grown to that degree of Ingenuity, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving their own everlasting perdition; as to put in all Exceptions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable against the Evidences, brought for the Probate of the Common Salvation, and the Way to it (the Common Faith.) I have therefore so far gratified the delicate Scepticism, the versatile Wit of these Pretenses; as to draw no other Conclusion from these Premisses, but this: That the Apostles were men of sound Intellects, and not such silly Animals as they deem them. And seriously, if they deny me the Validity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will very much impair the Repute the World hath of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as men of Reason, and dis-enable themselves of all possibility of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indication of their own Wit: For if the Apostles notwithstanding their contriving the Gospel in such an admirable Compliance with whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, venerable, (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers esteemed Virtue) whatsoever things are just, pure, lovely, of good report, whatsoever things can be thought on as praise-worthy <hi>(Phil.</hi> 4. 8, 9.) (all which the Apostle affirms, the Philippians had learned, and received, and heard, and seen in him) must still pass for Fools: do they not teach the World to think themselves such, for all their witty contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plays and Romances. <hi>Sophocles</hi> was accused by his Children to have been grown into Dotage; but absolved by the Judges (when he produc'd a Tragedy which he then made) saying, Is this the work of a man besides himself? Good God! must he that can make five Acts of a Comedy hang together (and yet not all out so exactly, but that he is forc'd (ever and anon) to call down some God upon the Stage, to help his Invention at a dead lift) be writ A WITT With a double <hi>W,</hi> and double <hi>T,</hi> and a great <hi>A;</hi> and those men presented as Fools, that acted upon the Stage of the great World, that have made Mercy and Truth meet together, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Peace kiss each other; that have made all the Results of true Reason and Religion, that were in the World before them, scrape acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43715:142"/>
with, and take knowledg of one another; and, by joynt consent, do obeysance to Christian Philosophy. Shall the Fame of those Scavinger-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions go rumbling like a Wheel-barrow, that can scrape together the Obscenities of <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> the Impieties of <hi>Lucian,</hi> and lay their Dung on orderly heaps, before the Noses of their applauding Spectators: who, as also <hi>Alcaeus</hi> writ their Poems when they were drunk, saith <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in his <hi>Dipnosoph. lib.</hi> 9.) And the memories of these be turned into the silent Grave (with the Burial of an Ass) who have gather'd all the Daisies and Lillies of the Vallies (the natural Emanations of every vulgar Soul) all the rarer Flowers of the best cultivated Gardens (of the most refined and abstruse Philosophy) and bound them into one Posie, a Nosegay for the Bride of the King of Kings! Shall the more civilized Atheist (for the Steam of that Augean Stable, where those neighing Stone-horse-men stand; of that Hog-sty, where <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Herd wallow, does almost stifle me, and I hasten out of it) be stroak'd upon the head (as a person of a deep reach) who can frame his maximes of State sutable to theirs in St. <hi>Austin: [Nolunt stare rempublicam firmitate virtutum, sed impuritate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum:] (August. Volusiano, ep.</hi> 3.) to the humours of the half-witted Vulgar, of one Age, of one Province; and by temporizing therewith, keep the Cart on Wheels for a while; that is, till the Team find the Reins loose upon their Necks, and an opportunity of bringing the Wheel over their ungodly Drivers: for when the Horse comes to find his own strength (and he will quickly learn that if he be not kept in with Bit and Bridle) off goes his Rider: and give me leave to give our modern Statists this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; that there are a Generation of men in the World, that are subject not for Conscience sake, but Fear; and with these no Governour shall be longer good, than he has power over them, and they awed from calling him all to nought. Shall then (I say) these Tinker-Machiavilians (who in stopping one hole make two) pass for great Head-pieces? And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles be reputed to have had heads no better than that, which the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key played with in the Carver's Shop, who have laid down such an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Model of Polity; so fitted to the universal, eternal, Rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; so perfectly complacential to the Dictates of all men; so exactly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Superiours and Inferiours, in all Ranks, of all sorts, to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bounds and Vocations: as it is impossible for any State, Kingdome, Empire, Corporation, Family, not to prosper and flourish under the due observation of it; or to subsist, under the neglect of it (execpt it be in judgment to themselves or others.) <hi>[Advertit</hi> Plato <hi>in omni sermone suo de reipublicae institutione proposito, infundendum animis justitiae amorem: sine qua non solum Respublica, sed nec exiguus hominum caetus, nec domus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem parva constabit:] (Macrobius in Som.

               <p>Shortly; say the Gospel be a Fable, it is the most profitable one that ever was devised, and the most cunningly devised, that ever was shown to the World; and shown to the World at its Age of best Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd doubtless nothing can hinder any man in his wits, from giving assent to this Proposition; That the Framers of the Gospel were Persons endowed with Reason. But then the Atheist puts in this Bar, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own and others Belief: That Christianity, possibly may have been lick'd into this form, wherein the Scripture presents it, after the Age of the Apostles, by such Politicians, as conceived it a good Epedient to keep men in Order, out of an awe and reverence of Religion.</p>
               <p>For the removal of this Scruple, I shall prove in this third Book; That we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43715:144"/>
have as good Grounds of assurance, that the Matters of Fact and Doctrine, contain'd in the Gospel, were done and delivered by Christ and his Apostles; as we have (or can have) of any other (the most certain and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) Relation in the World.</p>
               <p>Though we (who live at this great distance from the Time, wherein those Occurrences fell out) are so far disadvantaged, as 'tis scarce to be hoped that obstinate and captious Gain-sayers, who hate the Gospel for its Holiness and Strictness, will acquiess in the clearest Demonstration we can lay before them: <hi>[Necsi solem quidem ipsum gestemus in manibus, fidem accomodabunt ei doctrinae, quae illos jubet,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>(Lactantius de divino praemio, l. p. c. 1) Debaucht persons will not yield assent to a Doctrine that commands Holiness, Justice and Temperance, though for demonstration of the truth of it, we should carry in our hands the Sun it self.</hi> Before I make my defence (saith <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus) (lib. 1. calum.</hi> 23.) let me premise this; That to vindicate the Truth of any History, though never so true, is a matter of exceeding difficulty; and in some cases impossible. If a man be frowardly bent to deny, that the Grecians fought with the Trojans; that <hi>Oedipus</hi> married his Mother <hi>Jocasta,</hi> &amp;c. there's no convincing of him: there's no remedy against the biting of a Sycophant: Yet the abovesaid disadvantage, hath this convenience attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; that it necessitates us to the use of soberness of Mind, in seeking and receiving satisfaction: For the things in question being done many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before us, it were the highest act of unreasonableness imaginable, to expect or demand any other grounds of satisfaction, than such as all men, (that are not besides themselves, and incapacitated for rational Discourse) in all other the like cases acquiess in, without the least hesitancy; that is, Universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is of that force, as to leave all wise men as much assured of those Matters, that are so communicated to them, as of those they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are eye-witnesses of. I can no more force my self out of an assurance, that there were such men as <hi>Caesar, Pompey, Alexander;</hi> such Cities as <hi>Troy, Carthage, Jerusalem;</hi> than I can perswade my self to believe, that I am not now writing. Nay, I should sooner be brought to doubt of this than that: for I may perhaps (for this once) be but in a Dream; but that the whole World of Authentick Historians, (who have conveighed the Tradition of those things to us) should dream waking, for so many Successions of Ages, bids that manifest defiance to Reason and common Sence: as I must grow blind on both these eyes, before I can swallow that Flie.</p>
               <p>When I sift my Mind to find out the bottom of this invincible Assurance, such thoughts as these comes to hand: It is not any way my own Interest that byasseth me; whether there ever were any such Men or Cities, or no, <hi>(mihi nec seritur, nec metitur)</hi> I am no way concern'd in it; I cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly discover the least Atom of self, in my tenacious (and even obstinate) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to such Propositions. It must be therefore some pure Beam of refined Reason, by which I clime up, to this degree of Confidence: I take up, and hold to, these Conclusions, meerly as a Man, as a reasonable Creature; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out circumstantiating my self with those moveable, those separable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; of poor, of rich, wise, foolish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But find all Men, in all Ages since, have (with one mouth) either reported, or assented (by their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) to these Stories; and <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei, The common vote of Man-kind, is the voice of God:</hi> If I deny the validity of such Testimony, I banish all humane Converse out of the World.</p>
               <p>It may here perhaps be objected; that, in these cases, we suffer our Reason to be captivated to the general Vogue, by slender presumptions; and because we may, without any considerable detriment, ride with the stream, we are willing to save our selves the labour of rowing against it: but in Matters of so high a Concern (as Religion) Prudence should dictate to us the use of more Caution, than to be born down with the Current.</p>
               <p>But what we take up (in trust of the Publick Faith) upon such Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Testimonies, is not credulously imbraced, but forceth it self upon us with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43715:144"/>
main force of common Reason (I was almost saying) of demonstration; for else these Confidences might possibly be dismounted. If these assurances were not built upon the firmest Grounds, they might be undermined: if they were not mann'd and garrison'd by the strongest Reason, other Reasons might enforce to a surrender, as we see it daily happens in questions <hi>de Jure,</hi> and all Propositions built upon articifial Arguments. A man may be perswaded of the Truth of the Affirmative to day, and to morrow be confident of the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if that come arm'd (to his thinking) with better Reasons. But now in Matters of Fact, delivered by the Universal Tradition of those that were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, we cannot acquit our selves of the belief of them; we cannot extricate our selves out of those Chains that are clapt upon our judgement, by the most <hi>Proteus-</hi>like change thereof, though into an hundred forms and shapes. Let one (for instance) that upon such an account is perswaded, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth is dead, try if he can writhe himself out of the belief of it, by all the versatile windings, which the most serpentine invention can prompt; if he can hale that Conceipt out of his Mind, with a whole Team of the strongest Arguments he can yoak together: he will find he labours as much in vain, as the Sea-men did, in their attempts to bring the Vessel that was freighted with the reputed Mother of the Gods to shore, after she was faln a ground. The Hair-lace of the vestal (though under a suspition of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency) did more than all their Cables could. But in our Case the single twine of current Tradition (the votary of the never-dying Flame, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of the immortal Memory of things past) will draw the mind to a full irreversible Assent, against all contrary halings of the Cart-ropes of artificial Reasonings; notwithstanding our jealousies of a possibility of Error, or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. Nay, Universal Testimony forces the belief of those things upon us, which we would not believe, could we any way baffle the Evidence; when it informs us of the death of Friends, of the defeating of our Armys, of the loss of our Garrisons, of the sinking of our richly-laden and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-bound Vessels, (though we could wish to keep St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of not believing, till we see and handle the truth of those Relations, though we put in an hundred caveats of hope, that its otherwise) yet there's no resisting the evidences of such a Testimony: It lays our tatter'd Ships, our dismembred Soldiers, the pale-fac'd Corps of our Relations (though at ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great a local distance from us) so manifestly before us, as we cannot but hear their dying groans, handle their wounds, and see them laid out: In this Magick Glass we behold our Sea-men pinion'd, our Goods rifled, our Tackling torn, our Masts floating; and whatever we would not see nor hear, as sensibly as feelingly, as if we were upon the place.</p>
               <p>It begets in us a belief of (otherwise) most unlikely, incredible things; of such occurrences, as without this, all the Reason imaginable could not have perswaded us to assent to. Abstract <hi>Caligula</hi>'s causing the way to be swept from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Belgium,</hi> before that Army, wherewith he furiously charged the Sea, from that Reason, which the Currency of that History commends it with to our Belief; and then should we muster up all the <hi>Mediums</hi> in <hi>Aristotles</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks to assail and conquer our Minds to a perswasion; That a person ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to such honour, in so wise a State, might possibly be so pompously mad, as to play such freaks: or that those Sons of <hi>Mars</hi> (at whose prowess the World trembl'd) should be such tame Fools, as to be commanded (by him) to play such Munkey-tricks; the issue would shew that to be as vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a Charge upon our Judgements, as his was against the Ocean. But yet the Validity of the Historical Testimony hath (in spight of all unlikelyhood) gain'd Universal Credit for these Stories.</p>
               <p>It was Heresie at <hi>Rome</hi> (a while ago) to assert there were <hi>Antipodes;</hi> the Mathematicks (those demonstrative Sciences) could not convince the sacred Colledge, but that men must fall into the skie, if their feet were opposite to ours: The Books that made offer to make proof thereof, by the strongest Reasons imaginable, were (as heretical) committed to the devouring Flames.

And in a more knowing Age this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Earths globous Form was derided by <hi>Lactantius [est quispiam tam ineptus qui credat homines esse, quorum vestigia sunt superiora quam capita? aut ibi quae apud nos jaceat Universa pendere? fruges &amp; arbores deorsùm versùs crescere, pluvias, &amp; nives, &amp; grandinem, sursùm versús cadere in terram? &amp; mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur aliquis hortos pensiles inter septem mira narrare, quum philosophi, &amp; agros, &amp; maria, &amp; urbes, &amp; montes pensiles faciunt?]</hi> with more shew of Reason than can be brought against the Evangelical History <hi>(Instituti, lib. 3. cap. 24.) Can any man be so egregious a fool as to think that there are men who walk with their feet higher than their heads? or a place where such things as here lay upon the ground, hangs in the Air? that Plants grow with their tops downwards: that Rain, Snow and Hail fall upwards upon the earth? why should we wonder at the pensil Gardens of</hi> Babylon, <hi>one of the seven wonders of the World; seeing Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers make pensil Fields, Walls, Cities and Mountains.</hi> But I presume (for all this show of reason to the contrary) men are now as verily perswaded that the Earth is round, and that there are <hi>Antipodes,</hi> as they are, that there is an Heaven What hath conquer'd them to this belief? have better Reasons been laid before them? none but this of Universal Tradition: Since the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Navigation, men daily make voyages thither, and learn by the report of the Inhabitants of that lower Hemisphere, that that part of the World is not grown up of late (as a bunch upon the back of ours) but of as long a standing as it: and hence springs the undoubted confidence of its Existence now, and its Pre-existence to our knowledge and discovery.</p>
               <p>§ 2. To the other part of the Objection I make this twofold reply.</p>
               <p>1. In our present Case we are out of danger of receiving damage by being over-credulous: were that Testimony, which commends to my Belief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-matters of Fact, less credible than it is; my acquiescing therein would be transcendently advantageous, but no way possibly prejudicial: a Report goeth abroad, that some great Prince (upon the motion of his Son, who by certain condescentions has promerited the King's favour for them) hath sent out his Declaration to his Subjects; wherein he proclaims liberty to Captives tenders to those that will embrace his Son, and deport themselves as becomes Men, advancement to the highest honours; and menaceth to such, as will not by such inducements be reclaim'd from a bestial Life, the most exquisite Tortures that can be invented by abused Love: who but short-reason'd Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots would be over-curious, too nice in believing such a Report? which if it prove true, he is made, that conforms to it; he undone, that does not: however, the Terms are but reasonable, complying therewith (at present) prefers a man to the Lordship of himself, (and he's put to no expence, but what he may well disburse out of that Lordship) and for the future he is in a more promising way to Happiness, than any other course he can stere can bring him to. <hi>Hereto</hi> assents to that of divine <hi>Plato: (Phaedone;)</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>If these things</hi> (touching the happiness of the Soul in a state of seperation) <hi>which I say be true, we shall do our selves a pleasure by believing them, but if there remain nothing either of a man or for a man, when he is dead; yet however the Contemplation of these things will make my present life more comfortable.</hi> To which is a kin that of <hi>Cicero; (Tusculan) preclarum autem nescio quid adepti sunt, quod didicerunt se, cùm tempus mortis venisset, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos esse perituros: quod ut it à sit (nihil enim pugno) quid habet ista res aut laeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile aut gloriosum? They think they have obtain'd an excellent point when they have learn'd that by death they will be wholly dissolved: say it were so, what is there in this thing either joyous os glorious?</hi> All the danger here lies on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, in not believing: hereby we may possibly incur the pain threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; to be sure, lose the reward promised: but what detriment can we sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by embracing the Gospel, save of a little beastly Pleasure of Sin for a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43715:145"/>
season? What danger can we become obnoxious to, but a little suffering, for as short a season? which yet will be recompenced, an hundred fold, even in this Life, not only with the Hope of the Recompence of Reward, which made the Martyrs rejoyce more when they were condemned, than when absolved, <hi>[Magis damnati quàm absoluti gaudemus. (Tert. ad scapul. cap.</hi> 1.) Nay, such were the expressions of the Märtyrs Joys under the most painful sufferings, as made whole multitudes of Christians offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without summons, to Pagan Tribunals, there to receive the sentence of Death: insomuch as <hi>Tertullian</hi> urgeth <hi>Scapula</hi> to forethink what he would do with so many thousands of Men, Women and Children, as in <hi>Carthage</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd the Gospel, if they should offer themselves to him to be crowned with Martyrdom, as the Christians in <hi>Asia</hi> had done to <hi>Arrius Antoninus. (Id. Ib.)</hi> Sufferings, I say, for righteousness sake will be counterballanced, not only by the Contemplation of future Glory, but with the peace of Conscience, and the calm quiet of a Mind, not conscious to its self of any base Act, or Disposition unworthy of Man. And when we die, suppose the Gospel should prove a Fable, as that Pope, unworthy of name, stiled it <hi>(quantum nobis profuit haec de Christo fabula!)</hi> yet our having observed the Rules of it, will put us into a fairer capacity of Happiness in the other World, than the Rules of any other Religion, than our following the conduct of our bruitish Lusts, and untamed Passions can (in common sence) be presumed to do. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if Man exist after death, his having habituated himself to the life of Man, to intellectual Pleasure, (on this side of it) must render the Life of Reason (and that's the lowest degree of life we can be imagin'd there to live) more familiar, more complacential, and satisfactory on that side of it. If Man's proper and peculiar Felicity stand in his enjoyment of Communion with God (as it must do if there be a God, for to desire the possession of the very best, is a Quality radically adhering to an humane Soul) certainly our inuring our selves to Acquaintance with him, and Conformity to him here, must make way for our more clear beatifical Vision of him, and Converse with him hereafter: Should then our Christian Faith prove Credulity; yet that Credulity will prove our Wisdom, our way to Happiness: and therefore is not so much to be feared in our case, as the Objection implies. Be it an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, 'tis the happiest and most profitable Error, that Mankind can possibly fall into, though many men (saith <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus)</hi> are set free from the slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their own Passions, from the <hi>Colluvies</hi> and filthy slud of beastly Vices? how many have got their savage Manners tamed and charmed, upon occasion of hearing the Gospel preach'd? which (if we were wise) we would with all thankfulness embrace; were it but for this, that it is so soveraign and compendious a Remedy of all Vice: we should give it our grace and approbation to pass, if not as true, yet as most advantageous to humane kind. <hi>(lib. 1. cal. 30.)—[Et probanda si non ut vera, certè ut humano generi utilis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima—]</hi> The truth is, all the hurt that the VVorld has received by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, is the turning of Beasts into Men, and Men into Heroes and petty Gods: and all the benefit it reaps by rejecting the Precepts of it, and sipping the Circean cup of Atheism, is the transmuting of Men into Lyons, Tigers, VVolves, Hoggs, Harpies, Ravens, and as many kinds of wilde Beasts, and unclean Birds, as enterd <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark: Iniquity and injustice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man hath ever attended Impiety towards God. <hi>Dionisius</hi> the Atheist, after he had rob'd <hi>Jupiter</hi> of his golden Robe, as being too heavy for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, too cold for VVinter; <hi>Aesculapius</hi> of his golden Beard as not becoming the Son to wear, while his Father was beardless; and spoil'd the Temples of what was worth taking away, and made sale of his sacrilegious Booties, commanded those that bought them, to restore every man the things he had bought within a set day to the Temples, whence they were stoln: <hi>[ità ad impietatem in Deos, in homines adjunxit injuriam.] Haud unquam tulit docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta sors majora—</hi>Never was more feeling Proofs given of this sad Truth than this Age hath produced; nor can a clearer demonstration be made of any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43715:146"/>
thing, than the Primitive Times made of the Truth of the former Branch; when the Discipline of Christianity bound its Professors, to the keeping of the Peace, to a modest, meek, and good behaviour of Heart, Tongue, and Hand, towards all men, under the greatest temptation to the contrary, that the bloodiest Persecution could suggest; though the sufferers were the more numerous party almost in every City. <hi>[Ex disciplina patientiae divinae agere nos satis manifestum esse vobis potest, cùm tanta hominum multitudo, pars penè major civitatis cujus<expan>

When they could maintain that <hi>[nunquam vel</hi> Nigriani, <hi>vel</hi> Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani, <hi>vel</hi> Cassiani <hi>inveniri potuerunt Christiani] (Tert. ad scap. c. 2.)

Of the same importance is that of Rab. <hi>David Chimchi</hi> (in <hi>Ps. 1. 3. 4.) [Mundus documentum à viro bono recipit, per umbram viarum, &amp; fructum operum ejus, non sic impii: nullum commodum per eos venit, sed dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, velut gluma per ventum in occulos hominum pulsa, vel super hortos &amp; domos cadit (Vicars Decupla.) The World receiveth good Instruction from a good man (grown good by meditating in Gods Law) by the Tract of his Ways, by the Fruit of his Works: But as for the ungodly, it is not so; there is no benefit to be reapt of them, but incommodity; they are like the Chaff which the Wind scatters, and beats into mens eyes to afflict them; or into Gardens and Houses to annoy, to foul and disfigure humane Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Reply</hi> 2. Though humane Testimony (in Religious Matters) be the feeblest of all Arguments, to prove or disprove the Truth of Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, or the goodness of things done, yet it is of as much validity to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the delivery of Doctrine, the Doing of such Things, in this case, as in any other: we must not (indeed) so much as admit it into the Juries Chamber, much less into the Judges Seat, to give sentence, what is <hi>de jure:</hi> but yet it must be allowed, even in the Lords Courts (a place among the Witnesses) to declare what it knows <hi>de facto;</hi> to give in evidence, whether the Action un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate was done or not: whether an Action be legal or criminal, is the Judges Office to declare; but whether the Actions which are brought before him were done or no, is the Witnesses Office to discover. If the question be, What Doctrine was delivered hy Christ, <hi>Moses, Mahomet?</hi> what Orations were writ by <hi>Tully?</hi> what Poems by <hi>Homer?</hi> humane Testimony, and undoubted Tradition must umpire this: but if it be, what-like Doctrine, Orations, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, those are? Reason (regulated by the Maximes of every such Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whose subject is under debate) must cast the scales, and determine that Controversie. Reason (I say) may and must be exercised about Religion, in discerning the true from the false: we must not chuse our Religion, as men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43715:146"/>
draw lots, unseen: nor as Children, in that <hi>Libian</hi> Province, where women were promiscuously and in common frequented, drew Fathers, each of them taking him for Father, to whom in a great assembly chance, or instinct directed their first steps <hi>(Herodot)</hi> He that's a Christian, but perchance, may perchance be no better than no Christian, the blessed Jesus is well content, that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who deal with him, should see his Ware, before they buy. Indeed that God should endow our Souls with Reason, and make us differ from Brutes, only that we might rule them and not our selves; in what highliest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us; that he should put a golden Mattock into our hands, on purpose that we should digg Dung hills; and not rather, for hid Treasure, that he should communicate to us a Ray of the invisible World, only that we may contemplate the visible, and employ that Light (that Candle of the Lord) in the search of things, only on this side of Eternity, hath not the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity with that <hi>Decorum,</hi> observ'd by him in all his Works, which are fram'd in Number, Weight and Order. And those Morning Stars, which the Divine Goodness hath fixed in the Orb of our body, are (from the height of their Native Heaven) faln into the lowest Abyss of Reptile-spiritedness; if they be content with, and submit to such drudgery, such Gally-slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; and not exert their noblest Powers, upon the noblest Objects, in the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God, and the way to the eternal Possession of him. In which Case though we make it Reasons duty, to judge of the Religion which is true; yet we set not Reason above the true, but only the Unreasonableness of the false. The King of <hi>France</hi> set not <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Acres</hi> (that holy Maid of <hi>France,</hi> as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Rebel-covenanters stiled that their Enthusiastick Sister) as a Judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himself; nor our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth (of glorious memory) the Cardinal and his guests over himself: when they put them to it, to judge which of those Gallants was the of King <hi>France?</hi> which of these Guisers was the King of <hi>England?</hi> Reason may (without the least suspition of usurping the Office of a Divider, or the Authority of a Judge over him) determine which is the King in a crowd of Guisers; provided, that when she has discover'd him, she give him the Chair of State. I mean Reason in her Debates about the true Religion (after she hath, by Principles of common Sence, discover'd it to be of divine Revelation; from those manifest Impresses of its sacred Original it brings with it into the World) must be regulated by Maximes of that, now acknowledged, heavenly Science. We allow her to walk round about <hi>Sion,</hi> to mark well the Bull-warks, and count her Towers: but in judging of their Strength or Comeliness, she must not walk by the exotick, and forreign Rules of inferiour Sciences, but by the Domestick Principles of that Architectonick Art, the Municipal Laws of that holy State: while she sojourns in the City of God, she must conform to the Customs thereof. That may be a good Reason in one Science, that's a grand Solecism in another. The Asses adjudging the Palm to the Cuckow, from the Nightingal, was therefore absurd; because it was not grounded upon Principles of Musick (the Art wherein they strove for preheminency) had he past the same Sentence (upon the same reason he did that) in case of contest betwixt two publick Criers, the Determination would have been grave, substantial, and becoming a wiser A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal.</p>
               <p>But to return from this Digression: Humane Testimony, (as to Matters of Fact) touching Religion, is of as much validity, as in any other Subject. For although the Actions relate to Religion, they are not reported under that consideration; but barely as Actions that have past over the Stage of the World: and, as such, the Spectators are as competent Judges of them, as of any that are brought before them. All that is demanded of Tradition is, whether it saw Christ and his Apostles doing such things? whether it heard them deliver such Doctrines? or what it ever heard or saw tending to the disproof of that Relation? we call her not to pass judgement upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Quality of either Words or Works; we summon her to do the part of an Historian, not Commentator: And what hinders but that she may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43715:147"/>
us in this, as well as in any other Case? were not Christs Actions as visible as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, his Words as audible as <hi>Cicero's?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. Having thus stated the Question, and assigned to the Witnesses what we expect from them, as to the Resolution of it, we will call them in, and take their depositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Had we nothing to produce but those almost numberless Copies, and Translations of the Text into most of the Languages of the anciently<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known World; those Cart-loads of Commentators, Paraphrasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the Text (all agreeing in substance, and out of which we may with facility gather, not only the Matter, but the very Words (and every Word) of the Gospels) this would be a full-measure Proof, that the Books of the New Testament, as they stand now in the sacred Canon, are as faithful a Repository of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, as any Writings whatsoever can be of the Subjects contain'd in them. This would be a better Evidence (for instance) that the History and Doctrine therein contain'd is the genuine Off-spring of those whose Names they bear, than any man living can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, to prove that the Books going under the Names of <hi>Virgil, Horace, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> are those mens Works, whose Names they bear: That the Deeds and Conveighances whereby he holds his Estate, are those mens Deeds whose Names and Seals are affixt to them: or that he is that Man's Child, whom he calls Father. This comes near enough to the state of the Question: and one would think it concern'd the VVorld to repute that Generation of men the bane of Mankind, who with their insociable infusions of Suspitions into mens Heads (that possible it might be otherwise) deprive all men, Princes and Peasants, of power to make a rational Proof of their Title to what they hold from their Ancestors, as their Heirs at Law: And the Sceptick cannot in reason expect a more satisfactory Answer to his Misprisions, than such like as <hi>Plutarch</hi> (in his Apothegms) reports <hi>Cicero</hi> to have given his Nephew <hi>Metellus:</hi> to whom, demanding of <hi>Cicero</hi> to tell who was his Father, it was replyed, thus: It would be a far harder thing to tell, who was thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for thy Mother was accounted an errant Strumpet; and mine, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Matron. The truth is, all the claim that any body can make to him, whom he calls Father, depends wholly upon the single twine of one VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Honesty; which, be it never so apparent, is not to be cast in the Scales with the Fidelity of the immaculate Virgin-spouse of Christ, the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church. But I will wave this odious Comparison; partly because I would not create jealousies) of this Nature, in the Ranters Head, to harden him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his poor Mother (to whom it is affliction enough, to have been the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of such a Son;) and partly that I may not cast the least suspition of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon our Female-Gentry, whose inconquerable Vertue necessitates our Goatish Males to turn Channel-rakers, and to scrape off Dung-hills (fuel for their Lusts) the scum and off-spring of the fordid and Rascal vulgar, the scrapings and garbish of the Body Politick: such as that Nobleman of the East would hardly have set before the Dogs of the Flock. How many courses of Purification must such Lumps of Dirt mixt with the Dregs of English Blood undergo, before he that values the Nobility of his own, can think them fit for his touch, even by the proxy of a pair of Tonges. The Bawd washes the Cats face, pares her Claws, by the transforming power of the exchange dubs her a Gentlewoman: and then (though all the Castle-sope in Christendom cannot wash out Pusse's stains (contracted in the Chimney-corner;) nor all the perfumers Shops in Level-land take away the Nautious scent of her rank Blood) presents her, as the great Beauty of the Land, an <hi>Helen,</hi> a <hi>Venus,</hi> a Peer for a Prince, a Bed-companion for a Peer.</p>

               <p>If there be no difference of Blood, why do we boast of Nobility? If there be, why does it not recoil (even in spight of the most lustful Titillations) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those Vessels we extracted from our noble Progenitors, or at least, (for shame,) into our Faces; fitter Receptacles of it than such common Jakes? such unequal mixtures, are a kind of Buggery: For though in Religion there's none, yet in Nature there's as great, and in Politicks a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, between the Cream of Nobility, and the Sediments of Vulgar Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than there is betwixt this and some ingenious Animals: And in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks 'tis a less <hi>Indecorum,</hi> to see a Ladies Dog in bed with her, than her Groom: <hi>Publius</hi> commits a less Solecism in dallying with his Bitch, than with his Laundress: <hi>Catullus</hi> may with less Absurdity bill with his Sparrow, than his Maid.</p>
               <p>That our delicate and spruce Gallants (who cannot relish Prayer and Fasting which would cure them of this Canine Appetite after strange Flesh, of this <hi>Orexis</hi> after dirty Puddings) should be brought to this necessity, of feeding their Wolf with such course fare, at such three-penny Ordinaries; That they who will not lose so much of their height, as the bending of their Knees (to him who has promised to give his holy Spirit to them that ask) would put them to the expence of; should (by an unclean Spirit) be precipitated from the top of Honour's Scale, to the foot of the Hangman's Ladder, with that Wanton in <hi>Petronius. [Vsque ab Orchestria quatuordecim transilit ut in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Plebe quaerat quod diligat: &amp; amplexus in crucem mittat.] He leaps down at least fourteen steps from the top of the stairs of Nobility; that he may seek a Mistress amongst the basest of the Vulgar, and obtain the Embraces of one of</hi> Mal-Cutpurse-<hi>Nymphs, who last Assizes held up her hand at the Bar, and hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd the Gallows.</hi> That our fine-nosed Gentry (who can smell State-plots and humane Inventions in the most sacred Religion) should not smell the Plot which their own lusts have upon their Honour, nor how rank their Mistresses smell of the Dunghill; can proceed from nothing but their habituating themselves to such Carrion, for want of better fare. And that they are fain to feed the Flame of their Green-sickness-lusts with Coal and Cinders, must (with all thankfulness) be ascribed to the Chastity of our English Matrons: for if the Ladies honour had not been impregnable, <hi>Joan</hi> had never come in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Such Mushromes would never have been meat for the Gods (to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Nero</hi>'s Phrase;) such Lettice would never have pleased their lips, If the Garden of truly-noble Virginity had not been shut up against their Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Let this be engraven <hi>(in perpetuam rei memoriam)</hi> to the eternal praise of our English Ladies; that in the hour of temptation and laying seige to their Honour, they have not given up the Fort. And therefore, though the off-spring of Females of profligated honour, should follow the Dam (there being no sufficient presumption, whereby the Father can be indicated: upon which is grounded that of <hi>Vlpian: [Lex naturae haec est, ut qui nasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur sine legitimo matrimonio, matrem sequatur;] (Grotii de Jure</hi> 3. 7. 5.) and that of <hi>Cotta</hi> in <hi>Tully (de nat. deor. 3. pag.</hi> 133.) where he gives this Reason, why those Heroes, whose Mothers were Goddesses, were canonized Deities, and not those that had a God for their reputed Father; because the former were of the surer side: <hi>(ut enim in Jure Civili, qui est de matre libera, liber est: item Jure Naturae, qui de Dea matre est, Deus sit necesse est.)</hi> Yet for those that are born in Wedlock, the common sence of Nations presumes the Father is sufficiently pointed out. And as to our English Ladies, the respect
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43715:148"/>
they have to their Honour, is next door to a Demonstration of the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of their Issue; and that their <hi>Partus [non minùs sequeretur patrem quàm matrem]</hi> is as sure on the Father's as Mother's side <hi>(Grot. de jure 2. cap.</hi> 5. 29.) Nay (to give that whole Sex of all Ranks its due) though the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Servants in Wedlock, among the Lombards, Saxons, and most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, follow the Mother: yet so famous have our English Women been for Conjugal Fidelity; as the Law here is: <hi>[Francus, qui est aut villanus, ex pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, idemque in aliis conditionum discriminibus observatur,</hi> Littleton <hi>de villanis,] (referente Grotio ibid.)</hi> I will therefore wave this Comparison; and fall upon the proof of that, that's less Odious, and yet will shave the Seeker's Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice (against the Faith) more close, and come nearer the quick.</p>
               <p>§ 5. That the Gospel gives better evidence for its being rightly father'd on Christ, than he can produce, to convince such a captious Gainsayer as himself, that he is that Woman's Son, whom he calls Mother.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Depositions of Gossips, Midwives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Evidence of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-register, be valid Proofs; that at such a time, such a man was born, of such Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which of all these are wanting in our case? The things reported in the Gospel have been attested by many Eye and Ear-witnesses, who were upon the place when these things were brought forth; have been ingrossed in Parchment-rolls; deposited in the Archives of those Churches, to which they were originally directed: whither they were immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed by the hands of the Evangelists and Apostles Messengers, under known Seals, Marks, Tokens, Hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If not withstanding these Evidences, the bare possibility of Fallacy (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active or passive) (from both which we have freed the Apostles in our first and second Books) may administer, to a considerate Mind, ground of doubting; whether the Works and Doctrine reported of Christ, be indeed his, and not wrong father'd: will not that Principle much more warrant me to doubt, whether thou art thy reputed Mother's Child? For might not Mother, Midwife, Gossips either deceive, or some of them be deceived (far more probably than Christ, his Apostles, or Primitive Church) and combine to impose a suborn'd Child upon the Father, rather than they a suborn'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel upon the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Put case thy Mother had suspected her Husband would have thought her unfaithful by reason of the disparity of thy Complexion to that of both thy reputed Parents, and had question'd whether her alledging, that in the time of Conception she had in her Eye some Picture of another Complexion resembling thine, would have removed the scruple; might the not rather than put a point so tender to hazard, have put thee out secretly (as <hi>Persina (in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodorus, Ethiop.</hi> 10.) did <hi>Characlia</hi> upon the like account, fearing that her Child, resembling <hi>Andromeda</hi> whose Image hung before her while she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, would not be thought to be the Off-spring of an Aethiopian.) Say thy Mother, upon such a surmise, had put thee out to her whom thou callest Mother; by what prints couldst thou prick out thy way back again to thy true Original, or prove to a captious pretender that this is not thy lot, to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thy Nurse for thy Mother?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Put case thy reputed Father's Estate was intail'd upon Heirs Male, or that he passionately desired a Son, and his Wife as passionately desired to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his importunate Longings; how many ways might she invent to deceive him into an Opinion, that she was teeming with a Son, when she was not so much as with child? We have frequent examples of Women cheating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (through their extremely impatient desire to have it so) into a most confident beleif, that they are near the time of Delivery, when they have not so much as conceiv'd. It is not long since I knew one so big with a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> (a Brat of her own Brain;) as when her own appointed time of labour came, she cryed out for the Midwife and her Neighbours; who, though at first they had much ado to with-hold laughing out-right at the Woman's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43715:148"/>
folly; yet, as her pangs and visible child-bearing pains grew upon her, her Opinion grew upon them. In short, she could have no case, nor would allow them rest, till by the Midwive's advice they had fairly laid a bed, with all the Formalities appertaining to a Woman in that condition, into which she had fancied her self; and perswaded her she was delivered of a goodly Boy; at the news whereof her Travelling throws surrendred their place to a sound Sleep. I was christning a Child, in peril of death, over the way where this Comedy was acting, and some of this new laid Woman's Gossips came over to us; to whom telling this strange Story, and withal their fears, that upon her awaking (finding her mistake) she might fall into the like or worse Pangs; some advised, that the Child I had then Christen'd might be carried and shewed to her; that so time might be gain'd for the allaying of her Passion. Had now the Parents of this Child been content to forego it; it might have found a Mother, who would as verily have believ'd it to have been her Child, as thou believest thou art the Son of thine own Mother, or as thy Mother believes thee to be her Son. And had the Company been bound to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he might have rock'd the Cradle, whose own the Child was not; and the Cobler's Son, on the surest side, might have proved the Gentleman's Heir. If Women's Fancy can thus impose upon their Wit, how much more easily may their Wit impose upon our Fancy; when they set their Inventions on work, how they may (in case of Barrenness, Abortion, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the frowns of their (upon that account churlish) Husbands; or gratify the longings of their otherwise repining and dis-satisfied Mates, with the joyful Acclamations of <hi>[God give you joy of your Son.]</hi> Canst thou give any other kind of Proof, that this was not thy case, than we alledg to prove it was not the Gospel's case. To be sure thou art not able to imagine any such Temptations to have pressed the Apostles, to the use of such Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; as not only may rationally be supposed, but are actualy recorded, to have induced some Women to such like Practices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Say thy mother used none of this craft, but was really delivered of a Son; What Evidence can she her self have, or those who were then about her give, that thou art that Child which was then born, <hi>[Verum est de factis nullam esse certam perceptionem; sed ea quae solent in conspectu hominum fieri sui generis certitudinem habent extestimonio: Quo sensu mater certa esse dicitur, quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniuntur qui quaeve partui &amp; educationi adsuerunt:] (Grot. de jure, 2. 7, 8.) We cannot have a certain perception of matters of fact, but such things are done in the sight of men have that Certitude, is proper to them, by Testimony: in which sence the Mother is said to be certain, that such an one is her Child, because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were present at the Birth and Education of it,</hi> &amp;c. Hence <hi>Menander</hi> saith, Mothers love their Children more tenderly than Fathers; because Mothers know them, but Fathers only deem them, to be theirs. Yet how many Miles does thy Mother's Grounds of this Certainty fall short of those, upon which the Belief of the Gospel's Legitimacy is grounded? What privy Mark could she give thee (at thy coming into the World) whereby she can assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that that Babe which the Midwife wash'd, and swadled, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to her was that which she was delivered of? Or if we presume the Midwife did honestly restore the Pledg (for our prudent Fore-fathers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that collusion, which they providently foresaw might be used here, took the Midwives sworn: and perhaps when thou wast an Infant (and had not learn'd to discourse the World into a contempt of the Deity) Oaths were accounted sacred and obligatory;) yet what privy Mark did she take to know thee by, 10 or 20 Years after? <hi>(Sebastian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to such a Mark, for his release out of the Goal of <hi>Venice,</hi> and for his restauration to his Crown;) and nothing would convince the sagacious <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daspes</hi> that <hi>Characlea</hi> was the Child of his Queen, till <hi>Sisimithres</hi> made her strip her arm, and shew the print of an Elephant stamp'd thereon; a Mark which she brought with her into the World <hi>(Heliodor. Aethiopic. l. 10. cap.</hi> 15.) To whom did she communicate the knowledg of that Mark; for she

her self is but a single Testimony: whereas we have four, and all agreeing in the same Circumstances of every Story, better than any two ever did, in an History of such length and variety. I will not here urge that thy Mother might do all this, and yet not know who begat thee (and yet be an honest Woman, and true to thy Fathers Bed for ought she knew.) For such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident might perhaps befall her, as befell the Widow of <hi>Burdeaux;</hi> of whom the Lord <hi>Montagne (l. 2. ch.</hi> 2. of his Essays) tells this story, that she was got with child, she knew not when, nor where, nor by whom; and therefore got the Parish-priest to cry the Father of it: and to publish in the Church, That whosoever he were that was guilty of that Fact, she would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, and (if he pleased) make him her Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I doubt not but had her Husband been then living, she would have father'd it upon him, with as much confidence as thy Mother father'd thee upon hers. But say this was not her hap, to be taken asleep in the Chimney-corner: Wast thou chain'd to thy Cradle; and a Padlock hung at each end of the Chain: and the Keys deposited in the hands of sufficient Persons, of known Diligence and Integrity: for else, for ought that thou knowest, thou maist be a Fairy-Elf chang'd in thy Cradle. And verily, except thou canst disprove the truth of that Maxime, that <hi>[the Baptismal Character is indelible,]</hi> thy renouncing of it is a stronger presumption that thou art a Changeling, then any of those, than all those thou alledgest against the Gospel's legitimacy. And when thou wast loosed from thy Cradle: was a Chain (with the like Caution and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,) put about thy Neck and the Wrest of one or more Guardians, who led thee up and down like a Monkey, till thou came to Puberty (not to fix thee, that term of thy Walk, thou hast not yet attain'd to, years of discretion;) for else the Child that was then born may be secretly conveighed or made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thou be nothing but a supposititious <hi>Perkin</hi> or <hi>Lambert</hi> (as it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth's Children.)</p>
               <p>§ 6. Besides, art thou the none-such of the World? may not another so near resemble thee, as a third man cannot discern which of the two thou art? <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Publicius</hi> were so like <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, that they were usually salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one another's Names; and wheresoever either of them appear'd, the People stood up, as if <hi>Pompey</hi> had been in presence: this was Fortunes Play (saith my Authour, <hi>Valerius Maximus)</hi> with that Family; but she played fairer with him than she had done with his Father; for of him <hi>Menogenes</hi> his Cook was so perfect a Copy; as he could not (with all his Courage, or the Forces he commanded, repell the fastening of his Cook's name, upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; or of his honour upon his Cook. Neither the probity of <hi>Cornelius Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> his Manners, nor the reverence of his Ancestors, could hinder the insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, among the illustrious names of his Family, that of <hi>Serapion,</hi> the Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; such was the resemblance betwixt them. <hi>Rome</hi> had two Consuls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, when they sate in the Theatre, had as many Spectators as they that were upon the Stage; by reason of their resembling two Players: of one of which, <hi>[Spinther] Lentulus</hi> was sirnamed: and <hi>Metellus</hi> his Colleague had been branded by the name of the other, <hi>[Pamphilus]</hi> if he had not, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Nephew, repulsed it. But <hi>Mesalla</hi> his Consular Dignity and Office of <hi>Censor</hi> could not teach the People better manners, than to be-spat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with the Nick-name of <hi>Menogenes:</hi> nor <hi>Curio</hi> his many honours prevent his being called <hi>Burbulius:</hi> blots inured upon them, for their resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling two Actors of those names. <hi>Artemon</hi> was so perfect a Samplar of King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as <hi>Laodice</hi> having slain the King, placed him in his bed, where he so well acted the part of dying <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as the People admitted (in pretence) to here the last words of their departing Prince, believed verily they heard and saw the King himself committing, at his last gasp, <hi>Laodice</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Fidelity. <hi>Hybreas</hi> the Oratour, in lineaments of Face and whole Body was so peer'd by the sweeper of his School, as the eyes of all <hi>Asia</hi> did as good as point him out for his Brother: all the mark of difference betwixt

them was the Oratour's fluent Tongue; (never was that of the Philosopher more seasonable then here <hi>[Loquere, ut te videam:] Speak that I may see thee.)</hi> The Proconsul of <hi>Sicily</hi> found a fellow of that Province, so perfectly like himself, as he could not imagine how that Oneness of shape should happen, seeing his Father never came into that Island; till the Sicilian quicken'd his fancy, rub'd up his invention, by telling him that his Father had often been at <hi>Rome.</hi> By means of this coincidence of outward Features, Speech, Garb, Port, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (improved by the art of palliation and personating) how many base fellows have insinuated themselves into noble Families, and Estates they were never born to. <hi>Equitius Firmianus</hi> (of no better Bran then the <hi>Picene</hi> Smelt-mills ground) made the people of <hi>Rome</hi> so verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was the Son of <hi>T.

The sacred Majesty of the great and fortunate <hi>Augustus</hi> could not shield it self from this kind of injury: for a sawcy knave had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to fain himself the Son of his Sister <hi>Octavia;</hi> who had (as he said) for his exceeding deformity exposed him to a poor Woman, and taken her child in exchange for her own.

Sertorius,</hi> and the luck to be believed; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Sertorius</hi> his Lady could by no force be compell'd to own him; any more than all the Arguments we could use (from the Testimony of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish whence he was sent, from his wanting an eye and his having all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marks which her Child had) would prevail with one of my reverend and religious Father's Parishioners, to acknowledg a Child for hers, which was sent to her out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where she had formerly lived with her Husband. <hi>Trebellius Calca</hi> had so far insinuated into the People a belief, that he was the Son of <hi>Clodius;</hi> as <hi>Clodius</hi> his right heir had much ado to keep his Estate out of his clutches. In <hi>Sulla</hi>'s Dictatorship, a rude Clown burst into the house of <hi>Cn.

Smerdis,</hi> the <hi>Magus,</hi> might have passed still for <hi>Smerdis</hi> the Son of the great <hi>Cyrus;</hi> had he not been detected by his Ear-mark. That Jew of <hi>Sidon</hi> whom <hi>Josephus</hi> mentions <hi>(antiq.</hi> 17. 14.) did so perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble <hi>Alexander</hi> the son of <hi>Herod)</hi> (whom his Father had slain) as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded all the Jews of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> yea all that set eyes upon him (every where) who had seen the true <hi>Alexander</hi> (and those most, that had been best acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him) to believe, that he was the very <hi>Alexander;</hi> one of whom <hi>Celenus</hi> (a Freeman of <hi>Augustus)</hi> being sent by the Emperour to take a view of him, though he had been the play-fellow and most familiar acquaintance of <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet he could discern no difference betwixt him and this his Counterfeit: nor had he been detected, if the sagacious and Eagle-eyed <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> had not perceived wanting in him that softness of Hand, and grace of Body; which to persons of noble extract and delicate breeding, is heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>(Joseph, Antiq. 17. 18. Bel. Jud.</hi> 2. 5.) Examples are numberless of strange and base Slips that have been ingrafted into noble Families: infinitely more Persons have been suborned than Religions: and therefore if those presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, which the Sceptick brings against our Religion, be applyed to Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, (and 'tis all the reason in the World that he should be forc'd to buy and sell by the same Bushel) down goes Nobility and Gentry, all distinction of Lines and Families, and all possibility of making good our claims of Honour, Patrimony, or whatever we hold by our Birthright: for upon his may-be-Principles, wherewith he militates against the Faith divine, he destroys all humane Faith, turns the World into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> and renders it disputable,

               <p>§ 1. 1. TUrn over the Examinations, the Confessions, of Christians, in open Court, before Pagan Tribunals; where the same thing was done before the face of the Heathen World that was done at Baptism in the face of the Church. <hi>[Excepto martyrio, ubi tota Baptismi sacramenta complentur.

Let us, I say, examine the Confessions of Martyrs and in them you may find the Substance of the Gospel: peruse their Indictments against the Martyrs, examine what Crimes they charged Confessors with, what it was for which they raised against Christians those Out-cries <hi>[Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani ad Leones, away with these fellows to the Lyons;]</hi> they are not fit to live: they will not worship our Gods; they will not sacrifice for the Emperour's health; they worship for God one Jesus, who was born in <hi>Judaea,</hi> whom <hi>Pilate</hi> (at the request of his own Nation) put to death as an Impostor; who gave his followers a Law destructive to humane Societies, set up an unsocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, an unpracticable Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there we meet with the Sum of Christian Religion.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43715:152"/>
for imbrewing his hands in the blood of so just a man; a title conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by that Party out of an <hi>Odium</hi> to the Sadducees; and because he died in witnessing to those Articles of Christian Faith, which oppose Saduceism (upon the very same account that they sided with St. <hi>Paul.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The questions upon which <hi>Domitian</hi> examined the reputed Kinsfolks of our Lord, were, concerning Christ and his Kingdom: in what manner, and when and where it should appear: to which they answered, that it was not Worldly or Earthly, but Celestial and Angelical; that it should come at the consummation of the World, when that he coming in glory shall judg the quick and the dead, and reward every man according to his works: <hi>(Eus. ec. hist.</hi> 3. 19. out of <hi>Aegesippus:)</hi> which story, together with that of the noble <hi>Flavia</hi>'s banishment for the same Doctrine, he tells us, he found recorded in the Pagan Histories of that Age.</p>
               <p>In the persecution of the Gallican Church, under <hi>Antoninus Verus;</hi> his bloody Lieutenants writ the cause of their process against those Christians, to have been their professing Christ to be God; their refusing to give divine Worship to any but God, their believing the Resurrection, their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in the Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood: In their solicitating them, to renounce Christ, to adore their Pagan Gods; In their calumniate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Thiestian Banquets (for which they had no ground, but the confessions of some that fell (under the weight of that intollerable Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) informing their Examiners, that in their sacred assemblies they ate and drank the Body and Blood of our Saviour: in answer to which misprision the Martyrs would usually argue; that it was extremely unlikely, that they should devour Infants, when their Religion did not suffer them to suck the blood of Beasts, nor to eat any Flesh with the Blood; <hi>(Tertul Apol. adv. gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:)</hi> taking that for their <hi>Medium,</hi> in their Disputes with Heathens upon this point, as a thing famously known.) And lastly in their burning their bodies to ashes, and throwing the ashes into <hi>Rhodanus;</hi> (when yet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himself bestowed an honourable Burial and Sepulchre upon his Horse <hi>Panasinus: (Julius Capitolinus in vero Imper.)</hi> whether in affront to our Christian hope I know not. But his Lieutenants did dissipate and drown the ashes of Christian Martyrs on purpose to prevent their Resurrection: whereof (say they) the Christians being fully perswaded, contemn Punishment, and hasten themselves chearfully to death: Now let us see whether they can arise, after this dissipation of their Bodies. All which the French Church hath left Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of (taken in open Court) in their Epistle to the Asian and Phrygian Churches: <hi>(Euseb. Eccl. hist.</hi> 5. 1.)</p>
               <p>§ 2. If the Scepticks except against these Allegations; that we have them but at second hand, and not immediately from Pagan Records, and demand to see the Original; (though that be a request not all out so reasonable, as if a man, pretending to dissatisfaction in a Copy taken out of the Parish-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister, certifying his Parentage, and attested to by the Incumbents hand; should demand to see the Register-book it self) we can gratifie his utmost cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity. For we may gather what kind of people Christians were, by taking out those Characters of them which Secular Historians give, while at once they describe the temper of those civilized Emperours who indulg'd them; and give in that Indulgence as the reason, of others raising persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> (saith <hi>Lampridius) [Christianos esse passus est] permitted Christians.</hi> This he would not have done, had their Religion tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Theft, Uncleanness, Lying, Bribery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Emperour so far hated; as he made Proclamation to forbid all such Criminals to salute either himself or Mother or his Wife, prohibited mix'd Baths; would not allow <hi>[Lenonum, &amp; Meretricum &amp; exolotorum vectigal in sacrum aerarium inferri,] the Tribute of Brothel-houses to come within the sacred Treasury.</hi> And yet his Court was so frequented with Christians: as <hi>Maximinus,</hi> his Successor, raised Persecution against them, out of that grudg he bare to the Family of <hi>Severus:

(Euseb. l. 6. c.</hi> 21.) And his Mother <hi>Mammea</hi> sent for St. <hi>Origen,</hi> and entertain'd him in the Court as her Chaplain <hi>(Id.

[Places</hi> (I suppose) <hi>separate from common use for the celebration of the Christian Feast.]</hi> He caused the sinews of the fingers of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who had delivered into the Court a false Breviat of a cause depending, to be cut off, that he might be disenabl'd ever afterwards to write; and yet he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Origen,</hi> and other Christian Doctors, who gave in to the World a Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of Christs Cause to reside in the Palace; an Argument that they were not in the least suspected of forgery: When a Nobleman of a sordid life, and given to bribery (who had procured some Kings to intercede to the Emperor for him, that he would bestow upon him some Military promotion) was admitted into his presence; he was in the Presence of his Patrons, convict of Theft (that is bribery) and by their sentence condemn'd to the Cross. Had the Preachers of the Cross been under suspicion of that, or the like Crime, they would have sped no better. He caused <hi>Turinus</hi> for lying, to be smoak'd to death in a fire of green wood, while the Cryer made this Proclamation <hi>[Fumo punitur, qui fumum ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit,]</hi> Would so great an hater of Lyars have tolerated Christians, had they been guilty of that vice: Would he have honoured our Saviours Image, with a place in his Chappel (amongst those of <hi>Apollonius, Abraham, Orpheus,</hi> and others, whom he deemed choice men, and holiest Souls;) if the Doctrine he taught had been any other than pious, any other than what the Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates? Would he have taken up thoughts of building a Temple to Christ, and receiving him into the number of the Gods, but that he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, that the whole Empire would then turn Christian, and desert the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all other Gods? If the Christian Religion had not exceld all others, and been then presented, according to the Evangelical pattern now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? If the custom of Ordaining Christian Priests after trial (according to the now extant Evangelical prescript) had not been then in use in the Church? Would he (by name) have commended that Custom of Christians to the imitation of the Romans, in the appointing of Provincial Governours and Civil Officers. <hi>[Cùm id Christiani facerent in praedicandis sacerdotibus qui or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinandi sunt.] (Lamprid. Alex. Severus.)</hi> Had not the Christian Religion, then profest, been (as it is now) against serving the Belly? Would he have adjudged the benefit of a publiek place, which they had taken possession of, for Divine Service, rather to the Christians than to the Cooks? Whence learn'd he to offer those incomparable Jewels, which an Ambassador pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, to sale; and when he could not meet with a chapman would give the price; to hang them on the ears of <hi>Venus,</hi> rather than his Wives: but from that of St. <hi>Peter [whose adorning let it not be that outward of wearing of gold]</hi> This he did (saith <hi>Lampridius)</hi> to prevent the Queens giving bad Example to other Matrons, by this excess of costliness in Attire: who also (being a Pagan Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian) writes, That if any of his Soldiers had in their march, offered violence or done injury to any man, this Pagan Emperor would see him beaten before his face with cudgels orrods, or more grievously punish'd, if the offence deserv'd it: ingeminating to the offender, this expostulation <hi>[Wouldst thou have this done to thy self, and thy own possessions, that thou dost to another]</hi> (And that he was wont, while he was giving correction to the culpable, to cause proclamation to be made by a Cryer) <hi>[What thou wouldst not have done to thy self, do not to another] (quod à quibusdamsive Judae is sive Christianis audierat) which he had heard, either from some Jews or Christians.</hi> Thou mayst learn by this, Reader, that <hi>Lampridius</hi> was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: for otherwise he would never have made such a dis-junction, as ascribes that saying to the Jew, which never came in his mouth: but downright have affirmed (as other Heathens did, who studied the Case of the Christians on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to oppose it) that this was a Christian Proverb.

the History of this our Emperour, here are sufficient intimations given us of those Qualifications of the Christian Faith and Professors, as speak it, and them to have been such then, in the apprehension of Pagans, as they are given out to be in the Gospel at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> A Religion instituted by, and a Sect named from Christ, a Person of such holiness, as he deserved to be numbred in the rank of the best and divinest Philosophers, and would have been enrolled amongst the Gods, but for fear that the Religion of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would put down all others; it containing those excellent Precepts, which so civilized the followers of his Doctrine, as they were permitted in the Court of this Emperour, whence all vicious persons were prohibited; and were of that use in the administration of the Affairs of the Empire, as this very best of Heathen Emperours took those Rules and Practices of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for his Pattern, which the Gospel exhibites. Should I prosecute the Reigns of the rest of the Emperours, who had a favour to Christians (though themselves were none.) It would swell my discourse to too great a bulk, I will therefore content my self with two instances more.</p>
               <p>§ 3. One out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who in laying down the Reason why <hi>Trajan</hi> remitted that persecution which his Predecessors had raised against Christians, presents them in their religious Assemblies and civil Converse, walking by that Rule of Faith and Manners, which is extant at this day in the Evangelical and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Writings. This great Agent of State under <hi>Trajan</hi> informed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that by examining those that were brought before him, and accused as Christians, he had learn'd this to be the sum of their Religion (of their Crime or Errour, as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it) <hi>[That upon stated days, they were wont to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble before day to sing Songs, and make Prayers together to Christ, as God.

Ep. 103. Trajano)</hi> A description of the Religion and State of the Christian Church, (so exactly answering that which the Gospel gives, as if it had been transcribed thence,) is here drawn out to the life, and transmitted to us, by the Pencil and Pen of an Heathen, employed (by the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror (to take an account of the Religion profest by Christians; to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self what it was, wherein they, so far differ'd from the Religions establish'd or allowed, by the Imperial Laws, as to be therefore universally hated: and taken from their mouths, that were <hi>[cognoscendis causis Christianorum] (Plin. ibid.) appointed to take cognisance of the causes of Christians</hi> (as such) brought before them.</p>

If now thou wilt seek (Reader) what kind of Men and Courtiers they were, for whose Christian Manners this Monster hated them, and persecuted the Christian Doctors, for introducing this civilty into the Roman (then Pagan) Palace (and therewithall learn what went for Christian Virtue above 1400 years ago) thou wilt find that <hi>Maximinus</hi> persecuted as Christian those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Precepts which the Apostolical VVritings commend to us, and are not to be found, but there, or in Books derived from thence. And thou needest not go far for a resolution of this enquiry: for <hi>Lampridius</hi> will resolve thee, who in answer to that Question of <hi>Constantine [How</hi> Alexander <hi>a stranger born of</hi> Syrian <hi>extract, became so excellent a Prince?]</hi> tells him, That though he could alledge the indulgence of Mother Nature (who is a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame to no Country) and the fate of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> (which might have terrified him from vicious living) yet because he would suggest to him the very truth, he commends to him what he had already written, and <hi>Constantine</hi> read (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose touching the favour he had to Christians, and his sucking in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts) upon the perusal whereof, and reflexion upon that saying of <hi>Marius Maximus [It is better and more safe for the Republick, that the Prince himself be evil, than that his Friends and Counsellors be so; for one evil man may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sway'd by a multitude of good men; but a multitude of bad men can by no means be brought into order by one, though never so good a Prince.]</hi> And that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, which <hi>Homulus</hi> gave to <hi>Trajan,</hi> when he said, that <hi>Domitian</hi> was the worst of men, but had good Friends and Agents. <hi>[He must needs be a worse Prince than</hi> Domitian, <hi>who being a better man than he, had committed the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publick affairs to men of a bad life.]</hi> He presents it to <hi>Constantine</hi> as a thing not at all strange, that <hi>Alexander</hi> should prove so good a Prince; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by following his Mother <hi>Mammaea</hi>'s instruction, (which she had learnt of her Christian Doctors) he himself became the best of men. <hi>[Optimus fuit, optimae matris consiliis usus]</hi> and had constituted his Court, and adopted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars of men, <hi>[not malicious, not ravenous, not thievish, not factious, crafty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to evil, haters of goodness, lustful, cruel, circumventors, scorners: But ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, venerable, continent, religious, lovers of their Prince, who would neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, nor be a reproach to him, who would take no bribes, would not lye nor dissemble, nor betray their trust, but love their Prince.]</hi> such singly as one of them <hi>(Catilius Severus)</hi> he stiles <hi>[vir omnium doctissimus,]</hi> another, <hi>(Aelius Serenianus) [vir omnium sanctissimus;]</hi> another <hi>(Quintillius Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus) [quo meliorem nè historia quidem continet]</hi> another <hi>(Fabius Sabinus</hi> [Cato <hi>sui temporis,</hi> &amp;c.] And altogether, such, as gave occasion to the Senate (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, by the overthrow of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> the affairs of the Roman Empire were brought to that state, wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> left them) to congratulate the new Emperours <hi>(Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus)</hi> with the wish of <hi>Scipio Affrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus [ut in eo statu dii Rempublicam servarent in quo tunc esset, quòd nullus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior inveniretur] (Julii Capitolini Max. &amp; Balbin.) That the Gods would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Common-wealth in that State wherein it was, there being no better imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable than that which</hi> Alexander <hi>following those Evangelical Precepts</hi> (which are at this day given out as the peculiar Doctrine of our Saviour) <hi>had reduc'd it to:</hi> for the publishing of which, <hi>Maximinus</hi> hated and persecuted to death the Christian Doctors. So that as our ruled Law-cases inform us what is Treason, Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So we may inform our selves of the great things of Christs Law, by observing what Pagan Judges found to be Christianity, and censur'd in them as criminal. This is one most unsuspectfull way,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43715:154"/>
whereby it hath pleased God to hand down Religion to us, upon which gracious Providence let me make these Reflections, to enforce it upon our Minds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What we meet with in such Records, is Christianity confest with a witness; tis Christianity writ in the blood of the Professors of it; It is Christs Name in Capitals superscribed over his Cross, (the truely venerable Relicks of Martyrs) whose Tombs would speak, were the Scriptures silent; the preaching of the Cross by men not coming from the dead with it, but (what is more powerful) going to death for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Original Testimony of Christian Confessors, is in this case very venerable; so the Transcript of that Testimonie is very credible: it being conveighed to us from them by the hands of most malicious enemies; whose wrath the Lord so far restrain'd, as to make the remainder of it praise him, and serve his Church. Had <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen not been more ingenious than <hi>Rome</hi> Papal; she might either have thrown the Confessions of Martyrs into the fire with their Authors, or have left them to Posterity so mangled and dis-figured, as we should not have been able to have pick'd one word of the Gospel Religion out of them; nor have known any whit better for what they suffer'd, than we can now know out of Popish Records, what <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague, John Huss, Wickliff,</hi> and the Waldenses suffer'd for; scarce one of forty of those Articles they are charged with, being to be found in their own Writings, or the most authentick Histories of them. This is one part of that Mystery of Iniquity (to put Saints into Devils-hoods, Fools-coats, and Wild-beasts skins, that they might have some colour for bayting them;) which was not working so early as Pagan persecution; And through Gods thus restrayning the Heathens malice, it comes to pass, that we have a true account out of their own Court-rolls, what they charged Christians with, the Life-blood of the Gospel conveighed to us from the heart of the Martyrs, by the hands of Persecutors.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Substance of Christian Religion, as it stands now in the Gospel, is to be found in the Books of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>The Effigies of the Gospel is hung out where it is proscribed.</hi> § 2. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>attempting to out-oye Jesus with</hi> Apollonius, <hi>hath presented to the World the Sum of Evangelical History. § 3.

               </p>
               <p>§ 1. 2. THe Substance of the Gospel is delivered to us in the Polemical VVritings of such as did most hotly and cunningly oppose it. As we may learn, out of the Thomists confutations of them, what are the opinions of the Scotists: and out of the Scotists opposing of them, what are the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Thomists (bating their mistating the Question, and their wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Terms of it, to serve their own turn:) so we may gather the main Points of Christianity out of those Authors, who set themselves to oppose it (saving that here and there they pervert its sence, to make it more odious.) The Effigies of the Gospel (though bespattered with their dirty misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations) is hung forth there, where it is proscribed, in those Books, where it is condemned. I am perswaded, by that little I have read, and that much I have observed, in that little reading, looking that way; that a man furnish'd with leisure, and the conveniencie of Libraries, might find
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43715:154"/>
out, not only the general Sum of the Gospel, but the Contents of every Book, comprised in the undoubted Canon, under the Rubbish of Pagan Controversies and Calumnies against the things therein specified.</p>
               <p>The Roots of every material Gospel-truth (that flower and blow within the Pale of Christ's inclosed Garden) may be found (if we dig there for them) in the outward Court or VVaste that has been troden down of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The Tables of Christ's Royal Law (that hang out bare, and to open view, on the Pillars of the Church) lie buried under the earth <hi>(tepidae &amp; trepidae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictiuneulae,</hi> to use St. <hi>Austins</hi> phrase) <hi>Of Pagan tepid and trepid Contradiction,</hi> in the very Temple of the Idolaters, in the strong holds of those that have captivated them (but as the Philistines did the Ark) till we fetch them thence. Did we mistrust all the Copies of the Gospel in our own hands, we might fetch an undoubted one out of the Enemies Tents; and as intire as the Ark, and its appurtenances were (when <hi>David</hi> brought it back out of the Land of the Philistines) not a Pin wanting in the Tabernacle, not a tittle wanting in the Book of Testimony.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have a compleat History of the Miracles mentioned in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, in those Pagan Writers, whose drift is, either to paralel or out-vye Christ and his Apostles, in those mighty VVorks were done by them (as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withstood <hi>Moses)</hi> by presenting, to the fascinated eye of the mind, shadows of those substantial VVonders, which Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles wrought: In their VVritings you may see the Star that guided the Wisemen to our Saviour, hear the Angels singing his <hi>Genethliacum;</hi> here you meet with Persons of mean Extract and Education, arrived <hi>(ex tempore)</hi> to that height of knowledge, as the greatest Philosophers have been silenc'd by them (as the Scribes, Pharisees and Lawyers were by Christ) here you have produced Examples of men, that have cured the blinde, lame, possest; with a touch, with a word, with a nod; that have raised the dead, that have themselves been restored to life, after they had been dead, not only days, but years, have been taken up into the Clouds; have obtained divine Honours, Temples and the repute of Gods. This is a manifest Argument of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans assenting to the Truth of Gospel-history, of their acknowledging Christ to have done those wonders the Gospel reports of him. Else what needed this waste of like Narratives? VVhy did the Aegiptian Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers make shew, that they could turn a Rod into a Serpent, if they had not seen <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod first turned? the Truth always goes before the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
               <p>VVhile I lead my Reader (that I may give him a prospect of this Truth) into those places which are most infested with pestilential Airs: to secure himself from the malignity thereof, let him take this Antidote, made up of these cautionary ingredients.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to Matters of Fact, there is as wide a difference betwixt our and their reports (in point of the credibility of the evidence) as is betwixt the Fables of <hi>Tom. Thumb,</hi> the Tales of <hi>Robin Hood;</hi> and the most authentick Chronicles. Ours being of things done before many VVitnesses, in the open Sun; their's in a corner, and for which we have nothing but the bare word of him that did them, or his that reports them. <hi>Diocles</hi> his Author, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus,</hi> grounds all his whole stories upon the report of <hi>Demaris,</hi> the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Servant of <hi>Apollonius:</hi> most of which happened before <hi>Demaris</hi> saw <hi>Apollonius</hi> his face, and many of which were done behind <hi>Demaris</hi> his back, in his absence from his Master: So that all depend originally upon <hi>Apollonius</hi> his own Testimony of himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Pagans exceptions against the Articles of the Christian Faith, they proceed upon these Fallacies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon their misunderstanding some words, which we use in a peculiar sence, or they wrest from their common sence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon their confounding <hi>[the divine Oeconomy,]</hi> the distinction of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43715:155"/>
the two Natures, in the person of our Saviour; concluding he is not God, from such things as he did or suffered, on purpose, that he might declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And for their Cavils against our Christian Morals, they are raised.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From their not distinguishing betwixt God's changing of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Providence to us, and his changing of his own mind in himself: Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. From their mis-applying, to the external Court, those Laws Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Court of Conscience.</p>
               <p>What falls not under these I shall solve as I meet with them (if I think them worth answering.)</p>
               <p>In the Interim, having thus secur'd my Reader from mortal danger, I shall venture to give him a sight of Christ, in the High Priest's Hall, before <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Judgment-seat, in the crowd of those that cried <hi>[crucifie him.] Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscus</hi> (in his <hi>Aurelian)</hi> hath this Story: When <hi>Aurelian</hi> found the Gates of <hi>Thiana</hi> shut against him, he said in a rage, that he would not leave a dog a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in that Town: but the Town being taken, when his Souldiers (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gratifie his fury) ask'd him if they should depopulate that place: he bid them kill all the Dogs they found there, but not a man save <hi>Heraclom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who betrayed his native place, and therefore would never be true to him This alteration of the Emperour's mind (saith <hi>Vopiscus)</hi> is reported by some grave men, and recorded in some Books of the Ulpian Library, to have been occasion'd by <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus</hi> his Ghost's appearing to him, and saying, [Aureliane, <hi>si vis vincere, nihil est quod de civium meorum nece cogites:</hi> Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liane, <hi>si vis imperare, à cruore innocentium abstine: Aureliane, si vis vincere, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter age.]</hi> who was there amongst men more holy, more venerable, more august, more divine than this <hi>Apollonius?</hi> he raised the dead to life, he did and said many things beyond humane Power, upon the account whereof, he was worshipped as a God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, as such things would never have been invented of him, if they had not seen such things done first by Christ: So <hi>Vopiscus</hi> hath no Author for all the strange stories of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> but <hi>Philostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> I shall therefore wave reflecting upon him, till I have shewed how</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>Hierocles</hi> (out of the History of <hi>Philostratus)</hi> attempts to compare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> to our Saviour, in the point of Miraculous Works, and stupendious Occurrencies. (Upon the account of this conceited resemblance <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had his Image, together with Christ's, in his Chappel, amongst the Images of the chief Gods:) <hi>(Lampridius.)</hi> The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> appears to the Mother of our Lord; to his, a Fantasm that called himself the Egyptian <hi>Proteus.</hi> Angels sung at Christ's Birth; at his a Flock of Swans: <hi>(Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. de vita Apol. lib.</hi> 1.) Christ was not brought up in the Schools of the Prophets, yet attain'd that height of Knowledg, as he understood more than all the Doctors; knew what was in the hearts of men. <hi>Apollonius</hi> (as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus</hi> reports from <hi>Damaris)</hi> told <hi>Damaris</hi> at their first congress, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out artificial instruction in the knowledg of Tongues and Sciences, he was naturally endowed with a presention of things, could understand all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, the voices of Birds (so as he would ordinarily discourse with them;) yea the secret thoughts and conceits of men. <hi>Appollonius</hi> understood a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that came to inform a Flock of Sparrows, that at the Gate an Ass was fallen down under his burden, and had spilt the sack of Wheat. <hi>Porphiry</hi> triumphs in this story, and would prove its likelihood by two others <hi>(Tiresias</hi> and <hi>Melampus)</hi> who understood the voices of Beasts <hi>(in 3 de abstinen.)</hi> but <hi>Lucian</hi> (in his <hi>Alexander)</hi> affirms this <hi>Apollonius</hi> to have been an arrant Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er saith <hi>(Vossius de orig. idolat. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 44.) Christ made an escape through the throng of his enemies, unseen, unobserved by them; <hi>Apollonius</hi> could convey himself out of prison, out of the closest chains: Christ was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured before the Apostles; <hi>Damaris</hi> observ'd <hi>Apollonius</hi> frequently to have assumed a form more august than humane, to have been elevated two cubits
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43715:155"/>
above the Earth, and to have hung as a glorified body in the Air, by an art he had learn'd of the Indian Brachmans: <hi>(Philostratus, lib. 1. &amp;</hi> 3.) Christ fed many thousands with five Loaves, and at another time four thousand with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Loaves: <hi>Apollonius</hi> was present when the Indian Brachmans entertain'd King <hi>Jarchus</hi> with a Banquet upon the ground: where the earth <hi>(ex tempore)</hi> brought forth grassy Beds, for the Guests to sit down on; where they were served by four brazen Statues (in stead of Cup-bearers) with Wine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, flowing from four three-footed stools, as so many living Fountains: <hi>(I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Ibidem.)</hi> Christ foresaw the Earthquakes, Pestilences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that forerun the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem: Apollonius</hi> foretold the Pestilence that <hi>Ephesus</hi> was afflicted with: <hi>(Philost. lib.</hi> 4.) of which being accused unto <hi>Domitian</hi> (as proceeding from his practising of prohibited Arts) he excused it, by this Apology for himself; that he using a more fine and sober diet than other men, his spirits were thereby so refined, as he could perceive the corruption of the Air, long before others felt the mortal effects of it: <hi>(Philost. lib.</hi> 7.) But could he sent at that distance that <hi>Daniel</hi> or our Saviour set the Roman Eagles? <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> confer'd with Christ in the Mount, in their glorified forms: <hi>Apollonius</hi> had discourse with the Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> arising out of his grave, apparel'd in a Souldiers coat; and of the stature of five at first, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of twelve Cubits) about <hi>Homer</hi>'s History of the Trojan War; till the Lyon-like apparition was, by the crowing of a Cock, frighted into his hole: <hi>(Idem ibid.)</hi> Christ cast out Devils, so did <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and that of both Sexes; one a Male, out of a lascivious Youth; another a Female, which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus</hi> calls <hi>Empusa</hi> (for he must be feigned to make the Devils confess their names, as well as Christ did that Legion, wherewith the <hi>Gaderene</hi> was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.) He is said to raise a Roman Damsel from death to life: Which if they were any thing but mere Fictions, his emulous Rival in Philosophy <hi>(Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates)</hi> then living in <hi>Rome,</hi> would (without doubt) have put them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, among those Articles he prefer'd to <hi>Domitian.</hi> Our Saviour told the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> all the Occurrences of her life: <hi>Apollonius</hi> is brought upon the Stage by <hi>Philostratus (lib.</hi> 5.) telling a Piper his Pedigree, Estate, and all the Fortunes he had passed through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because Christ saith of himself, <hi>By me Kings reign: Vespasian</hi> is introduc'd begging the Empire of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> returning him answer, that he had already decreed him Emperour. Christ knew what was in man; and therefore this Ape must be reported, to understand what the sufficiencies of all men were: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as his Censures past for Oracles with <hi>Vespasian;</hi> who merely upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> his assuring him (from a gift of seeing into men's hearts) that they were wise and honest men, retain'd <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> into his Council, and most secret designs: though in the sequel of the story, his memory fails the Fabler: for him whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> had commended to the Father <hi>(Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian)</hi> as a just and wise man; he declaims against to the Son <hi>(Domitian)</hi> as a flattering Parasite, <hi>&amp;c. [Caupo est, cupedinarius, publicanus, faenerator, &amp;c.]</hi> But that was after <hi>Euphrates</hi> had cryed out first, and accused him as a Wizard. However this is enough to spoil his Divination, and to evince that he could not foresee that <hi>Euphrates</hi> would become his enemy, any more than he could foreknow that <hi>Domitian</hi> would not permit him to repeat that elaborate Oration, he had with so much pains pen'd and prepared: <hi>(Euseb. in Hiero. Clem. lib.</hi> 7, 8.) Had the Children held their peace, the stones would have cryed, <hi>Hosannah to the son of David.</hi> This was it that put words into the mouth of that Elm, that in an articulate and womanly slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Voice, welcom'd <hi>Apollonius</hi> to among the Egyptian Gymnosophists. <hi>(Philostrat. lib.</hi> 6.) By the invocation of Christ's name after his Assension, Miracles were effected: That they might make <hi>Apollonius</hi> vye in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with the blessed Jesus; there were some who affirmed, they had experienc'd a Magical Virtue in his name towards miraculous Operations. And lastly, (for I am weary of tracing him (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>foot by foot,</hi> where he is made to tread in Christ's steps) As Christ ascended into Heaven; so did he (if <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43715:156"/>
be to be believed) whither he was invited and taken up by a chore of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-angels, or Virgin-nymphs: his Tomb being no where to be found, though <hi>Philostratus</hi> sought for it, through the whole World: though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al he tells us, he knows nothing touching his death, nor do Authors (saith he) agree touching his departure; some saying, it was at <hi>Ephesus;</hi> others, in the Temple of <hi>Minerva Lindia:</hi> others, in the Island of <hi>Crete:</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (a little before) <hi>(lib.</hi> 7.) at the Bar, where he stood indicted of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, before <hi>Domitian:</hi> to whom after he had proclaimed that petulant and boasting bravado: <hi>[thou canst not keep my body bound, nor kill me</hi> (Caesar) <hi>for I am death-less:]</hi> he presently vanish'd out of humane sight.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Hierocles</hi> was not the only man that made those odious Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, neither was <hi>Apollonius</hi> the only man that was compared to our Jesus; but <hi>Apuleius</hi> and others, as <hi>Marcellinus</hi> tells St. <hi>Austin. [Apollonium siqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem suum nobis, &amp;</hi> Apuleium <hi>aliósque Magicae artis homines in medium profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, quorum majora contendunt extitisse miracula:] (Marcel. Augustino ep.</hi> 4.) The Pagans, (saith he, of whom we have great store in this City) set before us their <hi>Apollonius, Apuleius,</hi> and other persons; who by the help of Magick have done greater Miracles than Christ. Insomuch as that question was then worn thread-bare, and managed on their part with all subtilty, and patronized by great men and Wits, who moved every stone, ransack'd every corner, of Divine and Secular History, that they might parallel Christs migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works, and that no line in Christ's face, no lineament in his whole body, might pass without a parallel. Upon this subject, saith <hi>Celsus (in Orig. l. 7. cal.</hi> 76.) If you have a mind to believe stories of men being made Gods, and to fasten that Privilege upon any one, whose life and death make them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that honour; had not <hi>Hercules</hi> or <hi>Aesculapius</hi> pleased you, you had <hi>Orpheus;</hi> who without doubt was inspired with a divine Spirit, and died a Martyr to Philosophy, by the hands of the enraged frows of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> And if the cause of his death mislike you: (and truly who but a sorbid Epicure can like it?) for he deservedly contracted the just hatred of all Womankind, by his singing the flagitious brutishness of the Gods, in their unnatural Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median Lusts: <hi>[nonnulli aiunt quòd</hi> Orpheus <hi>primus puerilem amorem induxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, mulieribus visum contumeliam fecisse, illis, ab haue rem interfectum, &amp;c.

And his mercy provided for the satisfaction of all (that are not peevishly captious) by permitting the Heathen to draw one after that, in all points so like it, as the most curious eye can find no more difference, betwixt that which the Church hangs forth (to be worship'd) and that which the Heathen World hung out (to be scorn'd) than there was (from it self) in that homely piece, which the Sexton hung up (for the Image of our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over the Altar: and the Priest caused to be taken thence, and hung in the Belfry (for the Picture of the Devil;) if I may use, in so sacred a business, so homely an illustration. That which the Pagans drew and hung in the Belfrey, is the same with that which the Church drew and set over the Altar: not one prodigious Circumstance in this that is not in that; the Clay presents as full a proportion of the golden Key, as the Wax. So that had we lost the impression of it in the Churches Wax (in the sacred History) we mightmake another, by taking the Pattern of it that's drawn in the Clay of Pagan Fables, which emulate and counterfeit the sacred stories of Christ's mighty Works.</p>
               <p>§ 4. 2. We may infallibly know which way the Lamb of God has gone, by following the steps of his pursuers, where they have been hunting to death his Doctrine, as well as works.

The Pagan Philosophers in this place (saith he) perswade those, that are not well setled in the Christian Faith, to waver; by propounding such like Scruples.

                  <hi>Deo gratias</hi> informs the same Father, (St. <hi>August, Epist.</hi> 49.) that the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Porphyry</hi> made these Exceptions against the Evangelical Precepts. <hi>[If none but he that does these sayings of Christ lays a sure foundation of hope for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, what became of those that lived before Christ? must we exclude our Fore-fathers from hope of salvation?

               <p n="1">1. In their wresting Christ's saying <hi>[with what measure]</hi> into a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their Master's Placit. That all penal Purification (as they call'd it) was limited to certain Periods of Time; after the expiration whereof the Soul was to be restored into the state wherein it was, before it contracted guilt: in pursute of which Placit St. <hi>Origen</hi> thought the Devils should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged after a long imprisonment:</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their making Christ's expressions of <hi>[eternal fire]</hi> of <hi>[the worm that never dies,</hi> &amp;c.] to contradict that former notion of receiving by measure; whereas it is manifest, that Christ speaks not of measure of time, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of kind and degree, betwixt doing and receiving good or evil.</p>
               <p>To return to Pagan Testimony, for the truth of Christ's delivering that his Royal Law, which the New Testament hangs out the Table of; we find the Adversary attesting to Christ's dispencing of it, as to several other heads of it. While <hi>Celsus</hi> will needs make the Royal Law useless and needless, as to the most part of it; There is nothing (saith he) in the Christian Discipline new, or worthy of commendation, but is common to it and the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; who, before Christ, have taught <hi>[that there is to be expected Rewards of Virtue, and Mulcts for Sin, in the other World:] (Orig. contr. Cel.</hi> 1. 4.) Christ tell us (saith he) we ought not to worship Gods made with hands, that the Father is to be worship'd in Spirit. Why? we Philosophers account not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Gods to be Deities (we know that the Workmanship of wicked Artificers and villanous men (as many times they are that grave these Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) cannot be Gods;) we have learn'd of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> that they who adore liveless Statues do as simply as they that talk to Walls: of the Persians, that the Deity is not comprehended within any Structure made with hands: and of <hi>Zeno Citiensis</hi> (in his Book of the Common-wealth) that he need not build Chappels, that prepares the Temple of his own Soul, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of God.</p>
               <p>Those very Laws, which the Madaurencian Philosophers blamed (as destructive to humane Societies) <hi>Celsus</hi> mentions with Commendation: as far more ancient than Christ. They have also (saith he) these Laws: <hi>[Thou must not repel injuries: If any man smite thee on thy cheek, turn the other to him:]</hi> this is an old Dictate, long since utter'd by <hi>Socrates,</hi> when he was disputing with <hi>Crito,</hi> and mention'd by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus: (Orig. contr. Cel.</hi> 7. 17.) upon the same account he mentions the commendations which Christ gives to Humility, Purity of Heart, Pacateness of Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expressed by <hi>Plato;</hi> (in his Books of Laws) advising him that would be happy, to pursue Righteousness with an humble, pure and pacate Mind: <hi>(Id lib. 5. cal.</hi> 8.) And the Caution that Christ gives against Covetousness, <hi>Celsus</hi> (in the same place) affirmeth to have been derived from <hi>Plato;</hi> whose saying,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43715:157"/>
                  <hi>[that it is impossible, for any man to be very rich, and very good.]</hi> he paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels to that of Christ: <hi>[It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.]</hi> (The mortiferous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these Waters is to be cured, by casting in that cruze of Salt, which I have already exhibited, and brought to hand in the second Book; where I shewed, that whatsoever points of abstruse knowledge occurr in the Schools, they are beholding to the Temple for, and are but Beams of that Light, which Christ (or his Spirit in the Prophets) communicated to the World, the last of which Prophets Writings, are near as old, as the first of Gentile Philosophers.)</p>
               <p>It were endless to enumerate the ecchoes of Christs Law, which those Rocks that oppose it, so articulately reverberate; as a steadily listning. Ear may take in the beginning, middle and end of every Evangelical Precept, from those mock-sounds in Heathen Authors. I shall not therefore enlarge this Section with more Instances: but conclude it with this Observation; That the Adversaries, in making reply to our urging them with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Christs Law, would not have taken that course, as puts them upon such self-contradictory <hi>Salvoes;</hi> if they durst for very shame (the contrary was so palpable) have denied them to be Christs. Briefly we find in the Pagan Writers, what they took to be Christ's Law; and that which they opposed (as such) is the very same with that, that the Gospel presents, as such; not one Egg is more like another, than that Bracelet of Pearls, which our Saviour fitted to the necks of his Disciples, is to that, which these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Swine trample under their feet.</p>

Con. Cels.</hi> 5. 16.) (As <hi>Celsus</hi> doth here confess, that that Doctrine which our Bible exhibites, touching Gods prohibiting <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, and the Serpents prevailing with <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of that Tree, and the opening of <hi>Adam</hi>'s eyes thereupon to discern good and evil, and the Serpents infinuating to <hi>Adam,</hi> that God envied him that knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> was the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles; so his charging upon the Church that impious Practice of these Heriticks misgrounded upon the Churches Faith, and which the Church exprest her abhorrencie of, was no more equal dealing than that which the Romanists measure out to the British and other Protestant Churches, when they lay to her charge the practices of such as are at as great a distance from Communion with her, as with them.) You Christians (saith <hi>Celsus)</hi> profess you believe in, and worship God the Creator of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; but since <hi>Plato</hi> saith, it is hard to find out and know that God, and impossible to communicate the knowledge of him to another, is it like that you (of all other men) should attain to the knowledge of this God, being fast bound in chains of ignorance, so as you cannot see what is pure <hi>(Idem.</hi> 7. 14.) (Compare what the Christians teach, with what the Philosophers guess concerning God; and the controversie, which of us have attained to a more perfect knowledge of God? will easily be determined.) That God created man after his own Image, was the Doctrine of Christ and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church; appears from <hi>Celsus</hi> his arguing; that if the Christans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that God was first to be represented by Images made like man: they overthrew their own Doctrine, <hi>[that man was made after the similitude of Cod.] (Id.

(as if we could not honour them as Gods friends without imparting to them (their Masters due) divine honour. He gives still further and clearer evidence of the delivery of this Article of our Christian Faith, while he indulgeth himself the liberty, to deride that Truth which was once delivered to the Saints. The Jews (saith he) in a corner of the VVorld <hi>(Palestine)</hi> conspiring together, invented the Fable of Gods forming Man, and breathing into him the breath of Life; of VVoman brought out of his side; of man's receiving a Precept from God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Serpents Precept above Gods; of Gods casting <hi>Adam</hi> iuto a sleep, and taking <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s rib, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>This same Epicurean Hog thus grunts out Calumnies against the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, of Gods making Heaven and Earth <hi>(lib. 6. 23. 24. &amp;c.) [God said let there be light.]</hi> Did the Maker of all things borrow Light to work by, as we light our Candle at our Neighbours? God did not borrow, but made Light, not for himself to see by, but to illustrate his Creatures. Can any thing be more ridiculous, than to assign certain days to the Creation of the World; in the first whereof, God perfected one kind of being; in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, another; in the third, another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the sixth and last Man? The Matter of visible and invisible things God created in a moment, and in the same moment educ'd the invisible World out of that Matter. But that he should (for instance) create a Natural Day (which was his first days
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43715:158"/>
work) consisting of twenty four hours, in less than twenty four hours, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Contradiction; and that day being the first, and pattern of all the rest (that is) consisting the first half of it of night, and the other of day, it was impossible but that Darkness must be upon the face of the Deep one twelve hours, and Light in the upper Hemisphere other twelve hours. Or that he should (to instance in the fourth days work) make Sun and Moon, and set them in the Firmament of Heaven, and make them successively make a day and night in less time than twenty four hours, does equally imply a Contradiction. And for the rest they being more gross bodily substances educ'd out of the first Matter, it implies a Contradiction that they should move in an instant to those forms the Divine Power first bestow'd upon them; and it was most congruous (seeing they could not be made but in some time) to perfect them also in such a proportion of time (by his own free choice) as the nature of the things themselves required which were made the first and fourth day. Besides, the Light created on the first day (which must necessarily move sphaerically, or it could not have made a natural day) might be instrumental towards the producing those powers, which God (by his <hi>Fiat)</hi> gave the Matter, into effect: and then before the earth was all over-spread with Grass and Cattle, and the Sea with Fish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Light must shine upon them from one end of the Heaven to the other; which could not be done in less space than twenty four hours. And that God should rest on the seventh day, as if like a lazie Artificer he had been tyred, and must then keep holiday? Could there be days before the Sun was made; whose Motion measures Time? that lucid Cloud, created the first day, had a circular Motion, and thereby measured time, till on the fourth day God made the Sun. <hi>(Vide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Zanch. de operibus Dei par. 1. l. 1. c.</hi> 2.)

(as Princes go on Progress, to shew their Magnificence to their Subjects in the Country:) Did God then, now at last, (after so many Ages laps'd) think of justifying men, whose Salvation he neglected, for so long a time before?

                  <p>Touching the Christian's belief, that Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost: he hath this Animadversion: <hi>(lib. 6. cal.</hi> 35.) What need was there that the Holy Ghost should over-shaddow the Virgin, and frame Christ a Body in her womb? could not God have shaped him a Body, (he could not have a Body of the Seed of the Woman without the Seed of the Woman) without immersing his own Spirit into so great contamination? <hi>Celsus</hi> might have learn'd better Language of <hi>Proclus</hi> the Pagan Philosopher: <hi>(Secundum, nihil omnino providentiam ex gubernatis accipere, nec eorum natura repleri, nec eis alicubi commisceri: non enim ex eo, quòd omnia disponit, admiscetur prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereà gubernatis: (Proclus de anima &amp; daemone tit.

If he had been conceiv'd by the Holy Ghost, his Body would have excelled all othets in Stature, in Form, in Strength, in Voice, <hi>(nec vox hominem sonat)</hi> in Majesty, and in Elocution: for it is incredible that he who had so much Divinity, who was formed by so divine an hand, should not surpass all men: but Christ (as the Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) was but like to (if not inferiour to other men:) His face (according to Prophecy) was to be mar'd more than any man's:) low, mean, humble, yea deformed. Why should the holy Spirit be sent to one in a corner of the World, in <hi>Judea;</hi> and not be inspired into all men, (man must let the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption alone for ever,) if God have a purpose to save all men?</p>
                  <p>As to the last clause of this Article, he brings in a Jew <hi>(lib. 1. cal.</hi> 20.) thus scoffing at Christ for chusing to be born of so mean a Woman, at so mean a Town; (he was to be born in the form of a servant, and <hi>Bethlehem-Judah</hi> was the least of the Cities) of <hi>Judea</hi> as <hi>Bethlehem, &amp;c.</hi> did her beauty (her inward Beauty (being full of Grace) invited God to chuse her for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Son of God before others) invite God into her embraces? how could she conceive and bring forth a Son without the knowledg of man? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> retorts thus: how do the Vultures breed (as your own Pagan Writers report) without companying with the Male? why could not God make the second <hi>Adam</hi> without a Father, as well as the first without either Father or Mother? and lastly, that we Christians are not the only men who embrace such admirable stories is manifest, from your believing that <hi>Plato</hi> was conceived by <hi>Apollo,</hi> and born of his Mother <hi>Amphictione</hi> yet a Virgin, before her Husband <hi>Aristo</hi> had knowledg of her, being prohibited by a Vision to touch her: At the same point the Seeker, whom <hi>Volusianus</hi> mentions, strains: <hi>(August. ep.</hi> 2.)

                  <p>It is St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Observation, that the Philosophers, in questioning the truth of the Church touching the Incarnatlon, overthrew their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. It is their Assertion, saith he, <hi>(de civit.</hi> 10. 29.) that the intellectual Soul may by purging become consubstantial <hi>[paternae menti] with the Father's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43715:160"/>
Mind</hi> (which they confess to be the Son of God) what absurdity then can there be in the Christian Belief; that one individual soul, being the purest that ever was created (for the salvation of many) was assumed into Union with the Son of God? Now that the Body must adhere to the Soul, that he may be a perfect man, we learn by the Testimony of Nature it self: which Union of Body and Soul, if it were not usual, would be less credible than the union of an Humane Soul to the Mind, Word, or Son of God. For 'tis casier to be believed, that an incorporeal should be united to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, than that a corporeal and incorporeal Being should conflate into one. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes <hi>(Apol. priùs citato)</hi> that nothing was more common in the Heathen World, than Virgin-births of divine Conceptions; and yet they had been more common, if some like <hi>Olympias</hi> had not been jealous of <hi>Juno</hi>'s Jealousie: after whose Copy she return'd this answer to her son <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Letter, thus superscribed, <hi>[King</hi> Alexander <hi>the Son of</hi> Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hammon <hi>to his Mother</hi> Olympias <hi>all health:]</hi> I pray thee Son do not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me and accuse me to <hi>Juno</hi> as one that had been naught with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: for I shall never be able to bear the burden of that her spightful jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie which she will conceive against me upon thy writing thy self the Son of <hi>Jove,</hi> and thy insinuating me to be his Whore: <hi>(Agellius Noct.

                  <p>This Text of St. <hi>Austin, (Ep.</hi> 2.) beside that that I quoted it for, points to a great many Circumstances in the History of the blessed Jesus, mention'd in the Gospel: all which are, from this allegation of the Adversaries, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been the Doctrine of the Apostolical, as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, Church.</p>

                  <p>The Jew in <hi>Celsus (lib.</hi> 2. 6.) upbraids the Christian, for believing in him that could not avoid or evade those dangers, that Death, he was brought to, by the Treason of his own Disciple; but suffer'd himself to be apprehended, arraigned, condemned, and crucified; for all that he fore-knew, and fore-told his Disciples of those things that befell him. And that they put their confidence in Jesus, who not only in appearance suffer'd these things, but really, openly, before many Witnesses (as themselves say;) what God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or but wise Man, would wittingly and willingly have been taken in those snares, which were laid in his sight, if he could have help'd it? Is it not a wonder, that Christ by telling <hi>Judas</hi> of his Treason, <hi>Peter</hi> of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, should not have been so far revered (they believing him to be God) as to prevent the Apostacy of the one, the Lapse of the other? or did he not by foretelling it, teach them to do it, and lay snares for the Companions of his Table? God is impassible; why then did Christ, if he were God, suffer such an Agony for fear of death, as made him sweat like drops of Water and Blood, and cry out to be saved (in the Garden) in these words, <hi>[Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me:]</hi> and complain (on the Cross) in these, <hi>[My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?]</hi> The Christians (after all their Promises) produce, for the Son of God, not a pure and holy Word (as they term Christ) but a man affected with most ignominious suffering; beaten with stripes, spit upon, and nailed to the Cross; whence he could not descend, though provoked to do it. It was then (sure) high time for him to declare himself God, when the Jews insulted over him before <hi>Pilat,</hi> when in mockage they put on him a purple Robe, put a Reed for a Scepter into his hand, and set a Crown of Thorns upon his head; with the pricking whereof, as also of the Nails and Spear, Blood issued out from him.

You say (indeed) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended into Hell: (Observe, by the way, that our over-wise Disputers, who question the Antiquity of the Article of the Descent, are more ignorant of the Christian Faith than this dull-pated Epicurean Philosopher: this Article was so obvious to <hi>Celsus,</hi> as he made it the subject of Derision; and yet is so dark to men that can see through a Mill-stone, as we must take it for a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, if they will allow us to make it the Object of our Faith.) Was it to get Disciples there, seeing he could get so few among the living? <hi>(lib. 2. cal.</hi> 41.) the Jew mentions Christ's last words at giving up the Ghost, the Earthquake and Darkness that attended his death. On these Scenes, <hi>Celsus</hi> as he discovers the truth of the delivery of these parts of the History of Christ, and his knowledg of that History; so it bewrays his ignorance in the Contents of the Old Testament; wherewith if he had been acquainted, he would never have brought a Jew upon the stage thus to flout at the blessed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus for suffering those things which their own Prophets foretold were to befal their <hi>Messias:</hi> to wit, that he was to be apprehended, arraigned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as a Lamb not opening his mouth, that he was to have Vinegar giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him to drink, that he was to be betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> forsaken of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, denyed by <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>Celsus</hi> could not have devised how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Jew more effectually, that Jesus is the Christ, than by these very Arguments that he puts into his mouth against him: nor more manifestly have confirm'd the Truth of that Evangelical Assertion.

The first Story he brings to parallel this, is (out of <hi>Pindar,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> his fourth Book) of <hi>Aristaeus Proconesius,</hi> who going into a Fullers Shop, there departed this Life: The Fuller, shutting the door upon the Corps, goes to acquaint his Relations with this sudden accident: upon which, as they were discoursing, in comes a Cyzicene, and tells them, that in his travelling homeward, he met with the Ghost of <hi>Aristaeus</hi> travelling to its long home, trudging (as fast as it could) into the other VVorld: which he confidently affirming, his friends (with preparations for his burial) enter the Fullers Shop, where no <hi>Aristaeus</hi> appears, either alive, or dead: nor was he seen or heard of, till that seven years after, he shewed himself to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connensians, and having made that Paper of Verses which are called <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maspaei,</hi> he again disappeared. This (saith <hi>Herodotus)</hi> I have from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his Citizens: But this I know, that he was seen alive, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapontines, in <hi>Italy,</hi> 340 years after his second disparition: where (after he had play'd thus long at boe-peep with Death) by the appointment of the Ghost, and the confirmation of that his VVill by the Pythian <hi>Apollo,</hi> he had his Statue erected, by the Altar of <hi>Apollo:</hi> which was not made of such run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leather, as was its Prototype, that was standing, where it was first erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in <hi>Herodotus</hi> his age. Besides the incoherence of this Story, and the unlikelihood that a Squire of <hi>Apollo</hi> should be so many years in making one poor Paper of Verses, <hi>&amp;c. Agellius</hi> reckons this <hi>Aristaeus,</hi> for one of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Fablers, deserving the Whet-stone <hi>(Noct. Attic. l. 9. c.</hi> 4.)</p>
                  <p>The next Parallel that <hi>Celsus</hi> brings of our Saviours Resurrection, is <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes Astypulaeus,</hi> who to avoid the hands of his enemies, hid himself in an Ark; which when they that sought for him looked into, he was not found there, but, by some Divine Fate, had made a cleanly conveyance of himself out of his enemies clutches: but did they set a watch upon the Ark, as the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> did upon Christ's Sepulchre?</p>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:43715:162"/>
The third story of <hi>Celsus,</hi> is of <hi>Clazomenius,</hi> whom he brings in as a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of Christ; in that he had power to lay down his life, and take it up again: for <hi>Clazomenius</hi> his Soul would often leave its body, and walk naked up and down; and, when it had taken the Air, return home again to its old Lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But I suppose it never took a three days journey, nor was so long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; as to let the vital Fire go out, before its return; or the warmth of its Apparel be extinct, before it put on its cloaths again. The Story of <hi>Zamolxis</hi> is alledged by <hi>Celsus</hi> to the same purpose; though his Author <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> not only questions the truth of it, but relates it thus (which makes nothing for <hi>Celsus:)</hi> that he only withdrew himself three years into a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal house he had built, and that on purpose to deceive the Scythians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an opinion that he had been so long dead, and to the embracing of that Doctrine of his Master <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which he taught amongst them, that the soul of man was immortal <hi>(Herodotus Melpomene.)</hi>

And in the same Book <hi>(cal.</hi> 11.) mentions the Angels rowling away the stone from the mouth of the Sepulchre, not without this Sarcasm: <hi>[as if the Son of God was not able to do it himself, but must have it done for him by some other.]</hi> (but if he had minded what he read, he might have learn'd that it was not rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away for Christ's sake, that he might come out; but for the Women and Disciples sake, that they might look in) and not omitting so much as the variety in the Evangelists story; one, mentioning one; another, two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. One sitting upon the stone, two sitting, when the VVomen first lookt in; but standing, when they spake to the VVomen, one at the head, the other at the feet of the Sepulchre: <hi>(August. de consensu evan. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 24.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deogratias,</hi> mentions Christ's eating, and shewing the prints of the Nails, after his Resurrection (as points of Christian Faith) and argues from those Points as Christian principles (of which more anon.) as that Bishop informs St. <hi>Austin. (Ep. 39. quest.</hi> 1.) Nay, the Adversaries of the Christian Faith have not only mention'd Christs Resurrection, as an Article of our Faith (which is all I need to prove now) but have been forc'd to confess the Truth thereof, and to acknowledge that Christ did indeed rise from the dead: by name, <hi>R. Bechai</hi> (as he is alledged by <hi>Grotius de veritate Christan. rel. lib. 2. pag. 89.)

Be those Stories true or false, they are a good argument that the ancient and best Philosophers did not think the Resurrection impossible: for <hi>Plato (de repub.</hi> 10.) (quoted by <hi>Eusebius de praep. evan.</hi> 11. 35.) and mention'd by <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Max. (lib. 1. c.</hi> 8.) and <hi>Plutar. (Symposiae</hi> 9. 5.) and <hi>Macrobius (Som.

                  <p>The Argument of Christ's Divinity drawn from his assumption into heaven, they darken with so great a volly of Examples of their own <hi>Hero</hi>'s; as it would tire me to take up those Arrows one by one. But that he ascended with that body that was crucified: <hi>Celsus</hi> one while attributed to to delusion, it being impossible (as he argues) that a body can be made immortal, that being the Creature of inferiour Nature; not of God, as the soul is, and all other immortal beings. This Principle he borrows of the Manichees, out of the dispute betwixt <hi>Jason</hi> and <hi>Papiscus</hi> concerning Christ <hi>(lib. 4. cal.</hi> 22. 23.) Another while granting it true, he denys it to be a sufficient proof of Christ's Deity; because <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had (by what Art God knows) obtain'd that agility of body, as he could fly up as fast, and as far, as a dart could, even out of sight; and that was as far, as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples could see Christ ascend. But the gift, which Christ shed forth after his Ascension, spake him to have ascended far above the highest Heavens. And as to the truth of this assertion <hi>[That this was an Article of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical faith, that Christ did ascend into heaven]</hi> This Epicures carping at it, is proof sufficient; and his not daring to stand to his first Cavil; <hi>[that it was impossible,]</hi> but flying to another <hi>Salvo [But it was no more than others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him bad done, who yet thereby obtained not the repute of their deserving divine Honours]</hi> is a tacit Concession to the Truth of the thing it self: which is more than I here need to prove.

So little did they deem it to be against Reason, as by the conduct even of Reason they stumbled upon that Divine Notion, which the Socinians will not submit their vain Reason to the belief of, upon (the strongest of all Reasons) Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation: proved to be so, by the clearest of all evidences, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of power, exerted at the first manifest revelation of this Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at the Baptism of Christ; when the heavens were opened, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit descended upon the Son, and a voyce was heard from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Lastly, how can your Church be Catholick, in point of Doctrine? seeing you dissent and rend your selves, as a Sect from the Catholick Religion of the whole World <hi>(lib. 8. cal.</hi> 1.) The truth is (saith he, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. 5.) And are rent your selves into so many sects <hi>(lib.</hi> 3. 4.) We could allow your Religion to be acceptable to the God of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and your Society (upon that account) in favour with that God. But we cannot endure that pride, that you will either be all, or none: that you applaud your selves, as the All of the Universe, which God respects; and exclude all, but your selves, out of the divine favour: that your Church should be the Catholick Receptacle of the whole Community of Saints, and your Religion the Universal way of Soul-cure (a thing never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either among the Traditions of the <hi>Magi,</hi> Gymnosophists, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers) this is that we cannot but with abhorrencie disgust. That the Jews (for Christian Religion is orignally Judaick) that inconsiderable People, (and so much hated of the Gods, as they cannot obtain of any of them, so much room upon Earth, as to dwell upon together) should prescribe, in matters of Religion, to the whole World, and not permit to other Nations their own, as best for them: but break the bond of universal Peace; decry that National Independency, which (till this universal way of Salvation, this common Faith was obtruded upon the whole World) kept all Nations in a friendly Communion of heart, in a charitable correspondency among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: each one allowing other that Religion they esteem'd most convenient for themselves. The Evangelical way of Salvation, the Christian Faith; and Christian Church are therefore called Common, Universal and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; because it is that way of Salvation, which God hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning propounded to all Mankind, and been intirely embraced in all Ages and Places, by all Persons, who have preferr'd divine Revelations before their own Inventions: who are therefore collectively stiled the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Celsus</hi> therefore equivocates in saying our Religion and Church were but erected the other day: for though the Gospel, as it is an History of the exhibition of the promised Seed, could not commence before that Fulness of Time, when Christ came into the World; yet, as it is the glad tydings of Salvation by that Seed, it was preach'd in Paradise: in which respect Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is yesterday, and to day the same Rock upon which the Church hath been built in all Ages.</p>

When indeed men grew weary of waiting for the Seed promis'd, and became so vain in their Imaginations, as to frame Gods, and Saviours, and Religions to themselves. God preach'd the Gospel anew, and repeated the old and Catholick Religion to his friend <hi>Abraham,</hi> annexing thereto the Seal of Circumcision, as a sign that the Seed was not yet come, and that it was to come out of his Loyns by <hi>Isaac.)</hi> This was not only a peculiar Priviledge to his Posterity, but a general advantage to the whole World: For whither could men, in common reason, think themselves obliged to look (when they found themselves at a loss in point of Religion;) but to <hi>Sem</hi>'s Family, to which they were directed by <hi>Noah</hi>'s blessing the God of <hi>Sem:</hi> And to which of <hi>Sem</hi>'s stock could they repair, but to <hi>Abraham</hi> whom <hi>Sem</hi> himself (that King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and Priest of the high God (as some think) had blessed in the name of that high God. So that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Seed by <hi>Isaac,</hi> were Gods Standard bearers, to lift up Christ as an Ensign to the Gentiles: And to make these Standard-bearers higher by the head, than all other Nations, and the Ensign more conspicuous. God lifted that People up above all others, by signal favours while they walk'd in that way that he had appointed them, punish'd them double to any other trangressors, when they cast off the fear of <hi>Isaac,</hi> he built his glorious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongst them upon his own Hill, adorn'd his Worship with such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as at once rendred it august in the Eyes of Gentiles, and instructive to their minds: august as out-vying their Inventions in multitude, in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence: Instructive, as pointing to the bruised heel of the Womans Seed; as being so chargeable and toilsome, as it was not credible that any Nation should (by their own free choice) encumber themselvs with so burdensome a service, nor possible they could be induc'd to the embracing of it, by any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives inferiour to those dreadful appearances of the divine Majesty (at the promulgation of it) and Menacies annext to it. Add to all this, their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing in <hi>Aegypt</hi> (the Nursery of Idolatry) so many hundred years: Their settlement in <hi>Canaan;</hi> where the worship of Devils had taken deepest root; so near to <hi>Caldaea,</hi> where the Primitive Tradition had been first corrupted; The improvement of the Art of Navigation by <hi>Solomon;</hi> Their several dispersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into the utmost parts of the inhabited Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it will appear; that as the Earth was over-spread by degrees with people, and people grew to apostatize from the Catholick Religion; God sent this (then last) Edition of the Gospel after them; by the hand of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, bringing to their remembrance the almost forgotten Promise of the Womans Seed: And that therefore the Divine Grace administred to all men an occasion to seek after God: whom they might have found, if they would have sought him where he directed them: and whom all did find, who did not maliciously shut their eyes against the Light, shining in <hi>Judaea,</hi> in its full body (as the Sun in its Orb) and thence transmitting its Beams into the utmost Coasts of the World. Briefly, The Jews (setting aside the Covenant of Peculiarity, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of Earthly Promises and Carnal Ordinances) was only the Worlds Cock, to give it notice how the time past (till the Fulness of Time was come) to awake its drowsie eyes to wait for break of day; to profligat those paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lyons who had usurpt the Title of the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> to give notice, the Star of <hi>Jacob</hi> was not yet risen, and to direct them, by the voice of their Prophets, when and where to look for the promised Seed. In a word; they were not the Catholick Church, but a Nation of Priests, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated for the service of the Catholick Church, consisting of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, worshipping the true God, and waiting for Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Celsus</hi> his Exception, therefore, that Christian Religion opposeth the general Religion of the World, is manifestly false: for there never was any Religion universally profest (as that which bringeth Salvation to all) save the Christian; that is, Faith in the promised Seed; for Gentile Religions were calculated to particular Climes, but this publish'd to, and believed through the whole World.</p>

What he objects as to Sects of Christians, I answer, what ever Sect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes from the Catholick Church, and the common Faith ceaseth to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; that is, whoever rend themselves from that body of Believers (who in all Ages (before Christ and since) have held the common Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the blood of the Womans Seed;) become, as to Religion, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: and therefore the Church is not chargeable with them.</p>

                  <p>If when you speak of eternal Life (saith <hi>Celsus, lib.</hi> 8. 18.) you meant no more, than that you hope your Soul shall live for ever; I should cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assent to you, as rightly thinking, that they shall be happy that have lived well, and the unrighteous held in everlasting misery. From this Opinion, neither the Christian, nor any body else can recede: But to think that the Body shall be made immortal, is a Conceit that cannot enter but into rustick, impure, and brutish Animals. Why then did <hi>Plato</hi> think, that Souls separate have a kind of Body wherein they appeared about Sepulchres? <hi>(Orig. cont.

Lastly, why does this fleering Epicure deride

the Church for believing the everlasting Life of the Body, as a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible? Seeing the Philosophers are of Opinion, that the whole world is an Animal, a living Creature consisting of Soul and Body: and yet an Animal most blest and sempiternal. And that the Sun and the rest of the Planets have not only bodies (as every man's Eye may inform him) but Bodies animated, and (with these bodies of theirs) sempiternal, why cannot he, who hath given so bright and everlasting a Body to the Sun, cloath our Souls with Bodies, that shall shine as the Sun for ever, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> argues <hi>(de civitat.</hi> 10. 29.) expostulating with the Philosopers, for that they are forc'd to recede from their own Placits, while they argue against the Articles of our Faith. <hi>[Quid ergò est quòd cùm vobis fides Christiana suadetur tunc obliviscemini, aut ignorare vos fingitis, quòd disputare aut docere soleatis? quid causae est quod propter opiniones vestras quas ipsi oppugnatis Christiani esse nolitis?] [What's the matter, that while we argue with you to imbrace the Christian Faith, ye either forget, or feign your selves ignorant of, such things as you use to defend and teach? what's the matter that for the sake of those opinions of yours, which your selves oppose, you refuse to bocome Christans?]</hi>

                  <p>Can a fuller demonstration be required than this, that Christian Religion was deliver'd (at first) in that very Form, wherein it is now profes'd by the Church, and delineated in the Gospel? That the Rose of <hi>Sharon,</hi> the Lilly of the Vallies, which now sticks on the Churches bosome, is that which was planted by the hand of the Apostles, sixteen hundred years ago, may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd (beyond all possibility of doubt) by comparing it, with that, which grows among these Thorns, with the cuts and prints of it, in those Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals that were drawn on purpose to decry the Virtue of it.

               <p>§ 1. 1. THat Christ was born at such a time, of such a Mother, did such things, preach'd such Doctrine, as our Scriptures mention; the Jew (who was upon the place, and his Contemporary) had not the face to deny: as being things not done in a corner, but the greatest and most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of them, famously known to thousands of Eye and Ear-witnesses. The only Passage (in the whole Story of Christ) he offer'd to make excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against, was that of Christ's Resurrection: for the disproof of which he hired Soldiers, to say, that he was not risen, but his body stoln away by his Disciples. But now the positive part of their Testimony clearly confutes the Negative, and confirms the rest of the Evangelical Story, touching that matter: for if the Soldiers can tell, that his Disciples stole him away; then it is certain; that his Sepulchre was watch'd by them; that his body (the third day) was gone out of the Sepulchre; and that his Disciples said, he was risen. And this is as much as we need strive for, in this Question (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Matters of Fact reported by the Apostles) Whether this report were true or no! is another Question, whose final and irrefragable Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depends upon the probat of their divine Mission (of which anon:) For grant but this, that the Apostles (to whose Doctrine God set his Seal) did preach, that Christ rose again; and Gods Seal will go farther (with conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men) than the word of suborn'd Buff-coats: Soldiers are not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, men of over-tender Consciences: To weigh the Evidences, at present, in the Scales of common Sense: That Christ was conveighed out of the Grave (either by the hand of his divine Power, or of his Disciples) and that the Disciples said he was risen; is confes'd, is attested to, by the Soldiers: the only doubt remaining, is, whether in that Point wherein they differ, we are (in reason) to believe the Apostles, or Soldiers? The Apostles can shew Gods Hand and Seal, to confirm their Report; do with great power give evidence of Christ's Resurrection: we have only the Soldiers bare word, and the syllables of it not hanging well together: His Disciples (say they) stole him away while we slept: a company of armed men, set on purpose to watch, must certainly be asleep, if they let his Body be taken away by a few unarm'd and timorous persons, a few scatter'd sheep, now their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd was smitten, and on a dead sleep, if they were not awaken'd by that noise (they could not but make) in opening the mouth of the Sepulchre: it being shut up, with a great stone, firmly fastned in the Rock, with cramps of Iron soder'd into the Rock and Stone; and made as sure as could be, by the wit of his mortal enemies: <hi>Make it as sure as you can</hi> (saith <hi>Pilate) so they went and made the Sepulchre sure, sealing the Stone, Mat.</hi> 27. 65. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] they made the Sepulchre sure: as sure as a prison is, when the doors are fast lock'd; as feet are from getting out, when they are lock'd in the Stocks, <hi>Act 5. 23. Act.</hi> 16. 24. And this by sealing the stone, not as we seal bags (which makes them not fast, but is only a sign of honest dealing;) for no such sealing could have hindred the Disciples (if they had had a mind) to steal away the Lords Body: and therefore this sealing of the stone, could be nothing else, but their fastning it to the Rock, as hath been above expres'd, <hi>(Gaill</hi>'s Sacred Philosophy, <hi>art. 4. cap.</hi> 27.) But then (if they were on so dead a sleep) how can they tell what was done, or by whom it was conveighed away? They were awake (after the Body of our Lord was gone) when they saw, it was not in the Grave: and the Disciples were awake, those many times they saw him, and handled him, after his Resurrection. All say, they saw the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre empty, on Sunday morning, when they were broad awake: the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples say, they saw him alive after he was risen; and knew that Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he appear'd, to be that very Body which was crucified, by many infallible tokens. No (say the Soldiers) he did not rise again, but the Disciples stole away his Body; yet confess, they were asleep, while this was done: which is (in effect) to acknowledge they cannot tell, how it was conveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and to forbid all sober men to give assent to what they say, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Witnesses. Christ's Body we can assure you is not in the Sepulchre; but how it was removed thence, or by whom? ask them that can tell, for we were asleep. This is just like the evidence which <hi>Aemilianus</hi> gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Apuleius. (Apolog. pag. 295.) [Habuit</hi> Apuleius <hi>quaepiam linteolo involu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta: haec quoniam ignoro quae fuerint, iccirco Magica fuisse contendo: crede igitur mihi quod dico, quia id dico quod nescio.]</hi> Apuleius <hi>had certain things wrapt up in Linnen cloath: these, because I knew not what they were, I strongly affirm to have been some Magical Tools; that is,</hi> (as <hi>Apuleius</hi> truly represents to the Judges this Testimony) <hi>you must therefore believe me, because I affirm that of which I am wholly ignorant.</hi> And had the Chief Priests themselves believed the Soldiers Tale, why did they not send hue and cry after the Thief? why did they not rack those, that were famously known to be his Disciples, to make them confess where they had laid it? why did they not make privy search for it, while the sent was hot? Why did not the Soldiers, (if they had believ'd themselves) as soon as they awoke (and saw the stone roll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) disperse themselves several ways, in pursuit of those had stoln it? why did they not apply themselves (forthwith) to the Guards, at every Gate? to the Watchmen, that went up and down the City; with a <hi>[Saw ye not, heard ye not, can ye tell no tydings?]</hi> why was not <hi>Jerusalem</hi> all in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar at the news? How easily might the Discipies have been taken in the manner, who (by the Soldiers own confession) could not be gone far, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they awoke: for they had not time, (to shut the Cabinet, after they had stoln the Jewel) to roll the stone to the Sepulchres mouth again, after they had taken out the Corps; which certainly they would have done (had they not been prevented) on purpose to hide from the Soldiers so certain an indication of the removal of the Body, till they were got out of their reach. It had been worth the while to have turn'd every stone, to find whither the Disciples had convey'd it, that they might have laid it forth to open view of the people, to affront the Apostles preaching of the Resurrection: <hi>But the proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep</hi> (as their own Prophes, in a holy scorn and derision of them, had foretold) <hi>and in the hands of the mighty there is found nothing:</hi> Nothing, but this palpably feigned Tale, can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to prejudice the truth of Christ's Resurrection, by a Council of the subtilest and most implacable enemies Christs name ever had, and that, after whole nights plotting upon their pillow, (for they suspected Christ would rise from the dead) what to do? what to say, in case their fears should come to pass? yea, after comparing notes, and taking counsel together. Had they so drain'd their heads of devilish policy, in compassing Christs Death, as

they could invent nothing, to disprove his Resurrection by, but this pitiful shift? (as <hi>Euphranor</hi> bestow'd so much art in carving the Image of <hi>Neptune,</hi> as he could not tell how to go to work with the other Gods.) I begin (now) less to wonder at the observation I am upon, than I did, when I first took it up: It seemed strange to me, that Gospel-history should pass through so many Ages so currently, as not to meet with the least rational Contradiction (as to any Clause or Tittle of it) from any of those millions of desperate enemies it hath met with (all along in its passage down to us) save only in this case: But I see (in this very case) the Devils good will to oppose it, especially in this Article of the Resurrection; (this being that, wherein Christ triumphed over him; and we, in Christ; <hi>['Tis Christ that dyed, yea, rather that rose from the dead]</hi> is the <hi>acme</hi> of the Apostles glorying) And his want of skill, or power, or heart, to oppose it, ever since Christ tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed so gloriously over him (and his Instruments) in this Debate about his Resurrection; as no man (how great soever his enmity was against it) would so far under value his own Reputation, as to hazard it in gainsaying the Reports of the Gospel: So that this little Stone (ever since it was cut out of the Mountain) has not met with any contradiction, that could put it to a stop; but what it has with ease run over. I would not be too pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in affirming, what hath not been done; there may be more Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists against our Religion, than I have read: but this I may safely say, that after some considerable enquiry, and most serious perusal of all the ancient Authors opposing Christianity (that I could compass a sight off;) I have not read, nor heard of one person, who offered to assert himself, an Eye-witness, of any one thing, contrary to the Evangelical Story.</p>

[Herod <hi>putting away his own Wife, the Daughter of</hi> Aretas, <hi>the King of</hi> Arabia; <hi>and taking from his Brother (yet living) his Wife</hi> Herodias, <hi>had (not long after) War with</hi> Aretas: <hi>in which Battle</hi> Herod's <hi>host utterly perished: after which (for</hi> Herodias <hi>her sake, and through her ambition) he was deprived of his Kingdom, and, with her, banish'd to</hi> Vienna <hi>in</hi> France] What manner of man doth this speak the Baptist to have been, in the opinion of the people? when they impute <hi>Herod</hi>'s mishap to the murthering of him, rather than the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted sacred persons) or his own Children (a cruelty more than salvage) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which Barbarities, though <hi>Josephus</hi> declaims, yet he does not impute to them <hi>Herod</hi>'s falling into the displeasure of God, but to his beheading <hi>John.

This</hi> John <hi>commanded the Jews to embrace Virtue, to execute justice one towards another, to serve God in Piety, reconciling men by Baptism to Unity: for upon this account Baptism seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him a thing acceptable to God; if it were used, not for the remission of sins only, but for the purifying of the body, the soul being, first, cleansed from unrighteousness: he excited men to the studie of Virtue, but chiefly of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Justice, as also to the Laver of Baptism; which he then said was grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, when they did not give over this, or that, but all sins; and to minds, first purified by righteousness, added the purity of the body. (lib. 18. c. ap. 7.) And when as divers flocked after him (for they were greatly delighted in hearing him)</hi> Herod <hi>fearing, that so forceable a power of perswading, (as he was endowed with) might possibly lead the people into Rebelligon, sent him to</hi> Machaerous <hi>Castle.]</hi> How perfectly does this square with our Evangelists? as to his Doctrine of Repentance of Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the Opinion the Jews had of him, as a just Person: As to the occasion of his confinement and death; in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (and partly) <hi>Herods</hi> fear, that he might draw the people into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion (and therefore Christ, hearing of <hi>John</hi>'s Imprisonment (and the Pharisees muttering, that Jesus Baptised more Disciples than <hi>John)</hi> fearing that upon the same score he might be restrain'd, steps aside into <hi>Galilee,</hi> out of <hi>Judea;</hi> where he saw the people flocking after him, was looked upon with an evil eye <hi>(John</hi> 4. 1, 2.) as <hi>Scaliger</hi> well observes <hi>(de emendat. temp. lib.</hi> 6.)

               <p n="1">1. As to the Date of Christs publick Appearance, and being taken notice of; the Evangelists state, the dawning of it in the Baptists Ministry, in a manner immediately preceding Christ's Baptism. <hi>[In the fifteenth year of the Reign of</hi> Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate <hi>being Governour of</hi> Judaea, <hi>and</hi> Herod <hi>being Tetrarch of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and his brother</hi> Philip <hi>Tetrareh of</hi> Iturea, <hi>and of the region of</hi> Trachonitis, <hi>and</hi> Lysanias <hi>the Tetrarch of</hi> Abilene: Annas <hi>and</hi> Caiaphas <hi>being the high Priests;]</hi> with whom the History of <hi>Josephus</hi> will appear to synchronize in every Circumstance, if we first remove such rubs as are laid in our way by some too critical Scholiasts. As to that <hi>[In the fifteenth year of</hi> Tiberius.] The learned <hi>Vossius,</hi> that he may reconcile those Fathers to Scripture, who affirm'd that Christ suffer'd in the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius:</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth the years of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign <hi>[alone]</hi> and <hi>[with his Father]</hi> and conceives that St. <hi>Luke</hi> followed the Provincial Account, reckoning <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Reign from the time that <hi>Augustus</hi> made him his colleague, almost three years before his death: and the Fathers, the Roman Account of his reigning alone. But, first, as this great Critick missed the mind of the Fathers, who never dream'd of such a distinction, but grounded their opinions barely upon their misinterpretation of <hi>Isaiah 61. 2. [To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord]</hi> deeming that that Text limited Christ's Ministry to a precise year. They are of age, let them speak for themselves, by the mouth of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus (stromat.</hi> 1.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>[Christ was but to preach one year: for the Prophet speaking of him saith, The Lord hath sent me to preach an acceptable year.]</hi> And therefore he does but wash the Aethiopian, while he seeks to salve the matter. So, secondly, the Scheme which he himself draws upon this ground, runs foul upon his Author <hi>Josephus;</hi> while he assigns the beginning of <hi>Gratus</hi> his Presidency over <hi>Judaea,</hi> to the third year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign alone, which <hi>Josephus</hi> fastens to the beginning of his Reign, and mentions immediately after his coming to the Crown. And, thirdly, manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts St. <hi>Luke.</hi> For while he placeth the beginning of <hi>Gratus</hi> his Goverment, <hi>anno Tiberii 3. Christi</hi> 21. (seeing that <hi>Gratus</hi> continued that his Goverment cleven years) he is forc'd to place the beginning of <hi>Pilates</hi> Regencie; in the fourteenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign alone, and of Christ's thirty second; that is, two years at least after Christ's Baptism, upon his <hi>hypothesis:</hi> when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43715:170"/>
as the Evangelical Text saith expresly, that at the beginning of <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was Governour of <hi>Judaea,</hi> in the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> current, (the fifteenth of his Reign alone) not his twelfth: for <hi>Annius Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi> was President of <hi>Judaea,</hi> when <hi>Augustus</hi> dyed: and his successor <hi>Valerius Gratus</hi> continued President eleven years; who, if he began (as <hi>Vossius</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his third alone, <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twelfth alone, must be expired long before <hi>Pilate</hi> enter'd upon the Government.

And hardly in the date of his Passion, so as <hi>Pilate</hi> could in that time, before it, which he allows him (one year) bring his Family from <hi>Rome,</hi> and settle it in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> much less be a long time at enmity with <hi>Herod,</hi> (as the sacred Text asserts;) so that his <hi>hypothesis</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards that Article of the Creed <hi>[Suffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate] as well as cancels that part of sacred History <hi>[baptized under</hi> Pontius Pilate] I speak this in caution to others, not in disgrace of this excellent Person, to whose elaborate and judicious lucubrations we cannot ascribe too much praise, except we give them the divine honour of Infallibility. But the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the application of this distinction of the years of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to the Evangelical History, will be made more apparent in our proving of <hi>Josephus</hi> his concurrence with St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the several specified Circumstances of the Date of Christ's Story.</p>

And in the tenth Chapter of the same Book gives an account of <hi>Herod</hi>'s changing his Will the second time: for whereas in the first change, <hi>(Bel. Jud.</hi> 1. 21.) he had expung'd the name of <hi>Antipater</hi> (whom he caus'd to be put to death five days before his own,) and appointed <hi>Antipas</hi> to succeed him, passing by his elder Brethren <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> (upon some prejudice he had taken up against them, through the information of <hi>Antipater;)</hi> In his second change thereof, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Archelaus,</hi> the Elder Brother of <hi>Antipas,</hi> to be King: gave <hi>Philip Trachonitis,</hi> and the Country about it; and to <hi>Antipas</hi> the Tetrarchate of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee.

Now this last <hi>Herod</hi> dyed while he was at School at <hi>Rome (Bel.

Josephus</hi> puts a Key into our hands <hi>(Bel. Jud.</hi> 2. 8.) The Kingdom of <hi>Archelaus</hi> being reduc'd to a Province, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of <hi>Herod</hi>'s sons, to wit, <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> called <hi>Antipas</hi> govern'd their own Tetrarchates.</p>
                  <p>In this honour they both continued, from within one year, after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Birth, to within one year after <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Death; and one of them unto the Reign of <hi>Caligula:</hi> Of both which <hi>Josephus</hi> giveth this account, <hi>viz. Agrippa,</hi> (this was that <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> who was eaten up of worms) after six months grievous imprisonment by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was, at <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Death, not only set at Liberty by <hi>Caligula,</hi> but had the Kindom of <hi>Judaea</hi> bestowed on him, and the Tetrarchate of <hi>Philip,</hi> (but then newly deceas'd.) This Preferment of <hi>Agrippa</hi> did so sting <hi>Herodias,</hi> as <hi>Herod</hi> could have no rest from her importunities, till she had got him to <hi>Rome</hi> (in order to his strengthning his Court interest for his own, and against <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) But <hi>Agrippa</hi> so well plays his Game against his Uncle <hi>Herod,</hi> as he is forc'd to flee to <hi>Spain,</hi> and leave his Tetrarchate (by <hi>Caligula</hi>'s order) unto <hi>Agrippa (Antiq.</hi> 18. 9. 14.)</p>
                  <p>Neither doth <hi>Josephus</hi> only mention these two Tetrarchs as then in being, when our Saviour was upon earth, but all the Circumstances relating to them, recorded in sacred Writ. We read in the Gospel of <hi>Caesarea Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi (St. Matt.</hi> 16. 13.) so called because <hi>Philip</hi> the Tetrarch of a Village named <hi>Paneas,</hi> made it a City, and named it after <hi>Cesar,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>(Jud.

                     <hi>(Eccl. Hist. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 14.) I therefore mention this story at large, that the Romanists may see how little it makes for their Image-worship, seeing it was erected only, as a Monument of that benefit this Woman receiv'd, and had not divine honour conferr'd upon it, for all this miraculous effusion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtue into its Neighbour plant.

This touch given for the Cure of such impetuous Fluxes of indigested Notions, I return to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> concerning which <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> hath this story: That antiently the head of <hi>Jordan</hi> was reputed to be in its Confines, till <hi>Philip</hi> the Tetrarch by observing that the Chaff which he caused (for trials sake) to be cast into a Well an hundred and twenty Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from it, called <hi>Phiale,</hi> came out at the Springs of <hi>Jordan</hi> near <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea,</hi> discover'd that Well to be the head of it: from whence working like a Mole underground, till it came to <hi>Paneas,</hi> and there breaking out in two Fountains, it made those two Whirl-pools in the Caverns under the Earth, which swallowed up the Sacrifices, which the Pagan Priests once a year cast into <hi>Paneas,</hi> making the silly people believe it was miraculous. This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not for any mention is made hereof in sacred Writ; but for the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Story in <hi>Eusebius (Eecl. hist. l. 7. c.</hi> 14.) which he receiv'd from the mouth of <hi>Astyrius</hi> his familiars; how <hi>Astyrius</hi> by invocating the Name of Christ, caused the Sacrifice to swim at the top, by a miraculous power, contrary to that natural motion of it downward, and sucking of it in by the subterraneal <hi>Vorago,</hi> whence the Priests took occasion to abuse the Credulity of the Vulgar.</p>

over which Secular History, draws the same Line that the Evangelius do, though I have no instance at hand of any place in his brother <hi>Herod</hi>'s juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction made famous by our Saviours Converse, for the Lamb of God kept himself out of that Foxes walk, after he had murder'd his Fore runner, and was warned of <hi>Herod</hi>'s intent to kill him. I will therefore dismiss the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Topick, and conclude <hi>Herod</hi>'s Story with that of <hi>Herodias</hi> so frequently mention'd in sacred Scripture, of which, besides those that have already been specified, <hi>Josephus</hi> relateth these Circumstances: That so soon as <hi>Herod</hi>'s Wife, the Daughter of <hi>Aretas,</hi> perceiv'd the Regal Bed to smell rank of this Strumpet, not being able to endure to be nosed by a Sow with a gold Ring in her Snowt, having first removed her Court to <hi>Macheron,</hi> not then the Baptists Prison: for had <hi>John</hi> been then shut up there, she neither would have desired to remove thither, nor <hi>Herod</hi> have permitted her the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of a person, who had so openly declared himself in that Cause against <hi>Herodias,</hi> and was so well able to represent it in its most loathsome colours, to the World, if he had pleased; the fear whereof, through <hi>Herodias</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, made <hi>Herod,</hi> a while after confine the Baptist to prison in the Castle of <hi>Macheron:</hi> from whence, before he came there, the Daughter of <hi>Aretas</hi> was fled to her Father; who when he could neither prevail with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> to dismiss his Brothers Wife, nor with <hi>Philip</hi> to take her from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force of Arms, he himself begins a War, at first with <hi>Philip,</hi> hoping the fear of loosing her Daughters Inheritance, might force <hi>Herodias</hi> back to her own Husband, and loosen her from those incestuous Bonds, whereby, as the Fire-brand of <hi>Galilee,</hi> she was drawing an intestine War upon that Country. And when that succeeded not any farther than to the begetting in <hi>Philip</hi>'s subjects a grudge against <hi>Herod;</hi> for the convenient venting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they waited, even under <hi>Herod</hi>'s Banners, whither (upon <hi>Aretas</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them from their own habitations) they had repair'd; he turns his revenging Arms, whetted with a Fathers grief, and back'd with the justice of his Cause, upon his obscene Son-in-Law: to whose forces by the help of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Subjects, who (more resenting the injury <hi>Herod</hi> had done to the Daughter of <hi>Aretas,</hi> than that which <hi>Aretas</hi> had done to themselves) turn'd about to his Standard, in the heat of the battle: he gave so total a rout, as made the religious party of the Jews interpret that defeat to have been Gods revenge upon <hi>Herod,</hi> for his rejecting the Baptists Counsel, and delivering that good man up to the will of <hi>Herodias.</hi> And forc'd <hi>Herod</hi> to run puling to <hi>Caesar</hi> for aid against <hi>Aretas; Caesar</hi> orders <hi>Vitellius</hi> to stand by <hi>Herod;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whose joynt Forces, while <hi>Aretas</hi> is preparing to march, (with a great deal of confidence, as having been assured (by a Dream) that either he who lead the adverse Army, or he who appointed him to that undertaking, should fall by the stroak of death, before the Fight was ended.)

                  <p n="1">1. By divine Institution there could not be two High Priests at a time; for nothing but the death (either of Nature or in Law) of the High Priest could make way for the Succession of another. I ground this Distinction of death upon (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 26.) where <hi>Solomon,</hi> before he put <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Priesthood and <hi>Zadock</hi> in his room, tells <hi>Abiathar,</hi> that he was a man of death (a dead man in Law, having forfeited his life by Treason) worthy to dye: but for the service he had done for, and the sufferings he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone with his Father, he is content to remit that part of his punishment, and in room thereof confines him during life, to the City of the Priests, <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In rigid propriety of Speech therefore, those whom <hi>Herod,</hi> and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, or the Roman Deputies brought into the High-priesthood over the necks of one another, were none of them High Priests.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. However, the Office being necessary, and those whose Office it was by lawful Succession not being permitted to exercise it; that God, who will have mercy and not sacrifice, was pleased so far to wave his own right of instituting Successors in that Office by the death (the Key whereof he keeps in his own hand) of his Predecessor: as to own them for High Priests, whom that civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which he had set over that Nation, put into that Office. <hi>(Qod fieri non debuit, factum valet:)</hi> It was an Usurpation of the Magistrate over God, to put such persons into possession, but they being in the possession it was not then a time to dispute Titles; to have question'd subjection to them, as High Priests, would have been a greater Usurpation, and of more destructive consequence: and therefore we read not only that St. <hi>Paul</hi> excuseth himself for not treating <hi>Annanias</hi> with that respect, which was due to Gods High Priest: but that God himself vouchsafed to inspire <hi>Caiaphas</hi> with a spirit of Prophecy in honour of his Office, than which a more satisfactory evidence of Gods approbation could hardly have been given; this being, for kind, that wherewith God honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Moses,</hi> as that which should have stopt the mouths of all querulous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, <hi>[I have spoke face to face to my servant</hi> Moses, <hi>wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant</hi> Moses] <hi>(Num.</hi> 12. 18.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this would not satisfie the over-righteous Jewish zealots; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if those High Priests, whom the Deputies displac'd, were more deserving of the Office, more zealous of the Law, and more complying with their Principles, than those who were thrust into their rooms.</p>
                  <p>Now of all those of the Romans erecting, whom afterwards they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest, there was none after whom the Jews had so hankering a mind as this <hi>Annas</hi> in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Text: Of whom <hi>Josephus</hi> hath this Observation, That after he had enjoy'd the Priesthood a long while, he had five Sons bare that Office; and was of all men the most happy in the love of the people. <hi>(Jos. Ant.</hi> 20. 8.) It was, doubtless, the dissatisfaction which the people took at his deposition, which forc'd <hi>Valerius Gratus</hi> to thrust out, within a year, <hi>Ismael</hi> (whom he put into the room of <hi>Annas)</hi> and bestow that honour upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar</hi> the Son of <hi>Annas;</hi> which forc'd <hi>Vitellius</hi> to promote <hi>Jonathan,</hi> the Son of <hi>Annas,</hi> after the deposition of <hi>Caiaphas;</hi> which forc'd <hi>Agrippa</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Annas</hi> the younger, into the room of <hi>Joseph Cabi.</hi> And yet this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was not alone in partaking this favour of the people, so as to be reputed High Priest, after his Ejection: For <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Son (whom <hi>Vitellius</hi> made High Priest, in the room of <hi>Caiapas,</hi> and a while after deposed, putting

The like Privilege <hi>Ananias</hi> obtain'd, whom <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Calchis</hi> (having obtain'd of <hi>Claudius</hi> for himself and Successors the power of electing the High Priest, which was continued to them till after the Wars) put into the High Priesthood, a little before his own death, in the eighth of <hi>Claudius:</hi> And yet after that <hi>Quadratus,</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> had sent him bound to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the twelfth of <hi>Claudius,</hi> to answer what the Samaritans laid to his charge, as to his abetting the Galileans against them, and above ten years after that, when <hi>Ismael</hi> the Son of <hi>Phabeus, Joseph</hi> the Son of <hi>Cabi, Annas</hi> the Son of <hi>Annas, Jesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Damneus,</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> had possest the Priesthood, after his ejectment, he still retain'd the name of High Priest, even then <hi>Josephus</hi> writes him High Priest, when the doom which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had past was executed upon him; when this painted Wall was smitten and slain by the Robbers. <hi>(Jos.

Till when, from his deposition he grew daily (by his largess to the People, his caressing of the Governours, and their High Priests) into such favour with the People, as made him in effect the High Priest, and the High Priests themselves but shadows. <hi>(Joseph. ant. l. 20. c.</hi> 8.) This (by the way) is that <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, upon <hi>Cumanus</hi> sending him prisoner to <hi>Rome, Agrippa</hi> put <hi>Ismael</hi> into the High Priesthood: <hi>(l. 20. cap.</hi> 6.) upon the same reason that he put <hi>Joseph Cabi</hi> into <hi>Ismael</hi>'s room, when he understood that he was one of them who went to <hi>Rome</hi> to plead for the standing of that blind to his prospect into the Temple, which he would have had pull'd down <hi>(l. 20. c.</hi> 7.) Or if I mistake <hi>Josephus</hi> in this point; in this I am sure I do not; that <hi>Agrippa</hi> conferr'd the High Priesthood upon <hi>Ismael</hi> soon after <hi>Faelix</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Office, and his own repair into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and long enough before St. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought before the Council. This might put a wise man to a stand, in determining who was then High Priest, there being in that juncture three that bore that name and repute (according as the interest of several Sects, lead them to like or dislike,) to wit, this <hi>Ananias,</hi> a Sadducee; <hi>Jonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> a Pharisee (and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s crying he was a Pharisee was in design not only to secure himself from the fury of the rabble (by dividing them) but to prevent this whited walls falling upon him, (in revenge of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s affronting him;) and <hi>Ismael</hi> whom the lawful power had estated (though perhaps unduly) in that Office, and whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore meant to be the true High Priest, and the pragmatical <hi>Ananias</hi> only a shadow. For I cannot think he intended to assert there was then no High Priest at all; for what had that been but to equivocate? seeing those he replyed to, had not yet heard him, or any other Apostle preach Christ to be the true High Priest, and therefore could not be thought to have any other conception of that Title than the common Notion: neither would they have permitted such a Reply, as he gave, to have past without examination, if they had not had some person in their eye, to whom that Office did more legally appertain than to <hi>Ananias.</hi> Neither could <hi>Paul</hi> be ignorant what <hi>Ananias</hi> was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he meant, as his Reply plainly imports, that he knew <hi>Ananias</hi> was not the High Priest, there being another; to wit, <hi>Ismael</hi> preferr'd to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the same Authority from whence he had formerly receiv'd the High Priesthood. In which particular as he vindicated the honour of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in bestowing it where it was due; and gratefully pleads for that

But let the Learned judge as they please of this Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Reply; That to have two High Priests at once in those times, (one legally invested by the Roman Authority, and another factiously adhered to, as unjustly deposed: The one called in scorn the Kings High Priest, as ordained by man only; the other in honour, the Lords High Priest, as elected of God, and judged to be so by the Lords people, as that si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In my stating St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denials in the house of <hi>Annas;</hi> which as it may be evinc'd by those Reasons which he alledgeth (to which I refer the Reader) so it is more than probable by this, that <hi>Annas</hi> was the High Priest of the Faction, from his female attendants, and their pragmaticalness, Damsels waiting in the Hall, and keeping the door, as busie with St. <hi>Peter</hi> below, as their Master was with his above; whose Zeal to the Cause, either would not permit them to go to bed, or rowsed them thence at the news of our Saviours apprehension; that Sex being made up more of Passion than Reason, are mark'd out in sacred Writ as most obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to seduction and aptest to be proselyted into a Faction. As to the rest, the observing how inconsiderable a while our Saviour was before <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> as it intimates the satisfaction of the Jews in the Sentence of <hi>Annas,</hi> and that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was only their Stalking-horse, to give a Form of Law to their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being that Person without whose previous Juridical Sentence, <hi>Pilat</hi> would not have proceeded against our Saviour; so it perfectly reconciles the Evangelists, without putting us upon the miserable shift of crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pilat</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> or <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Annas</hi> into one joynt habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Notwithstanding that <hi>Annas,</hi> though deposed, was adhered to by the Faction, as the Lord's High Priest, in conformity to which Notion St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls him High Priest; (as <hi>Moses</hi> in compliance with vulgar apprehension stiles the Moon one of the great Lights, though she be the least of those God hath set in the Firmament.) Yet <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> at the beginning of <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry, and at the Passion of our Saviour, was indeed the lawful High Priest, as being put into that Office by the Minister of God, the Roman power ordain'd of God over the Jews. To this <hi>Josephus</hi> gives his suffrage <hi>(Ant. l. 18. c.</hi> 3. and 6.) <hi>Valerius Gratus</hi> took the High Priesthood from <hi>Annas,</hi> and gave it to <hi>Ismael;</hi> a while after he bereaves <hi>Ismael</hi> of it, and bestows it on <hi>Eleazar;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth <hi>Eleazar,</hi> after he had enjoy'd that honour a year, and sets up <hi>Joseph</hi> sirnamed <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> in which Office he left him, when he went out of his own: and of which <hi>Caiaphas</hi> held possession till <hi>Vitellius</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> turn'd him out, and put in <hi>Jonathan,</hi> at what time he received order from <hi>Tiberius</hi> to conclude a peace with <hi>Artabanus,</hi> so near the Death of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> as <hi>Pilat</hi> whom <hi>Vitellius</hi> turn'd out of Office, and sent at the same time to <hi>Rome</hi> to answer for his Male-administrations, found him dead when he arrived there. <hi>Josephus</hi> indeed does not write <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the Son-in-Law of <hi>Annas</hi> (it not being his wont to set down any Relations but that of Father

and Son in his Catalogue of High Priests) but he writes <hi>Annas</hi> old enough to have been his Father-in-Law in his mentioning <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Son of <hi>Annas</hi> to have been High Priest before <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> So that hitherto the Chronology of St. <hi>Luke</hi> keeps time perfectly with the forreign and secular Account.</p>

                  <p>§ 7. There is one passage in <hi>Josephus</hi> which hath found the greatest wits works enough to reconcile it to sacred Chronology, and gives a better ground for <hi>Vossius</hi> his distinction, of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign with <hi>Augustus,</hi> and alone, than I elsewhere meet with, as seeming to force upon us either the rejecting of <hi>Josephus</hi> his Authority, or the concluding that St. <hi>Luke</hi> calculates <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his years from <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Colleagueship with <hi>Augustus.</hi> The place of <hi>Josephus (Antiq.</hi> 18. 8.) is this: <hi>At this time dyed</hi> Philip <hi>the Brother of</hi> Herod <hi>in the twentieth year of</hi> Tiberius <hi>his Empire; after he had justly and prudently managed his Tetrarchate, thirty seven years.</hi> The Knot this: If <hi>Herod</hi> had been dead thirty seven years in the twentieth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and our Saviour but thirty years of age in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth, Christ's thirty seventh falls in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twenty second, and by that acount he must be born two years after <hi>Herod</hi>'s death, at which <hi>Philip</hi> his Son enter'd upon his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarchate. If in solution hereof it be said, that <hi>Josephus</hi> reckons the years of <hi>Tiberius</hi> from the beginning of his Reign alone, but St. <hi>Luke</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Colleagueship with <hi>Augustus:</hi> that will make Christ's thirty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth fall in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twentieth, and give room to date his Birth about half a year before <hi>Herod</hi>'s death: for if Christ was thirty years of age in <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his fifteenth, from his Colleagueship with <hi>Augustus,</hi> he must be thirty two, and almost an half at <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth from his Reign alone, and by consequence thirty seven, at the twentieth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> alone; five added to Christ's thirty two, making him thirty seven, and five added to <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth, making his Empire twenty years old. But then we contract a worse snarle, and must be forc'd to date our Saviours Baptism before <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Presidencie, which so palpably contradicts St. <hi>Luke,</hi> (giving this as one of the Characters of the time of Christ's Baptism, that it was when <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> was president of <hi>Judaea)</hi> as we break the Evangelist's head in thus

For if <hi>Philip</hi> was but Tetrarch full thirty six years in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twenty second, and Christ had begun thirty one in the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> his thirty eighth must be begun in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twenty second, and so his Birth stated one compleat year, and a good part of another before <hi>Herod</hi>'s death. But because I presume the Quotation out of <hi>Josephus</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death in the twenty second of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was the mistake of the Printer (for the place in <hi>Josephus</hi> specifies the twentieth year) I will, at present, lay no greater stress upon this Argument, than what may incline the ingenuous Reader, not to think me immodest in this Proposal: That perhaps, what befel <hi>Scaliger</hi> by the Press, might happen to <hi>Josephus</hi> by an inobservant Pen; and that twenty might be crept into his Text, instead of twenty two or twenty three, until I give him out of <hi>Josephus</hi> himself the Reason of this my surmise; to wit, That his dating <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twentieth, will no way consort with those stories, which (he saith) bore the same date with <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death: such as <hi>Pilat</hi>'s being turn'd out of Office, which in all reasons, could not be long before the Death of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in the twenty third of his Reign; which yet he layeth in the precedent Chapter: And that of <hi>Vitellius</hi> his making peace with <hi>Artabanus,</hi> and his procuring him to send his Son an hostage to <hi>Tiberius:</hi> to which he immediately subjoyns the Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death with this Chain, [<gap reason="foreign">

               <argument>
                  <p>The Date of Christ's Birth, as it is asserted by the Church, maintain'd by Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>Christ homaged by the</hi> Magi <hi>early after his Birth. § 2. Christ born and baptized the same day of the year. § 3. God would have the Church observe the day of Christ's Birth. The Priestly courses, the character of it, which from their first Institution by</hi> Solomon, <hi>to the last and fatal year of the Second Temples standing, were never interrupted. § 4. The Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these Courses leads us to the Conception and Birth of the Baptist and our Saviour. § 5. Christ's Baptism, and</hi> John's Ministry <hi>in the same year of</hi> Tiberius <hi>Reign, point out the same thing, Objections answer'd. § 6. The Taxing of all the World ill-confounded with that of</hi> Syria.</p>
               <p>§ 1. ANd now neither St. <hi>Luke</hi> nor <hi>Josephus</hi> need be beholding to <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> for endeavouring if not to make them friends, yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being so far at odds; by his interpreting <hi>Josephus,</hi> to speak of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death in the thirty seventh incompleat year of his Government, (an Article of Agreement which this Text of <hi>Josephus</hi> will not subscribe to <hi>[after that he had presided over</hi> Trachonitis <hi>thirty seven years])</hi> for we may allow <hi>Philip</hi> to have been Tetrarch thirty seven, and to have been well gone in his thirty eight year, at the pacification, in the twenty third of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and yet allow to Christ's Birth, time enough before <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death to do all that in, which sacred Scriptures reports him to have done. Thus Christ was thirty compleat in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth, <hi>December</hi> 25. his thirty seventh year compleat, therefore falls in the twenty second of <hi>Tiberius, December</hi> 25. and his thirty eighth current from thence overtakes <hi>Tiberius</hi> his twenty third, the 19. of <hi>August</hi> following; at what time <hi>Philip</hi>'s Government had been going in its thirty eighth year, but from the middle of <hi>March.</hi> If we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will take the Universal Churches word, for this; that our Saviour was born, <hi>December</hi> 25. by so much sooner did Christ's thirty eighth commence, than the thirty eighth of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Government, as Christmas preceds the middle of <hi>March.</hi> So that this does not only reconcile Secular and Sacred History; but afford us a place, where we may fix our feet, and stand our ground, in the defence of the Churches practice, against all those opposers, who employ their wit in removing old Land-marks. And therefore, for vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Churches celebrating Christ's Nativity on the 25. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> I shall improve this occasion in laying down these propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>

                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 1. Whatever the Gospel reports, touching the Occurrences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Saviour's Birth, and <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death, might (in all reason) fall out, in as small a parcel of time, as intervenes betwixt Christmas and mid <hi>March</hi> next ensuing (at which time of the year; to wit, at the beginning of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san, Herod</hi> came to his miserable end: as <hi>Scaliger</hi> observeth out of <hi>Josephus;</hi> and proveth, from the Celebration of his Funeral, a little before the Feast of unleaven'd Bread.) For, the <hi>Magi</hi> found Christ at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> whither they were sent by <hi>Herod</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] (St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. 8.) where they could not have found him, had they not tender'd their homage to him, before he was presented in the Temple, at the Purification of his ever blessed Virgin-mother; but in <hi>Galilee,</hi> whither they returned, (as to their home) from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> after they had performed those things in the Temple which the Law required <hi>(Luk.</hi> 2. 39.) neither is it like, that after the <hi>Magi</hi> had enquired that at the Priests lips, and been informed (out of so cleara Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy) that the King of the Jews was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> God, who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43715:177"/>
had been so rich in grace towards them, as to shew them Christ's Star, in their own Country) would put the Faith of such young Proselytes to so great a trial; as to put their hopes of finding him at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to a disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, by his removal thence, before they found him: for had he been then in any place else, but where they were directed by Prophecy to look for him: at how great a stand and uncertainty, if not despondency, must they have been? I need not here urge, that the word [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] which we translate the house <hi>(Matt. 2. 11.) [and when they were come into the house, they saw the young Child with</hi> Mary <hi>his mother:]</hi> does more properly signifie an out-house (such as a Stable) than a dwelling house: at least, indifferently, an habitation for Men, for Cattle, and for Birds (as <hi>Scapula</hi> observes) which speaks it probable that the <hi>Magi</hi> in their visit, prevented that Office, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charity, of removing the blessed Babe and his Mother out of that cold Lodging, into a more convenient one; and found the Wisdom of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Beasts that have no understanding. Nor that St. <hi>Matt.</hi> in his [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] seems to imply, that the <hi>Magi</hi> came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the very point of Christ's Birth; and enquired after the place thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, perhaps, that he was just then born, by the indication of that Light in the Air, which shone upon the Shepherds, and which they might, (by as many degrees of greater probability) see, rather from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> than their own homes, as their was degrees of difference betwixt the places, in point of distance from <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> Nor lastly, to shew how manifestly all this makes, for the justifying of the Churches Fidelity, in communicating this Doctrine to her Children, that the last appearance of the Star to the <hi>Magi,</hi> and their homaging our Saviour, was on that very day which we celebrate in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, that is the twelfth day after our Lords Nativity:</p>
               <p>For, 1. <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was not so far from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as persons so inquisitive, and upon the spur, would spend many days in journeying thither, after they had informed themselves touching the place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Herod</hi> would not be long of easing himself of the fear of a Rival-King, by putting all the Children of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to the Sword, of whom, (in point of age) he might entertain the least suspicion; to wit, <hi>[all of two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men</hi> (St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. 16.) not that it was two years since he had enquired, but that the Wise men informed him it was so long since they first saw the Star: and he questioning, whether it was an indication, that the <hi>Messias</hi> was then born, when it first appeared; or a <hi>Praeludium</hi> to the Star of <hi>Jacob;</hi> to make all sure, on either hand, he slays all the Infants that were born within the Precincts of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> from its first appearance, unto the time he sent out his bloody Executioners.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. But because this is an Argument only <hi>à posse,</hi> and therefore does not prove it necessary that Christ was born at Christmas. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore urge some that are more cogent, drawn from these undoubtedly true Chronological Observations; compared with the date of our Saviours Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry. After I have, by way of preparation thereunto, laid down and cleared the justifiableness of that Universal Opinion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That our Savour was born and baptized on the same day of the year: <hi>(eàm<expan>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] <hi>As for our keeping the Feast of the Nativity and Baptism, we have very good reasons for what we do; first, the Example of all Churches beginning from the Apostles; secondly, the Word of God;</hi> for St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives Testimony of this (that our Saviour was born and baptized both on one day of the year <hi>(Vide Scaliger Ibid.)</hi> And <hi>Beroaldus Chronic. (l. 4. c.</hi> 2.) where he proveth from the joynt-Testimony of Authority, that the Birth and Baptism of our Saviour were celebrated and fell out on the same day of the year, though in computing Christ's Age when he was Baptized, he assigneth it to the beginning, that is the first day of his thirtieth year initiant; but therein he is sufficiently confuted by <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> who, from the plain Grammatical sence of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Phrase, evinceth, that Christ was baptized the last day of his thirtieth, and first of his thirty first. However this will make no difference here, for be it first or last, it comes all to one, as to the vindicating of this commonly-received Truth, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> dates Christ's Birth and Baptism on the same day. But for the Reasons pre-alledged I adhere to <hi>Scaliger.</hi> And therefore, if you demand where St. <hi>Luke</hi> testifies this? I answer; where, he saith, that Jesus, when he was baptized, was thirty years of age: that is, on that day, which terminated his thirtieth, and gave beginning to his thirty first. Secondly, and if St. <hi>Luke</hi> had not thus punctually delineated the Time of Christ's Age, when he exhibited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Baptist, as a Candidate for Ordination. Yet the same thing might be collected from that Law (under which the Law-giver put himself, that he might fulfill all righteousness) prohibiting the Priests, to officiate till they were thirty, and commanding them, then to enter upon the exercise of their sacred Function. (Numb. 4. <hi>They shall serve from thirty years old and upwards.)</hi> By virtue of this Law, Christ would have been a Transgressor, had he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded himself into the sacred Ministry, before his thirtieth year was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated: and therefore till then, he doth not shew himself to <hi>Israel,</hi> no not to his own Parents (for his Mother was uninstructed in the knowledge of her Son) not to his Fore-runner (for the Baptist, though he knew Christ was in the croud, yet who was he, he knew not, till he saw the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending upon him) but kept at home, and was subject, to and under the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Father and Mother. So wide is that Gloss from the sence of that Text, (where we have account of Christ's being amongst the Doctors) which stiles it, Christ's disputing with them, which was nothing else, but his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting himself at twelve years, as an Israelitish Catechumen, to ask the Law (the Tearms of the Covenant, which he enter'd when he receiv'd Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision) and to receive their Answers, to what he propounded, or to answer their Questions (not as their Doctor, but Scholar:) and upon his examen, and their approbation of him (who sate in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair) perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to enter into that Covenant, which his Sureties had enter'd into in his name, at his Circumcision. The Work of his Father which he had there to do, was to be a Scholar, not a Teacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43715:178"/>
And on the other hand, he would not have been an exact fulfiller of that Law, if he had delaid the tender of himself to Ordination, beyond the time fixt by the Law, and not applyed himself to the Baptist, at whose laying hands upon him, he knew, he was to receive the Holy Ghost, and be visibly separated to that Work, which his Father had fore-ordained him to, assoon as ever he was legally capable of it, in respect of Age: upon this account Christ urged the Baptist in these words <hi>[suffer it now, for thus it behoves us to fulfill all righteousness,]</hi> Christ had no need to be baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism (the Baptism of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for remission of sins) neither did he receive that Baptism: but <hi>John</hi>'s Baptizing of him, was of another kind, than his Baptizing of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; to wit, and external Rite, in the administration whereof, Christ was to be visibly set apart, and called by God to his Office of Preaching, (See Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi>'s Annot.) the Law, therefore, the Righteousness whereof Christ fulfill'd, in being baptized by <hi>John,</hi> was that which prohibited Prophets to run, till they were sent of God. But this was not all the Righteousness which Christ fulfill'd now, but also of that other Branch of the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, whom God had separated to the service of the Sanctuary, to enter upon that Function, as soon as they were thirty years of Age: and therefore our Saviour inserts this note of time [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>suffer it [now]</hi> now, that the impediment of Age is removed, I must not defer my entrance upon the work of Teaching: Nay, if there had not been such a Law, Christ's Love to us would have been a Law to himself. He, who when the time was come that he should be offer'd, was straightned till his Baptism of blood was accomplish'd, that went into the Garden to meet the Traytor; would sure not be well at ease, when the time was come (assigned by the Law of his Father) that he should be inaugurated in the Office of the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, till he was baptized with that Baptism, of Water by <hi>John,</hi> and of the Holy Ghost, by his Father, by which he was to be consecrate to that Office. Would this tender Shepherd of Souls, for his love and for his pitty, let a day pass, after the removal of the impediment of Under-age, before he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a capacity of seeking and saving the lost Sheep of <hi>Israel!</hi> How have they learned Christ, either as to his Obedience to his Father, or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to his Brethren, who scruple the belief of this point, which the Primitive Church Universally embraced upon so good and solid Reasons, as who so questions the force of them, must present the blessed Jesus to their own minds, as a person that cared not what the Father said, not what we ail'd.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. This being concluded on, and laid for a Ground, that Christ's Birth and Baptism fell on the same day of the year, I proceed with this Light before me, (by the help of those Chronological Observations I have, or shall irrefragably make good,) to find out the Day of Christ's Nativity.</p>
               <p>The Mother of <hi>John</hi> Baptist was going in her sixth month at the Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Blessed Virgin, and Conception of Christ (St. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 36.) <hi>[And loe thy cousin Elizabeth hath conceived a son</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43715:178"/>
before the Baptist's Conception, if that Rule had not been both sure and applicable to this Question. He would never have beaten the Air with those Chronological Descriptions of it, had it been vain for us to know the time, or impossible for us to find it out (so manifestly false is that Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Conceit, which the Novelist propounds as his main Principle, to wit, that God hath conceal'd the time of Christ's Nativity, (as he did the Body of <hi>Moses)</hi> to prevent our observation of it: and so dim-sighted was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious <hi>Beroaldus</hi> at noon-day, who though he confesses <hi>(Chronic. l. 4. c.</hi> 2.) that the ignorance of the day of Christ's Birth proceeds from meer supine sloath in not sifting those means of its discovery which God hath propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us: and if we could tell when, or how long <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s Course begun and continued: the Question would quickly be determin'd: yet waves that enquiry, as a fruitless undertaking: chusing rather to pin that Character of time, assigned by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s sleeve, as denoting only his Reign (to which it cannot possibly have the least relation) than to fasten it upon the Baptists Conception, where St. <hi>Luke</hi> so manifestly fixeth it, as he must be blind, that sees not the drift of the Evangelist in this and the other forementioned marks of time, to be the leading us by the hand to the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of the Baptists, and, by it, our Saviours Birth. I will therefore follow the Conduct of Gods Spirit, and this Holy Angel, in pursute after the knowledge of that acceptable day, which God would not have the Church either ignorant, or unmindful of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These several twenty four courses of Priests (by the Computation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Holy Ghost directs us to the Time of Christs Conception and Birth by comparing them with the Baptists) served their week about [<gap reason="foreign">

Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve here, that rather than they would break the Order of the Courses, by permitting (even in that case of extream necessity) any other Division to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate, than that whose lot it was to attend that week, they will omit the service it self, on one of the most solemn Fasts they had in the whole year. When notwithstanding they were so zealous of this, as nothing else but meer force, could procure them to wave the daily sacrifice; of the continuance whereof they were more sollicitous than of their own safety. Hence when the Temple was besieged by <hi>Sosius,</hi> all the request they made to him was, that he would permit Beasts for the daily Sacrifice to be brought in <hi>(Joseph antiq. 14. c. ult.)</hi> of which <hi>Dion</hi> also, a Gentile Historian makes mention <hi>(lib.</hi> 49.) when <hi>Pompey</hi> besieged <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he with greatest wonder observ'd that they intermitted nothing of their Religion, in the midst of arms: but as if they had enjoy'd the greatest peace, did offer their daily Sacrifices and Victims: and while his Soldiers were upon the slaughter of the Citizens, and put them daily to the Sword (even before the Altar) they abstain'd not from that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, which by their Law they were to celebrate day by day [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] Nay, the Priests when they saw the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers rushing into the Temple (with drawn swords) did undauntedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe, in fulfilling their Divine Courses, and were themselves sacrificed to the Roman revenge in the very instant when they were offering Victims to God, and burning Incense: preferring the discharge of their Office before their Lives <hi>(Josep. Bel. Judaic. l. 1. c.</hi> 5.) Yet how zealous soever they were of maintaining the daily Service, they were more zealous of observing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Priests and Levites Courses: For at this time, when the daily O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation ceas'd, there were Priests enough in the Temple <hi>(Josephus,</hi> in the place above quoted, writeth that when <hi>Titus</hi> sent him to <hi>John,</hi> the Captain of the Templars, upon occasion of his hearing that the daily Sacrifice was interrupted: many Priests, (by name <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Jesus)</hi> taking that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, made their escape out of the Temple to <hi>Titus;</hi> and therefore it was not simply for lack of Priests, but Priests of that Course, whose Lot it was then to officiate, that the Divine Service ceas'd: whence appears the invalidity of <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Herculean Argument, for the abruption of the Priests Courses, when the daily Oblation was taken away by <hi>Antiochus:</hi> for they placed more Religion in keeping their Courses, than in performing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and therefore might possibly stand in <hi>[procinctu]</hi> according to their Lots, when they were prohibited, (by main force) to offer sacrifice, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the removal of that force. Whatever therefore befel the daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Josephus</hi> his [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] affirming, that the Courses set by <hi>David</hi> were not interrupted unto his time, is proof sufficient, that the Priests Courses kept their course.</p>
               <p>But since it is questioned by some, whether in the several Apostacies during the first Temple, those Courses were canonically observed? And determin'd by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that during the persecution under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the Second Temple (upon which Principle he proceeds, to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Ancient and Catholick Opinion <hi>[that our Saviours Birth was on the 25. of</hi> December.] So that nothing need be said more, in reply to his reasoning, and vindication of the Church, than to shew his mistake, in that point which he so peremtorily asserts, and the groundlessness of his and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned mens questioning upon that account, the cessation of the Priests Courses, I shall prove from sacred Testimony, that no such cessation fell out, either under the First or Second Temple, nor till the year of the last Temples Fall, and the last part of that year: when God was departed from the Temple, as <hi>Josephus</hi> himself testifieth to his Country-men's faces, <hi>(Bel.

               <p>wherein speaking of the Desolation of the First Temple, they introduce the Priest, whose Course it was then to wait, thus lamenting. <hi>[On the ninth day of the month, at the hours of the Evening-sacrifice, when I was in my Course; the Course of</hi> Joiarib. (to whom fell the first lost, 1 <hi>Chron. 24. 7.) the enemy enter'd,</hi> &amp;c.] which could not have been his Course, if the Order of serving had been computed, either from <hi>Hezechias</hi> or <hi>Josias,</hi> his setting the Priests in order. But falls out exactly to be his lot, if we reckon from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Dedication (as that never to be sufficiently praised Keeper of the Clock of Time hath demonstrated, in his Fragments annext to his Emendation) And that there was no cessation of these Courses under the First Temple may be irrefragably evidenc'd from that plain Text <hi>(Ezech. 44. 15.) [The Priests that kept the charge of my Sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from me after their Idols; they shall come near to me to minister, and they shall stand before me to offer.]</hi> And they are rebuk'd by that Prophet, that did not keep Gods charge by course in their own person (whether in compliance with the Court-interest under idolatrous Kings, or in scorn of those meaner Offices, to which their lot assign'd them, (for the several services was distributed by lot weekly, amongst the Priests of every Course at their entrance upon their service, whence it is said of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> that <hi>[his lot was to burn incense])</hi> subro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated others in their room (just as our Pulpit-Pearchers (either in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Rabble of their brainless Proselytes, or out of scorn, after the promotion to a Lecturer's place, to stoop so low as the Desk,) used to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Minister of the Parish to read the Divine Service to the Walls; but yet with so much more impious contempt, as the offering of the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice excell'd the kindling of a fire, or sweeping away the ashes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: the Common-Prayer being that very daily Incense, and pure Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God promised should be offer'd in all places under the Gospel, and as far surpassing the best Pulpit-exercises, both in point of preaching the pure Gospel, and praying according to the Will of God, as the most rational Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice surpasseth the Sacrifice of Fools.) This irreligious shifting of the charge of God's holy things to others, God taxeth and menaceth the Jewish Priests for. <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. <hi>[Ye have not kept the charge of my holy things, but have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for your selves.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Not under the Second Temple; as appears, from Gods Promse to the Priests who had kept his charge under the First, that they should stand before him in their Courses under the Second Temple <hi>(Ezcch. 44. 15. 16.) [They shall keep my charge]</hi> which as it is every whit as good a <hi>medium,</hi> for the probat of a Non-cessation under the Second; as the pre-alledged Text (which <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> urgeth to that purpose) is for the proof of a Non-cessation under the First Temple: so it might seem strange how it could escape the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Eagles-eye; (but that we see it usully thus fall out, when men approach sacred ground, with their shooes on their feet; address themselves to sacred Scripture, prepossess'd with their own Conclusions; and do not strip themselves of all private preconceptions, when they come to enquire for Truth, at that sacred Oracle. But to proceed; the Non-cessation of these Courses, during either Temple, is clearly asserted by God himself, in his Promise to <hi>Zadok:</hi> whom <hi>Solomon</hi> advanced, (at the deposition of <hi>Abiathar,)</hi> to fulfill Gods threatning to <hi>Elie</hi>'s house (1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. 27.) and of whom <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> carried from God to <hi>Elie,</hi> this Message (1 <hi>Sam. 2. 35.) [I will raise me up a faithful Priest, and he shall walk before mine anoynted for ever.]</hi> Which Promise never receiv'd accomplishment in any other sence but this; to wit,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43715:180"/>
that the Priesthood in that Line, should keep their Stations or Courses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, till the rejection of the whole Nation. For in all other points the Priestly Office had been interrupted, they did not walk before God, or his anoynted perpetually, in their offering of Sacrifices, or actual performance of their charge of holy things; but only in their standing in their Courses, ready to perform their several charges, when the impediments were removed: they stood in their weekly lots perpetually, (waiting for times of refreshing, and break of day,) in the darkest nights of interruption of actual services, which befel them during the standing of both Temples. And this is farther evident from the deep silence of the Jewish Records, as to any interruption of their Courses, till the year that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was desolated by <hi>Titus:</hi> of which we should certainly have heard (as well as of that last and final Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe thereof) had such an accident befaln them. They who kept a Fast, for the extinction of the holy Lamp (through want of Oyl by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Priest, whose Lot it was to supply it) in the Reign of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> (on the 18. of <hi>Ab.)</hi> in Commemoration of the Israelites, ceasing to present their First-born in the Temple under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> (the 23. of <hi>Sirvan)</hi> in memory of <hi>Gedoliah</hi>'s slaughter (the 3. of <hi>Tisri)</hi> of the bickerings betwixt the Schools of <hi>Shammai</hi> and <hi>Hillel,</hi> and more contingencies of far less concern <hi>(lib. anga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarum)</hi> would sure have celebrated the day, whereon so sad an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had happened, in the afflicting of their Souls: but more of this anon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The only Scruple (then) remaining is, what became of these Courses, in the interval betwixt the two Temples, during the Babylonish Captivity. It is commonly taken for granted, that they then ceas'd: and if they did, it will not prejudice my account: for if we begin at <hi>Zorobabel</hi>'s restoring of the Hierarchical Courses, the Lot will fall orderly upon the Course of <hi>Abias,</hi> (wherein <hi>Zachary</hi> serv'd, wherein he receiv'd the Promise of a Son) in such a time of the year, as thence may be demonstratively evinc'd the Time of Christ's Nativity to have been at that season, wherein the Church celebrates the memorials of it.</p>
               <p>To which Calculation I find the account drawn from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Temple, to agree so perfectly; as encourageth me to assert (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hesitance,) that the Courses of the Priests, during that long Vacation of the exercise of their Function, were reckon'd by <hi>Zorobabel</hi> (much more, in that short interruption under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> by <hi>Judas Maccabeus)</hi> at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing them to the actual serving in their proper Courses; as vertually ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd, (as the years of the Reigns of exil'd Princes are put into the account at their Restauration, as if they had actually during the time of their Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exercised the Royal Function.) So that from the fall of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the Babylonians (in the 1. Course, the Course of <hi>Joiarib)</hi> there had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weeks passed, unto the 3. of <hi>Adar</hi> (when at the Dedication of the Second Temple, the Priests were set in their Divisions) as the same division was then appointed to serve; whose Course it would have been to serve, had the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice not been interrupted; for otherwise their putting in Order, would have been a putting them out of Order, and an injury to those Families, whose turn by the Series of intervening years (according to <hi>David</hi>'s Order) fell out before theirs, who first served at that Dedication, by the appointment of <hi>Zorobabel:</hi> And indeed what use can be made of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s mentioning the eighth Course in our Calculations of the Time therein pointed at, if it was not the eighth course from the first Institution?</p>
               <p>§ 4. This will be both more intelligible and apparent, if we compute the Courses themselves. In order whereto (though I plough with <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, I shall not let her run wild over the ancient bounds, but accustom her to bear the Churches yoak, and inure her to tread out the good Corn of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Verity) I shall first premise these two infallible dictates of that great Oracle of Chronology.</p>

1. The compleat Cycle, or Period of Time, wherein the twenty four Courses of Priests (appointed by <hi>David,</hi> and set to serve in the Temple by <hi>Solomon)</hi> return to the same day and hour, wherein they first waited, is 224 years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a less, but incompleat, Cycle of these Hieratical Courses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining fifty Revolutions, and concluding at the end of twenty three years, after their first Institution, or Revolution of the great Cycle; with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of ninteen hours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and these common Chronological Notes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Dedication of the Second Temple, in the sixth of <hi>Darius Nothus, Adar</hi> the third, (about our <hi>February</hi> 19.) to the Fall of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are 490 years <hi>(Euseb. Chron. Daniel</hi>'s seventy Weeks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 24.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. From our Saviour's Birth to the Fall of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are seventy one years <hi>(Scaliger append.) Phlegon,</hi> quoted by <hi>Origen (tractat. in</hi> St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 29.) reckons from the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> his desolating <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years: this falls in with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> if we understand him to mean (as his words plainly import) after the expiring of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth, and we cannot pitch upon an Author better vers'd in the Roman Annals, than he was.</p>
               <p>Upon these Principles, I proceed thus to collect the Time of <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, from the Courses of the Priests intervening, betwixt that and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Second Temple.</p>

till the Sabbath was over. Now from the 15. of <hi>October</hi> to the Annunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which day the Church celebrates the Virgins Conception are five months, three weeks, and one day precisely; so long was <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gone with Child at the Angels Salutation, as her sixth month was upon its last week: which is not only hinted by <hi>Gabriel,</hi> but by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the sequel of that sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>vers. 39. [In those days Mary arose and went into the hill-country to visit her cousin Elizabeth, and she abode with her about three months]</hi> that is till her Cousin was delivered, and the Baptist circumcised: for it is improbable, that she (whose affection carried her so far from home to give her a visit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> so long) would leave her in her greatest exigent: or that so near and dear a Relation (who had she been at her own home, would have been sent for to the Baptist's Circumcision, amongst the rest of the Kindred) being with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> so near the end of her nine months; would go home in that juncture, and not stay till she had perform'd that Office of a Kinswoman: And most of all, that the blessed among Women, (whom the Evangelists signally commend, for laying up in her heart all special Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of Providence) should not stay, till she saw what became of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi>'s dumbness, or not be one of those Kinsfolks, who, upon the day of Circumcision, are said to ponder, what befel, then, in their hearts.</p>
               <p>By this reckoning our Saviour, indeed, was ten months in the Virgins womb: but as it is no strange thing for women to go so long, so a fitter Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod could not have been pich'd upon, for the Lord of Hosts pitching his Tent in the blessed Virgin: if it were but barely to answer the expectations of the Gentiles, who (out of <hi>Sybils</hi> Books) had got this notion by the end, that the Eastern Monarch, the Jews <hi>Messias,</hi> the Restorer of all, was so long to Tabernacle in his Mothers Womb; well exprest by <hi>Virgil,</hi> in that Eclogue which <hi>Constantine</hi> the great (in his Oration to the Clergy) shews can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to none but the blessed Jesus.

Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus)</hi> that is, he was born in the fortieth week, in the last week of the tenth month after his conception: and I suppose, if the Births of Heroes were examin'd, it would be found that antiquity assigned them commonly one month in the Womb beyond the account of ordinary persons.</p>
               <p>§ 5. But I leave this to be disputed by Mid-wives, while, to the proof of my Assertion, that Christ was born at Christmas, (drawn from the time of <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s Ministration,) I add another drawn from the Circumstances of Christ's Baptism. St. <hi>Luke</hi> dates the Beginning of <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry, and Christ's Baptism, both in one and the same fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and Christ's
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43715:182"/>
Baptism, before <hi>Easter</hi> in that year. Now St. <hi>Luke</hi> reckons <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Reign, from the death of <hi>Augustus</hi> (as hath been already proved) that is, the 19 of <hi>August.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this clearly evinceth the absurdity of that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that Christ was born in <hi>September:</hi> and manifesteth all those strong Reasonings of ill-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd wits for it, to be meer Paralogisms. For since our Saviour was born, and baptized on the same day of the year; had that been in <hi>September, John</hi> must bestir himself at that rate, as no man in his right wits can make haste to believe he did, if betwixt then and the 19 of <hi>August</hi> preceding (which is the utmost latitude we can allow in the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which commenc'd that day) he could come into all the Country about <hi>Jordan,</hi> and draw such multitudes of Disciples to his Baptism, from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and all <hi>Judaea,</hi> and all the Region round about <hi>Jordan</hi> (St. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 1. 3. St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 5.) How vain doth this, by name, prove <hi>Beroaldus</hi> to be in his imagination, that our Saviours Birth fell in <hi>September</hi> at the autumnal Equinox: for from the 19 of <hi>August,</hi> which was the first day of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> his fifteenth year of Reign (in which year, the Divine Oracle saith, the Baptist began his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry) to the fourteenth of <hi>September</hi> (on which day <hi>Beroaldus</hi> saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was both born and baptized) are but three weeks and four days; now whether Christ's Forerunner could, in that scantling of time, fulfill the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which went of him, and the work which the Evangelists say he did, in preparing Christ's way before his face; I refer to the determination of all unbiass'd and intelligent persons.</p>
               <p>If it be, here replyed, that he began his Preaching towards the Spring, and after he had spent that Summer, baptized our Saviour about <hi>September;</hi> that indeed gives him time enough, but then the fifteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> would have been expired, and his sixteenth began, before our Saviour's Baptism: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this supposition leaves our Saviour more time unto the Passover, for the effecting those things, which he is reported to have done in that space, than his zeal to the work of Redemption would permit him to take, who came into publick, as a Gyant refresh'd with Wine, ready to run his race.</p>
               <p>But now all these inconveniencies are avoided by dating Christ's Birth and Baptism at Christmas.</p>
               <p>For, 1. the Baptist being, in respect of Age, capable of a call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry at Mid-Summer, had a sufficient time to prepare himself for the exercise of it, after his call by fasting in the Wilderness: so that by that time that <hi>Tiberius</hi> his fifteenth year commenc'd, he might begin to perambulate the Regions about <hi>Jordan:</hi> and by Christmas, his fame might be spread so far abroad, as to bring persons of all ranks out of all <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea</hi> to his Baptism: that Nation being at that time big with the expectation of the <hi>Messias,</hi> then to be exhibited: which is hinted by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>[all men were musing of John whether he were the Christ.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 2. Our Saviour by this account had time sufficient, and no more than sufficient, before <hi>Easter:</hi> for his forty days fast in the Wilderness: for his coming to <hi>Bethabara</hi> (where the Baptist gave Testimony of him, that he was that Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world; that Christ the Son of the living God, whom they looked for) for his setting his Fathers Seal to the Testimony of <hi>John,</hi> three days after, in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee;</hi> for his going down with his whole retinue to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not many days before the Passover was at hand, at the approach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> purged the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly (for it were endless to enumerate particulars.) The perspicuity of this Calculation, as it gives light to several sacred Texts, otherwise unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible: so it discovers the Vanity of all attempts, to pitch Christ's Birth upon any other day but that (wheron it hath been commemorated in all Ages) the 25. of <hi>December:</hi> whether of those that go in that <hi>Analytical</hi> way which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> chalk'd out, who, though he hath sufficiently invalidated
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43715:182"/>
the Argument of the Decembrians drawn from the Feast of Exipiation, yet he hath not offer'd any Arguments against the practice of the Church (which is not presently to be concluded unreasonable and groundless, as soon as some weak defenses, which some of more zeal than knowledge make of it, are cast down) but what proceeds upon more manifest mistakes. Such are (that I may, for the honour I bear to his Learning and Parts, particularly confute them) his professing he will shoot at an hairs-breadth <hi>(ad unguem)</hi> to the mark in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Bow. But he casts that Bow so, as it shoots not near <hi>Daniel</hi>'s scope.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In assigning the Term of <hi>Daniel's</hi> seventy Weeks at Christ's Passion, which <hi>Daniel</hi> aim'd at the Fall of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as hath been prov'd in my Discourse upon those weeks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In expounding <hi>Daniel</hi>'s middle of the Week to denote the precise mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the year of Christ at his Passion, he pareth the Prophet too close; for, as Mr. <hi>Meed</hi> observeth, that Phrase of speech implys no more, than that the <hi>Messias</hi> should be cut off within the space of the last Septimane, the last not of the 70 but 62.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is wide of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s mind in expounding the cutting off of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> to be his death, for <hi>Daniel</hi> meant it of his rejection by the Jewes from being their King. So that he fixeth not one of these steps upon firm ground, which he maketh in travelling for this Conclusion, Christ was born at the Autumnal Equinox, from this medium; His Passion fell out in the midst of this last year, at the Vernal Equinox.</p>
               <p>His Argument from the Type of expiation stands upon no better ground, yea makes against him: for grant the world was created at the Autumnal Equinox, that then the ancients began to reckon the year, that then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Expiation was made in Paradise, that then the Feast of Expiation was observed: did not God himself alter the beginning of the year to the Vernal Equinox, at what time Christ expiated for sin by his death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created the World by his rising from the dead: and what fitter expedient could Wisdom it self have found out to draw peoples minds from expecting to see the Redeemer come in <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or of those who are not so industriously, but more subtilty, vain in their reasonings, than <hi>Beroaldus:</hi> that pack of lazie Curs that will not take the pains to range Chronology for Arguments against the Churches Practice, but lye barking in Chimney-corners, and manage their attempts against it, not by hunting out the account and marks of time set out by the holy Ghost, but by representing to us the complexion of the Season, when these things and others accompanying them fell out. Such is the objection from the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Winter-month: Calculated indeed to the effeminacy of this degenerate Christian Age (wherein nothing passeth for Gospel-preaching, but Flesh-indulgency, wherein men's love to Christ and Zeal for their own Souls welfare is grown so cold, as they will scarce wet their foot in serving Christ, or in working out their own Salvation; and therefore shrug at the thought of men's watching their Flocks by night, of such multitudes descending into the Water, of the Virgins travelling to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and of Christ's travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for our salvation in the greatness of his strength into the deep of <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the depth of Winter:) but not bottom'd upon any thing, will go for Reason among any persons, but such as live by Sense. As to the Virgins jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying in that Brumal season, it may put to a stand the Faith of the <hi>Sibarites</hi> (who were so dainty as they would not permit those Manufuctures that made a din to come within the hearing of their City) or those mincing Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (who could not walk but where they could make a tinckling with their feet, nor abide that wind that would ruffle their well-set Hair:) But how Credulity should stick so deep in this mire, as it cannot get out amongst us: whose high-ways are never unoccupied (but terms and Markets frequented, by both Sexes Winter and Summer;) is scarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; except we think the Air be full of frosty <hi>Daemons,</hi> in Christmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week,

Can it then seem strange, that men should run through fire and water, to avoid that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, which the Axe (laid to the root) threatned to every Tree, that did not bring forth fruit meet for Repentance; to escape that Damnation of Hell, that unquenchable fire, which they believed was to be the portion of such as would not listen to the voyce of the Cryer. And as to our Saviours submitting himself to the tolerance of Winters cold, his acquainting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with grief, as soon as he came out of the Womb, and his exposing his sacred Body to <hi>Jordan</hi>'s chillest Streams; as they were part of his Cross and Expiations for that pleasure we take in sin, so they were the products of that inconquerable Love of his to Mankind, a Love stronger than Death, and which many Waters could not quench <hi>(Cant.</hi> 8.)

(Josephi vita)</hi> thus armed against the Christian Faith, in the Judaean troubles under <hi>Gessius Florus,</hi> he betakes himself into <hi>Galilee,</hi> the Stage of our Saviours great Works: in managing of which Province he staid till he was taken Prisoner by <hi>Titus;</hi> having in the mean while his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by turns, in all the Towns of note, in that tract which the blessed Jesus had so worn with his feet, as he could scarce come any where, where he might not yet see the recent prints of them, and converse with thousands, upon whom, and in whose sight, those Miracles were wrought; he might yet, at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> where he first quarter'd, see the Ships which those Disciples were called out of to be Fishers of Men; wherein Christ taught multitudes, that stood on the shore, wherein he commanded the Winds, and the Sea to be still. At <hi>Gadera,</hi> the next place he march'd to, he might speak with the Relations of that man, out of whom Christ cast Legion, and with some of the owners of that Herd of Swine, into which the Devils enter'd. At <hi>Cana</hi> he might see the Water-potts whence the true Vine made Wine flow in room of Water. After quarter given him by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> he followed the Roman Ensigns, as a Prisoner, to <hi>Caesarea;</hi> where he might feel the Prison and Moot-hall, almost yet warm with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Breath; the Judgement-seat, yet quaking with <hi>Felix</hi> his-trembling, yet resounding the Eccho of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s pleadings, and <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Confession, that he was half perswaded to be a Christian: if not infested by that Vermine, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated into that other <hi>Herod,</hi> the knowledge of his being a Man, while the flattering voyce of the people cryed him up for a God: where he might, with his Keeper, walk to the House where <hi>Cornelius</hi> was praying, when he saw the Angelical Vision; where he and his Family were brought in, and consecrated to Christ, as the First-fruits of the Gentiles; and converse with that Italian Band that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had command over. <hi>(Bel. Jud.</hi> 3. 14.) From whence he had as fair an opportunity of sending to <hi>Joppa,</hi> to enquire for the Tanners house where St. <hi>Peter</hi> lodged, and on whose Battlements he received his Commission to go to the Gentiles, as could be offered; for at that very time <hi>Vespasian,</hi> sent a party thither. <hi>(Bel. Jud. Ib.)</hi> But I must not write a Journal of his March with the Army in Chains, though all that while he had freedom and leisure enough to inform himself in the Truth of those things he then intended to commit to Posterity. Follow we him, whither the Eagles lead him, after he has liberty granted him by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> (now made Emperor) and we find him at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> where was a famous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, then gathered by St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist, and a Society of four thousand Essenes, mentioned by his Co-etanean <hi>Philo</hi> the Learned Jew; if they were not all one (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> thinks) they were so near a kin, in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; as the ancient Church, (to wash her hands of those stains were cast upon her Virgin-purity, by the Worlds deeming the Essenes to be of her Society,) was fain to explode them together with the Ebionites, Nazarites, and Hemerobaptists: or rather the Essenes were really the greatest opposers of Christians, and the Christian the most perfect hater of them, of any Society of men, as coming nearest him in outward shape (as the Ape to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43715:189"/>
a man) but having a divers Soul, and therefore the most odious of all Beasts: However <hi>Josephus</hi> his venerable Opinion of that Sect, and his three years Pupilage, in his Minority, under <hi>Bannus</hi> the strictest of the Judaean Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senes, could not but invite him to the acquaintance of the Alexandrian: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the fresh memory of Jesus, and his Fore-runner the Baptist, (a person of blessed memory with both him and them) must needs lead them to confer upon the Stories of them, and to compare Notes. With <hi>Titus</hi> we find him at <hi>Antioch:</hi> where the Name of Christian (by which he comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morates Christ's Followers) was first imposed upon Christians, taken up (as the learned <hi>Junius</hi> thinks) by themselves, to distinguish them from such as called themselves Galileans and Nazarites, as if they embraced the Gospel, but of whom for their Judaizing the Church was ashamed, and wiped their names out of her Calendar. At <hi>Jericho,</hi> at <hi>Bethany,</hi> and all Judaean Towns where Christ convers'd; from the Inhabitants and inspection of which places he either saw those manifest tracks, or received that full satisfaction of what he reports of Christ's miraculous Works, as makes him thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively assert the Truth of those Matters. For where else, among whom else, could he gain that certain knowledge, that he himself requires in an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, and professeth himself to have had of those things he records, both in his Books of Antiquities, and the Wars. <hi>He that promiseth to others</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Tradition of Facts really done, must himself first have a perfect understanding of those things (either because he was present at the doing of them, or understood them by those that saw them done) which Rule I have strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed in both my Treatises, (Josep. contrà Appion, l.</hi> 1.) He could not be a Spectator of the Works, of the Effects of them he might, (upon those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, upon whom they were wrought, in those places where Monuments of them remain'd:) but where could he have better information by Eye-witnesses, than the Inhabitants of those Countries and Villages where Christ manifested his Glory, and <hi>Josephus</hi> so long convers'd?</p>
               <p>Of the Truth of such information that he was undoubtedly assured, will be yet more evident, if we observe, how narrowly he was watch'd by those two men of an evil-Eye, towards him and his History.</p>

                  <hi>Appion,</hi> a learned Gentile Philosopher, and <hi>Justus</hi> so zealous a Jew, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> became his Advocate to the Emperour (against the accusations of the Decapolitanes, presenting him as the sole Author of his Countries Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy from its Allegeance) and born and living in that part of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where our Saviour chiefly convers'd. How glad would either of these have been, to have taken <hi>Josepus</hi> tardy, in so considerable a point of his History? and how easily might they have catch'd him tripping here, if he had not look'd so well to his feet, as to deliver nothing concerning our Saviour, but what he was certain of, and could make good against all cavils? How comes it to pass that those critical Adversaries, (who scarce leave one Story, in either of his Treatises, untouch'd, against which they could make any plausible Exception) have not a word to say against this, but because the Evidence of its Truth was so apparent, as there was no contradicting of it? Nay, would not these pick-quarrels have found fault, if not with the falsity, yet at least with the presumption of this Passage; if they had not been convinc'd, that he went not upon presumptions, but undoubted Grounds. <hi>Photias (de Justo Tiberiadensi)</hi> writes, that in Emulation of <hi>Josephus,</hi> he wrote the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Jews (from the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> unto the death of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> the seventh King of the Herodian Race, and last of the Jews, who began his Reign under <hi>Claudius,</hi> augmented his Kingdom under <hi>Nero,</hi> and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and dyed in the third year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> to whom <hi>Justus</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his History.) I report this quotation at large: as well to certifie a mistake of my own, touching <hi>Josephus</hi> his Appeal to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for the Truth of his Judaick Wars; it being this <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and not (as I then supposed) he whom <hi>Caligula</hi> preferr'd, for that was he, of whom the Text of St. <hi>Luke</hi> speaks, who dyed in the fourth of <hi>Claudius,</hi> of worms, while <hi>Josephus</hi> was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43715:189"/>
in his Nonage: as also to shew, that this <hi>Justus</hi> had time enough, betwixt <hi>Josephus</hi> his finishing his History (under <hi>Domitian)</hi> and his finishing his own (under <hi>Trajan)</hi> to examine, and find fault in it: and that if he could have detected <hi>Josephus</hi> of falsity, in this his Story of Christ: the Heathen World, and this persecuting Emperour (who hated Christians to death) would have been sure to have heard of it by <hi>Justus.</hi> Never did any Secular Historian pass a more severe scrutiny than <hi>Josephus</hi> did: and in no part of it more than this of Christ, and the Baptist.

The whole Nation were now big with expectation of some great Man, who should do great Things (they looked when the Mountains would bring forth, when God would shake the Heavens, and thence send the Desire of all Nations:) while they are thus musing, the Branch springs up out of the wither'd Stem, the dryed Root of <hi>David</hi>'s Stock, without form, without comeliness; one wherein they could see no beauty: here they are as much frustrated of their

A point which is constantly prest by our sacred Historiographers, and appealed to by our Saviour, in the answer he returned to <hi>John</hi> the Baptist (when he sent his Disciples to enquire, whether he were the Christ?) <hi>Go and tell John what you see, that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, &amp;c.</hi> If these be not the Works assigned to the <hi>Messias</hi> by the Prophets, believe me not that I am he. The Miracles that Christ did were not elective Works (as those were which false Christs pretended to) but fore-appointed and prescribed him by the Spirit of Prophesie; and therefore as they point him out to be him that was to come; for never man but he applyed himself to work by the Rule of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (and I challenge all Reading to produce one Example of a person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side him, that so much as pretended to the doing of those wonders that the Prophets cut out for the Christ.)

Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Josephus</hi> in this Character which he gives of Christ's Miracles (that they were such as the Jewish Prophets had assigned in their Predictions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Christ) doth both discriminate Christ's Miracles in point of Excellency from all others (for as the veriest Dunce may have conn'd some Lessons so by heart, as to have them at his singers end: that if he be left at liberty to read where he pleases, one that hears him would think he reads perfectly; when perhaps he scarce knows one Letter of the whole row and therefore, the way of trying his sufficiency, is to turn him to, and make him read the Lessons which we prescribe him:) So the most sottish Wizzard, if he may chuse what Pranks to play, may shew one or two, which may pass for Wonders: But if you prescribe him what to do, he forth with bewrays his inability: nothing but Omnipotency could keep pace with the Prophets Prescriptions in working Miracles;) And also evinceth those, of which the Evangelists make report, to have been those very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual great VVorks, of which <hi>Josephus</hi> writes: seeing all these, and these only, (of all those that either Christ hath been reported to do by apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Authors, or any man pretended to do in any other Name) do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly bear the Impresses of this Character, that they are such, as the Prophets predicted should be performed by the Christ, at his appearance.</p>

               <p>In which Text this Jewish Priest gives witness to the Truth of what the Evangelists declare touching the most material points of Christ's Death: that he was crucified, and that under <hi>Pontius Pilat;</hi> and that by the instigation, and accusation of the Jewish Elders, and Chief Priests: and the main Circumstances of his rising from the dead, that it was on the third day; that he gave Demonstration of it, the very day he rose, not to all, but certain VVitnesses, whom he had chosen to go in and out with him from the beginning; that this Demonstration was so palpable and convincing, that it animated the Disciples to adhere to him, not withstanding his preceding ignominious Death. This is all so clear that it need no Comment, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reflection but this. That as <hi>Josephus</hi> could not be ignorant of the Allegation of the Jewish Priests (he being himself a Priest, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Associate of the Priests of <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> that his Disciples had stole him away; so he makes so little account of it, as he thinks it not worth the mentioning: but, not withstanding that report, without any circumlocution, affirms plainly, that Christ did shew himself alive the third day to his Disciples: on whom he bestows that Epethete which our Saviour gave them in his question to St. <hi>Peter.

               </p>
               <p>§ 1. HE gives as full a Testimony to the History and Acts of the Apostles, as to Christ, in all those particulars where the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church are interwoven with the Affairs of the Empire, or the Kingdom of <hi>Judaea,</hi> that is, where-ever their History comes in his way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> the Son of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> his Story in <hi>Josephus</hi> goes hand in hand with St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Story of him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to his personal Qualifications, He is described by St. <hi>Luke (Act.</hi> 13.) to have been so great a Favourite of the Jews, so ambitious to gratifie them, and so zealous and forward a Professor of their Religion, that to serve their interest, and to do them a pleasure, he beheaded St. <hi>James,</hi> and imprisoned St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with an intention to have sacrificed his Blood also to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples humour. In the same habit of Soul does <hi>Josephus</hi> paint him; not only in those Texts which have been formerly alledged, but also in the seventh <hi>Chap.</hi> of his ninteenth <hi>Book of Antiquities:</hi> Where, shewing his different Temper from that of <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> he tells us that <hi>Antipas,</hi> out of an <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> against that Nation, manifestly shewed more good will to the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than Jews, adorning foreign Cities with Gifts, Bathes, Theaters, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not vouchsafing to grace any one Town of the Jews with any memorable, either Ornament or Bounty. But <hi>Agrippa,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, though he was beneficent, liberal, and courteous to all; yet he was above all others benign to, and ready to help in their greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies, his own Country-men the Jews; willing to have had his constant residence in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> being so religious an observer of his Countries Rites, as he let no day pass without sacrifice, nor suffered himself at any time to be polluted with Legal uncleannesses: insomuch, as when one <hi>Simon</hi> who had in a publick Assembly calumniated him behind his back, as impure, and not fit to be admitted to Temple-Worship, was convented before him, he was not able to instance one particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Agrippa</hi> had miscarried touching the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:43715:192"/>
Another of his Qualifications; hinted by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> is his profuse Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,] <hi>Because their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was maintained by the Trade they drive at Court, (Acts</hi> 12. 20.) the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Gallantry of <hi>Herods</hi> Court maintain'd their Country with Trade. The Maritine Towns and Countries of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> being chiefly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, by their Court trade, by vending there their rich and costly Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for back and belly, those Peacock-feathers that made him so gay on the Judgement-seat, as to procure him divine adoration: if their acclamations were any thing else than an artifice of those cunning Tyrian Merchants, to cry up and inhance the price of their own Wares, and to intimate to this ambitious Prince, that what had gain'd him the repute of a God, was well worth the price he had given for them; for I cannot think that Royal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel could dazle those Eyes, which were dayly inured to the richest Rarities of Nature or Art: and I have strong impulses to opine; that <hi>Herod</hi>'s fine Cloaths stood yet unpaid for in those Merchants Books, and that he stormed so furiously against them, either for that they had set the Dice upon him in their price, or dun'd him for payment: for I could never yet learn, what other cause of quarrel he could have with those Merchant-Towns; nor how that ambitious Prodigal could maintain that Pomp he kept, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Tick,; nor for what they, that (but five days before) call'd him a God, should at his death, curse his Memory: but because he died so much in their Books, and his Lands were not bound to pay his Debts. And I doubt not but my intelligent Reader will be partly of my mind, by that time he has heard <hi>Josephus</hi> speak to this point. This King, (saith he) was so born to Liberality and demeriting of people by Largesses; as he took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pleasure in making his name famous by Munificence, and cared not what expence he was at, to purchase the repute of a munificent Prince, <hi>(l.</hi> 19. 7.) Before <hi>Calignla</hi> prefer'd him, <hi>(Joseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. 8.) he brought himself to that penury, (with the Splendour of his dayly Attendance, and immoderate Liberalities) that he durst no longer shew his face in <hi>Rome;</hi> but taking Sanctuary (from his many and importunate Creditors) in a Castle of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> bethought himself how he might put an end to his miserable life: which hunger would quickly have determin'd, had not his Sister <hi>Herodias</hi> (by the instigation of his Wife <hi>Cypros)</hi> obtain'd of her Husband <hi>Herod,</hi> a sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for him, and an Office at <hi>Tiberias;</hi> till his Uncle (in the midst of their Cups) upbraiding him with it, he left him in scorn, and betook himself to the Trencher of <hi>Flaccus</hi> the President of <hi>Syria:</hi> from whose friendship he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doth (with much difficulty and disadvantage) obtain, of his Mothers Freeman, the Loan of 20000 Attick Drams: with which he makes fot <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but is intercepted and arrested by <hi>Herennius Capito,</hi> for 300000. he was indebted to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Follow him whither you will, till he come to the Crown, you shall find him immersing himself in Debt. And when he comes to that, he leaves not his old wont: for, though then his yearly Revenues were 1200. Myriades, yet he outrun the Constable in his Expences, his Disbursements did so far exceed his Incomes, as he was still forc'd to borrow and take up upon trust. <hi>(Joseph. Antiq. lib.</hi> 19. 7.) But we need no other Instance of his excessive profuseness, nor evidence of his being deeply in the Books of the Tyrian and Sidonian Tradesmen, than that Description of the Royal Apparel (mention'd by St. <hi>Luke)</hi> which <hi>Josephus</hi> makes, <hi>viz. [He was arrayed in Cloath of Silver so admirably wrought, as the Beams of the rising Sun beating upon it, it cast so wonderful radiant a splendour, as begat veneration in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</hi>

               <p>We will proceed to his external Character, <hi>[Herod the King]</hi> whereby he is distinguish'd from <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> the Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee,</hi> who slew the Baptist, and simply <hi>[the King]</hi> without the addition <hi>[of Judaea]</hi> to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him from <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, in whose son <hi>Arebelaus,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Judaea</hi> expired, being annext to Syria, and made a Roman Province, at the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and administred by the Governours of

                  <hi>Syria, (Jos. ant.</hi> 18. 15.) from which time to the Reign of <hi>Caligula</hi> the Herodian Family had not so much as the Title of King; and when <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> bestowed that Title upon this <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> he made him not King of <hi>Judaea,</hi> but only of those Tetrarchates which he gave him, (the Tetrarchates of <hi>Philip, Lysanias,</hi> and <hi>Herod)</hi> together with some part of those Territories which <hi>Archelaus</hi> had held. And this Herodian Kingdom (of the second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) though it throve to as great dimensions, under the favourable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>Claudius, Vespasian, Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> upon the Junior <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as that of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, had done, under <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> [Claudius <hi>added to</hi> Agrippa'<hi>s Jurisdiction,</hi> Judaea <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>which had of old belonged to the Kingdom of his Grandfather</hi> Herod,] <hi>(Jos. ant.</hi> 19. 4.) yet it never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd that Grandure, either to be, or to be so much as reputed, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judaea,</hi> till either <hi>Eusebius</hi> or St. <hi>Jerome</hi> miscalled it so, (to make it comport with their former mistakes, about <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, and the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Scepter.) Against which mistake both the sacred Historian, (in giving <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> the formal Title of Kings of <hi>Judaea:</hi> but <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> and his Son, that only of, King;) and <hi>Josephus</hi> (by giving us the Story at large of both those Kingdoms) have given us sufficient Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have set up so plain VVay-marks, as the way-faring Ideot cannot erre, if he attend to those palpable differences of those Kingdoms, pointed out by those Mercuries; nor possibly overlook their perfect Correspondency in that particular. For this <hi>Herod</hi> is not so much as stiled King of <hi>Judaea,</hi> except once, by <hi>Josephus,</hi> and that for brevity's sake, with the addition of <hi>[totius:] [Tertium Judaeae totius regni annum agens:] (ant.</hi> 19. 7.) by that distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing that his three years Reign, from his four precedent, under <hi>Caius</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had only some part of its Territory, which under <hi>Herod</hi> the Great made up the Kingdom of <hi>Judaea)</hi> but not intending thereby, that he was,, in due form, King of <hi>Judaea:</hi> for he presents him as coap-mated and check'd by <hi>Marsus,</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Syria,</hi> in his building the walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and his entertainment of the five Kings, whom <hi>Marsus</hi> commanded forthwith to depart <hi>Herod's</hi> Court unto their own homes, much against <hi>Herods</hi> will, if he could have helpt it: <hi>(Joseph. Antiq.</hi> 19. 7.)</p>
               <p>§ 2. The like agreement there is betwixt St. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Josephus,</hi> in their dating the remarkable Death of <hi>Herod.</hi> At that time, while (upon <hi>Agabus</hi> his Prophecy of a general Dearth) the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> sent St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with relief to the Christians which dwelt in <hi>Judaea,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> dates it, for having mentioned their Mission, he subjoynes the stories of <hi>Herod</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>James,</hi> imprisoning <hi>Peter,</hi> and his own miserable End; after which he tells of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> their return, (from performing that Ministry, and Office of Charity) unto <hi>Antioch,</hi> from whence they had been sent: which though it do not necessarily inforce this Conclusion, that all those things mentioned in that intervall, fell out in that order, wherein they are related (for St. <hi>Luke</hi> might lay the Actions in the 12 Chapter, before the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the Gentiles, on purpose that the story of St. <hi>Peter</hi> might be taken up together, and concluded,) before the Story of St. <hi>Paul</hi> come in, which is to be prosecuted to the end of the Book (as Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> well observes,) and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mission to the Gentiles might, possibly fall out, before some part of the story of <hi>Herod,</hi> and yet properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be mentioned after,) Yet this intertexture, plainly enough teacheth us, that their former Mission, to carry the benevolence of the Church of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> to the Saints of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> happen'd before the Commencement of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Story, and that this is contemporary with that Famine which fell out in the days of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> states it. That is <hi>Herod</hi>'s murder of <hi>James</hi> fell out in the third, and his own death in the beginning of the fourth year of the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> expresly affirmeth, <hi>(antiq.</hi> 19. 7.) Herod Agrippa <hi>died at the age of 54. after he had reigned seven years.</hi> That is, in the Tetrarchate of <hi>Philip,</hi> three years: and one, in the Tetrarchate of <hi>Herod</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

It was therefore at the Passeover in the third of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was apprehended; and <hi>Herod</hi> missing of his prey, betakes himself to his Progress; wherein he stays at <hi>Berytum,</hi> during the pompous Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and impious handselling of the Amphytheatre he had there built. At the Galilean <hi>Tiberias,</hi> while he caresseth the five Kings of <hi>Comagena, Emosine, Armenia</hi> the Less, <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Chalcis.</hi> From thence he removes his Court to Cesarea, whence he departs not, till he departs the world: having at his coming thither, fulfill'd the third year of his reign, since <hi>Claudius</hi> began his, <hi>(pag.</hi> 19.) and therefore the tenth of the Calends of <hi>February,</hi> on which <hi>Claudius</hi> began to reign, was then past, when <hi>Herod</hi> arrived at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and not so much of <hi>Herods</hi> fourth years reign remaining, as unto Easter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before his decease, for that would have made so considerable an addition of months and dayes to the years of <hi>Herod,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> would not have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the mention of them; neither would <hi>Herod</hi> have cast his progress so, as not to have been return'd to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (had he lived) before the passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: he being a man so punctual in observing the Law. It was therefore in the beginning of both <hi>Claudius,</hi> and of <hi>Herods</hi> reign under him, the fourth year, that <hi>Herod</hi> came to this wretched end. <hi>(Jos. ant.</hi> 20. 1.) puts this beyond all doubt: for there he tells, how that <hi>Claudius,</hi> after the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> sent <hi>Fadus</hi> to look after the affairs of <hi>Judaea,</hi> after whose coming thither, and demanding the high Priests stole and Crown to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd into his custody, the Jews sent an Embassie to <hi>Rome,</hi> to deprecate that impeachment of their privileges: this request <hi>Caesar</hi> grants, and writes to <hi>Fadus:</hi> to suffer the Jews to enjoy that, and other favours, granted them by the Romans; and these Letters of <hi>Claudius</hi> bear date the fourth of the Kalends of <hi>July,</hi> in the fourth year of his Reign: four or five moneths is little enough, for all these transactions, and journeyings betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Judaea.</hi> Let us now see how well this accords with that Character, which St. <hi>Luke</hi> sets upon these occurrences, <hi>[The time of the Famine,] Dion. (l, 60, p.</hi> 410.) Placeth the beginning of it indeed, in the second year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> but hints the continuance of it, some years after: for <hi>Claudius</hi> is reported by him, to have made that preparation for the importing of Corn at all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the year, (in his building that Haven, from the attempting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Workmen discouraged him with the greatness of the charge) as the Horse must have starved while the Grass grew; if, that year, the famine had dilated it self so far, as the City could not be reliev'd out of the circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Countries, (the way by Sea being blockt up, while the Haven was a building.) In his third year, the Dearth of necessaries bred that distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance among the Commons, as the Emperour was fain for their Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to go into <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and himself set the price of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:43715:194"/>
But what progress soever the famine might make in other parts, it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Judaea</hi> in the fourth year of <hi>Claudius, Rufus</hi> and <hi>Pompeius Sylvanus</hi> Consuls, and <hi>Fadus</hi> Governour of <hi>Judaea:</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> dates it, <hi>(l.</hi> 20. 1.) at the same time that <hi>Helena</hi> Queen of <hi>Adiabenum,</hi> being turned Jew, went to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> in an happy time for the poor distressed Inhabitants, whom she seeing to be opprest with a grievous famine, and multitudes of them to dye of hunger; sent some to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for Corn; others to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> for dryed Figs: wherewith she relieved the almost famish'd people, <hi>(l. 20. c.</hi> 2. 3.) So that upon supposition of <hi>Dions</hi> faithfulness in the account he gives of the time when this Famine began at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his reconcileableness with <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> who placeth the heat of it at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> two years after, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth of <hi>Claudius; Josephus</hi> his date agrees exactly with St. <hi>Luke's:</hi> the Sacred Historian assigning <hi>Herod's</hi> Death to that time, when the Messengers of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> were carrying the Contributions of that Church to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> for their relief in that grievous Famine; which fell (as <hi>Josephus</hi> saith) in the fourth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> at the same time when Queen <hi>Helen</hi> succour'd the Circumcision, and King <hi>Herod</hi> expired. Upon which <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed, with Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> than upon that of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that <hi>Dion</hi> speaks of one Famine, and <hi>Josephus</hi> of another: because 'tis usual for Famines to be of as long continuance, as we make that to have been; and chiefly because the sacred Text seems to look that way; if we either leave out the full point after [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§ 3. As to the substance of this Story, <hi>Josephus</hi> attesteth to these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Herod,</hi> upon a set day, presented himself in glorious Apparel, to the view of the People of <hi>Cesarea:</hi> to wit, on the second day of that great Solemnity he had appointed to celebrate there, for the Health of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: to which were assembled a great multitude of Nobles and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43715:194"/>
out of the whole Province: at which Assemblies they that bid those extraordinary Festivals, used to make Speeches, in praise of <hi>Caesar,</hi> Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks upon the happiness of his Regiment, to stir the people up to more Devotion in praying for his Health. On which day, he had appointed them of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> (saith St. <hi>Luke)</hi> to have an hearing, and to sue out their pardon, by crying <hi>Peccavi;</hi> that his Greatness in bringing them upon their knees, and his Goodness in pardoning of them, might be so far more conspicuous as the Audience, before whom these matters were transacted, was more august.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That while he was pleasing his ambitious Mind, with the expectation of the peoples grateful Acclamations, the Spectators and Auditors (amazed with the splendidness of his Attire, and ravished with the sweetness of his Voyce) salute him for a God: uttering that voice of Beasts, It is the Face, it is <hi>[the voice of a God;]</hi> and that no Demy-god, as the Hero's were esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but one altogether a God <hi>[not a man,]</hi> one of the immortal Gods: some crying out, <hi>[Hitherto we have rever'd thee as a Man, now we are forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge something in thee more excellent than Humane Nature; Oh, be thou a propitious and favourable Deity to poor Mortalls prostrate at thy sacred feet!] Josephus</hi> does not tell the story, of the Tyrians and Sidonians in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Form of words; but yet he presents them in Hieroglyphicks and Rebuses: out of which we may spel their deep sence of his displeasure against them, and their deprecating, with all humility, the insupportable effects thereof: and smell the Chamberlain's contrivance of the whole Plot, that he, as the Master of those Ceremonies, had taught the Phaenician Merchants (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had no other God than <hi>Hercules,</hi> the God of gain) this Lesson of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to erect this Chair of State, this Bed of Honour for <hi>Herods</hi> pride to rest in, with as much complacential quiet, as the Center of his Ambition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd could confer upon him. A Lesson which <hi>Tiridates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> took out, and repeated to <hi>Nero,</hi> after he had con'd it over before his Statue, unto whose image, in the presence of <hi>Corbulo</hi> and the Roman Legions, that fawning Prince Sacrificed, and made oblation of his Crown, <hi>(Tacitus an.</hi> 15.) <hi>[Caesis ex more victimis, sublatum capiti Diadema Imagini imposuit,]</hi> and to whose self, before the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> (as dazel'd with that pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Majesty in pretence, but) in design to obtain of him the Armenian Crown, he bleated out this sheepish speech (unworthy of the Family of the <hi>Arsacides,) [I am come,</hi> Caesar, <hi>to worship thee for a God, not inferiour to</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra, <hi>my Country-deity; to profess that I will be nothing but what thou art pleas'd, by a kind of destiny, to make me, for thou art my fate.] (Xiph. ex Dion. Nero.)</hi> Pride at this height is not far from its Fall, (and therefore <hi>Tiberius</hi> wisely avoided all Deifying Compellations, as bad Auguries, and unlucky Presages of approaching Ruine,) <hi>(Suetonii Tiberius,) Nero</hi>'s shameful death did not tarry long after this blasphemous Sacrilege of Divine honour: But <hi>Herod</hi> is taken with the mannour, struck down in the Act of his Pride, the report whereof,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is the third Point, wherein <hi>Josephus</hi> gives his Suffrage to St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Story, <hi>[immediately (upon the peoples shout) the Angel of the Lord smote him, and he was eaten up of worms and gave up the Ghost.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Josephus</hi> instead of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s <hi>[immediately]</hi> hath <hi>[by and by,]</hi> but therein he contradicts him not, but explains the former part of his own Story, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Acclamation was given <hi>Herod,</hi> when he enter'd the Theater, and gives Reason it self room to think, that after <hi>Herod</hi> was sate down upon the Judgment-seat (where St. <hi>Luke</hi> begins his account of the Reason of God's smiting him, leaving out what befell at his first appearance, as that which he might on his part be excused for not shewing his dislike of, while he was passing through the throng) when the first thing he should have done there, was to have check'd the peoples Blasphemy, he begins his Speech in praise of <hi>Claudius:</hi> upon the Conclusion whereof, followed that second Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, upon which immediately he received his Deaths-wound: for it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43715:195"/>
will not stand with the Reason of his celebrating that Festivity for the Health of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he should not, as soon as he was well composed on his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, prefer his own good wishes for him, and perswade the people to say <hi>Amen;</hi> but only sit there as a gazing-stock, and make a dumb show of his own Attire, and the richness of his own VVardrobe: nor with the Divine Patience, to strike immediately upon the peoples Acclamations, before he could possibly shew his dislike thereof; had he not shown his approbation of it, in not rebuking them for their first sacrilegious ascribing to him divine honour, which he had time enough to have restored to God, while he made his speech, during that <hi>[by and by,]</hi> which intervened betwixt the first and second Acclamation; which he not doing, but on the contrary, by his silence, giving consent to, is now immediately arrested by the hand of Divine Justice, as a Partaker with them, in their first; as the Author of their second Shout: which he might have prevented, had he either repuls'd or chastised that first impious Flattery; for the neglect whereof, as <hi>Josephus</hi> saith, by and by (that is, after that which he mentions) the Angel of God smote him. For it is manifest, from the Comparison of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s and <hi>Josephus</hi> his Stories, that at <hi>Herod</hi>'s first appearance in his gay Robes, the People adored him as a God: and after he had made his Speech, they renew'd their deifying Acclamations; which multiplying of Divine honour upon him, <hi>Herod,</hi> liked so well, as at the Conclusion of his Oration, and their blasphemous applauses; instead of casting down a frowning Countenance upon the People, he casts up an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious eye upon the Cieling, (as men do that think scorn of others;) or looked about him, as Orators do, when they please themselves with having pleased the Audience; or cast up his eyes as men do in suddain apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fear of Divine vengeance; and in this twinkling of an eye, he espies an Owle sitting over his head, upon a Curtain-rod, or one of the Cords that bore up his Canopy: and perceived (saith <hi>Josephus)</hi> that this Bird was the Angel or Messenger of Calamity, a German Southsayer having foretold him, that when he saw that Bird again (which was then a Messenger of glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to him; as he interpreted an Owls sitting upon a Tree, (on which <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> lean'd and rested his weary body, born down with grief of mind,) to be) he must expect death, within five days. <hi>(Antiq. l.</hi> 18. 13.)</p>
               <p>§ 4. It would be too large a Digression here, to discuss the Art or rather Craft of this kind of Divination, the Vanity of it has already been discovered, and is sufficiently evinc'd by this Example; for this German promis'd <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> an happy Death, and that he should leave his Children in the possession of his Wealth; neither of which proved true: his Son being kept many years from the possession of his Fathers Crowns, during which time he was the Emperours Beads-man: and his Soul passing out of his Body, through those faetid Pores the Worms made in his Entrails. Though God permitted the Augure to hit the point of truth, in his Prediction, that within five dayes after his second sight of that Bird, he should die; as he did, the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi>'s Familiar (in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle) to tell <hi>Saul</hi> the sad tidings of his next days loss of Field and Life: the divine Wisdom ordering mens Curiosity and Credulity, in such cases, to be their torment. That other Point, of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Spirits, this Text of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> forceth me to speak to, that I may illustrate his Paraphrase upon St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and proceed upon clear grounds, in paralleling the remaining parts of the story. But yet I shall not be so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of my Readers patience, as to discuss, whether this Angel of <hi>Herods</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, this Messenger of his death, sate upon his Canopies Cord, or only upon his Optick Nerve: that is, whether a Spirit, assumed this form upon it self, or painted it on <hi>Herod</hi>'s Fancy? For 'tis all one, as to our Case, whether the File, was a real one, upon the Book; or a painted one, upon the Spectacles. Nor whether good Angels appear in any but august Forms? and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, whether this was a good or an evil Spirit? I profess not to cure
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43715:195"/>
the itch of mens Curiosity, but only to shew the agreement of St. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Josephus</hi> in sence, while one calls that an Owl, which the other calls an Angel; in order to which it will be sufficient to observe, That good Spirits are more obedient, than to refuse any form, that God bids them take, for the service of his Providence, or the Ministry of his Saints, (as this was; for St. <hi>Luke</hi> reports it, as an occasion of the growth and multiplying of the Word) why then should a good Angel more scruple at appearing in this homely form, than a whole host of them did, at appearing in the shape of Centaures and Chariot-horses, for the encouragement of one poor servant of the Prophet: nay, than the eternal Spirit did, at the appearance in the form of a Dove? Is there not infinitely more distance betwixt the holy Ghost, and an Arch-angel; than is betwixt a Dove, and an Owl: Nay, hadst thou been of Gods council, what form couldst thou have advised him to command his Angel to take, whom he sent to bring message to <hi>Herod</hi> of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, (to torment him in the midst of his jollity, with the fore-thought of it) than of that Creature which he (being perswaded of the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the German Oracle, in the last, by experiencing the truth of the first part of it) thought as verily to see five days before his Death, as <hi>Simeon</hi> hoped to see the Lord Christ; before his departure.</p>
               <p>But that the Sceptick may not laugh in his sleeve, at my transforming an Angel into an Owl (though had he so much of Athenian Learning, as he boasts of, he would not think <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Squirell, so contemptible a Bird, but that an Angel might assume her form, and therein be more congruously plac'd, than his (so brutified a Soul, as it lives by nothing but Sense) is, in an humane Body. I do not positively assert this to have been a good Angel; for as the heavenly attend as Voluntiers, so the infernal Spirits, as prest Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, are at the command of the Lord of Hosts; and when he imploys them, they are his Messengers, the Angels of the Lord. God march'd through <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when the First-born were slain with the Pestilence, in the head of an Army of evil Angels, <hi>Psal. 78. 50. [by sending evil Angels among them,] [he weighed his anger]</hi> (distributed it by a just proportion, to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, while the Israelites were passed over; and among the Egyptians, so as it fell upon the First-born of Man and Beast, while the rest escap'd) <hi>[they were given over to the Pestilence]</hi> by the immission of so many <hi>Asmodei,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,] <hi>(Septuagint.) Sent by the hands of evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> Chald. Indeed which of his Creatures can God more properly make use of to be the Executioners of his wrath than evil Angels: and yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angel is called <hi>[the Angel of the Lord] (2 Samuel</hi> 24. 16.) the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the Kings Officer. Be this therefore a good or bad Angel, it was that Angel of the Lord that smote <hi>Herod,</hi> as both St. <hi>Luke</hi> stiles this Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, and <hi>Josephus</hi> conformably unto him. To proceed now in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: therein the blewness of the Wounds this Messenger gave him, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent both upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s Soul and Body: for as soon as he perceiv'd this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boading Angel, he is struck to the heart with grief <hi>[ex intimis praecordiis indoluit;]</hi> and his belly with gripings, <hi>[secuta sunt ventris tormina.]</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon turning his eyes to his Parasites, <hi>Behold,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I, whom ye called a God, am commanded to depart this life; fatal Necessity proves you layrs; and I whom you stiled immortal, am posting to the Chambers of Death:</hi> with his speech his pain increaseth: they therefore forthwith carry him to his Bed; where, after five days racking and gnawing pain in his Bowels, he gives up his weary Ghost.</p>

But I am not solicitous to determine the numerical Instrument: it will give more light to the Text, if we can resolve, what this pungent affliction was, wherewith St. <hi>Paul</hi> was kept humble? since it could not be Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence; for that had been to cast out Satan by Satan: to expel one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, by bringing in seven, nay, the whole legion of unclean Spirits: the Body of Sin, to subdue one Member.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> thinks <hi>(Epist. 15. to 7. pag.</hi> 101.) this Thorn was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, the Persecutions, raised against the Apostle. But these were: 1. So usual and daily, and so universally inflicted by all the enemies of the Cross of Christ, as will hardly comport with this <hi>[Thorn]</hi> in the Text; which as it was signally given (upon this special occasion) so it was inflicted by some particular emiment Tool of Satan. 2. It will not be easie to conceive how this kind of Physick could be proper for this distemper, but should rather imp the Apostles Wings, for an higher flight of self exultation; and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion him to think that those Consolations in Christ, in the Anticipations of Paradise, were set to counterballance his afflictions for Christ, if not God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding his sufferings.</p>
               <p>They guess most probably, in mine Opinion, that conceive this Thorn to have been some corporeal Disease (whether the <gap reason="foreign">

(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.) so the Lord (in favour to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to prevent his being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above measure) sent Satan to buffet him, to infix some pungent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in his flesh (Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5) reckons St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s buffeting as an effect of God's delivering him unto Satan) which caused the like pain as they feel, that have a Thorn in their Body, or a barbed Arrow stuck in their Flesh, or a sharp stake run through their body, upon which they are, as it were, spitted, as [<gap reason="foreign">

He, in his 13, or 14. Book, affirms, (as he is quoted by St. <hi>Origen, in Cels. l. 2. cal.</hi> 8. 9.) That Christ foretold many things to come, which accordingly fell out: and from this his foreknowledge of Contingencies, is forc'd there to confess, that his Doctrine was super-humane. [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,—] And mentions the Eclipse that happen'd at our Saviours Passion, (as the same Father in his Treatise upon St. <hi>Matthew, chap.</hi> 35. affirms,) and St. <hi>Jerom</hi> upon <hi>Eusebius</hi> (his Chronicle notes) giving this Testimony of that miraculous defection. In the fourth year of the 202 Olympiad in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (this <hi>Olympiad</hi> concurrs with the 18 of <hi>Tiberius, (Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <hi>Chronolog.

Of which Earthquake <hi>Phlegon</hi> (out of the History of <hi>Apollonius</hi> the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian) gives this further account, that by it were overthrown many and the most famous Cities of <hi>Asia,</hi> which <hi>Tiberius</hi> afterwards repaired: in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial whereof were stampt those Silver-pieces, that had on one side, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> on the other, of <hi>Asia,</hi> with this Motto, <hi>[Civitatibus Asiae restitutis,]</hi> one of which <hi>Scaliger</hi> saw in the custody of <hi>William Gorlaeus: (Scal. in Euseb: Chron:)</hi> And <hi>Pliny</hi> this description, <hi>[Maximus terrae, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriâ mortalium, extitit motus,</hi> Tiberii <hi>principatu, 12 urbibus</hi> Asiae <hi>unâ nocte prostratis,] There was in the Reign of</hi> Tiberius, <hi>the greatest Earth-quake that has faln out in the memory of man; whereby in one night 12 Cities of</hi> Asia <hi>were ruin'd.] Tacitus,</hi> this, <hi>Twelve of the Famous Cities of</hi> Asia <hi>fell that year by an Earthquake; of which many men were swallowed up, by which the highest Mountains were levelled, the lowest Vallies elevated.

Whether <hi>Tacitus</hi> have stated this Earth-quake so long before the Passion of our Lord, as he seems to do at the first and overlie sight? and whether he has then stated it right, and might not be mistaken in that, as he is frequently in his Chronology? or how the stating it so early, stands with his interweaving it with the story of <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which fell out so near the latter end of <hi>Tiberius?</hi> I shall leave to the Sceptick to discuss; and am content, to shake out of the lap of my discourse these Testimonies, concerning this Earthquake, when he shall have dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my Opinion: that this was it, which happen'd at that time, when the

Of which also, as well as of this twofold Heathen Testimony S. <hi>Tertullian</hi> takes notice in his Apology for the Christian Religion: <hi>[Eodem momento dies, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium orbem signante sole, subducta est, deliquium utique putaverunt, qui id quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que super Christo praedicatum non sciverunt.] At the minute of time when our Lord suffered, the Sun in the mid Heaven, day with-drew it self: so as they that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew how it had been prophesied of Christ, that while that Shepherd was smitten it should be neither day nor night but betwixt both, a</hi> Nucthemeron <hi>of God's own creating, thought that diminution of light to have been an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse.</hi>

An excellent monument of so famous a day,</hi> as that was, whereon the darkness was so great and universal, as to be thought worthy of an intrado into the publick Records, amongst the portentous Contingencies of that Age. But <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> concerning our Saviours Crucifixion; with what past thereupon at <hi>Rome,</hi> (preserv'd till <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s days, in the same Records) is a more remarkable piece of Roman Antiquity: for that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Gospel, as in point of Time it got the start of the Canonical, so it contains the sum thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the blessed Jesus through the envy of the Elders of the Jews (for the fame he got, by his miraculous healing of Diseases, stilling the wind and seas, raising the dead, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> was deliver'd to <hi>Pilate</hi> to be Crucified: that though his Sepulcher by <hi>Pilate</hi>'s order, upon the motion of the Elders, was watch'd; yet his Sepulcher was found empty the third day; after which, he convers'd upon Earth forty days, and then ascended into Heaven, <hi>[Ea omnia super Christo Pilatus Tiberio nunciavit.

So as he foresaw a Famine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before it fell out: and all</hi> Egypt <hi>had perish'd through Famine, if the King, admonish'd by</hi> Joseph, <hi>had not commanded provision to be laid up for many years. Yea such experiments did he give of his Wisdom, as his Responds seemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from man but God.</hi> For this it was that he obtain'd, while he lived, the honour of being proclaimed by the Kings Command, <hi>[Abrech,]</hi> that is, <hi>[tender Father,]</hi> or as St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> (in his Hebraick Questions) and the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine Translate it, <hi>[The Saviour of the World,] (Gen.</hi> 41. 43.) prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that, before that of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> favours, and our English follows, <hi>[bow the knee.]</hi> And after his Death was worship'd by the Israelites in the Wilderness, under the form of the Golden Calf: they putting more confidence in him (for relieving their wants, in that barren Land) than in their Fathers God, who so often had spread a Table for them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness: Him also did <hi>Jeroboam</hi> worship at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> as the God of Plenty, and for the honour of his Tribe, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> being of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Joseph.</hi> Of which (beside the suffrage of some Rabbies mention'd by <hi>Vossius, (de origin. idololat.)</hi> these Observations may be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. 1.

This Coat of Arms, <hi>Moses</hi> calls, the Firstling of a Bullock; because of the green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s years, when he was set over the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> being then but 30 years old, exceeding young for the Gravity of his Counsel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; and therefore his Emblem was a Calf or Firstling. 3. Though the bewilder'd Israelites erected but one Image, yet their acclamation, before, it was, <hi>[These are thy Gods, oh Israel, which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt] [Exod.</hi> 32. 8.) VVhy Gods? but to denote, that Idol to have been of the Epicene Gender, and to have represented both <hi>Apis</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi> the Ox of <hi>Memphis</hi> and <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> which saith <hi>Plutarch, (de Iside &amp; Osyride)</hi> the Aegyptian Priests affirmed to be all one, and that <hi>Isis</hi> was the Soul of <hi>Osy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> And why, <hi>[Thy Gods which brought thee up out of the land of Aegypt,]</hi> but to exclude the <hi>Inderites,</hi> Egyptian Gods, whose Interest it was to keep them in Aegyptian Bondage, and to imply it was some deified Israelite, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit,

               <argument>
                  <p>The Adversaries forced upon very great Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to their own Cause, by reason that they could not for very shame resist the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, brought in defence of sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>Christ accused of working by the Prince of Devils: that Accusation withdrawn in open Court: and this Plea put in against him, that he made himself a King, and therefore was an Enemy to</hi> Caesar. § 2. <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Exceptions rebound upon the heads of their Framers. § 3. The Modern Scepticks half-reasons too young, to grapple with old Prescription. § 4. Christ's Works, God's Seal to his Mission. § 5. The present Age as able to judge of the Nature of those Works, as that was, wherein they were done. § 6. Aheistical exceptions against particular points of Religion, an</hi> Hydra's <hi>head; yet they all stand upon one neck, and may be cut off at one blow, by proving the Divine original of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. THese are all the kinds of Testimonies, that Matters of Fact are capable off: and so full and impartial; as, I am sure, our Modern Disputers cannot produce the like, for the probat of any Matters of Fact, except those which we have account of in the Gospel. I might therefore here conclude: But that I may leave the Sceptick without, not only all possibility of Reply, but of Excuse, for his Pertinacy, (if he hath the face to question the validity of this Argument) I shall add this weighty Consideration.</p>
               <p>That the Adversaries of the Christian Religion, in their discoursing upon that Subject, were put upon exceeding great inconveniencies, meerly upon this Reason, because they could not (for very shame) resist those Evidences were brought, in defence of the Evangelical History.</p>
               <p>To begin with the Jewish, we find the chief of them consulting, what they should do to hinder the Progress of the Gospel, when they saw such notable Miracles effected by Christ and his Disciples, as could not be denyed: and fore saw, that the whole World would run after them, if some stop were not put to this rowling Stone. The first Obstacle they lay in its way, was the calumniation of those great Works, as being done not by the Finger of God, but the Hand of <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> But whatever Presti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giator was read of in any History, so qualified as Christ was? the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutor of a Society, accomplish'd with all Gravity and Virtue; a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor</hi> of most sincere and true Doctrine (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> challengeth the Pagan Objectors <hi>(Demonst. Evang.</hi> 3. 8.) The only colour of a proof they bring for this (for their Fables, of Christ's going into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to learn Magick, of his having the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> sown in his Thigh, have not the least shew of Probability) was the seeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and of Christ, it being on all hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, that <hi>Moses</hi> was sent of God, and assisted in the Wonders he wrought
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43715:204"/>
(in confirmation of his Mission) by a Divine Power: and therefore what Christ did, in proof of his Doctrine, must needs be (as they bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphem'd) by a Diabolical. But when he attempts (at the araignment of our Saviour, and his Protomartyr) to prove Christ's Doctrine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, to that of <hi>Moses</hi> (by suborning Witnesses, to alledge many things in the New, looking a squint upon the Old Testament) these two, upon examination, prove better friends, and agree better with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, than the Witnesses do among themselves: whose allegations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy one another, while they are combining to prove the Gospel destructive to the Law; and in conclusion, after they have left no stone unturn'd, they are not able to make good one Instance of any such Doctrine. And thus, while the Jew cannot, while he dares not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the doing of the Works, the Delivery of the Doctrine (they were so manifest) but is forc'd, (if he will not, let the Gospel wholly alone) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Plea, he runs himself upon the inconveniency, of being manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baffled, and nonsuted in open Court: Insomuch, as (for all his boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he put on that Armour) he dares not trust to it, in the pitch'd Field, has not the heart to mutter one word before <hi>Pilate,</hi> of Christ's casting out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> though could he have made such a charge but probable, it would have administred to him a more plausible occasion of putting Christ to death, (both in respect of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Caesar)</hi> than that which he was, at last pinch, forc'd to take up, <hi>viz. [he said he was king of the Jews.]</hi> A Plea which, of all other, the Jew would not have stood upon; had not Malice over-clouded his Intellect, and prompted him to snatch up, in a rage, that weapon to offend Christ with, which (otherwise) he could not but forethink, the Gospel would take up in defence of the Truth of its History, and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that Doctrine, which is the very Soul of our Religion <hi>[He said he was king of the Jews,]</hi> that is, King <hi>Messias,</hi> the great Prophet that was to come into the VVorld. This is proved to the Christians hand, in open Court; Christ is called to make a good Confession of it, before <hi>Pontius Pilate. Pilate</hi> causes this Indictment to be writ in Capital Letters, in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek and Latin (for all to read) over his Cross; as the Crime, of which he was accused, and for which he suffered <hi>[Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This is enough to evince the Truth of the Gospel, as to Matter of Fact and Delivery of Doctrine; that the Church hath not feigned this story, that Christ really gave out himself to be that Person, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel reports him to be: for in saying, he was King of the Jews (in the common sence of that Age, and in the Notion of King <hi>Messiah)</hi> Christ said, he was born of the Virgin, of the Lineage of <hi>David,</hi> born in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> fled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> educated in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> convers'd in <hi>Galilee,</hi> made the lame to leap as an Hart, made the Eyes of the blind to see out of obscurity; was anointed of God to be that great Prophet, whom all are to hear; that Seed of the woman, that was to break the Serpents head: the Desire of all Nations; that unknown God; whom the Gentiles ignorantly worship'd; that Judean King, who was to subdue all Kings Scepters to his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can it be imagin'd, that one who pretended to this Title, would come with his Thumbs in his Mouth, and not demonstrate his Right to it, by doing such stupendious VVorks, as could not be effected, but by Divine Power; (seeing all pretenders to the Messiaship, both before and after him made show of working Miracles, in confirmation of their Pretensions;) and not exercise that Office, he affirmed he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43715:204"/>
the VVorld to manage, by giving out his Royal Law, by publishing his heavenly Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. VVhat VVorks, what Doctrine, was ever father'd upon Christ, so well becoming that Title, so like to sting the carnal and blinded Jews, to grate upon the proud and envious Pharisee, to offend that Generation that opposed him; as that whereof the Gospel giveth us an account? By what other VVorks but those, could <hi>Pilate</hi> be so far <hi>(conscientiâ Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> stiles him) convinc'd in judgement, that Jesus was indeed (what the Jews accused him to say he was) the King of the Jews; as he could not by their solicitations, be perswaded to alter the first Inscription? VVhat Doctrine but that could, upon trial, have been found so holy and blameless, as Christ's most malicious and cunning enemies, could not suggest one tittle of it, to a Judge, partial enough on their side, that he could find any fault in? St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore had reason to call that <hi>[a good Confession]</hi> which Christ made before <hi>Pontius Pilat,</hi> and to urge it upon <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Conscience, in that charge he gives him, to observe the Canon of Doctrine and Life, propounded in that Epistle: as being that Doctrine of Christ, which he confirm'd by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles before the people: and by confessing himself, before <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Tribunal to be King of the Jews. And so much more infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted did the Jews appear, in procuring (by the Plea they enter'd against him) the publication of this Title, in the ears of Jews, Romans and Grecians: which as it comprehends the Sum of the Christian Faith, so it is the Touchstone of all VVorks and Doctrines father'd upon Christ; and clearly evinceth the Truth of Evangelical History, if we compare what it delivers, with what the Prophets foretel the King of the Jews was to say and do.</p>
               <p>§ 2. These were their studied and unanimous Pleas against Christ: they had some Extempore ones, and, as it were, the Opinions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors. I will but glance at these. VVhen the Resurrection is preach'd, the Pharisee Applaudes, the Sadducee derides: when Christ preacheth the paying of Tribute, the Herodians approve, the Pharisees oppose. VVhat means this snarling of the Dogs, but that such bones were thrown amongst them? Some alledge, <hi>[that no man knows whence the Messias comes,]</hi> and therefore concludes, that Jesus was not he; they knowing, that he came out of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and having converse with his Mother, his Brethren, and Sisters. Others affirm that <hi>[the Christ was to come out of</hi> Bethlehem;] and that therefore the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was not he, being of so obscure an Extract, such a <hi>Terrae filius,</hi> as no man knew whence he came. Besides the manifest Contradiction whereby those Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Christ trip up one anothers heels, here are the manifest Prints of Christ's twofold Generation; one as God eternal, of his Father, which none can declare; another temporal, of the Substance of his Virgin-Mother. And of two material Passages in the History of Christ, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the Prophets, and infallibly conducting us to the places, where we are to look for the <hi>Messias;</hi> to wit, at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as to his so obscure Birth, as it was hardly taken notice of: and at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> as the place of his Education, and constant residence of his fleshly Relations.</p>
               <p>But these are but slight Inconveniencies, which the Jew drew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, by chusing rather to betake himself to these kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, than to oppose the Truth of the Narrative; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of those mortal Wounds, he hereby, gave his Cause, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43715:205"/>
might have avoided: if he had but dar'd, to have chosen that ground.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Had he excepted against the Truth of the History, and could have gotten the better there; he had been absolute Master of the Field: could he, for shame, have denyed the doing of the Miracles, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered would not have been able to stand out against his assaults, who would have followed a Doctrine, so repugnant to all mens carnal interest, so far above all humane Reason; had not God given it out, under his own Hand and Seal; without which Testimony of Christ's Mission from Heaven, he would but have been, as a private man: and his word of no more than (nay, not so much as) the Doctrine of the Scribes and Pharisees: for they sate in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Chair, and could shew Gods ordinary Commission: and therefore if they could have invalidated Christ's extraordinary Call, they needed not have feared, that his VVord would have been taken before theirs. Now what shorter or clearer way could they possibly have proceeded in, to make void Christ's Commission (even to all mens satisfaction) than by proving, that those great Works, which are reported of him, were not done by him, had that been feasible? Again, could they have proved, that he did not preach such Doctrine, as the Gospel presents; the Miracles would have wheel'd about to them, and have proved as good a defence of Pharisaism, as they are (as the Case now stands) of Christianity. If it had not been so famously known what Christ preach'd; as they could not deny, nor pervert his Doctrine; they might have father'd their own, upon him: and have alledged the Miracles wrought by him, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. Had not the Jew wanted face or courage to fall on here, he could not have wanted men: their love to sin, and priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Covenant of Peculiarity, would have furnish'd him with whole Legions of Voluntiers; besides those he might have prest with Bribes (as he did the Witnesses and Souldiers) to make a breach upon the Truth of Gospel-history: had not that attempt been looked upon as desperate, upon what other imaginable account can it be, that he sneaks about the Shore, where, ever and anon, he either runs on ground, or splits against the Rocks, and makes such miserable Shipwrack of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? Why avoids he the open Sea, and dare not encounter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel there, where, if he can put her to the worst, all's his own? Can any thing stand in his way, but cowardise, and the desperateness of the adventure? It is reported of the northern <hi>Augustus,</hi> the great <hi>Gustavus,</hi> that he seldom brought into the Field an Army of above 10000 men, (but those veteranes and experienc'd Solders) chusing rather to animate a well-set, than a corpulent and bulkie Body. Such was Christ's Army of Martyrs, whereby he subdued the World to the belief of the Gospel, and so formidable to the Jew, as he despaired to break its ranks, with all the force he could raise. Methinks I hear him thus discoursing with himself: <hi>[Should I say, this or that Passage in the History of Christ, is a forgery? I could have Seconds more than a good many; I could levy more Legions, to employ in that service, than the Gospel hath Squadrons, to defend its Truth: But alas mine would be as so many droves of Sheep, led up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Lyons: Those that she hath are faithful, and tried veterane Soldiers, Eye and Ear-witnesses of what was done and said; and the greatest part of them prest (at first) against the natural inclination of their will, against the Religion of their Country, to be on her side (and such in this case will do best service) meerly by such Conviction, as they are not able to withstand. It grieved them to hear and see such things; but such is the Evidence, whereby they commend themselves to the Consciences of all, that see or hear them, as they cannot be flattered, threatned, excommunicated, reason'd into
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43715:205"/>
a denyal of them. Who can I muster up, that will not be as Grashoppers, in the eyes and hands of such Gyants? the greatest part of those I can rally, being such, as were out of the way, when the things, under debate, were done; the rest such, as all know to be my own Creatures: but the worst is, when they come to charge, they will not be kept in any Order, but fall foul upon one another, and be in as many different Tales, as they are Persons. I must therefore let the Gospel alone, as to the Truth of its History (which sails with so strong a gale, as it were desperate fool-hardiness, to affront it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly:) I will rather try, what can be done by Consequences; I will give it Sea-room to sail by, perhaps I may espie something, in the works done, that may make men suspect, they are not the Finger of God; something, in the doctrine delivered, that may argue it not to come from Heaven: but as to the doing of the Works, the Delivery of the Doctrine, they are so manifest, as it were madness to oppose the Report.]</hi> This is the plain English of the Jew's behaviour, in his opposing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Another irrepairable loss he hath sustain'd, to the disparagement of his Cause, (by permitting the History of the Gospel to pass currant, through the first Age, without any offer of his opposition) is, that he hath hereby deprived himself, and his friends, of the advantage of playing an After-game. Had he boldly calumniated the Truth of the Story, something might have stuck, that might have rendred it less cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and afforded its Adversaries, in after-ages, some colourable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance against it: but now, he that lived upon the place (and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watched, for Christ's halting: for the faultring of the Pen of the sacred Scribes) having nothing to say against these Matters of Fact, has wholly disappointed, and bereav'd succeeding Generations of all possible Pleas. [Orpheum <hi>Poetam docet</hi> Aristoteles <hi>nunquam fuisse, &amp; hoc Orphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Carmen Pythagorici ferunt cujusdam fuisse</hi> Cecropis] <hi>(Cotta in Cicer. de natura deorum, l.</hi> 1.) Aristotle <hi>taught, that there never was any such Poet as</hi> Orpheus; <hi>and the Pythagoreans report, that the Poem that goes under the name of</hi> Orpheus, <hi>is the work of</hi> Cecrops. But both he any they were too young, to gain upon the VVorld's Faith, that had been ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the former, ancient, and universal Tradition, (that there was such a Poet, and that the Verses that go under his name, are his.) Let the Sceptick, if he can, produce one single Testimony, of that validity, that these against <hi>Orpheus</hi> are, against the blessed Jesus. How then can our Modern Atheist think, his silly and importune Quarrels, against the Evangelical History, are of any Validity with intelligent Persons? his Quarrels now, in the end of the World, sixteen hundred years too young, to bear witness against that, which its Contemporaries had not the face to deny?

[restat, ut ipsi velint esse testes de Christo, qui sibi auferunt meritum sciendi quid loquatur, loquendo quod nesciunt.] (August. tom. 4. pag. 162. de consensu Evang. 1. 8.) [It remains, that we take those mens Testimony of Christ, who by speaking those things which they are ignorant of, deprive themselves of the benefit of knowing what to speak:]</hi> while I lay open the mortal Wounds, which the Jew, his not daring to deny the Matter of Fact, hath given his Brother in iniquity, the Gentile Philosopher; who having so much Reason, as to think it unreasonable, that he, who was not an Eye-witness, should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against the Evidence of Eye-witnesses, touching those things, which Eye-witnesses (and as great enemies to the Gospel, as himself) had not been able to make any substantial exception against; was forc'd to grant the Truth of the History, and had nothing left worthy of a Philosopher, to object but this,</p>
               <p>§ 4. That the Works Christ did, did not speak him to be God, but only a good Man, and familiar with the Gods (by converse with whom, he learn'd the Art, or obtain'd the Power, of working Miracles) I use this Dis-junctive, because <hi>Porphyrie</hi> held the faculty of doing Miracles, may be attain'd by Art, but <hi>Jamblychus</hi> will have it, the free gift of God, bestowed on those that are most conformable to, and conversant with him, exploding all Arts tending that way, as Diabolical, (as <hi>Ficinus ex Jamblicho de mysteriis</hi> relates, <hi>pag. 78, 79. &amp;c.).</hi> But let them dissent or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as they please, that the stupendious Works of Christ were the effects of Divine Magick, and such as he could not have wrought, had not God been with him, was confest by the unanimous consent of all the Philosophical Opponents of the Christian Faith, who all subscribed to that of <hi>Porphyrie</hi> [Porphyrius <hi>dixit Christum summè religiosum, immortali animâ post corpus incedere, animâ sapientiae, gratiâ, honore affectâ, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

[It appears not by any competent signs of a Divine Majesty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, that your Jesus was God: for his casting out of Devils, his curing the sick, his restoring the dead to life, (if these and other strange things done by him be duly weighed) are too mean for him to manifest his glory by, whom you stile the Lord and Governour of the Universe,]</hi> said the Gentile Philosophers, in that Conference, of which <hi>Volusianus</hi> gave St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> an Account. I will not so far anticipate my intended discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Christ's Miracles, as here to give a full Answer to this Argument, but only glance at that which St. <hi>Austin</hi> returns him, <hi>[It's true indeed, such things as these have been done by men.</hi> Elias <hi>and</hi> Elisha <hi>raised the dead</hi> (1 Reg. 17. 22. 2 Reg. 4. 36.) <hi>but whether the Heathen Magicians ever raised any from death, let them inquire, who will needs maintain</hi> Apuleius <hi>did so, contrary to that defence himself makes, against the imputation of that,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43715:206"/>
as a Crime. To be sure, in his being born of a Virgin, in his raising himself from death, in his Ascension into Heaven he out did all men. And he that thinks these things too mean for God, I cannot tell what he can expect more; except he thinks Christ should have done such things, as are inconsistent with his being made Man.</hi> In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, and all things were made by him: <hi>Ought he, therefore, being made Man, to have made another World, to convince men that he was he, by whom the World was made? But a greater than this, or one equal to this, could not have been made in this World: and had he either made another World out of this; the making of that would have been no evidence to the Inhabitants of this, (for it would have been out of their sight) or a less World than this, in this; the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick would have had the same objection, that it was less than became God to make: seeing therefore it was not meet he should make a new World, he made new things in the old World; his Virgin-birth, his Resurrection, and Ascension, are works of greater Power, perhaps, than making the World: If here they answer, that they do not believe these things: what shall we do with such men, as contemn the least, and dis-believe the greatest of his Miracles? They believe he raised the dead, because that hath been done by others, and that's too mean for God: his taking Flesh of a Virgin, and lifting it up from death unto eternal Life above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, is therefore not believed, because no man ever did it; and its fit for God to do.]</hi> To return to our Heathen Philosophers. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they gave why they thought those things reported of Christ in the Gospel, not clear enough evidences of his Deity, was because some of those amongst themselves, who were reputed most holy Men, had done the like things; and therefore Christ, being a very wise and holy Person, and who convers'd intimately with God, might obtain that favourable Gift at the bountiful hand of Heaven. What an infinite disparity, both in respect of the things done, and the credibility of the stories, there is betwixt the Works of Christ and their <hi>Magi,</hi> will be discust in its proper place: I am now only to shew, what inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Learned Gentile was put upon, while he is forc'd upon making this Exception; as not having the face to deny the Matters of Fact.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Evidence of Christ's great Works, he is convinc'd that Christ was a good an holy Man; for none but such were privileged with a Power of doing such Works, as he did. By the same Evidence he must confess that Christ is God, for he profest himself to be one, with, and equal to the Father: and <hi>[a good man will not lye.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, if Christ were an holy Man, and by his Holiness had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Magick Art, he would have communicated the Principles of that Art to others: for [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,] <hi>[a good man is a common good;]</hi> communicative of his profitable knowledge. The Pagan here, was driven to this Reply: That Christ did write Books of the Magick Art, and dedicated, and delivered them to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> They could not (saith St. <hi>Austin)</hi> have pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more ridiculous answer; the falshood thereof laying open to the youngest Catechumen; who can tell these gray-beards, that Christ was ascended into Heaven, before St. <hi>Paul</hi> became his Disciple. But they had seen the Memories of those two Apostles celebrated together, and had heard them spoken of as the prime Apostles (the one of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the other of the Incircumcision) and therefore they joyn'd them in this Fable, as the likeliest persons, by whose hands Christ
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43715:207"/>
might diffuse the Principles of the Magick Art, through the World, of Jew and Gentile. Or they might take up this Conceipt, from the <hi>Helcesaitae,</hi> of whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> thus writeth: <hi>[St.</hi> Origen. <hi>in</hi> Psal. 80. <hi>mention'd a kind of Hereticks, called</hi> Helcesaitae, <hi>who gave out that they had a Book, which fell down from Heaven, which who so heard and believed the doctrine thereof, should receive an otherwise Remission of sins, than that which Christ dispensed.]</hi> This should be a Book of Magick by that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in <hi>Justinian's Codex [de maleficis &amp; mathematicis o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 5. But the mischief of mischiefs, that the Jew has brought upon his own, and his fellows Causes (in his not being able to resist the Truth of the Evangelical History,) is this, That hereby he has afforded the Christians of this last Age, an even ground to play with them upon, at all other Weapons, in all the remaining Controversies, touching that Subject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It being confest, that the Doctrine of the Gospel was deliver'd by Christ and his Apostles, and witnessed to, by such wonderful Works as are therein reported: for the determining of this Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those Works are truly and properly Miracles, and sufficient indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that the perpetrators of them, were commission'd by God (as his Embassadors) to treat with man? we of this Age are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way as well instructed as they that were (or as we our selves could have been, had we been) Eye-witnesses of them; whether <hi>Pompey</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> had the better Cause? (it being supposed that Antiquity has given us the true state of it) may as well (and perhaps more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially) be resolved by Modern Civilians, than by <hi>Cato</hi> or <hi>Cicero;</hi> though there may be more danger of mistake in resolving this Case, than ours; for the precise Rules that Lawyers are, in that case, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by, are not the universal Maximes of Right, but as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, limited, and manacled by the then Laws of the Roman State, where that might have been just or unjust, two thousand years ago, that would be the quite contrary now, (in respect of those mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have, in the interim, befaln their Politicks:) But, in our Case, we are to walk, by standing and fixed Principles in Nature, of eternal Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: nothing can be a Miracle, or not a Miracle now, that would not have been so, three thousand years ago: State-maximes are not, like the Laws of Medes and Persians unalterable: but the Covenant which God hath made with Day and Night, (the Ordinances of Sun, Moon and Stars) cannot be broken, but by the immedate hand of him that made them <hi>(Jer.</hi> 32. 26. 33. 20.) And therefore we who live now are better abilitated to judge: when the interposition of that hand suspends the operation of those Ordinances, than they who lived before us, saving the advantage they had of us, by means of the first Traditional Learning, communicated either by God, to <hi>Adam,</hi> or by <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Patriarchs: or acquired by those long-livers before the Flood, (the length of whose Age allowed them so large a time, to conn those Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which the hand of creating Omnipotencie had writ, in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the Universe) and deliver'd by their survivour <hi>Noah,</hi> to the Generations after the Flood; the benefit whereof the Devil did not so much envy (to humane kind) as he did the Tradition of Religion; (and therefore that was better preserv'd than this) Though our own be but a Pigmey-experience, yet it stands upon the Giants Shoulders of the experience of former Ages, by means of which upper ground, we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43715:207"/>
make new Discoveries, and take out new Lessons out of the Book of Nature, <hi>[facile est inventis addere.]</hi> To say nothing of the Modern helps we have; Of Scripture-physicks, by which many of the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers mistakes are discover'd, and we lighted to a clearer discovery of Nature, than Nature could make of her self: Of Accademies, where we enjoy all imaginable expedients of Arts, towards the perfecting our Minds in the knowledge of Natures Laws, and Learning to judge, when those Laws are either suspended, or improved, beside, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their own Line (the benefit of which opportunity would yet be improved, if we would subordinate Philosophy to Divinity, in point of Authority and Use:) of Authority in preferring the Light of the Sun, to the blaze of that Candle of the Lord within us: of Use, in studying natural Ethicks and Physicks, to the end we may know where Nature ends (as to both) and where Grace, and the God of Nature, begins to out-do those ordinary Powers, that are planted either in the great World, or its Epitome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Truth of the Gospel-Narrative yielded. If upon due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but any one of those mighty Works, therein reported to have been done, do undoubtedly appear to be a Miracle: we may, we must, without the least haesitancie, rest assured of the Infallibility of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctrine. For Gods Faithfulness and abhorrencie of Falshood, will no more consist with his setting one Seal to a Lye, than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. The Magicians vying with <hi>Moses,</hi> in some of those Wonders he wrought before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> did not prejudice his Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; seeing <hi>Moses</hi> did some things in confirmation thereof, which they could not imitate, but confess'd to be the Finger of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Any one Action of Christ, proved irrefragably a Miracle, will seal to the Truth of the whole Body of Gospel-doctrine, will attest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire sum, and compleat form of sound Words, to have been from Heaven. For God by granting Miracles to be wrought by Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in Christ's Name, did immediately seal to Gods sending Christ, and Christ's sending his Apostles, as Heavens Plenipotentiaries, to treat with the World, about the Matters of Eternal Life. The miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous descension of the holy Ghost upon our Saviour, at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, was to point him out to his Fore-runner, <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, as that true Light, which (according to Prophecy, and the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Jews) was come into the World, <hi>[he it is upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descend.]</hi> Upon seeing of which, and hearing that voyce from Heaven, <hi>[This is my well-beloved Son]</hi> the Baptist asserts him to be, that Prophet which God promised to send, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his whole pleasure to the sons and daughters of men. Christ's transformation in the holy Mount, was to confirm the three Apostles, in the Truth of that Voyce, they heard <hi>[This is my Son, hear him;]</hi> that is, whatever he shall speak in my Name, what terms soever he shall propound to the World, what way soever he shall chalk out to reconciliation, let them be observ'd, let no other be expected; For I have made him my Ambassadour, and given him full power to treat with the World. When the Apostles returned from working Miracles, the Question that Christ propounded to them was <hi>[Whom do men say I am?]</hi> and the question he put to such, as upon hearing or seeing the miraculous Cures, he wrought on others, applyed themselves to him for Cure, was, <hi>[Believest thou that I am be?]</hi> Infinite Examples might be produc'd. But this Proposition <hi>[Miracles do immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm the Divine Authority of the Speaker, and consequently
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43715:208"/>
the Truth of whatsoever he delivers]</hi> is so evident, as it needs no proof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, Matters of Fact granted, and the Supernaturalness of any one thing, done in confirmation of the Gospel, proved, affords Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of the meanest Capacities, ability sufficient, to confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in a full assurance of the Truth, of all Gospel assertions; to convince the subtilest Gain-sayers, (as that Laick did the Arrians, in the Council of <hi>Nice)</hi> and to answer all Objections, that ever were made, or can be invented, from those seeming absurdities, impossibilities, contradictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the wittiest Sophister can make himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he finds in the Evangelical Religion. For there cannot be <hi>[yea and nay]</hi> with God, nor any thing impossible to him, to whom it is possible to raise the dead, and to do such stupendious Works, as were wrought, for the demonstration of the Divine Authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: <hi>[Si Ratio contrà Scripturarum authoritatem redditur, quamlibet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuta sit, fallit verisimilitudine; nam vera esse non potest: rursùs, si mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festissime certae<expan>

Marcellino Ep. 7.) [If Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be alledged against the Authority of divine Scripture; be it never so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, it is not true, but deceives us, with an appearance of Truth, with a shadow of Reason. Again, if the Authority of Scripture seem to oppose manifest, and certain Reason: he that alledgeth that Authority does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Text he quoteth; and objects against that Truth, which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son presents, not the sence of Scripture, (which he is not able to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) but his own conceipt. Neither doth he oppose, against such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what he finds in the Text, but his own gloss and Comment, which he frames to himself.]</hi> And therefore when that Affricane Light thought he found any thing in Scripture, that seemed contrary to Truth, he concluded; That it was but either a shew of Truth, or a shew of Scripture, and that either <hi>[the Copy was corrupt, or the Translation false, or that he himself did not understand the Text aright] (August. Hieron. Ep. 19.) [—vel mendosum ese codicem, vel interpretem non esse assecutum quod dictum est, vel me minimè intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexisse.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Purity, and infinite Perfection of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that makes it impossible for God to lye, makes it impossible, that he should give his approbation, and the <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> to a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicting, absurd, or unreasonable Book.</p>
               <p>§ 6. Judicious <hi>Plutarch</hi> (in his Treatise of the Fortune of <hi>Alexander)</hi> compares his attempt to subdue the World, to <hi>Hercules</hi> his Combat with <hi>Hydra;</hi> in that, though he had no sooner dispatch'd one War, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sprung up, yet by searing the places of the neck where the heads grew which he cut off, he prevented the pullulation of fresh heads from those places: that is, by fortifying the places he gain'd, with Garrisons, he prevented the rising of the conquer'd, at his back; by which means at last he conquer'd all Nations. Of like difficulty and immense labour, is the undertaking to subdue Atheism: in an heart pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest with which, is a world of Devices; and a Tongue, prompted by such an heart, is a World of Iniquity (if not Epicurean infinite Worlds) <hi>(Jacob.</hi> 3. 6.)

It may be some daunting to the Atheists, some encouragement to the Church, to see so many heads lye gasping at the feet of the meanest of her Sons: And, perhaps, satisfie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of modest persons, as to what my Title promiseth, to see three of those Horns, that have (with the greatest spite and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain) been pushing at the Gospel cast out, by one so unskilful a Carpenter; A work for three of the ablest Artists; for God allows to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Horn a Carpenter, <hi>(Zech.</hi> 1. 20.)

The opportunity, which he impiously wish'd against the Senate, God hath graciously vouchsafed us, against the Atheist; for though these three Objections of his against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, that have been answered, stand upon several Grounds (as distinct Necks) and therefore are not to be cut off, but one by one: yet all his remaining Objections stand upon one neck, center in this one point. Say Christ and his Apostles meant honestly, say they were wise men, say we have in the Gospel a true account of their doings and sayings: yet they were but Men, and as men discover their weakness, in such and such Texts, in these and these passages: which had they been divinely inspired, would never have faln from their Lips or Pens. If, then, we can demonstrate the Errour of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, we make the Sophistry of all their Premises, upon which they labour to ground it, apparent: a man of the weakest Intellect, that hath seen Snow, will conclude all arguments, brought to prove it is not white, Fallacious. If we can manifestly prove, (the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to what they would conclude) That the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are of Divine Original, the weakest Christian (by help of that natural Logick, that is, every man's Birth-right) though he cannot discern the particular irregularity of the Atheists discourse, as to Mood and Figure; yet may certainly and scientifically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in the gross; that the Atheist's Arguments are not cogent, and necessarily concludent: and may stop all his blasphemous mouths, charm, into a dead sleep, the hundred squint eyes he casts upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; with one <hi>Bolus,</hi> with one <hi>Caducaeus;</hi> and, be his Heads a thousand, give them their deaths wound at one blow, and so cut

               <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been a question agitated in the Schools, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Notion of a Deity be not so imprinted on the Tables of the Heart, as 'tis not possible to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out? So congenial to the humane mind as it cannot frame a conception inward, answerable to this outward expression <hi>[There is no God]</hi> a Sentence in the Fools mouth and heart, and perhaps in his Brutish imagination, but not to be transcribed thence into his upper soul, whose pre-notions repulse all thoughts of entertaining it. <hi>(Alexand. Alens. sum. par. 1. quest. 3. memb 2.) An ita deus sit cogitare non esse; (vide Trismig. peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.) Jamblicus</hi> makes the knowledge of God so essential to the soul, as he saith <hi>[to know God is the very essence thereof] Jamblic. de mysteriis 6. titulo de cognitione divinorum.) [Ante omnem rationis usum inest naturaliter dei notio: imò tactus quidam divinitatis melior quam notitia—Intellectus divinus dat esse
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43715:211"/>
animae, per intelligere suum essentiale: ergo esse animae est quoddam intelligere, scilicet deum, unde dependit; esse nostrum, est Deum cognoscere.] The Notion of God is naturally in man before all exercise of reason: yea, a certain touch of the Divinity better than knowledge. The divine intellect, by giving it to understand its own being, gives being to the soul, the being therefore of the soul is to know that upon which it dependeth, to wit, God, our being is to know God.]</hi> Or whether, in case it could be supprest within, the arguments from without, of a Deity, are not so urgent upon our discoursive faculties, as we cannot open our eyes upon the creature, but we must see the impresses of the infinite Wisdom, power, goodness, of their Creator and disposer? The Author of the Book of Wisdom <hi>chap.</hi> 13. puts the fool upon all them, who from the good things that are seen, could not see him, that is, neither by attending to his works, would acknowledge who is the workman. As to matter of fact the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ages afforded those were called Atheists, by those who reputed all such that did not imbrace the commonly received Gods, (for which reason the Christians were branded with that ignominious title) but that those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges produced one real Atheist, is more than can be proved: there were then such as doubted <hi>an dii sint vel non sint [Whether there were any Gods or not]</hi> There were such as questioned (or rather determined negatively) whether those were Gods, whose Idols were presented either in the colour of the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Deities, black, (as <hi>Alexander Geraldin, 5. Itenerarii</hi> affirms the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> to have painted their Gods, thinking that the most venust colour which themselves were tanned with) or in the bloody hew of Victors, Red: as the <hi>Romans</hi> in their triumphs painted <hi>Jupiter</hi> (saith <hi>Pliny, l. 3. cap.</hi> 7.) or in such ridiculous and unbeseeming shape, as that was whereby <hi>Latona</hi> was represented at <hi>Delos;</hi> at the sight whereof <hi>Parmenistas Metapontius</hi> could not refrain laughter, who before that had never laught since he came out of <hi>Trophonius</hi> his Cave <hi>(Athenaeus Dypnosoph.</hi> 14.) but there never was any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ancients that ever questioned. <hi>An Deus sit? [Whether there be a God?]</hi> But this last age hath been productive of Monsters, whose Bellies have sent up those fumes into their head, as cloud the knowledge of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and will not suffer any God to be acknowledged but the Belly: so much more black and dismal is that night of ignorance, wherein the divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice invelops the abusers of Divine light, than that which men brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves, by not attending to natural Notions. That we may not therefore seem to beg that principle, but force the adversary to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Deity; we will first prove the existence of a God, and then (by the same evidences) prove the Scriptures to be of Divine and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> in his wild discourse of the production of the Universe, makes one sober Observation. That he who goes about the framing of any work, if he have before him a model thats always the same, and propounds that to himself as a sampler, must of necessity produce an excellent work: but if he mind only the shape of the thing it self which he is making (which changeth with every turn of the wheel, and receives new impresses by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new motion of the Artificers hand) he shall never bring forth so absolute comly a piece as he desires. From hence (saith he) it necessarily follows that this world, which we plainly discern to be an every way perfect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, is the counterpart of some eternal Idea, pre-existing in the mind of the Architect, before it was made. <hi>(Seneca de provid.) Supervacuum est ostendere, tantum opus non sine aliquo custode stare. (Arist. 2. Phys.) Natura ut est sub primo agente intellectuali, operatur propter finem; (&amp; Metaph. 12. 10.) necesse est unum esse principem, ut optima sit universi gubernatio. Neaue enim potentia temeraeria, sed sapientiae virtute, omnipotens est Deus (August 9. super Genesin ut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram cap. 17.) It is needless to shew that such a work cannot stand without a Keeper</hi> (saith Seneca) <hi>Nature as it is under the first intellectual agent, operates for some end: where the universe is so excellently composed, there must need be one Prince (saith</hi> Aristotle) <hi>God saith Saint</hi> Austin <hi>is Omnipotent, not by a teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43715:211"/>
power, but by the virtue of wisdom.</hi> I choose this for my medium, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the consequence of it is perceiveable by the common sense of all men, from the greatest Statists to the simplest mechanicks. If the Carpenter or Wheelwright had nothing in their mind while they are hewing, but whats under their eye and Axe, (to which every stroke gives a new shape) if the one while he is shaping a spoke, did not think of a Wheel, and the other while he is forming a Beam, of an House, and both of them had not the perfect Idea of the proportions, and forethought of the use of that they are framing, they would never make all meet together in that symmetrie of parts, as the ultimate product of the one should be meet for habitation, and of the other for carriage. Should not the Gallants Taylor take measure of him, and sound all his Dimensions, or at least have one of his size in his thoughts while he cut out a sute for him, he would make a pitifull Gentleman of him, if he were a man only of the Taylors making, and nothing but his cloaths.</p>
               <p>§. 2. No less conspicuous are the prints of infinite wisdom, the footsteps of eternal, all-comprehending, divine foreknowledge in the admirable frame of the world. If we travel through the little World, Man, the Index, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, and Abstract of the great, that Nutshel wherein the whole Iliads of the larger Poem are comprised, that Center where all the lines of the whole Creation meet; and therein contemplate the outward and inward composure of the body, wherein there is not the least particle but hath its apparent use, and whereof every part is without the care or industry of Parents fitted to its proper use, with so much art, that the greatest Philosophers and most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Physicians can never sufficiently admire it. This Workmanship shews the Workman to be a most excellent mind, and to have squared his work by the line of most Superlative wisdome. The Prince of Physicians, <hi>Galen,</hi> though an Heathen, saw, (and wondred that any are so blind as not to see) the incomprehensible riches of the divine omniscience in the Anatomy of the eyes, and in the Dissection of the hand, felt (and admired that any should be so thick skin'd, as not to feel as it were by the fingers end) the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the maker, exprest in the admirable disposing of every joynt, so as to make the hand a fit tool for the performance of every work, we use it in. The tongue of the most fluent Orator never run more glib in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any passions of his mind, than those of admiration, at the artificial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of an humane body; when he read to the World that Anatomy Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, in his second Book <hi>de Natura Deorum,</hi> where discoursing upon that Subject, from the hair of the head to the nails of the toes, he makes every pipe of that well tun'd Organ, every string of that melodious Lute, sound cut the praises of the all-wise Maker, one while stiling it the <hi>[incredibilem stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturam]</hi> so admirable a composure, as did we not see it with our eyes, we could not be induc'd to believe it were within the compass of wisdom it self to contrive such Engines of speech, of Breathing, of Digestion, Egestion, Generation, Local Motion, &amp;c. another while crying out <hi>[vim quondam in-, credibilem artificiosi operis divinique testantur.]</hi> would it be credible if it were not sensible, that so artificial and Divine Works could be framed?</p>
               <p>§ 3. How much greater Wonders of the Divine Science might I shew the Atheist, if I ripped up before him that other part of himself? If I shewed him the sparklings of the Jewel that's deposited in this Cabinet; the Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alness of the Spring of all, these stupendious Motions; whereby, in the twinkling of an eye, his Mind surrounds the Earth, and, if he please, mounts above the Stars: but this his immortal Piece is as far from his knowledge as his care! I will therefore not disturb him out of that pleasing Dream and conceipt of Jack-work or Clock-work: (for his mind is so taken up with Time, so fastned to his Trencher, Palate and Panch; as he can think of nothing but Clocks and Jacks;) nor wish him to strain his eyes in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of so small a Print, as that incorporeal Spirit is writ in, whereby he

lives (or should live) the Life of a Man; nor draw him out of his own gross element of bodily Substances; nor pose him with these hard Questions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things above his head, the ballancings, the Bottles of the Clouds, the moulten Glass of the Heavens, the Treasures of the Snow and Hail, the way that parts the Light, the Rain-spouts, the influences of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> the time measuring <hi>Mazzaroth,</hi> the Seamans guide <hi>Arcturus;</hi> his Neck inured to stooping, would ake if it should stand in an erect posture: But only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him to cast his eye upon that, on which he sets his Feet, the diverse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, flowrie, or grass-green Carpet of this Earthly Globe; and with the same reason he can think, that any thing but immense and eternal Wisdom, could contrive, the providing of so well furnished a Table, with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Food, and such plenty of delicates; the planting of so rich a Garden, with such variety of Flowers for Food, Physick or Delight; with so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a variety of Colours, Scent, Tastes; he may far rather expect, that his own Garden should of it self, by meer chance of Fortune, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Head, or labour of the Hand, part it self into most curious Beds and Artificial Knots; or that Stone and Timber should by chance, lay themselves into the form of a well-built House; or that single Letters cast out of a shuffling Box, should fall in that order, as to make an Elegant Poem. <hi>(Cicer, de Natura deor. 2. p. 87.) [Hîc ego non mirer esse quenquam, qui sibi persuadeat corpora quedám solida atque individua, vi &amp; gravitate ferri, mundum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ornatissimum &amp; pulcherrimum ex eorum corporum concursione fortuita?

He who thinks this possible to be done, I see no reason why the same man should not also think, that if innumerable Characters of the one and twenty Letters, were cast somewhither, there might of them fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the earth be made the Annals of</hi> Ennius, <hi>so as they might be read, whereas I can hardly think, that fortune would be able to make one verse, after that manner.]</hi> How much more like a man did he discourse, who obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Geometrical Figures drawn on the Shore, said, <hi>[I see the footsteps of a man]</hi> easily perceiving that such Figures had not been flung by blind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but drawn by Art. If he dare venture to cast his eye so near Heaven, as the top of a Tree, or the midst of a Bush; he may observe those so well timed and orderly Actions of Birds and Bees, as cannot but proceed from an higher Reason, than that of their particular Natures; that Fore-cast, to make; that ingenuity in making their Nests; that Discretion in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at first sight their Foes from Friends; that Parental care of their young, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may with more reason be admired, than they can, by the best improved Art, be imitated by us men. If the Atheist scorn <hi>Moses,</hi> let him (if it be but for Recreation) read <hi>Aelians</hi> History of Animals, <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Treatise of the Ingenuity of Birds, Beasts, Insects, Fishes, and Bees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himself must be (what <hi>Plutarch</hi> denies any of them to be) a Brute: if he learn not, that they received their skill from a mind fraught with infinite Wisdom; from a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of infinite Goodness, proportioning every of their properties to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their own Beings and conservation of their kind. If he open but an Ants Nest, a whole Colledge of Doctors will accost him, and offer to read him a Divinity-Lecture, upon this Point: the Doctrine whereof they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry in their Mouths, but lay upon their Shoulders; he may see them hording up in Autumn their Winters Provision, and first eating the Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of every grain of Corn in their Granarie, to prevent its Sprouting: how gloriously incomprehensible must that Providence and Foresight be, that makes those silly Insects thus provident!

But while I send the Sluggard, the Slow-belly Atheist to the Ant to learn, I must not forget to lay open to my Christian Reader, those Golden Letters of this great Volume, those Spangles that glitter in that our Canopy, which is but the Pavement of the upper House of the invisible World; whose Influences and Motions are so attempered to the Production and Conservation of Terrestrial Creatures; so fitted to our conveniency, as it is not possible to imagine how they could have been order's better.

Nor do I think that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was in earnest, when he said that had he been with God, at the Creation, he could have directed the Sun a better course than that which he steers: Or if he was, he had the Moon then in his Crest, or was himself the greatest errour that ever nature committed. For though another course of the Sun might have been more convenient for <hi>Alphonsus</hi> his Kingdoms, as well as another course and place of the Sea; and though the end of his keeping within the Zodiack, which <hi>Cleanthes</hi> fancies, (to wit this, that the Sun being a Globe of Fire (the Food of whose Vitals was Moisture) that he might not die of thirst, would not recede further from the Mediterranean, than that he might reach, if not his Lip, yet (with the help of a long arm) his Spoon into it; and sip from thence his dayly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, might have been better obtain'd, if he had in his course been led al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to face the Ocean. Yet to him that considers what a general benefit it is to the whole world, that the Sun follows that line he does, in his dayly and yearly course; how by this means his Light and Heat is most equally distributed; the, (as profitable as pleasant) interchanges of Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of Spring and Autumn, procured: and all sublunary Creatures have assigned to them, as fit proportions of time (to work and rest in) as could be devised. To him I say that considers this, it will appear that an house built thus Magnificent, and furnisht with all imaginable conveniences, and all the members and parts of it disposed into so comely an Order (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every particular serves it self, in serving the Community) was neither built for, nor by, Rats and Mice; but by that infinite being, who had in his mind, before the production of it, a preexisting, eternal and perfect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of all its Parts, Uses, Appurtenances, and Circumstances. If the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous concourse of Atomes (saith <hi>Cicero)</hi> could produce so comely a Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture as the Universe, why do not they produce a Portch, a Temple, a City, which are far more easie, and have infinitely less Workmanship? Who can think him worthy of the name of Man, who when he sees such certain and regular Motions of the Heavens, such fixed Orders and Ranks of the Stars, and all things in Heaven and Earth so aptly connext and joyn'd together; can deny that the greatest Reason hath been, and is imployed in the making, sustaining, and guiding of them?

That some men, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lived underground, should be let out of that Dungeon, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come upon the surface of the Earth; where, on a sudden, they should see, the Earth, the Sea, and Heaven; perceive the greatness of the Clouds, the force of the Winds; look upon the Sun, and understand the vastness of its Bulk, the Beauty of its Face, and the force of his Influence; the efficacy of its Light, making Day, of its Heat cherishing and refreshing all creatures: and next, when day is shut in, should fix their eyes upon the many thousand fixed eyes of the Starry Heaven, the various Faces of the Moon Increasing and Decreasing, with all their Risings, Settings, and constant Motions. They could not with - hold their assent to this Truth; That all this is the contrivance of unsearchable Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Divinely our <hi>Lactantius (De falsa relig. l.</hi> 2. 5.) in answer to that of the Philosopher <hi>[If the Motions of the Stars be not fortuitous. they must be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and have a Principle of Life and Reason within themselves]</hi> denies the sufficiency of the Disjunction; saying, they are neither fortuitous, nor voluntary; and yet keep a constant course in performing their journeys, because God (the Architect of the Universe) hath so framed them, that they run through the spaces of Heaven, by a Divine and admirable Reason, in order to the making of variety of Seasons succeeding one another. If <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> could so frame the Image of the World in concave Brass, as one might see therein the Sun and Moon, making the like Motions as they do

in the Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Could not God much more so despose the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, than humane Wit could make a Resemblance of them. And if a Stoick should see the imitation of the Heavenly Motions, would he say that motion was caused by the Wit of the Engine, or of him that made it? There is therefore Reason in the Stars, fitted to carry them to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their various courses; but that is the Reason of God, who made and governs all things, not of the Stars that are moved. And <hi>c. 2. [Nemo est tam rudis, qui oculos suos in caelum tollens, tametsi nesciat cujus Dei Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiâ regatur hoc omne quod cernitur, aliquam tamen esse non intelligat ex ipsa rerum magnitudine, motu, dispositione, constantiâ, utilitate, pulchritudine, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratione: nec possit fieri, quin id, quod mirabili ratione constat, majori aliquo consilio sit instructum.] There is no man so rude, if he lift up his eyes toward Heaven, although he knows not by what Gods Providence, all that which he sees, is governed, that does not understand by the Immensity, Motion, Disposition, Constancy, Conveniency, Beauty, Composure of these things, that there is some providence or other; and that it is not possible, but that that which is continued by such admirable Reason, was at first framed by the greatest Counsel.</hi>

They were usually not of things purely future, but latent in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes: latent (I mean) to Humane Knowledge, but not to Diabolical Sagacity; which smelt them at a distance, sometimes in their general Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (by their skill in Judicial Astrology) sometimes in their immediate and more particular Causes (by their skill in the affairs of States and Interests of several Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By means whereof, I am so far from admiring their fore-telling the events of Battails, the Fortunes of some Persons of note; their communicating Intelligence from places of 100 or a 1000 miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in an hour, in a minutes space; as I wonder they could get any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect at all, among the soberer and more Civilized Nations, by such three penny Prognostications, as an ordinary Wizzard might out-vie. <hi>Hagag</hi> the Son of <hi>Joseph</hi> a Jew, and Prefect of <hi>Babylon, Anno Christi</hi> 714. being taken with a violent Fever, inquired of an Astrologer, whether he could find by the Motions of the Starrs that a King was to die that year; he affirmed there would but one, whose name was <hi>Cain Hagag,</hi> calling to mind that his Mother had given him that Name at his Birth; I must die then (replyed he) but thou shalt die before me: and instantly commanded his head to be struck off: <hi>(Scalig. can.

No sure, but he came to the knowledge of it as Gypsies do, of mens Relations and the temper of their Neighbours towards them. <hi>[Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sunt auguria non divini impetûs sed rationis—quos prudentes possimus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, id est, providentes, divinos nullo modo possimus; non plus quàm</hi> Milesium Thalem; <hi>qui ut ostenderet etiam Philosophum, si ei commodum esset, pecuniam facere posse, omnem Oleam, antequàm flores cepisset in agro Milesio coemisse dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; animadverterat fortasse quadam scientiâ, olearum ubertatem fore: Necillam divinationem voco, quâ</hi> Anaximandro <hi>Physico moniti</hi> Lacedemonii <hi>sunt, ut ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem et tecta relinquerent, armatique in agris excubarent; quòd terrae motus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staret:—Nec illam quâ</hi> Pherecides, <hi>cùm vidisset haustam aquam à jugi puteo, terrae motus dixit instare (Cicer. divinat 1. pa. 197.)

               <p>But it is more to be admired that those busie spiritual Wickednesses, in the Heavenly places, those Princes of the Air, those Curriers that went to

and fro over the Earth, did no more improve the advantage which their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave them, to their abusing the World with stronger Delusions; To which, doubtless, their Pride and Ambition to be reputed Gods, and their spiteful enmity to the Womans Seed, did instigate them. And therefore I cannot but adore that Divine Providence, which so far restrain'd those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, powerful and intelligent Spirits, as in this point (of Fortune-telling) they could not go the full length of the Line of their own Natures; they were not permitted to tell all they knew, to shew things that were in their second Causes, (and therefore under their inspection;) much less to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the fore-knowledge of things that had no being but in the first Cause.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Though he might (for the punishment of mens impious Curiosity) have used bad Angels as well as good, to carry Tidings of such Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as the Messenger could not have known, but by his Revelation: yet that was done without impeachment of this his challenged Privilege of shewing the End from the Beginning: For he used the service of wicked Spirits (to anticipate the torment of wicked men, by their fore-knowledge of what would happen) only in general predictions of some one single event, without any other Circumstances than such as did either naturally touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or might with strong probability be gathered from, that one supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally-reveal'd Contingent. Thus, upon supposition of Gods revealing to that Spirit, which the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> raised, that <hi>Saul</hi> should die in that Battail, which the Israelites and Philistines were so near an engagement in, as both Armies were set in Battalia, and facing one another, what time <hi>Saul</hi> consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Witch; that spirit might rationally collect the time of his death <hi>[to morrow;]</hi> for it was not like the Armies would stand longer in that posture, nor the Israelites engage sooner, than <hi>Saul</hi> should return to the head of his Army: the discomfiture of the Israelitish Host, for it could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that <hi>Saul</hi> should die in that Battail, but either in Fight, (and that would be such a quelling of the spirits of his men, as to make them turn their backs upon the enemy) or in Flight (and that must be after his loss of the Field, and the taking of the Ark of God, which they carried with them into the Field, and must leave there when they had lost the Field. It might be here observ'd, that the Indian Responds to <hi>Alexander,</hi> were meer Gypsie-juglings. <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> informs him, that the Priests told him, that <hi>[The Sun gave out Oracles in the Grecian as well as the Indian Tongue, but the Moon only in the Indian:]</hi> Is not the reason of this apparent? because the Priests of the Sun were Learned Knaves, and could speak Greek; but the Moons Vestals were illiterate Females, who understood their Mother-Tongue only. And as to the Answers which both gave, how easily might they guess what <hi>Alexander</hi> desired to be resolved about? For what could a person of his ambition think of, but Conquering the World; or a person to whom his Mother and Sister were so dear, as he intermingled their Names in the Discourses he had with the Gymnosophists, but of returning home to those beloved Relations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so long a march? And, how easie was it to promise him the Conquest of the World, after he had subdued it as far as <hi>India</hi>'s utmost Eastern Bounds, (that is, to the end of the known World on that side, where it was most anciently and populously inhabited, and therefore most likely to make resistance.) Lastly, how probable was the Conjecture, that (now his labour of conquering was as good as over) a man of his complexion would give himself to that ease and luxury, as would lay him open to the stroke of untimely death, by effeminating his body, and making it unapt to bear the extremities of the Climes, through which he was to return; Or grow up to that height of disdainful pride, as might possibly provoke his Captains to disgust him. To say nothing of that light, which those Travelling Sophs might have received, from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, from which it is manifest, those Chaldeans borrowed that Light, which they exhibited, in their Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostications

of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Greatness, and <hi>Darius</hi> his Fall, (by <hi>Q. Curtius l.</hi> 4.) The Demon of <hi>Delphos</hi> was not such a punie Devil sure, but that he could count to four, and read <hi>Daniels</hi> Text, where he wrote of a fourth King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> from <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Graecia</hi> should subdue: nor such a Freshman, but that he had Logick enough to make this inference, That he who was to subdue the Empire of the whole World, would translate the whole Empire to himself: and therefore his informing <hi>Philip,</hi> that his Son, whom <hi>Bucephalus</hi> permitted to come upon his back, should make the whole World his Mule; was no more than what any Pigmie, set upon the Gyant shoulders of <hi>Daniel</hi> might have seen.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Where Pagan Oracles, in an apish imitation of those of the God of Israel, seem to foretel things from beginning to end; yet they shew not, they declare not, those future things, in such clear expressions and incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versial Terms, as speak the Author of those Responds, to have had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what they seem to speak; but rather a design to cover their own Ignorance, and save their credits, under the shelter of ambiguous words; such as, whatever should fall out, might equally be applied to them and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from them, according to the different Glosses, which several Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies might put upon them. Of which though I have elsewhere given seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral examples, I shall here add that out of <hi>Homer,</hi> observ'd by <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his <hi>de Som. Scipion. (lib. 1. cap. 7.) [Divulgatis etiam docemur exemplis, quàm penè semper cùm praedicantur futura, ità dubiis obserantur, ut tamen diligens scrutator, nisi divinitùs impeditur, subesse reperiat apprehendendae vestigia verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>We are taught (saith he) by famous examples, how that almost constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when future things are foretold, they are sealed up in doubtful words; yet so as the dilligent searcher, if he be not divinely impeded, may find out some footsteps of Truth therein hinted.</hi> As when the Grecian Emperor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Jove</hi> in a Dream, that the day following he should draw up his Army and give Battail to the Trojans; and, encouraged with manifest hope of promised Victory, did as he was commanded: but came off with so great loss of men, as he had much ado to make a retreat to his own Camp. Was he deluded with a lying Oracle? by no means (saith <hi>Macrobius)</hi> but the Fates intending that mischance to the Grecians, there was that lurking in the words of the Dream, which had they observ'd, would have directed them, how they might either obtain the Victory or avoid Fighting. For <hi>Jove</hi>'s Precept was, that the whole Army should be drawn up, meaning, that the King should forthwith make his peace with <hi>Achilles,</hi> (who upon disgust, had drawn off his Party, and deserted the Cause:) The King therefore not following <hi>Jove</hi>'s Instructions, did both deservedly sustain that detriment, and absolve the Dream from the envious charge of lying.

The Responds were as contingent, as the things they foretold. Those blind Bards might hap-hazzard, stumble upon a Truth; as the veriest Lyar in the World may; while those great Lotteries were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, though most of the Fortunes were Blanks, yet some lucky hand might perhaps once in an Age draw a Prize, or throw a <hi>Venus</hi> upon the Prenestine Dice, once in an hundred casts. To that Samothracian who made offer to prove <hi>Neptunes</hi> faithfulness to his Votaries, by the multitude of votive Tables which were dedicated by such as had escaped Shipwrack; yea, replied <hi>Diogoras,</hi> but were there a Table hung up, for every one that has been drowned, while they were most devoutly invocating <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Temple would not contain them. <hi>[Quis enim est qui totum diem jaculans non aliquando collimet?] (Et Plutarch de oracul. defect. pag. 679.) sicut ii qui saepè jaciunt, saepenumerò scopum attingunt] He has very bad luck that shoots all day long, and never comes near the mark,</hi> saith <hi>Cicero, (de Divin.</hi> 3.) Upon these accounts these Oracles grew into that contempt, as the Spartans would not trust to the Respond of <hi>Dodona,</hi> till they had sent <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to <hi>Delphos,</hi> to propound this Question to <hi>Apollo;</hi> whether he was of the same mind with his Father? and notwithstanding they had the assurance of two Oracles, <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> to cure the Despondency of his Army, was fain to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn the <hi>Augur</hi> to imprint <hi>Victory</hi> upon the Liver of the Sacrifice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he found it there.

The far greatest and most substantial part of those things not being applicable, in truth, to the persons that spake them. <hi>David</hi> in his own person suffered not such like things, any more then he did not see corruption, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> argues: And therefore, as the same Apostle dictates, those Prophesies were not of private interpretation; that is, as Saint <hi>Philip,</hi> (in answer to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs question) resolves, the Prophets did not speak those things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but of some other man, to wit the <hi>Messias.</hi>

The Learned <hi>Vossius (de Origine idol. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 48.) doth explode the madness of some Modern Astrologers, who affirm, that all the Miracles wrought by Christ and his Apostles, or any body else, were the natural and necessary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of some Conjunctions of Planets; and were not ashamed to ascribe to the Horoscope, the Birth of Christ of a Virgin, and all his stupendious works, and those great Changes which have faln out in respect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ascribing the rise of the Jewish, to the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Saturn;</hi> of the Chaldean, to the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Mars;</hi> the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian, to the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with the <hi>Sun;</hi> The Mahometan, to the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Venus;</hi> the Christian, to the Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Mercury;</hi> and the Antichristian, to <hi>Jupiters</hi> Conjunction with the <hi>Moon,</hi> (all which is to be read in <hi>Albumazar, lib. 2. de mag, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectul. tract. 1. dissect.</hi> 4.) Say that such Conjunctions might possibly incline those parts of the World, under the Dominion of their Influence, to imbrace those several Religions; yet he must be of a Facile Faith, that can believe it was possible for our Divine Prophets to read their Predictions, in the Book of the Starrs; who if they had had an everlasting Almanack in their heads, from what Positions of the Heavenly Bodies could they have Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticated, the concentring of so many emergencies upon one man? from what Conjunction of Planets (or Lincaean inspection into Matters of State) (a Book more tost, and to better purpose than the other, by those prudent Judicial Astrologers, who had a mind not to shame their Profession) could <hi>David</hi> foresee the agreement of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> who the day before were at enmity, and on the day of our Saviours Passion were made Friends, and that in order to our Saviours Crucifixion at <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> which (according to Gods determinate Counsel revealed to <hi>David)</hi> could not be effected, till
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43715:216"/>
those Rulers under the Gentile Empire stood up in their Masters quarrel, and with the people of Israel, took councel together against the Lord and his Christ, as the Church dictates, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 25. 27. From what sowr and crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Aspect of the Planets, could <hi>David</hi> foretell, their turning of Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vinegar? From what influences the distilling of the Blood of God from Christs Head, Hands, Side, Feet? In what <hi>Ephemeris</hi> did the Prophet read that astonishing Darkness that invelopt the Earth? Briefly, in what Cause, but the Will of God revealed to them by himself, could they see those strange events that fell out; that one Year, that acceptable Year of the Lord; that one Week, that great Week, as the Ancients stiled it; that one Day, that Day of Redemption? Let the most expert Astrologer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Scheme, set up all the Lamps of Heaven, in that posture wherein they stood at our Saviours Passion; and try if he can by their Light, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the least appearance or likelihood of a reason, that in such a juncture such things must fall out, by the course of nature. That at that time (for instance) those Prophetick Forms, which the Jews used in derision of Christ, that had hung (as it were frozen) at the Prophets lips, so many hundred of years, should be thawn, and drop into the Mouthes of that Generation: That the Legs of the Thieves should be broken. and not our Saviours: That his Side should be pierced and not theirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Those Prophecies are so plain, and the Application of them, in their Effects, to the Blessed Jesus, so natural; as we need not strain courtesie with the Letter it self (to wrest it from its most obvious sence, in making the Buckle and Thong meet; in making the accomplishment kiss the Oracles. Here need no <hi>Salvoes</hi> of the Prophets Credit, by understanding them to speak figuratively; The Text is so easie, as it needs no other Gloss, than the plain History of the Gospel; the same words, the same things, which the one foretells to be done, the other tells as done, <hi>Bethlehem</hi> answers <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, Nazareth, Nazareth; Aegypt, Aegypt,</hi> as face answers face: <hi>David</hi> declaring the case of his own soul used the phrase of <hi>[Broken Bones]</hi> Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, to shew the dislocation of its Faculties, by his great Fall: But <hi>Moses</hi> in describing the ordinance of the Paschall Lamb (the Type of the Lamb of God) uses those words <hi>[a Bone of him shall not be broken]</hi> in their proper sence, in that sence, wherein the Evangelists applies that Text to Christ. He had his Metaphorical Gall, Vinegar, Spittings, Buffetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Son of <hi>David</hi> had them really, according to the Letter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. The ruine of the Jewish State, the Vocation of the Gentiles, the Glory of Christs Kingdom are sometimes indeed set out in Rhetorical Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes and borrowed expressions; but they (and all things else pertaining to Christ) are in other Prophetick Texts, so plainly foretold as the Tongue of Man can speak.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The punctual performance of this whole Cluster, the ripening of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Berry thereof into Event, speaks the Prophets not to have spoken by chance. That Poem cannot be a Medley, a Rapsody, whose every foot is of a regular length. If you throw 4 Dice, perhaps one of them may be a Size, but who ever saw an hundred Sizes cast at one throw of an hundred Dice. If a Sow with her Snout should imprint upon the ground, which she is rooting up, the Figure of the Letter <hi>[A]</hi> couldst thou therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, she might, in these Lines she draws express <hi>Ennius</hi> his <hi>Andromacha,</hi> or <hi>Virgils Aeneads. (Cicer. Divin. 1. p.</hi> 162.) It was the unparallel'd Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophecies delivered to Israel, that there failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken to the House of Israel: but all came to pass <hi>(Josh.</hi> 21. 45.) for the truth whereof <hi>Joshua</hi> appeals to their own Experience <hi>(chap. 23. 14.)

                  <p>Instances of Prophecies fullfill'd whose Effects are permanent and obvious to the Atheists Eyes, if he will but open them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>Predictions that Israel would reject their own</hi> Messia, <hi>made, by Jews Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, many hundreds of years before Christ. § 2. The Prophets foretell Gods Rejection of the Jews for their Rejection of his Son. § 3. Texts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a final Rejection. Christs Blood calls down this vengeance. § 4.

               </p>
               <p>§ 1. TO give an Enumeration of all Particulars here, would be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Task, It may suffice, that the most prying Adversary hath not, to this day, produc'd one instance of any of our Prophecies that hath faln to the ground; but what our Apologists have demonstrated, either to be accomplisht, or accomplishable in its time. And furthermore our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Atheist is too wise to believe further than he can see; and therefore I will not press him to the belief of the accomplishment of those Prophecies, whose Effects are gone and past out of sight by any other Arguments, than those I produced in the first part of the Third Book, where I proved the Truth of Matters of Fact reported in the Gospel. But if he be wise enough to know, what his own Senses Dictate to him? it is all that Wisdom, at this present, requires of him, to make him docible, and capable of her Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And verily, if he be not so far a man, as this amounts to, <hi>Anticira</hi> is a fitter place for him, than the Academy. Art thou then weaned from the Milk, taken from the Breast? art thou not still like that Child of the Lady <hi>Moores</hi> Prayers, a Boy still, and wilt be so, as long as thou livest? Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou thy right hand from thy left? Come in, sit down (Wisdom invites thee) though thou beest in the lowest Form of Rational Animals, she will teach thee knowledge, though thy Soul be the most narrow mouthed glass, that ever was blown by the breath of that Almighty, whom thou scornest she will infuse her Documents into thee, drop by drop, as thou art able to receive them, through the Loop-holes of thy Head and Face.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thine Eyes can spare so much time from beholding vanity, fix them upon those Texts, <hi>Is. 53. 1. &amp;c.</hi> and they will inform thee, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet foresaw and foretold, that he, of whom the Evangelical Preachers were to say, <hi>[Thy God, Oh Sion, Reigneth,]</hi> that that arme of the Lord, upon his making of which bare, all the ends of the World, should see the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Israels God: that he, who was to besprinkle many Nations; at whom Kings were to shut their Mouthes; who was to have a Portion divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him with the great, and to be made very high; to have a Name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him above every name: should (notwithstanding the beamings out of his Glory amongst them, notwithstanding <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets had so manifestly pointed him out) be despised and rejected of those that saw him, among whom he had his converse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From them cast thine Eye upon Secular Chronology, and that will tell thee, how many hundreds of years this Prophecy was pen'd, before our Saviour (to whom alone it is applicable) was incarnate: Or if thou suspects, they may write in favour of Christ, consult the Jews, his profest enemies, and they will inform thee; how <hi>Isaiah</hi> gave forth this Prophecy, before the Birth of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> so many ages, as rendred those things impossible to be known, but by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43715:217"/>
of that Infinitely-wise Being, to whom all things past and to come are alike present. Of which if thou makes question, it will be thy part to shew, by what other means the Prophets could come to the knowledge hereof; or to give one instance, at least of any one man, that by Natural Means hath foretold a thing so long before it fell out. But rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon such a Wild-Goose-chase, (except thou could devise how to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Magnetick Sphere of the Earth, that thou mayst stalk it over the Clouds, into the World of the Moon, to fetch an example thence, of what is not to be found in that Globe which we inhabit) I would advise thee, to make a Voyage into the Low-Countries, and to enquire there, whether the Jews do not reject that Off-spring of <hi>David,</hi> who made his soul an offering for sin, who was led as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep, was Dumb before the Shearer, and opened not his mouth, when he was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to call his servants to rescue him out of the hands of his Murderers: who gave his Face to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, that Buffeted and abused him. Ask this Generation what opinion they have of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> of whom their Fathers were the Betrayers and Murderers, whom God raised from the Dead, by whom God wrought Signs and Miracles. I am sure they will make thee such answer, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the <hi>Messias,</hi> above two thousand years ago, by the mouth of their own Prophets, foretold they would make to that Question. Listen in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, if thou canst hear the blessed Jesus named, except it be in execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, spie if thou canst see the Symbol of his precious Death, except it be in their barbarous representation thereof, by some Crucified Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. Observe if there be any Signs of their relenting, for Murdering that holy and just One, of their bitter mourning over their Fathers sin, in choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Murderer before the Innocent Lamb of God: If thou discernest one tear to trickle down from their eye, while 'tis fixt upon him; except it flow from their spightful envy, to see him exalted, adored, and worshipt of all people, but themselves: [<gap reason="foreign">

They are preserv'd alive, that they may be vexed at the heart, by beholding the glory of Christ shining every where.</hi> Or be in revenge of that vengeance upon them, by which Christ has paid himself, for the Travel of his soul for that unthankful Nation; and vindicated the honour of his Deity, in the opinion of all men, but themselves: by which they, that would not receive instruction, are made an instruction to others; and they, who would not, (by all the plainest Demonstrations which Christ or his Apostle did lay before them) be convinc'd, are become a Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to convince the World, that that Jesus, whom they slew and hanged upon a Tree, is the very Christ: For as their Fathers, by condemning him; so the Children of that stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by persisting in their denial of him, (not knowing him, nor the voyces of the Prophets, which are read eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath day) have been and are still fulfilling those Prophets, as to this Point of their Prediction, that that People should reject their own <hi>Messias, (Act.</hi> 13. 27.)</p>
               <p>§ 2. A second Branch of Prophecy, whose Fruit hangs yet upon it, whose Effect is still permanent, to be seen, felt, and handled, is that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods Rejection of the Jews, for their rejecting of his Son; Of the truth of which that Nation is a manifest proof, and stands as a Pillar of Salt, to season all Ages with the belief of the Supernaturalness of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations wherein that event was foretold; And of the warrantableness of the Churches Application o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is not the dispersion of their Nation, the ruine of their Temple, City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>sufficient indications of Gods rejecting that people?—I dare say they shall never be restored:] (Origen. contra Celsum. l. 3. cal.</hi> 10.) I

hope the English Atheist is not so much a French Gentleman, as to take it in Dudgeon, that I lay some grains of this Salt on his Trencher, or rather advise him to help himself to some, now that it stands at his Elbow: for I fancy him yet in <hi>Belgium,</hi> taking out the first Lesson touching the Jews dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning of Christ: And now that he is amongst those Keepers of our Rolls, those bearers of our Books; let him search, whether those Prophecies which foretell, that upon that Nations refusing to accept their own <hi>Messias,</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God should wholly disown them; be the inventions of Christians, the pious frauds of our Church, or the Responds of their own Prophets? Ask a Jew of whom that Prophet of theirs (whom for honours sake they call An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel) <hi>Jeremy,</hi> speaks, <hi>(chap. 6.) [I will bring evil upon this people, because they have rejected the word of the Lord]</hi> because they said <hi>[we will not walk in the good way,]</hi> wherein they were promised to find rest for their souls; because <hi>[they would not hear the sound of the Trumpet]</hi> that sound which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles would hear; <hi>[Hearken therefore; hear ye Nations] hear O earth: I will bring evil upon this people, reprobate Silver shall men call them, because God hath rejected them.]</hi> Can the most obstinately blinded Jew shut his Eye so close, as he shall not here see the glimmerings of those unwelcome Truths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is an Evil, the Effects whereof should be so palpable, as all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should so manifestly see the Marks of Gods rejecting them, as the name whereby they should, in common speech, be called, <hi>[is reprobate Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,]</hi> a refuse Nation, a People cast off of God; a name, which God was angry with the Heathen for fastning upon them, in the saddest dereliction of that people formerly. That,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>[The word]</hi> for their rejecting whereof they were rejected of God: <hi>[The good old way,]</hi> for their refusing to walk wherein, they were left out of the road of Mercy, can be none other, but that eternal Word, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed himself to be the Way, and offered Soul-rest to them would come to him, is manifest. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is absolutely and without compare the good old Way, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Word that was chalk'd out, that was Preach'd to <hi>Abraham,</hi> before he was Circumcised, 400 years before the good old Way of <hi>Moses</hi> was known; Nay, preach'd by <hi>Noah,</hi> that Preacher of Righteousness, by Faith, many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations before <hi>Abraham;</hi> and by God himself in Paradise, tendering Life through Faith in the Blood of the Womans Seed, which was the only thing saving, in all the After-dispensations of that Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the only Word and Way which the Jews totally rejected, the Word, spoken by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, their Fathers (in some part, for some time) neglected, but never totally renounc'd it; and the Modern Jew does too tenaciously stick to the Letter of that Word, and the external Form of that Way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The only Sound of the Trumpet which the Gentiles hearken to, in order to their finding rest to their Souls, is that sound of the Apostles, which from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is gone into all the Earth, and to the uttermost parts of the World: the sound of that Trumpet, whereby Christ is Proclaimed, the Word of God, the everlasting Way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Ask a Jew, whether the same Prophet <hi>(chap.</hi> 16, and 17.) threaten not a more dreadful Judgment (then impending over that Nations head) than the Northern Captivity; to wit, a dissipation into <hi>Strange lands, that neither they nor their Fathers knew;]</hi> whereas <hi>Chaldaea</hi> and all the Nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they were carried Captive, before their Crucifying the Lord of Life, were their door Neighbours (with whom they had Commerce) where God would <hi>[shew them no favour]</hi> (as he had done in all other Captivities) but <hi>[take away his peace from them, even loving kindness and mercy:]</hi> where they should be hunted from every Mountain and Hill and Hole; wherein
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43715:218"/>
not only all the Treasures of Gods Mountain in the Field (the riches of that Covenant of Grace, sometimes deposited with that faithless and fruitless People) should be given as a spoile to the Gentiles: <hi>[But the holy Mountain her self discontinue from that heritage which God had given her, and he burnt up and made desolate, by a fire that should be kindled in Gods anger, and burn for ever:]</hi> A fire of Eternal Vengeance, such as that whereby God <hi>[destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sodom and her Sisters:]</hi> So as she may with as much reason expect, that the Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> shall become firm Land again, and grow into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Plain like the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> and the Captivity of those Cities be return'd from that Sulphury Abyss that captivates them: as she can look for the returning of that her Captivity, as another of their Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 16. 55.) To these Prophecies <hi>Josephus</hi> relates, when <hi>John</hi> the Captain of the Rebel-Jews, had answered <hi>Josephus</hi> (whom <hi>Titus</hi> employed as his Interpreter to perswade them to yield) <hi>That Jerusalem was Gods City, and therefore invincible.</hi> I confess, replied <hi>Josephus</hi> I deserve to be severely punish'd, for attempting to perswade you, to avoid your Destiny, and to preserve men condemned by the Sentence of God: For who knows not the writings of the ancient Prophets and their Responds hanging over the Head of this most miserable City? <hi>(Bel. Jud.</hi> 7. 4.) The Modern Jews who have lain under the burthen of those Prophecies so many hundred years, cannot for shame deny that Application of them, which one of their own Priests made, at the first Commencement of their Effects, even before their irresistible force had batter'd their City and Temple about their ears, and scatter'd their whole Nation as chaff upon the face of the Earth. However they cannot deny, that these are the Responds of their own Prophets, and I dare refer it to the judgement and determination of the blindest Atheists own eyes, to conclude upon what people those Menacies are faln; whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny it is, to be the butts of those well aimed Arrows of Vengeance. And then let either Jew or Atheist say if they can, what that Sin can be, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which, the God of <hi>Sion</hi> should so loath <hi>Sion,</hi> as his heart should wholly depart from her: that Sin of <hi>Judah</hi> written with a pen of Iron, with the point of a Diamond, that it might remain in the guilt of it before God for ever (compare <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 1. with <hi>Job</hi> 19. 24.) that sin of theirs; which out-cries all the beastly and barbarous Idolatries of their Fathers, the filthiness of the Sodomites: that sin which, in the days of the <hi>Messias</hi> (as their own Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists, quoted by the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot (in harmo.</hi> on Epistle to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,)</hi> gather from their own Scriptures) shall make the Synagogues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Stews, the Wisdom of the Scribes to be abominated, and the religious persons among them to be scorn'd, and the faces of that Generation to be as Dogs: that Sin which shall speak that Generation to be, men of Canine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, Ass-like Contumacy, and Savage Cruelty:) as the Talmudists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the State of the Jews in the days of the <hi>Messias,</hi> in another place, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Grotius (verit.

It was their hating the innocent Jesus without a Cause; their becoming his enemies wrongfully; their heart breaking Reproaches; the Gall they gave him for meat; the vinegar they gave him in his thirst, for drink; that exasperated their God's heart against them: It was for this, that <hi>David</hi> (in the Spirit of Prophecie) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted that Nation to that Ruine, we now see brought upon them; to that Vengeance, we see God pouring out upon them; in making their Table their Snare, and their Wellfare, their Trap; in turning the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Covenant of Peculiarities, into an occasion, of their perverse denial of Christ, of their further Obcaecation and Obduration: It is for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting him, whom God smote, (when he laid upon him the iniquities of us all) that, that man after Gods heart poured out these imprecations against them <hi>[Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them: ever bow down their backs]</hi> that is, let them fall and never rise (let them never see that Redemption from Captivity which they look for, as the <hi>Syriack</hi> expounds it:) <hi>Let them not come into thy righteousness,]</hi> that is, deal with them in fury, not in Judgment; let them be strangers to that mitigation of the severity of justice that's tender'd in the Gospel; let them have judgment without mercy: (as the Arabick glosseth) <hi>(Vicars</hi> his <hi>Decupla</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.)</p>
               <p>As to any other sin: The Jew came out of the fire of the Babylonish Captivity, so refin'd; as he hath been, ever since, his Fathers better; not a dram of the Golden Calf would ever since down with him; he hath never since relisht the Cakes bak'd for the Queen of Heaven, nor lusted after the Onyons, Garlick, or Flesh-pots of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> nor endured upon his body the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Letters of his Idol, as King <hi>Joachim</hi> did (which marks were seen upon him, when he was cast out naked, says, <hi>Tostatus,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas, Lyranus,</hi> on 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.) nor the Symbolical Mark of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> an Ivy-leaf: which rather than they would receive the impress of, they exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a thousand torments; nor endured to hear the cries of Innocents, while they were a sacrificing to <hi>Maloch;</hi> nor so much as the name of a strange God. And for Immoralities, he that reads <hi>Josephus,</hi> and compares either his general charge of Sins (worse then those of <hi>Sodom)</hi> upon that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which the fury of Divine Wrath was poured; or the particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples he brings of the Impiety and Irregularity of that Age, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-temper of that People, must be very uncharitable, if he does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the present Generation is much reform'd, if not wholly changed from that boysterous and indomable opposition to Supreme Power (the sin which actually procured their ruine) into as sordidly fawning and servile a Spirit as Flesh and Blood is capable of: and that therefore that which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriously wrought their subversion then, and continues them under Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment still, must be something which escap'd the observation, not only of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus,</hi> but of modern Jews (though more theirs than his) and some of their

The meaning then of this Menacy of Christ is, that the Jewish Nation should (by their persisting in Impenitency, for their rejecting him) ripen themselves for as great a Judgement, as if they had been guilty of all the innocent blood that had been shed, from the Foundation of the World, to the day of the Fall of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> and this is no more than what the Prophets had as plainly fore-told, as any thing they delivered.

               <p>§. 4. And lastly, whether these Menacies be not executed to the full? whether wrath be not come to the uttermost upon this People of Gods Curse? Whether Israels God hath not withdrawn from them all the Tokens of his favourable presence? and manifestly exprest his abhorrency both of their Persons and Most Religious Performances; yea, of that Worship which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self commanded their Fathers to pay unto him; may be committed to the Umpirage of any mans eyes, that reads what glorious indications of Gods owning that Nation (above all the Nations of the Earth) were exhibited to their Progenitors: and sees how things are with them now, and have been, since that Generation, which our Saviour said, should not pass away, till all the Prophets Menacies were fulfill'd upon them. Israel was Holiness to the Lord, separated from all other People (by the eminent favour of God towards them) to be his peculiar Heritage. But what is now become of the Ark of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the Holy Oracle, from whence he was wont to give Responds, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they had need to enquire? Whither are those winged Cherubims and Seraphims flown, betwixt which he dwelt, while he was Israels Sheepherd? By what terrible Earthquake is the Holiness of that place flitted, which he chose to put his Name in, as long as he would have that Nation called by his Name? Where is that holy and beautiful House, the joy of the whole Land, where their Fathers worship'd him, of which <hi>Judah's</hi> God had said, <hi>Here will I meet you, here will I dwell for ever,</hi> (that is, while I dwell with you;) out of which no Sacrifice was acceptable, but polluted and unclean, <hi>(Hag.</hi> 2. 14.) By what power hath that Royal Pallace of the great King been laid in the dust, and kept from a Resurrection, but of his Arm, who said, it should be perpetual desolations, (Israel's sometimes God;) and of his word; who said, One Stone shall not be left upon another (Israel's rejected Saviour.) Where is that Copy of it (the Temple of <hi>Heliopolis)</hi> erected by <hi>Onias,</hi> in a precocious humour to fulfill the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah, (Chap.</hi> 19. 19.) and, in his conceipt, built as a Trophy of the God of Israels Victory, over the Idols of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in a place full of the Ruines of the Shrines of their Sacred Animals <hi>(Joseph. ant.</hi> 13. 6.) was it able, with all its weight, to suppress those Rat and Mice-Gods while it stood: And did it not fall at last with the Idol-Temples? Was it not blown down by the Breath of him, for whom the Conquest of <hi>Aegypt</hi> (to the Obedience of Israels God,) was reserved, (our great High-Priest, who hath erected there the Altar of his Cross) after it had first been prophan'd with the Image of that Monster of Men-Gods, <hi>Caligula,</hi> and shut up against the Jews at the end of the Jewish War, by <hi>Lupus,</hi> and kept shut, by <hi>Paulinus, (Joseph. Jud. Bell.</hi> 7. 30.) Where is their High-Priests spirit of Prophecy, since <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Prophesied, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that one man should die for that Nation; hath not that one Man's Blood so discoloured the Gems of the <hi>Ephod,</hi> as they never since sparkled out a Respond? Hath it not so fast Cemented the Names of the twelve Tribes to the Plate on which they were set, as the Letters of those Names could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since stand up above their fellows, so as by those prominent Characters, the enquirer could spell out the Determination of his propounded Question? Hath not God called that his Leiger, that his Resident, Agent, from amongst them: and sent him to the Christian Church; in the virtue whereof, Christ and his Apostles have foretold the sacking of their City, the demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of their Temple, the overthrow of their Politie, and dispersion of their persons; and whatsoever else conduceth to the strengthning of our Faith, or the engaging us to possess our souls in patience.

               <p>§ 1.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] in the end of it; which Letter, in Numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion stands for [5] they say that the want thereof sheweth the want of 5 Things in the second Temple, which were in the first. The Ark (and its appurtenances, the Mercy-seat, and Cherubims.) Secondly the Fire from Heaven. Thirdly the Majesty of Divine presence, called <hi>[Shechina.]</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Holy Ghost. And Fifthly <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> From whence they draw these two Conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That their want of their antient Glory, is not to be imputed to their putting Christ to Death; seeing that was departed from them, many Ages before he was born.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Apostles were not moved, to write the New Testament, by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, for they wrote during the standing of the Second Temple.</p>
               <p>Though the Answers which are commonly return'd to these Parologisms, are Butteresses strong enough to secure the Christian Cause against these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, to wit, That though the Second Temple wanted the Shadows, it had the Substance of all these; the things themselves, though not the Types; and therefore was filled with a greater Glory, when he appeared in it, in whom the Godhead dwells bodily, who is the Ark and Propitiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that Gods withdrawing these visible Signs by degrees, was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Sun was towards Rising, and should have been to the Jews a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to expect so much more earnestly its arising, as they saw the Stars disappearing one after another. Yet because these Answers do not beat the Jew off from his presumption; but, by seeming to yeild, that as to matter of fact, all these were wanting, harden him in his conceit; that he has not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this loss, upon the account of his being found guilty of our Saviours Blood.</p>
               <p>I shall here shew, that most of, if not all these five things, were (in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral sence) in the Second Temple; and in being, in, or not long before our Saviours Time.</p>
               <p>That the Ark was in the Second Temple against the Testimony of the Cabbalists, I set the whole Company of the return'd from the Babylonish Captivity to attest; in one of those <hi>[Songs of degrees]</hi> so called, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were sung upon steps (either the 15 of the ascent into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or other places of advantage where the Levites stood) for all Psalms were sung upon Ascents, or Scaffolds, <hi>(Nehem.</hi> 9. 4.) but because they were Sung at the Dedication of the second Temple, by them that had ascended out of the Abyss of Captivity, as the Chaldee Paraphraseth this Title; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their fixing of which Title, first to the 120 Psalm, grew that wild Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudical story, of the rising up of the Abyss, at the building of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: which I would not have nam'd, but that (as ridiculous as it is,) it serves to prove, that in their opinion, the Psalms thus intituled (by whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43715:221"/>
at first pen'd) were, by the Spirit of Prophecy, fitted, to the case of them that ascended from the Captivity, and accordingly used by them, in their Singing Praise. Of which mind also is <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Euthymius:</hi> and to this agrees the <hi>Syriack,</hi> making the Contents of Psalm 120. to be a Prayer of the People detain'd in <hi>Babel;</hi> and of the following, a Song of Educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Ascent out of <hi>Babel,</hi> (the best exposition of the Septuagint) [<gap reason="foreign">

Obad.)</hi> to be resolv'd in their doubts (that could not by other evidence, be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) by the Priest, consulting God before the Ark; as they were directed, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 17.) The Ark is called the Ark of Testimony, partly because the Law was kept in the Ark, in its Original (by which all Copies were to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and what was doubtful in them, by it, to be determined:) partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from the Oracle, over the Ark, between the Cherubims, God testified what his will was in such cases, which he had not so distinctly declared in that common Rule: hence the Oracle upon the Ark, or the Ark in respect of that Oracle is called simply <hi>[The Testimony,]</hi> in distinction to <hi>[the Law]</hi> in that Text <hi>(Isa. 8. 26.) [To the Law and to the Testimony;]</hi> where we must not think the Holy Spirit Tautologizeth, in giving so short a direction: but as the Heathens enquired, in their Pontifical Books, and at vive-voyce Oracles, where those Books came short of a Determination; so God appoints his people, first to the Law, and then to the living Oracle. The sence then, which their own most learned Rabbies (and such as flourish'd before their Enmity to the Gospel, put their Expositors to wrest the Scriptures into a thousand forms, that they might not speak for the Christians) put upon those Texts, is such as speaketh the return'd in the Second Temple to have rejoyced in this, that they had an opportunity and invitation to go up to the Ark of the Testimony, to the Throne of Gods presence, the Ark. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Castellio</hi> goes so far along with me, and these most antient Rabbies, as to render Testimony by Oracle.</p>
               <p>In another of those Psalms of ascent, the whole Choire of them ascended out of <hi>Babylon</hi> introduce the Ark into the second Temple, in this form of words, <hi>(Psal 132. 8.) Arise, O Lord, and come into thy resting place, thou and the Ark of thy strength:]</hi> the same, in sence, that <hi>Solomon</hi> used at the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Temple (saith <hi>R.

[We found it in the Fields,]</hi> expounding <hi>[the Fields]</hi> by <hi>(Mich. 4. 10.) [Thou shalt dwell in the Field]</hi> thou shalt go to <hi>Babylon.</hi> I do not mean, it was carried into <hi>Babylon;</hi> but hid (together with the Tabernacle, and Altar of Incense) by <hi>Jeremy: 2 Maccab.</hi> 2. 4. an authority, which (though ingeniously confest, by the Writer to be but humane) will, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byast Persons, out-weigh the word of the whole Tribe of Cabbalists. And that the Ark was restored, is further manifest; because the return'd from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity do direct their Worship towards it, (in <hi>ver. 7.) [We will worship at his footstool.]</hi> Whether of these Opinions is of harder digestion? That those purified sons of <hi>Levy</hi> (newly come out of the Furnace of Affliction) should offer the Sacrifice of Fools, not considering what they said; should sprinkle God with the Court-holy-water of Complemental Thanks, for what they had not been blest with; should dance before the Lord, after the Pipe of their own deluded Fancy, and praise him with Songs, made in their golden Dreams, of an Ark, when they had not the Ark? or that their degenerate successors should belye the goodness of God, in denying the Typical, as they do the real Ark of Gods presence, to have been in that Temple; and which of these Testimonies is most credible? This of the blinded modern Jewes, (who, that they might with more liberty blaspheme the blessed Jesus) have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43715:222"/>
conjured out of one Letters want, in a word, the Second Temples want of five things which the First had, and among them the Ark of the Covenant? Or that of the antient and impartial Rabbies, who, in their Comments upon these Texts, introduce their Forefathers blessing God after their Restauration from the Babylonish Bondage, for restoring to them that Symbol of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, upon whose Testimony ('tis so far from being a Fable, as <hi>Weemes</hi> is pleas'd to call it) I think it may be concluded, as more then probable, that the Second Temple enjoyed the Ark, as long as <hi>Jerusalem</hi> enjoy'd the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is, till it was brought in Triumph to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. But they are more impudent, in reckoning the holy Fire to have been wanting in the Second Temple, against the manifest Testimony of their Progenitors, the Jews of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> who, in their Letter to their Brethren in <hi>Aegypt, (2 Mac.</hi> 1. 18.) give them an account at large, how by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the sacred Fire was hid, by some Religious Priests in a Pit: and by <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Order, search being made for it, by the posterity of those Priests, they found thick Water or <hi>Naphthar</hi> therein; which being laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacrifices kindled, as soon as the Sun-beams beat thereon, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the sacrifices; the Memorial whereof they pray the Jews of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that they would (as they of <hi>Iudaea</hi> had done) celebrate. Contrary to the plain inference of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s, <hi>(Nehem.</hi> 10, 34.) putting it, among the Articles of that Covenant he made all the Jews seal to, <hi>[That they would make provision for the perpetual keeping of the Fire upon the Altar, according to the appointment of the Law] Levit.</hi> 9. 24. 10. 1. 3. Which pious act of his, he concludes his Book with, and presents it to God as a Sacrifice of a sweet odour. <hi>(Nehem. 13. ult) [And for the Wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits; remember me, O my God, for good.]</hi> All which, from the beginning to the end, would have been no better than the taking of Gods Name in vain, had that Fire, which consumed the first acceptable Sacrifice, which they offered after their Return, been no more then ordinary Fire: for then they might (without any offence to God) have kindled it anew, every time they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed. Contrary to what follows from Gods accepting those Sacrifices which by <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> order were offered; which upon that consideration, God discriminates from those were offered before the Temple was built; professing they were unclean, because they touched the unclean, that is, had strange Fire put to them <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 12. That no burnt Sacrifice was accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, but what was consumed by holy Fire, was a Maxim so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally receiv'd in the Church, as <hi>Moses</hi> expresseth <hi>[Gods fire coming down]</hi> upon <hi>Abels</hi> and not upon <hi>Cain's</hi> Sacrifice by <hi>[Gods having respect]</hi> to <hi>Abels</hi> and not <hi>Cain's,</hi> and therefore <hi>Theodosion</hi> Translates that Text <hi>(Gen. 4. 4) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammavit Deus in</hi> Abel <hi>&amp; ejus sacrificium; at in</hi> Cain <hi>&amp; ejus sacrificium non inflammavit Deus;] God sent Fire down upon Abels Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. For no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way can be conceiv'd how <hi>Cain</hi> could know Gods acceptance of his Brother's, and rejection of his own, but this visible Sign, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <hi>in locum.</hi> Hence our English Translators parallel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. with <hi>Lev. 9. 24. 1 Reg. 18. 38. 2 Chron.</hi> 7. 1. where 'tis said the fire came down from the Lord upon the Sacrifice at the Dedication of the Altar, at <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Prayer: and at the Dedication of the Temple. So that the Sons of <hi>Aarons</hi> offering with strange fire <hi>(Lev.</hi> 10. 1.) seems to be imputed to their being at that time stark Drunk <hi>(vers.</hi> 9. 10.) which occasion'd that prohibition to the Priests from drinking Wine when they went into the Sanctuary. If therefore they had not holy Fire to Sanctifie the Altar, the Altar could not Sanctifie the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but both remain'd prophane as they had been before; the affirming of which is manifestly contrary to those many and plain Promises, that in the Second Temple <hi>[Their Sacrifices should come up with acceptance upon Gods Altar.]</hi> And lastly contrary to as good Authority, as Secular Records af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that the Memorial of that holy Fire was Celebrated, as long as the Temple stood, in the yearly Festival called [<gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore the Greeks (so many of them as do not abhorr our Religion) having had such certain experiments of this Miracle, as could not be gainsaid, call'd the Breast-plate [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] that is, <hi>[the Oracle,]</hi> But both the Sardonix on the high Priest shoulder, and the Gemms on his Breast-plate have ceased to send forth their brightness, two hundred years ago, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing displeased with our Nation, for their contempt and violation of his Law: of which I shall speak elsewhere. Thus far <hi>Josephus:</hi> whom I make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of following, rather than the whole College of conjecturing Cabal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, while he plays the part of an Historian; and therefore collect from this Text, that the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> continued under the Second Temple almost 300 years, and to within little more than one hundred, of our Saviours Birth; for <hi>Josephus</hi> wrote his Jewish Antiquities in the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Domitian.</hi> Though I may (without impeachment to his credit) suspend my assent to his Conclusions, when he acts the Divine, as he doth in assigning the reason of the Dimness of these precious Stones to be that Nations contempt of Gods Law; which I think may better be ascribed to (what he did not see) the approaching Light of that Pretious Stone, God was about to lay in <hi>Sion,</hi> to the proximity of that Age, to the appearance of that true Light, of that only infallible living Oracle. (This by the way.) To this Testimony of <hi>Josephus,</hi> for the Second Temple's enjoyment of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> seems to give his Suffrage, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.

Lastly, though it was wanting at their first Return before the Temple was finish'd, yet they expected it would be restored: and therefore, <hi>(Ezra.</hi> 2. 62, 63.) the <hi>Tirshata</hi> would not take them into the number of Priests, that could not shew their Pedigree. <hi>[Till there should rise up a Priest with</hi> Urim <hi>and</hi> Thummim;] and, in all reason was restored, as soon, as the Temple was finish'd: a Vision whereof, <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> seeth <hi>(c.</hi> 3.) where <hi>Joshua</hi> is cloth'd with that <hi>[change of Raiment,]</hi> wherein it is promised him, <hi>[He shall judge Israel] [Post ablationem vestium sordidarum, &amp; restitutam mundi sacerdotii dignitatem, promittitur, quòd ipse ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex sit domus ejus.] After the taking away of his filthy Raiment, and restoring to him the dignity of a clean High-Priest-hood, it is promised to him, that he should judge Gods house,</hi> (as St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> from the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expounds that Text) a clear Paraphrase of the Pectoral of Judgment) of the stones whereof <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> affirms, that they are the ingravings of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and (in the 6 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Zach. vers.</hi> 14. and 10.

               <p>§. 4. As to the Spirit of Prophesie, its being under the Second Temple, (in both those Degrees of it, implied <hi>(Revel.</hi> 4. 2.) that which inspired ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men with Prophecy, or to be Prophets and to Preach; and that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired them to be Penmen, or to write Prophecies) Is so palpable by the date of the Prophecies of <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> as nothing but malice can hoodwink the Jew from seeing it. And though it be true, the Sun set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their writing Prophets, about the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; yet they had speaking Prophets as long as the Temple stood; of which <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> gives many instances: of <hi>Judas,</hi> whose Prophecies used to prove so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as when he saw <hi>Antigonus</hi> going to the Temple, the afternoon of that day, on which he had prophesied; he should die, and that at <hi>Straton</hi>'s Tower (which was 600 Furlongs distant) he cried out to his Disciples (in the words of the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> when God spared <hi>Ninivie,</hi> after he had threatned the destruction of it within 40 days) I now grow weary of my life, seeing <hi>Antigonus</hi> his life convinceth me to be a false Prophet; for it is impossible he should die this day at <hi>Straton</hi>'s Tower, who is here alive, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so much of the day is spent, and at so great a distance from that place. But there was a Tower, in the Palace, of that name; in the Vault whereof, <hi>Antigonus</hi> was Murdered, in his return from the Temple, and news there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of brought to <hi>Judas,</hi> while he was tormenting himself, for fear of the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Prophesie. <hi>(Joseph. ant.</hi> 13. 19.) Of one <hi>Jesus</hi> who four years before the beginning of that War, which ended with the Desolation of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> (at what time the City enjoy'd as much peace and plenty as ever) coming up to the Feast of Tabernacles, suddenly broke out into these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, <hi>A Voyce from the East, a voyce from the West; a voyce from the four Winds; a voyce against</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and the Temple; a voyce against the Bridegroom and the Bride; a voyce against this whole Nation;]</hi> and, without ceasing day or night, carried this burthen of Prophesie through all the Streets and Lanes of the City: from which no punishment could restrain him. And (to spare the alledging of more Examples) Of himself who prophesied to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> that he should be Emperour: against which <hi>Vespasian</hi> making this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43715:223"/>
Exception. How canst thou foreknow my Fortunes, that couldst not foresee thine own Captivity, nor the taking of <hi>Jotopata</hi> (of which thou was Governour?) Why replied he) I told the <hi>Jotopatanes,</hi> that within 47 days they should be destroyed, and my self become a Prisoner to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</p>
               <p>By this we see how false, as well as blasphemous this Assertion is, that the Second Temple wanted the Spirit of Prophecy: and how far wide of <hi>Daniels</hi> sence the modern Jews are, in expounding <hi>[The sealing of Prophecy]</hi> whereby he means the fulfilling and ratifying thereof, by the Blessed Jesus, to be the cessation of it: of which cessation of all Prophecy they sometimes make the <hi>Aera</hi> to concur, with that of the defiling the Temple by <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> sometimes with that of the League which <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> made with the <hi>Romanes;</hi> sometimes to the first year of <hi>Seleucus Nicanor:</hi> Whereas speaking Prophets continued to the end of the Jewish State, and writing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ceas'd long before the eldest of these Dates; and therefore the Author of the Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> speaks of that, as falling out a considerable time before the discumfiture of <hi>Judas</hi> by <hi>Alcimus</hi> and <hi>Bacchides. (1 Mac.</hi> 9. 27.) So there was a very great Affliction in <hi>Israel:</hi> the like whereof was not, since the time that a Prophet was not seen amongst them, that is, a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Prophet. <hi>(Vide comput. Jud. Scal. de emend. temp. lib. 7. pag.</hi> 628. 654.)</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Shechina</hi> or Majesty of the Divine presence; wherein God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be present, by the appearance of Angels (those Courtiers of Heaven) either in a lucid, flaming, shining appearance (as that Host of Heaven, those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God's presence, that pitcht their Camp before Israels Camp in the Wilderness, appeared in the night) or in a thick Cloud or Smoak, such a bodily appearance as they assumed, on the day <hi>(vide Hamond. an. on Mat.</hi> 3. 16.) that this Majestick presence of the Lord did fill the Second Temple, as well as the First, is attested by the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Jews, (2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2. 7.) where they write to their Brethren of <hi>Aegypt</hi> that <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when he had hid the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and the Ark, told the Priests, that when God restored that Captivity, he would shew them his Glory; that the Glory of the Lord should appear, and the Cloud also, as it was shewed under <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> For the Truth of all the Contents of this Letter, they appeal to ocular evidence; wishing their Brethren, if there were need, they would send some to see. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> would not believe, that God dwelt then between the Cherubims, till he had been soundly beaten into the belief of it, and scourged by the Angel of Gods presence into a Confession, of what he had seen with his eyes, and felt upon his ribbs, advising <hi>Demetrius,</hi> if he had any Enemy or Traytor, he would send him to rob the Temple: for thou shalt (saith he) receive him well scourg'd, if he escape with his life; for in that place (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) there is an especial power of God (2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 3. 36.) It was in this Temple, <hi>Hircanus</hi> (the High Priest) had conference with God, by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appearing to him, while he was offering Incense: that <hi>Zachary,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Baptist, had the appearance of God by an Angel. A thing so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, as the people, without Hesitancie, conclude he had seen a Vision, when he did but becken to them. But what need of proving that by Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Particulars, which naturally follows from the Premisses: for must not the Divine Presence be there, where was the Ark of Gods Presence? Could the Temple which had the Fire, want the Smoak, want the Cloud?</p>
               <p>§ 5. It is manifest then, that under the Second Temple the Jews enjoyed all these Prerogatives. Nay, they were so far from wanting what they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the first, as even in respect of external indications of Gods gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence amongst them, the Glory of the Second, exceeded the Glory of the First Temple. For under the later House, they had,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The power of ejecting Devils out of the possessed, which we do not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43715:224"/>
find they had under the First Temple: for that melancholy Spirit which <hi>David</hi> cast out of <hi>Saul,</hi> by his playing upon the Harp, comes not up to the case, either as to time (being before the First Temple;) or as to the thing, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the removal only of melancholly.) But that under the Second Temple there was a stated Order of Exorcists (who by invocating the Name of God, over such as were possessed with unclean Spirits, did cast them out) is manifest from our Saviours urging that practice, in vindication of his own, and professing that he cast out Devils by the same power by which their Children did. <hi>[If I by Beelzebub cast out Devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. Mat. 12. 27.] In virtute sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet Creatoris, By the power of the Creator]</hi> as <hi>Tertullion</hi> expounds this Text, <hi>(contrà Marcion. lib.</hi> 4. 26.) and maintains that Exposition by this Reason, that Christ upbraiding their Children with casting out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> was inconsistent with what he had said before <hi>[If Satan cast out Satan,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>[Hâc voce quid magis portendit, quàm in to ejicere se, quo &amp; filii eorum, in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute scilicet Creatoris?] [What can Christ mean by this word, but that he cast out Devils, by the same power, by which their Children cast them out, in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to wit, of the Creator.]</hi> Thus <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (quoted by Dr. <hi>Hammond annot.</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 27.) By the invoking the name of the most high and mighty God, even before the coming of Christ, men were delivered from the wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and all kind of Devils. So powerful then, was the Name of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> saith <hi>Origen, (contrà Cels. l. 1. &amp; l.</hi> 4.) But the use of this form of Exorcism grew so ineffectual, after Christs Name was called upon them that were possessed, as the Jewish Exorcists were willing to change it into that Form, <hi>[We adjure you by the Name of Jesus.]</hi>

So this Exposition of the Text by <hi>Theophilact,</hi> beside the force it offers to the Words, offers violence to common Sence; of which I could give several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but will content my self with that reply, which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> gives to that Objection (which he conceives the chief) to wit, That 'tis uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how the healing Virtue of that Pool, (had it arose naturally from the fresh warm blood of the Entrails of the Sacrifices that were washed there) could be limited to one, to him, that first stepped in after the troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Waters; for that reason of this which the Doctor assigns, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the circumstance of the place containing these Medicinal Waters, which might be of no larger capacity, than to hold one at once: as that is the only circumstance that can be imagined to avoid the force of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; so that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> implies a plain Contradiction to all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the case, as themselves state it; for what needed an Officer go down into so narrow a hole, when he might have stood at the top, and have poakt up the grosser matter from the bottom with a Pole? Nay, what room could there be for him, to bestir himself or to use a Colt-staff in the bottom, to stir up the congeal'd blood in so narrow a compass? or with what wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must that water be washt wherein so many hundreds of Entrals were wash'd? for doubtless if it was contain'd in so narrow a compass, it stood in as much need of washing as the Entrails themselves: and the immersing fresh Entrails therein, after an hundred (or according to their account ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands) had been wash'd therein, would have been the defiling of them, rather than their cleansing. Besides, had this curing of only one been but once, or at the most three times a year, and that by a natural Virtue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into the water, the stirring of the Sedements from the bottom; it was wholly in the Officers power, to admit whom he pleased, to step in; and then those multitudes of impotent folk, that lay there waiting for the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the water, and some of them so long (as the man whom Christ cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) must have been more crazie in their mind than bodies, if they could not collect, it was in vain there to expect good, if they could not make the Officer their Friend: Lastly, what need of a Temple-Officer's going down to stir the water? when those whose impotencie lay in their eyes, or any where but in their feet, might themselves have done all that he could
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43715:225"/>
do; to wit, with their Feet, or Hands, or Crutches, stir up the congealed Blood, and make it mix with the Water; and really 'tis hard to conceive, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a great multitude of poor Cripples, their should not be some, who, when they saw their time, would not strain courtesie with good manners, and make no more scruple of stepping in before the Angel, than the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Horse did of drinking before Queen <hi>Elizabeths.</hi> Had he been no more than a Temple-Officer, and not as the King's Manuscript reads it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,] <hi>The Angel of the Lord,</hi> whose stirring of the Pool put a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Virtue into it, which by divine dispensation was so bounded, as to the Effects thereof, as it should but cure one at a time, and that time not to be foreseen (as their stated Festivals were) but purely at the divine Arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore to be waited for by those that came thither for cure; of which he that first stept in failed not to partake, while the five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> (the Books of Gods Covenant with their Fathers) as so many Porches encompassed that Nation. (St. <hi>Aug. de verbis Dom. Serm.</hi> 42.) But, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace removed from them, this Pool (though still to be seen) hath no more Virtue in it now, nor ever had since the Holie Ghost, hath chosen the Christian Font-water to sit upon, (St <hi>Jerom. de locis Haebraicis)</hi> than the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalion</hi> or <hi>Colophon</hi> Wells.</p>
               <p>I could instance in more Privileges, which the Second Temple was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, beyond the First, which (as if they had been entail'd upon it) fell with it. But it would be an infinite labour, to recount all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that Inventory of Divine Benefits, (Arguments of Gods special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to that people] which they died seis'd of, at the expiration of their State, and demolishing of their City and Temple.

Alas! how many days hath that wretched Nation continued, without a King, and without a Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sacrifice, and without an Idol, without an Ephod, and without a Teraphim, without God or any token of his presence, save that whereby he watcheth over them for evil? under all which heavy stroaks, they are as insensible as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fool, that slept upon the Mast: So that to crown his Judgements God hath taken from them that tenderness of Heart, which their Forefathers had in the Babylonish Captivity, who were jealous of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that God had hardned their hearts from his fear, to their greater Ruine: but these though that of their own Prophets <hi>(Isa.</hi> 6.) be palpably ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd upon them; and all the Curses written in Gods Book laying, with all their weight, upon their loynes, yet none of them say <hi>[What have I done?

                  <p>The Jews rejected <hi>Messias</hi> to be called the God of the whole Earth: and all other Gods eternally to be rejected.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>The God of Israel every where worship'd where Christian Religion obtains place. § 2. The God of Israel hath his Priests amongst the Gentiles. § 3. No acceptable Oblation but what Christians offer, tender'd to Israels God. § 4. The Gospel hath utterly abolish'd Idols, made Virmin-Gods creep into holes. § 5. Daphnaean</hi> Apollo, <hi>choak'd with the Bones of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilas. <hi>Heathen Testimony for the silencing of Oracles; the Vanity of their Reasons. § 6. Gross Idolatry in the Roman Pale by her own Doctors Confessions and Definitions (the Legend of the Golden Calf) yet not in the proper and prophetick sence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. A Third point of Prophecy, the accomplishment whereof is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and now in being, (to the beholding of which I refer the Atheist for Conviction, that the Author of our Scriptures hath an infinitely perfect fore-comprehension of Contingencies.) Is that wherein it is fore-told; That this, by them rejected, <hi>Messiah</hi> of the Jews, was to be called <hi>[The God of the whole Earth:]</hi> That this Christ, this Son of God, against whom the Jews took Counsel, the Bond of whose Covenant they brake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, the Cords of whose Royal Laws they cast from them, was to receive of his Father <hi>[The Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for his possession] (Psal.</hi> 2.) was to Reign <hi>[from Sea to Sea,]</hi> and to fill <hi>[The whole Earth]</hi> with his Majesty <hi>(Psal.</hi> 71.) That to this <hi>Shilo,</hi> after the Departure of the Scepter from <hi>Judah, [The Gentiles should be gathered] (Gen.</hi> 49.) That this Branch, out of the Root of <hi>Jesse,</hi> wherein the Jews saw no form nor comliness, is to reign <hi>[over the Centiles] (Isa.</hi> 21.) in whom <hi>[the Gentiles are to trust] (Isa.</hi> 42.) to whom the Nations are to come, saying, <hi>[Our Fathers have inherited vanity] (Jer.</hi> 16.) That in the days of this Kings Son <hi>[All the ends of the earth]</hi> shall remember themselves and turn to the Lord, and <hi>[all the kindreds of the Nations]</hi> shall worship before him. <hi>(Ps.</hi> 22.) That to him Princes should come out of <hi>Aegypt, Aethiopia</hi> should soon (with the first) stretch out her hands unto God: That his Dominion shall be so far extended as <hi>[all Kings]</hi> should worship him, <hi>[all Nations]</hi> do him homage. <hi>(Psal.</hi> 68. 31) That it was too small a thing that he should raise up the Tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that therefore God would give him for a Light to Lighten the Gentiles, and to be his Salvation <hi>[to the ends of the earth.] (Is.</hi> 49. 6. That at what time, the Lord of Hosts should refuse to accept an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, at the hands of the Jews, and take no pleasure in them or their Legal services, his Name should be dreadful among the Heathen, great among the Gentiles: and that <hi>[in every place, from the rising of the Sun, to the going down thereof,]</hi> The God of Israel should have Incense offered to his Name, and a pure offering, <hi>(Mal.</hi> 1. 10. and 14.)</p>
               <p>Let the Atheist consult his Reason, and then try, if he can conceive, how that God, who spake by the Prophets so many things touching the <hi>Messias,</hi> which are all come to pass and verified in the blessed Jesus, could possibly be ignorant of, or falsifie in the main, in the Subject it self of all those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, the Person of the <hi>Messias:</hi> Or that he, who foresaw the Rejection of the Jews, would not provide himself of another People. But I will not put him to the expence, (of what he hath not, in the purchase of Faith. His own Senses, where ever he comes, will inform him of the accomplishment of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43715:226"/>
these Predictions: what part soever of the old World he travels through, he may hear the Name of the God of Israel celebrated, he may see the Trophyes of Christs Victories standing there; hear the Confession of all men, with one mouth, that the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> is the God, that made Heaven and Earth: with which rebound the Mahometan <hi>Moscos,</hi> the Christian Churches, the Jewish Synagogues; for Pagan Temples he will find none, where the Gospel has been. Let him ask where he comes, at the hearing of what Doctrine it was, that their Gentile Progenitours came in to the acknowledgment of the God of Israel, confessing that their Fathers had inherited Vanity, had made lyes their Refuge: I am perswaded the Mahometan will have so much Ingenuity, as to confess that their Religion found all those parts of the World, whither it hath come, worshipping the God of Israel: and therefore that was not the Light God set up to the Gentiles, to bring them in, to guide them to the one true God of Israel; that theirs found the world inheriting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself will not call a Vanity; but for the time its Virtue lasted, (that is, till he put forth his <hi>Alcharon,)</hi> confesseth to have been a saving, and the only saving Religion, as being the Appointment of God himself by the hand and Ministry of his Beloved Son Jesus Christ, the greatest Prophet that ever was till <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by <hi>Mahomets</hi> own Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the Jew may easily be confuted, if he shall have the simplicity to say, that that is a Prophecy of the Repentance of their Forefathers when they forsook the Idolatries of the Nations they were mixed with; for 'tis the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are to come and say, Our Fathers inherited Vanity; and the truth is, the repenting Jews could not in verity make this Confession: for though they for some time took long Leases of the Idolatry of the Heathens, yet those I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries never obtain'd that Prescription as to become their Inheritance, as they did in the Heathen World, where, long time out of mind from Father to Son, no other Gods but Idols were worship'd. Or if he should have the face to deny that it was the Preaching of the Gospel which prevail'd with the Nations of the World to come in to Israel's God, confessing that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of their Forefathers were all Vanity. For before the Preaching of the Gospel, 'tis manifest that all Nations walked in their own way, and in the name of their own Gods; and the Jew was so far from introducing the Worship of their sometimes God into the Roman Capitol, as they had much adoe to keep that Monster of all Roman Gods, <hi>Caligula,</hi> from receiving Divine honours in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and could not prevent the erecting of his Statue in their Temple at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> nor the Adoration of it in the Presence-Chamber of the God of Israel. Besides, let them say by which of their Rabbies <hi>India,</hi> by which <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> by which <hi>Spain,</hi> by which <hi>Eritain,</hi> the utmost Coasts of <hi>Europe, Asia, Affrica,</hi> were converted from Idols to the One living God; as we can shew by what Apostles and Apostolical Persons the World was by piece-meal brought under the Obedience of God and of his Christ.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Let him next observe, if Israels God have that service perform'd to him; which by his Prophets he had declared he would only accept, when he should be called the God of all the Earth, any where but in the Christian Church. If since his rejection of the Levitical Priesthood (which then vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually commenc'd, when Christ as a Priest after <hi>Aarons</hi> order, made upon the Altar of his Cross (by the oblation of himself) a full and perfect Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the sins of the whole World: and was then actually inflicted, when, in the virtue of that Attonement, God sent him as a Priest after the Order of <hi>Melchisedech</hi> to bless the Nations, by turning them from their sins. If this God of Israel hath, where he is invocated, any Priests, taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, but those of Christs Institution, that call themselves, and are called (that is known by the name of) the Priests of the Lord. He may find this name scorned by such punie Antichrists, as the Gospel tells us have ever been, and foretells us will ever be in the Church, but not of the Church:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43715:226"/>
who being under a Form of Godliness deny the Power, and either out of a blind zeal, or for a cloak of Covetousness, decry the Evangelical Priest-hood, casting contempt upon and practising to abolish that Name which the God of Israel hath said the Evangelical Ministers should be called by: do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what in them lay to overturn the Foundation of Christian Faith; For if there be not an order of Men, taken out from the rest, from among the people, called the Priests of the Lord; the Gentiles are not yet called, nor that God whom we invocate, the God of Israel, nor that Jesus whom we worship, the Christ, the promised <hi>Messiah;</hi> for of the days of <hi>Messias</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied <hi>(Is. 66. 8.) [I will gather all Nations and Tongues, and they shall come and see my glory;]</hi> and this I will do by setting a Sign amongst them, (by ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Standard of the Cross, <hi>[For those that escape</hi> (those of the Jews that save themselves from the untoward Generation, by embracing Christ) <hi>I will send to the Nations, disperse them over the World, to</hi> Tarshish, Pul, <hi>and</hi> Lud, <hi>to</hi> Tubal <hi>and</hi> Javan, <hi>to the Isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my Glory: and they shall declare my Glory]</hi> Preach Christ, the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Glory <hi>(Heb.</hi> 1. 3.) among the Gentiles. <hi>[And they shall bring all your Brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all Nations: and of them that shall be converted out of all Nations I will take for Priests and Levites: For as the new Heavens that I create, remain before me; so shall your Seed and your Name remain for ever.]</hi> And again <hi>(Isa. 61. 6.) [Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God.]</hi> See here what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences those tender ear'd men have, and how well those Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church-men consult the promoting of the honour of Christ, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls through his Blood, that, rather than we should offend the itching ears of those white Devils, would have us wave the use of so harsh a word, so grating a name as that of Priests: though it be of the mouth of the Lords naming, and the bearing of it among the Gentiles, one of those Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of the Spirit of Prophesie, that Christ is come; and that he, whose Priests we are, is the God that made Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>Not but that the Romish Sacrificers have Sacrilegiously abused this name to the abetting their Sacrifice of the Mass: or, as if names or things, whose use is not necessary, may not be laid aside, when abused: as God took the name of <hi>Baal</hi> out of his peoples mouth, after it had been appropriated to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and <hi>Hezechiah</hi> broke the Brazen Serpent after the Idolatrous use of it. Yet he that upon that pretence would banish the name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or other Names of God out of Christian use, would leave us never a Name to call him by; for all his Names that the Gentiles could get at the Tongues end, they applied to their Idols: and should we exterminate every Word or Thing that has been made an evil use of, we must speak by Signs, renounce our Creed, our Meat, Drink and Sleep. How much more cautious should we be of entertaining those Principles of a squeasie and mis-inform'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as induce us to a disuse of that Name which God himself hath stampt upon the Ministers of the Gospel, as their Memorial for ever. But,

               <p>I should blame my self for making this excursion before the Atheist, if it were not to inform him, that in case, while he is seeking for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this Prophesie, he meet with such as disclaim this, and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by another Name, and thereby be confirm'd in his Atheism; the Church is free of his blood; for there never hath been any Christian Church upon Earth, whose Ministers are not known and called by the name of the Priests of Israel's God.</p>

§. 3. Let him enquire what Sacrifices and Oblations have been offered him since his Name was Great in all the World, but that commemorative one of the great Propitiation which our high Priest made once for all; That Thanksgiving-Sacrifice of the Eucharist, that well-pleasing Sacrifice of a sweet odour we tender him in our Works of Charity, in our honouring him with our substance; that living and reasonable Service, wherein we offer up our selves, Souls, Bodies and Spirits to the disposal of his Royal Law? What In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense hath been burnt before him, but Prayer from a Devout and flaming Heart? What Libations have been powred out in his presence, but peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tears, flowing from a contrite spirit? Let him travel Aegypt through and through, he will find no Altar there erected to the God of Israel, but that Table-throne of Grace, whereon we offer to him his Creatures of Bread and Wine, and make a Commemoration of his Son's Death. No Pillar there set up to the Lord, but the eternal Monument of his dear Love, the Triumphant Standard of the blessed Cross. He will find the Jew, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian, the Aegyptian, serving the God of Israel joyntly in the practise of no Religion but the Christian.</p>
               <p>And then I leave it to the Atheists Discretion to judge, whether it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that that God who was so wise as to foresee, and so powerful as to effect this great Change, we see wrought in the World, by the Gospel; should be so far wanting to himself, and those of Mankind that most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love him, as to have none to worship him, in a way of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution (this sixteen hundred years) ever since he by his Providence hath made it impossible, to tender him that Worship himself had formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: the place being destroyed where God will only accept of such like services; and the Jews having been terrified from rebuilding it under <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> so, as they never since durst reattempt it. The Story of which their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation is thus reported by <hi>Greg. Nazianzen, (Oratione 48. in Julianum 2.) Julian</hi> invited the Jews to return into <hi>Judaea</hi> and rebuild their Temple, whereupon multitudes of them repair thither, and busie themselves in that work (with as much zeal as our City-Matrons exprest. When those Forts and Lines of Communication were cast up, whereby they excluded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Protection of the best of Kings, and cooped up themselves to be a prey to the worst of Tyrants; for as ours then, so) the Jewish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, now, spared neither their tender Limbs, nor fine Cloaths, nor richest Jewels; but as they expended their Treasures in hiring Labourers, so they themselves did not disdain to serve the Workmen by carrying Baskets of Rubbish, till both Masons and Servitours were forc'd from their work, by Balls of Fire issuing from the trembling and gaping Earth; by which they that were not kill'd, had their Garments or Bodies inured with the Sign of the Cross: by which Marks of God's displeasure, many of them were so far convinc'd, (that no other Religion was acceptable to God, but the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as they with one voyce invocate the help of Christ, and were by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism initiated in the Christian Faith. The substance of this Story I have elsewhere alledged out of <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> one of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Captains. And <hi>Nazianzen</hi> affirms, that when he wrote this Oration, these Prints and Marks upon their Cloaths were still to be seen, Is't then (I say) imaginable in reason, that ever since the disannulling of the Mosaical Service of Legal Sacrifices, God has been no where worship'd in a way of his own institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or is it possible to point out any People upon Earth, save the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, that worship him in that way which God himself foretold he would erect at the vacateing of the old?</p>
               <p>§. 4. The fourth and last instance I shall give of Prophecies, touching meer Contingencies, that have been so palpably fulfill'd, as the Effect of the accomplishment is now existing, is of those which foretold, That after Israel had cast off their <hi>Messiah,</hi> and their God cast off them and taken the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43715:227"/>
to be his People; Those Gentiles, as they came into Christ should cast a way all their former Idol-Gods, so as never again to return to them. Of which Tenour are those Texts, <hi>(Isa. 2. 18. 20, 21.) [The Lord alone shall be exalted in that day, and the Idols shall he utterly abolish; and they shall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the Caves of the Earth, for fear of the Lord and for the Glory of his Majesty, when he ariseth terribly to shake the earth. In that day shall a man cast his Idols of Silver and Gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the batts;]</hi> This day is that when all Nations shall flow unto the Mountain of the Lords House, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi> 1. The same Prophecy is repeated <hi>(Is.</hi> 31. 7.) and the Effect of it dated, when the Lord the Shepherd of Israel shall rise up against the multitude of Shepherds, called forth against him (the whole Crew of Idols erected by the Gentile world to affront the Majesty of Heaven) and make no more of them than a Lyon doth of unarmed Shepherds, who would scare him away with their voyce when he comes to take their Flock from them: and when those Flocks shall be turned unto that God, from whom the Children of Israel have deeply revolted. <hi>In that day shall every man cast away his Idols,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>(Isa.</hi> 45. and 46. Chapters.) When all the ends of the Earth shall look unto God, when to him every Knee shall bow, every Tongue shall swear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their Idols were upon the Beasts, your carriages were heavy laden, they are a burden to the weary Beasts, they stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into Captivity:]</hi> That is, the Heathen Great Pontiffs and Philosophers shall not be able to maintain the Cause of those false Gods, whom by office and inducement of State they are bound to support, but shall fall down under the weight of that Vanity and Impiety, the Gospel shall charge them with; and throw off their load, and themselves become Christs Captives; so mighty were the Weapons of the Apostles Warfare, to cast down those vain Imaginations, that had exalted themselves against the knowledge of the true God, and to bring into obedience to Christ the strongest holds that Satan by his Deputies held in the Heathen World. And <hi>(Zech.</hi> 13. 2.) In that day when a Fountain should be open'd, to those Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to that House of <hi>David,</hi> that should mourn every Family apart, over him whom they had pierced (which cannot be meant of the Jews after the Flesh, for it was the Gentiles that pierced Christ, it was the Roman Soldiers that platted the Crown of Thorns, and set it upon Christs Head, that Nailed his Hands and Feet to the Cross, that peirced his Side with a Spear: to which external peircing of Christs Body, (and not to that Sword, which the unthankful Jew ran through his Soul) the Evangelist applies this Text, <hi>(John</hi> 19. 37.) The Spirit of Grace and Supplication is not promised, to the breakers of his Heart, but Bones: the Gentiles Heart that broke his Bones, shall be broken, when the spirit convinceth them of that sin: but the Jews generally lost under Judicial blindness;) in that day, I say, that the spiritual <hi>Judah</hi> shall repent and be baptized. (St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this Fountain to be Christian Baptism, that Laver of Regeneration) <hi>It shall come to pass (saith the Lord of Hosts) that I will cut off the names of the Idols out of the Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and cause the unclean spirits to pass out of the Land.</hi> Was ever any thing foretold with more plainness and perspicuity? most of those Oracles (and a great many more, which for brevity sake I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) are as transparent, as if they had been writ with a Sun-beam: in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious variety of expressions, there is not one ambiguous Word, not one dark Syllable; a Child may run and read these Visions: Would then such eminent Persons, as their Prophets were, in their several Generations have run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of having their Memories traduc'd in after-ages, by such plain speaking (having no imaginable Secular Temptation to it, but against it:) had they not been (beyond all possibility of mistake) assured of the Infallibility of that Spirit by which they were moved. Now the same Degree of Assurance, which they had <hi>à priori</hi> (from the Cause) we may have <hi>à posteriori</hi> (from the Effect;) they could not (by that more then Scientifical Vision of those things

For never were any Predictions more manifestly fulfill'd than these; not one title of them is faln to the Earth. There is not now, nor has not been, in any part of the World, since Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion was planted in it, the least Relique of those numberless Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Gods, it swarmed with before that. Where, (not only as to their Oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but Being) are the Gods of <hi>Hamath,</hi> and of <hi>Arphad?</hi> Where are the Gods of <hi>Sephervaim, Hena,</hi> and <hi>Iva</hi> (shall I say or) the Gods of <hi>Europe, Asia, Affrica?</hi> The Aegyptian <hi>Nile</hi> spawned Fish-Gods, their Land brought forth Gods of Grass, and Gods that eat Grass, their Air was darkned with vollies of winged Deities: In <hi>Greece</hi> the Genius of every species of Animals and Vegetives; In <hi>Rome Pallor</hi> and <hi>Terror</hi> the Fever and Jaundice grew into Gods; They had their he and she-deities, for Conception, Birth, Puberty, Marriage, Merchandice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods of the Closet, of the Market; Gods of the Close-stool, and Chamber-pot; such as 'tis a wonder their own <hi>Jove</hi> did not thunder-strike the adorers of; such, as one would think, <hi>Hercules</hi> might have scar'd into the holes of the earth with the shadow of his Club, or blown away with his Fly-flap: But that in the Exile of the lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, every one has an equal right to the Crown; and in that parity, there is not a chip to chose betwixt a Peer and a Peasant, a Calf will serve the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites for a God, when they have forgot him that brought them out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> When men delight not to retain the Former of all things in their mind, every Man will be a God-wright and frame an Image of the Deity, of any thing that comes off the Wheel of his ever-running Imagination. Yea Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy it self, in those Times of Ignorance, could not castrate the rank Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> of this prolifick God-teeming humour, but that they spawn'd as many Gods, that is eternal Beings, as there are Atoms in their conceipted infinite Worlds. In which particular I should think <hi>Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> to have wronged their memories, If I did not see (in this Age of improved Learning and divine Light) some mens Wind-mill-heads grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the God head of the one eternal, into as many and small grains as there are moats in the Universe: If I did not see those <hi>Leviathans,</hi> who make sport with, and take their pastime in deriding the Notions of created Spirits, and of the adorable Trinity of Persons in that one uncreated Essence (as finding no bottom of that immense Ocean, which Faith makes fordable to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Christian;) themselves introducing an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of more Spirits (for take Divisibility from Matter and nothing remains but an Incorporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and he that talks of a crooked, an hooked, a three-corner'd Atome, may, with as much reason, tell us of a Square, or Triangular Circle, except he can impose upon the World a new Grammar: as well as Philosophy, or perswade all <hi>Greece</hi> to forget its Mother-tongue) than can stand betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster:</hi> I could make infinite more room for them upon the Cartesian Ground, but that is a Field large enough for all the Host of Heaven to incamp in; and I shall enlarge their Quarters in my Reflections upon the other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> which the Doctrine of Atoms introduceth, to wit, as many Persons in the One Eternal Being, as many distinct individual Subsistencies in the one Essence of Eternal Matter, as we can imagine Moats in the Sun-beams, should they dart themselves ten hundred thousand millions of times further upwards towards the Emperial Heaven than they do downwards to this Globe of Earth, and spread themselves round about that vast Circumference, in comparison of which this of our habitation is but an Atome; For, give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity to Matter, and you give it the Essence of God: make it subsist in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, each one distinguish'd from another, and the result will be so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Subsistencies in that one Essence. Give to these Subsistencies a power of moving themselves (which you must grant them, or say they are moved by another, and what can be elder than Eternity, or by Chance, Chance must
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43715:228"/>
be then before them) and it must be the life of Reason: and that will make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every Atome an individual Person, a Rational <hi>Hypostasis.</hi> So that instead of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, subsisting in one undivided eternal Godhead, This new Divinity commends to us more millions of divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons than could be reckon'd up in an age (should all the men of that Age betake themselves all their life to their Counters:) That which we inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, <hi>A Troop cometh,</hi> in the Story of <hi>Gad's</hi> Birth <hi>(Gen.</hi> 30. 11.) some Hebrews expound, Fortune cometh; upon which our learn'd Antiquary expends the first Chapter of his 1 Syntagme, <hi>de Dais Syriis,</hi> I will not undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which is the best Translation; perhaps they may both stand with that Text, though not better than their conjunction would suit the Birth of the Doctrine of Atomes. For since <hi>Leah,</hi> that blear-eyed, purblind, Epicuraean Philosophy, grown, under the Age of the Gospel, past child-bearing, hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knees of her handmaid, <hi>Zilpah,</hi> Modern Atheism, brought forth into the Christian Air, her Son <hi>Gad</hi> or Fortune, as that which made the eternal Atomes so happily meet, as to fall into all those comely Forms whereof the World consists; <hi>Gad,</hi> or a Troop comes, (shall I say) or a Legion or a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riad of Troops of Deities: God the crooked, God the hooked, God the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse, God the sharp, God the long, God the short Atome; for it would be a taking of that Name in vain to apply it to those infinite Forms into which those mens Fancies cast those eternal Beings, which (notwithstanding) they call Atoms, with a far greater Solecism than he committed with his Finger; who pointed it to the Earth, when he was speaking of the glorious Furniture of Heaven; and shall rather bestow my time in transcribing that Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our divine Poet snbjoynes to the History of those and such like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Polytheists.</p>

I do not call <hi>Cartesius</hi> an Atheist, though doubtless his Philosophy has made many; but I think I may well enough call his a Feminine Philosophy, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi> grounded upon Principles received by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Tradition; though they neither could retrieve all Principles of that Nature, nor, through want of the rest, always rightly apply those they had received; And it seems a wonder to me, that so many, who would be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43715:229"/>
counted men in understanding, should be so affected with his Systems, which he himself (if my memory fail me not) in his Preface to his Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy affirmeth, he could make no man understand or relish so well, as one woman, who, though she was a person of honour, and of as great a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as any, as all of that Sex, yet sure she was not a competent Judge of such Speculations, had they been truly Masculine. She might perhaps have judged of a Poem, upon the presumption of <hi>Sapphos</hi> Dexterity; of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and have not gone beyond those bounds to which that Sex reached in the persons of <hi>Amaesia, Affrania, Hortensia,</hi> she might perhaps have found by enquiring of her Cooks or Scullions, that his Kitchin-experiments were true, and by her own Discretion see some of them subvert some of the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the old Philosophy; (as one fool may spy more faults than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred wise men can mend.) But that they were a Foundation, firm enough for his Conclusions; that she, and only she, should discern, is an affront to our whole Sex; if indeed his Philosophy be calculated to the sublimest Principles of the most Masculine and Strenuous Wits, and not Female and Vulgar Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (who are easily imposed upon by the fallacy of <hi>non causa pro causa,</hi> Though It must be acknowledged to the praise of that excellent Lady, that her Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Genius so far transcended the common standard of her Sex, as to make credible that Story which <hi>Socrates</hi> relates of the Alexandrian <hi>Hypatia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Theon</hi> the Philosopher, who excell'd all the Sophisters of her time, and either preceded or succeeded <hi>Platinus</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, <hi>(Lib. 7. 15.

Lord of Hosts; their Adorers never struck one stroke in their defence, as they did for their celestial Gods, the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which they worship'd, the Gods of the greater and lesser Nations: But all in vain: For those strong men that kept the house are all turn'd out of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session by the blessed Jesus, and spoil'd of all their Ensigns of divine honour: <hi>Jove</hi> of his Thunder-bolt, Christs still voyce drowning the noise of his Thunder: <hi>Apollo</hi> of his Bow and Arrows, Christ's Arrows proving more sharp in the sides of <hi>Python</hi> the Serpent, than his: <hi>Mars</hi> of his Faulchion, Christ's two-edged Sword proving the better mettled Blade: <hi>Minerva</hi> of her Spear, being not able, with her Target, to defend her self against the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of the Cross: <hi>Mercury</hi> of his <hi>Caduceus,</hi> by the more sweet Charms of the Apostles. The Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> uncas'd <hi>Hercules,</hi> and pull'd off his Lions Skin over his ears. As that Light of Light appeared in the East, and gradually shone to the West; the World ceas'd to fear those Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, that had affrighted her in the dark: men learn'd to look upon the Sun without the Ceremonies of Adoration, without kissing the hand or bending the knee. As the Bread that came down from Heaven, hath been broken, to the several Nations of the Earth; they gave over baking Cakes to the Queen of Heaven: As the Gospel introduc'd the fear of the One blessed God, she shak'd off the fear of false Gods, broke down their Altars, demolish'd their Temples, contemn'd their Oracles, and stampt their Images to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

So that now a Child may lead those Lions, at whose voice the World trembled, before God utter'd his voyce; none frequent those Fountains, Caves, Groves, Oaks for Counsel; at the lips of whose Oracles, formerly the whole World hung for advice, in all Matters of weight, thither men repaired, there they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about planting of Colonies, building of Cities, about Peace and War, <hi>&amp;c. (Plutarch. conviv. mor. tom. 1. p.</hi> 377.) But they have all lost their Tongues since God spake to us by his Son. <hi>Jove</hi>'s Fountain of <hi>Castalion,</hi> and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therof <hi>Colophon,</hi> (saith <hi>Clem.

One of those silenc'd Oracles, (that of the Daphnean <hi>Apollo,</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Antioch) Julian</hi> would have cured of his dumbness, and he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the like elsewhere, <hi>(Am.

What success he had here or in other places that Historian doth not relate, which doubtless so great an admirer of Gentilisme as he was would have done, if it had answer'd <hi>Julian</hi>'s expectation. And therefore I conceive he sped no better elsewhere than he did at that Oracle near <hi>Antioch,</hi> where all the Respond he could get from <hi>Apollo</hi> was, that the body of the Martyr <hi>Babilas</hi> (there interr'd) would not permit him to give Oracles, or to do those other freaks wherewith he had formerly deluded the World: whereupon the Emperour commanded the Christians to remove the Sacred Relicks thence, which they did in triumph, singing (saith <hi>Ruffinus)</hi> those words of the Psalmist, <hi>Cursed be all they that Worship Carved images, and put their trust in Idols (Socrat.

               <p>§ 5. 1. That Pagan Oracles lost their Speech and Credit in the World, when the Gospel was Preach'd. I have quoted before the Respond which the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> gave <hi>Augustus</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, may be seen in <hi>Eusebius (praepar. Evang. lib.</hi> 5. 16.) In one whereof he cries out, oh, woe is me! lament ye <hi>Tripodes</hi> for <hi>Apollo</hi> is gone, he is gone: for the bright Light of Heaven, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> who was, and is, and shall be, Oh! mighty <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he compells me. Ah woe is me! the bright glory of my Oracles is gone from me.</p>
               <p>In another to a Priest that asked him which was the true Religion? he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43715:230"/>
gave this Answer: Thou unhappiest of all Priests! oh that thou hadst not asked me, being now at my last, of the Divine Father, and of the dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of that famous King, nor of the Spirit which comprehendeth and surroundeth all things: for woe is me! he it is that, will I, nill I, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me from these Temples; and full soon will this Divining-seat become a place of desolation.</p>
               <p>And in another, being extreamly urged by Exorcismes to break off his uncouth silence, he thus laments—<hi>Apollo</hi>'s voice is not to be recovered, it is decayed through length of time, and locked up with the Keyes of never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divining silence. <hi>Zosimus Comes (lib.</hi> 1.) hath this Story; at <hi>Selucia</hi> a Town of <hi>Cilicia</hi> there was a Temple of <hi>Apollo Sarpedonius,</hi> about which were great flocks of those Birds they call <hi>Seleucides,</hi> which <hi>Apollo</hi> used to send to devour the Locusts that infested those mens grounds which applied themselves to him for help. But, saith he, the men of this age have rejected so great a bounty of that God. <hi>[It à loquitur homo paganus, quia inductâ Christianâ Religione, passim ludibrio erat gentilis superstitio.] Vossii de Idololat. l. 3. cap. 97.)

               </p>
               <p>It was in the Reign of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> that <hi>Porphyrie</hi> lived, and he reports these abovesaid Responds to have been extorted from <hi>Apollo</hi> before his Age. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> who flourish'd under <hi>Adrian</hi> long before <hi>Porphyrie</hi> (though a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Heathen) yet confesseth, that in his days the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> (that had been formerly renown'd) was faln to decay, that all the Oracles in <hi>Asia,</hi> save two or three, were then grown out of date: and in particular, that <hi>Baeotia</hi> (which formerly seem'd to be all Tongue, by reason of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Oracles there resounding) had lost her speech; her Oracles (like Rivers in an extream drought) were dried up, and wholly sunk into the Earth: so that they who came to draw water there could find none but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Lebadia.</hi> That of <hi>Amphiarius,</hi> at which <hi>Mardonius</hi> enquir'd in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian War: that at <hi>Tegirae,</hi> where <hi>Apollo</hi> was thought to have been born, whence the Grecians (in the Medic War) receiv'd a promise of Victory; were become speechless, and that of late; for I could give (saith <hi>Demetrius)</hi> one of the speakers in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Treatise of the Decay of Oracles, instances of more recent Responses received thence, which Oracles being now altogether struck dumb; it were worth the while to enquire, what the Reason thereof may be. <hi>Didimus</hi> the Cynick urgeth as the reason hereof, the Impiety the World was then grown to, which had provoked God to withdraw this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from it. <hi>Plutarch</hi> rejects this, upon these grounds, for that God did still continue his favourable Providence to the men of that Age: and that if he had so pleased, he might have taken occasion of as great displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Ages to which he afforded Oracles: for there were then good and bad, and the good as far out-numbred by the bad, as now. <hi>Ammonius</hi> (by way of Preface to this enquiry) layes down this ground. We must ascribe this Cessation of Oracles unto Divine Providence; (for if we deny that he hath silenc'd them, we lay a ground for suspition, that he did not erect them: and indeed who can Tongue-tie them, but he that gave them a Tongue; and assigns this as the reason, why so many of them were then ceast; because <hi>Greece</hi> was so depopulated with continual Wars, as that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the greatest part of it, would have run waste, if <hi>Apollo</hi> had not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Springs; what should he do with his hundred mouths, at which he formerly spake, now when he hath no greater an audience, than may all hear from one mouth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> will not allow, either that God spake in those Oracles, or did by special dispensation silence them: but ascribes this to the Mortality of those Middle Essences, those amphibious Spirits, the mean betwixt God and Man which inhabited those prophetical Seats: of whose Mortality <hi>Philippus,</hi> (another speaker in that Colloquie) gives an example in that story I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43715:230"/>

When the Emperour (saith he) sent me into <hi>Britain,</hi> I, out of curiosity sail'd to the Isles called <hi>Sporades:</hi> in a neighbour Isle to which, I found some few Inhabitants, of whom I learn'd that those Isles were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted sacred, as being the habitations of the <hi>Genii,</hi> who when they died caused perturbations in the Air, tempests on the Sea, and many portentous sights; such as hapned while I was there, an argument that at that time a Spirit was deceased.</p>
               <p>Briefly, (for why should I follow him step by step while he is hunting which way Oracles went) after he hath thrown on the whole pack of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, and in vain smelt for a reason of their then Cessation in <hi>Plato</hi>'s 5. in the Hermits 283. and in <hi>Epicurus</hi> his infinite Worlds, the best he can find in this, That there was in those places certain breathings of subterraneal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which actuated the Divining Faculty of the Mind (as the Light doth the Eye) and made it exert it self in prophesying, which in time were either wasted or diverted to some other place; as it happens to Fountains, which in length of time either dry up or flit, by reason that the subterranean Fire, which distills them, either goes quite out for want of fuel or Creep after its <hi>fomes,</hi> till it meet with matter enough to feed it, and caverns long enough to be Limbecks for such distillations. A <hi>Salvo</hi> which is neither broad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the sore, for it cannot be a sufficient reason why all the Oracles should at once be silenc'd, nor consist with common Principles touching those delusive Responds; and exploded by <hi>Cicero (de divinat.)</hi> nor comparable to that which the Christian brings and the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> himself was forc'd to acknowledge, though so much against his will; As when the obstinate Pagans would not rest satisfied with that answer, but labour'd to overcome his obstinate silence, and by Charms extort a better Respond from his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos;</hi> that he might be no longer forc'd to speak so much to his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; he stifled his Prophetess, whom against her will they thrust into the Cave; when by all ordinary dumb shows he had first exprest his dislike of their making enquiry at his Oracle, the Victim standing still as without sense at the first libations, and scarce shrugging when they rain'd, powr'd whole showers of water upon him. What could the poor dumb Idol do more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rebuking the madness of the enquirers that would still be asking questions of him, after he had so often and with so much passionate grief told the world he was tongue-tied from giving any other answer then this, That he was forbid by an higher power (the Hebrew Child, whom all Gods are commanded to obey and worship) to give answers? What could the poor dumb Beast do more towards the stopping them in that prohibited way, than to stand stone still, neither winnying, as we say in the North, nor wagging the Taile; neither tossing her horns nor shaking her ears, when water was poured on her head: it being a received Maxim in the Pontifical Schools, That when the Libations proceeded not Canonically, it was an infallible sign of the aversion of the <hi>Daemon,</hi> of his dislike of what they were about, <hi>[Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pram argui frigida affusa, si non moveatur.

too far and the Faction or rather the Superstition of the Vulgar hath been indulged more than enough, insomuch as to that height of Adoration, which even the Pagans gave to their Images, and to the extreamest vanity which the Heathens shewd in fashioning or adorning their Idols, there seems nothing wanting among us; And therefore perswades the Emperour that the ancient Doctrine might be restored and the new restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

               <p>Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath contracted the colour of the Calf upon the Golden locks of her Shrines and Images, by drinking too deep and too gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily of the Cup of Pagan Abominations, and thereby hath bewrayed herself to have the Calf in her heart, a very strong inclination to the grossest Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and to stand in extream need of that Admonition which <hi>Cassander</hi> gave her, that she would remove the scandall she hath given to the Mahometans, to the Reformed Churches, and the soundest part of her own Communion, by countenancing such Doctrines and Practices, as in the Judgment of her own Doctors, consequentially abett as perfect Paganism as ever reign'd in the Pagan World.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding all this, if we lay aside this jangling with words, and take Idolatry in its native proper and old prophetick sence; a sence which any thats come to the stature of a man, may stride over at once: And not suffer ourselves to be abused by those over-acute unhappy Wits, who cut this Term into as many Thongs as will compass the whole body of Romish Superstition, and by sub-dividing those thongs, would bring the innocent and pious Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> within the compass of that word Idolatry: by which art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43715:232"/>
his words from their genuine sence to our humours; and nothing will be more apparent to us than that; neither the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any other Society of men whatsoever, that once embrac'd Christianity, have Apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to the embracing of any of those Pagan Gods whom the Gospel ejected; or to the Worship of any God, but of that only wise and Eternal God that made Heaven and Earth. Him alone the Mahometans, him alone the Papists worship, with that degree of divine honour, which is proper to the Deity. And as to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> she so far abhorrs Idols, in the sence of those Texts which foretell their downfall under the Gospel, as she is famously known to have converted in these last days some Heathen Nations from Idols to the living God. And that not only by force of hand, as the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards attempted upon the Americans at their first arrival there; but by force of Argument, and evidence of Miracles; not such feigned and Legerdemain Sleights of hand, as she pretends to do in order to the conviction of those, who have either upon just cause forsaken her Communion (in those things wherein she has forsaken the Communion of the Catholick Church;) or have been shut out of her Communion (though they could have been content for peace sake to have walked with her in point of External practice) meerly because they could not find in their heart professedly to abjure the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blessed Apostles, the Primitive and Universal Church: Such as cordially believe in Jesus Christ; for whom Miracles were never intended by God, but for them that believe not: And therefore, though her Priests in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to shew Miracles in Christendom, declare themselves so far to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Satan, or of him whose coming is after the power of Satan, with lying wonders: yet among the Infidel Americans they may, and certainly do work Miracles; not as Papists, but as Christians; not in the virtue of Papal Innovations and singularities, but of the remains of the old and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Christian Religion mixt therewith: As I believe any of our Ministers might do, did their zeal to propagate Christs Kingdom carry them out, to Preach the Gospel, where it only can be preach't in propriety of speech, to that yet Heathenish part of the World. This Point our Hot-spurrs might do well to consider, who stretch their Stentorian throats with outcries against the Churches Apostracy to Pagan Idolatry: whereby in effect they decry the blessed Jesus, and pronounce him an Impostor, and not the very Christ. For the Prophet Christ is by the power of his Law and Spirit, utterly to abolish Heathen Idols, out of the several Nations of the World, upon their submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Sceptre. So as they should never regain their old Territories, but be and remain totally and finally exterminated from off the face of the whole Earth, and from under the whole Heaven.</p>

               <p>Expositors do macerate themselves and perplex the Church with disputes about the sence of this Text. But they are most at a loss in placing the <hi>Aera</hi> of the commencement of these 1000 years: and that rightly stated will give light to all the rest. I therefore begin there, and date it at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires submitting it self to the Sceptre of Christ, when he gave the World, (as the Empire was then reputed to be) that terrible shake, as made it cast its old Gods. When, at the rising of his Majesty so gloriously, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour acknowledged it; the Imperial Laws were made to serve Christ, which till then had been against him; for awe of which the Idols were hid in the holes of the Rocks, even by such as did not believe, as they had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before by them that were believers, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> well applies that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>(Isa. 2.) [Donec projicerentur à credentibus Idola, &amp; à non credentibus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconderentur] (August. de consensu Evang.</hi> 1. 28.) And since which time Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath been wholly restrained from prevailing with the Nations either to erect new Gods or to restore the old. Though I am not very solicitous to assign the precise point of time, when the Kingdoms of this World so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Kingdom of God and of his Christ, as Satan was ejected out of his; as he and his Angels, the Daemon-Gods, and the Creatures, whom he had perswaded the World to worship before the Creator, were cast out: both these growing up by such degrees, both as to place and thing, as 'tis far easier to see the effects, than observe the steps they made while they were in motion toward that existence: <hi>Herbam crevisse apparet, crescentem non cerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> We must not deny the Grass to be grown at Midsummer, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell in what minute of the Spring it began to put forth, or saw it not growing; yet these Particulars are beyond dispute.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Pagan Idolatry kept possession even of those Provinces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, whose Local Governours were Christians before the Conversion of the Emperour; of which we have a clear Instance in <hi>Paphos;</hi> where, though the Governour thereof, <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> was converted to the Faith, early in the days of the Gospel, yet we find the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> there long after that: for <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> visited it, and had fortunate Responds thence touching the Jewish Wars, and his own Affairs. <hi>(Tacit. Hist. 2.) Sergius</hi> might, as the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> as the Centurion, purge his own Family; but the reforming of his Province was no more in his power (saving what his Example
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43715:233"/>
and the exemplariness of his Family contributed thereto) than the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor had to reform his Prisoners, or the Centurion had to reform his Band.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That after the Conversion of the Empire, every particular Province thereof was not actually brought under the obedience of Christ, but those earliest which were nearest the Imperial Seat, and most under their observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obnoxious to the due execution of its Laws for Christ. Thence we find the <hi>Gandavi</hi> not converted, nor their Altars of <hi>Mercury</hi> demolished, until the Reign of <hi>Heraclius, (anno</hi> 612.) Nor <hi>Flanders</hi> submitting to Christs Sceptre, till <hi>anno</hi> 648.

Nor <hi>Westphalia,</hi> till that <hi>(anno 690.) Abbus</hi> and <hi>Niger</hi> converted it to the Faith. Nor <hi>Frisia,</hi> till <hi>Pippin</hi> having subdued their Pagan Duke, <hi>(anno 696.)

Nor <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Saxony,</hi> till about the year 670. they were brought under Christs Yoak, by the Preaching of <hi>Swibert, Winefred,</hi> and <hi>Aderbert,</hi> English Bishops, Nor <hi>Denmark,</hi> till King <hi>Herald</hi> their first Christian King, <hi>(anno</hi> 826.)

                  <hi>Constantius,</hi> the Father of Great <hi>Constantine,</hi> though the Gospel prevail'd not with him, so far, as to make him a Christian; yet he was so much a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of Christians, as to give them a Toleration in his Dition, who fled from the rage of his three bloody persecuting Colleagues, and to retain those as his Domestick Servants in the Palace who stood firmest to the Profession of the Christian Faith, rejecting such as he found (contrary to their better perswasion) conforming to the Pagan Worship, to please him, saying, they that would not be true to their God, would dissemble with their emperour. <hi>(Euseb. de vita Constantini, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 9, 10.) And toward the close of his Life renounc'd the Politheism of the Gentiles, and betook himself to the service of the one only God; so as his Court bare some resemblance of a Church, there being in it, the Ministers of the Lord dayly officiating for him, and praying with him. <hi>(Id.

Yea, <hi>Constantine</hi> himself, and his Successors, Christian Emperours (down as low as <hi>Gratian)</hi> retain'd still the Title and Office of Great Pontiffs, and accordingly order'd all businesses, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ethnick Ceremonies, by their Deputies. <hi>Mirabile dictu!</hi> saith the Learned <hi>Meed, (2 vol. book. 3. chap.</hi> 10. 746.) and because it seems so to him, it seems to me worth a more serious ponderation. That the Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, unto <hi>Gratian,</hi> were a kind of Samaritane Christians, serving the God of Israel, with their own Country-Gods (though with a vast disparity of respect: and the later, perhaps, but in complement and policy: as <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> bowed in the house of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> or <hi>Jehu</hi> proclaim'd a Feast of <hi>Baal,</hi> that I may not lay an ignominious blot upon the Memories of those pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) is more manifest than that it needs more proof than what Pagan Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gives. <hi>Constantine</hi> could hear the Orator of the <hi>Hedai;</hi> stile his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, <hi>Claudius, Numen:</hi> and his own favours to the <hi>Hedai, remedia numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis tui:</hi> could indure, to see the Images of all the Gods of that City carried in Procession to meet him, <hi>[omnium deorum nostrorum simulachra protulimus ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi occursura:]</hi> and to hear, that in thankfulness for the benefits receiv'd at the hands of <hi>Constantine,</hi> they offer'd gifts in their Temples; (in that Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick was made in their name, Printed at the end of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Panegyrick for <hi>Trajan.)</hi> He could with Patience permit the Orator of <hi>Triers,</hi> to call <hi>Claudius,</hi> a Companion of the Gods, nay a God in Heaven: <hi>(Imperator in terris, &amp; in caelo Deus:)</hi> whom the Temples of the Gods waited for; who was now receiv'd into the Council of the Gods; <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself giving him his right hand: and to commend <hi>Constantine</hi> himself, for visiting <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>(vidisti Apollinem tuum)</hi> (in his Panegyrick, <hi>Ibid.)</hi> All this to me seems not so strange, as that those Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were educated in the Law of God, should have God's approbation as men fearing him in the main, though they (contrary to as express a Precept as any is in the whole Law) took not away, but suffer'd their People, and sometimes used themselves to Sacrifice in high places, as <hi>Jehosophat</hi> and <hi>Asa. (1 Reg. 22. 44. 1 Reg.</hi> 15. 14.)</p>
               <p>§ 2. How much more might this connivance of the Emperours stand with true Piety, who being some of them nurst up in Gentilism, had not the means of knowing the will of God, which those Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had, which was St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his excuse for <hi>Valentinian</hi> the elder, his coming at the Pagan Altar in the Senate house, (in the place forealleged,) and the rest of them, having their Reigns incumbred with Secular, but especially with Ecolesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Wars, (and those about the main Fundamentals of Christianity) as they had not leisure to inquire into the niceties of practical Points of Christianity. It was much that those of the West imbrac'd Christ as God, and that those of the East prefer'd him before Idols, then when it was disputed among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whether he were God or no. Or had they had opportunity to study the will of Christ, as to that particular of the Magistrates Duty: yet their temptations against an exact conformity to it, in that case, (wherein their Political Interests were so much concern'd,) were so great and almost invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, as that may plead for our charitable Censure, except we our selves had never been drawn, by the Loadstone of our Temporal concerns, to strain cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie with conscience. Or had they been never so willing, at any charge or hazzard, to conform to God's Law once manifested to them; Yet it might have born a dispute, whether, in that Juncture, it were their Duty, to shew any greater discountenance, than they did, to the old, and so much doted on, Religion of the Gentiles? Especially having those great Examples of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s connivance at <hi>Laban</hi>'s Idols, in his own Family, and among his Wives; till he had an opportunity (after the settlement of his affairs) to purge his house of those Idols: and of <hi>David</hi>'s permitting his Wife <hi>Michal,</hi> to have an Image of the same kind with those of <hi>Laban</hi>'s, as the Jewish Doctors say,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43715:234"/>
quoted by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (in his <hi>Syntag. de Teraph.)</hi> and described by them, to have been the head of the first born of their Clan, the Founder of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, wrung (as the Priests did the heads of Fowls to be sacrificed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 15. and 5. 8, Texts which they alledge, for the illustration of this Rite,) off, and season'd with Salt and Aromaticks. To which (having placed it upon a Golden Plate, whereon was writ the Name of that unclean Spirit, which they believed they had called into it, by their barbarous Rites, and lighting Candle before it;) they gave divine honour, and applied themselves, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of all difficulties as unto an Oracle. Such were the Gods which both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> tolerated in their own Families, while they had not power to cast them out. Upon the account of the same Law (that of necessity, that has no Law) the first Christian Emperours were forc'd to tolerate Gentilism. <hi>Constantine</hi> prefaceth his decree of Immunity, with this excuse. It is necessary for the preserving of publick Tranquility, <hi>&amp;c. (Euseb. hist.</hi> 10. 5.) But where there was no danger of destroying the common peace (by provoking a major part, as in the Case of the Arrians; he orders, that all the Churches of those Hereticks be forth with overthrown, and their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies be no where suffer'd, either in publick or private. <hi>(Euseb. de vita const.</hi> 3, 63.) Whereas <hi>Gratian,</hi> on the contrary, finding the party of Arrians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, and swarming in all places (by reason of that indulgence his Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor <hi>Valens</hi> had used towards them) fearing some general tumult, if he should hastily distress so numerous a multitude as they were: gave order that they and all others might have Churches and Oratories with freedom and immunity: But he being once settled, and joyn'd with <hi>Theodosius,</hi> (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made strong enough to quell them) commanded that all Heresies should be silenc'd for ever, as interdicted by the Laws of God and Man, that none should any longer presume to teach or learn prophane Doctrines; <hi>(Codicis lib. 1. tit.</hi> 5.) From which consideration of the difference of Times, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> told <hi>Valentinian</hi> the younger (advising with him whether he should gratifie those of the Senate, who requested that the Altar, at which the Senators, that still adhered to Gentilisme, had used to be sworn: (Note, it was the fashion of the Romans to stand before the Altar, when they took an Oath,

                  </q>
As it was also of the Jews, (1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 31.) and the Oath come before thine Altar.) Before they gave their Vote in the Reigns of his Predecessors Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperours, might be rebuilt, having been demolish'd by his Brother <hi>Gratian;)</hi> That if <hi>Gratian</hi> had not had the heart to throw down that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but had left it standing, yet he would advise <hi>Valentinian</hi> to overthrow it, seeing the Pagan party, both in the Senate and among the Vulgar, was less formidable then, than it was at that time when his Brother had the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to demolish it: for they that prefer that request (saith he) do abuse the name of the Senate, while they present that Petition to you in its name, who are only a few Pagan Senators <hi>[Pauci Gentiles communi utantur nomine.]</hi> As I remember, when about two years ago, the like Petition was preferred, with the like subscription; <hi>Damasus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> sent me a Libel, which the Christian Senators (far more numerous than the Pagan) gave out, wherein they declared their disowning of that Petition. <hi>(Ambros. lib. 5. Epist.</hi> 30.)</p>
               <p>A manifest Argument that those first Christian Emperours could not be more rigorous against Paganism, than they were, without hazarding the publick Peace, and danger of turning all into confusion, by a precocious Zeal, by reason of the numerousness of those that then profest it, which as it decreas'd the severity of their Decrees against it increased. Princes must do as they can, when they cannot do as they should: in which case they do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43715:234"/>
what they should, when they do what they can. God accepting the Will for the Deed.</p>
               <p>It will be an harder task to free them from guilt, in their retaining the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Great Pontiffs, and being present at the Pagan Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for the last it may be pleaded, (for the extenuation at least of their Crime) That they had the Example of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s taking an Oath of <hi>Laban,</hi> in this form <hi>[The God of Nahor judge betwixt us]</hi> (meaning that God of the <hi>Caldees</hi> which <hi>Nahor</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> and their Forefathers worship'd before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Call;) and eating with him upon the same heap whereon he had Sacrificed to that God, <hi>(Calvin in locum:) [nec dubium est quin jurandi formae responde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit sacrificium.] Jacob</hi> himself sacrificing to the true God, and swearing by him, whom (to distinguish him from that God which <hi>Laban</hi> sacrificed to and sware by) he calls the Fear of his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> not <hi>Abraham;</hi> because <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Fear (for some time) had been the God of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> but <hi>Isaac</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born after his Father had left his Country and Country Gods, and entred into Covenant with the only true God) never had any other God, for his Fear, but the eternal God. <hi>(Gen,</hi> 31.) That <hi>Isaac</hi> was in presence, while <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> sacrificed to a false God; and heard him swear by the name of that God, at such time as he made a Covenant with him: <hi>(Gen. 26. 28.) Percu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiamus faedus tecum, Let us make a Covenant with thee by Sacrifice, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it by Oath;</hi> the antient Use being to slay Victims, at their making of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants (whence the Phrase of <hi>Icere, percutere, ferire faedus) (Vossius Etym.)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the parts whereof he that swore passed, as he pronounc'd his assent to the Covenant, ratifying that assent with such like execrations, <hi>[ità me Dii mactent—si sciens fallo] Let God mangle me as I have mangled this Victim if I wilfully break this Covenant: (Livii. lib. 1. lib.</hi> 21.) This ceremony God observed in his entring into Covenant with <hi>Abraham. (Gen.</hi> 15. 9. 17.) by the deputation of that smoaking Furnace and burning Lamp that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pieces on that same day wherein the Lord made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Excellently has the imcomparable <hi>Grotius</hi> determined this case of Conscience: <hi>[Se tamen, si quibuscum negotium erat, adduci non possent ut aliter jurarent, contraxisse cum eis (Idololatris,) ipsos quidem ut opportebat jurantes, ab illis autem juramentum accipientes quale haberi poterat. (Grotii de Jure Bel. lib. 2. cap. 13. 12.) If those with whom the Patriarchs had to do in the point of mutual swearing could not be induc'd to use another Form, than in the names of their Country Gods, they used to contract with them, though they were Idolaters, they swearing as they should, and taking such an Oath from those as they could possibly obtain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might also alledge the example of <hi>Naaman</hi> who, (according to the best Expositors) putting this Case to the Prophet: whether he declaring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that he believed there was no God, but the God of Israel: and yet bearing that Office under the King, as the King at times, leaned upon his shoulder, when he went abroad (for greater State:) if the King should go unto the house of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> while it was <hi>Naaman's</hi> Office to wait upon him; and <hi>Naaman</hi> should there bow, not in reverence to the Idol, but in a civill respect to his Master, who could not bow, if <hi>Naaman,</hi> upon whose shoulder he lean'd did not bow; whether, I say, in this Case he should sin against God in committing Idolatry was the Question he put to <hi>Elisha.</hi> And the Prophet in his answer to it assures him he may go in peace, that is, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in such circumstances would be no occasion of breach of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the God of Israel and him. Upon this example the Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines assured the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> whose Office it was to bear the Sword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour, and to whom the Emperor had sent a Command to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him in the performance of that Office, while he went to Mass; that he might lawfully observe that Imperial Injunction; because, <hi>[ad suum officium esset evocatus] he was called to the performance of his duty;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Elector accompanied <hi>Caesar</hi> to the Mass, <hi>[non vel ut ad cultum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ad Missam accedens,] not addressing himself to the Mass as a Religious duty,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43715:235"/>
but to the performance of the Civil Duties of his Calling,</hi> (Sleidan <hi>Comment. lib.</hi> 7.)</p>
               <p>And Lastly, I might urge, that the Pagans themselves (forc'd by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of our men and their own Mythologists) were at that time brought to an open and avowed confession, that the Gods of the Gentiles were not Gods, properly called, but either Created Spirits, in the invisible; or infused Properties, into the several <hi>Species</hi> of things in the visible World. So as <hi>Jupiter</hi> signified no more then (even in the Gentile Dialect) than the Heat; and <hi>Juno</hi> no more, than the Moisture of the Air, And that their erecting Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to them, was no more but an acknowlegement, in particular, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours bestowed upon Mankind by the one Eternall God, by their hands, as his Instruments. The change of the propriety of those Heathenish names must needs mitigate the harshness of their sound, even in Christian ears, if not make them as little offensive then, as the names of <hi>Saturn, Sol, Luna, Jupiter. Mercury, Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> are at this day: when, for distinction sake, we apply them to the Days of the Week, and as that Verse of St. <hi>Austin (contrà Academicos tom. 1. p. 197.) Sic pater ille Deùm faciat, sic magnus</hi> Apollo; with that Comment which himself makes of it: or that of the Flocena Oratour, utter'd to <hi>Constantine</hi> in his Panegyrick, <hi>[Quod</hi> Ceres <hi>mater frugum quod</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter <hi>moderator aurarum, quicquid illi parciùs dederunt nobis, amen ex benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o tuo natum est:]</hi> whose contexture speaks no more but this, that <hi>Constantine</hi>'s remitting to the Flavians the Customes due to the Imperial Crown, had made them amends for what they suffer'd, either through unseasonableness of the weather, or barrenness of the ground. But to enlarge here, would carry me too far from my intended Scope, which was to shew how by inches the Gospel gain'd upon the Roman Emperours. To proceed therefore in that discourse—</p>
               <p>§3. Christianity so far gain'd upon <hi>Valens,</hi> though an Arrian, as he would not aid the <hi>Gothes,</hi> but upon condition of their embracing the Christian Faith: which they did so cordially, as when by the Treason of <hi>Stillico</hi> they were set upon in their march toward <hi>Gallia,</hi> where the Emperour had allotted them quarters, by some Companies of Jews on the Lord's day, they scrupled to make resistance, though in their own defence, because they would not shed blood on that day which was dedicated to the honour of our Lord; till the Jews, abusing this their over-religious Opinion, in observing no mean in slaughtering them, taught them man by man to betake themselves to those arms which altogether they had resolv'd rather to die than use upon that day. <hi>(Vives de Getis. praef. ad August. de civitate dei.)</hi> Yet <hi>Valens</hi> neither received Christ for God, nor restrain'd his own Subjects by any penal Law from the publick Worshipping of Idols; any more than <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Elder, of whom <hi>Marcellinus (lib. 30. cap. 12. [Hoc moderamine principatus inclaruit, quòd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter religionum diversitates medius stetit, nec quenquam inquietavit, ne<expan>

               </p>
               <p>It prevail'd so far upon <hi>Gratian,</hi> as he refused the Pontifical Stole, when it was tender'd him by the College of Pagan Priests; saying it was unlawful for a Christian to be installed in, or to manage the Office of Great Pontiffs. But I do not read that he prohibited the College to officiate, or the inferior Priests to sacrifice; for I find <hi>Heliadius,</hi> the sometimes Master of <hi>Socrates Scolasticus,</hi> to have officiated as a Priest of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Ammonius,</hi> as a Priest of <hi>Apis,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Elder, and the Temples of Idols
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43715:235"/>
every where standing and frequented, if I may call that frequenting, when, (notwithstanding that there had not yet been made any penal Laws against Gentilisme) the assemblies there were so thin'd and the number of Pagans faln to that ebb, as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate to gain the Empire and the good will of the Provinces was fain to counterfeit himself a Christian: <hi>Ammian.

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Jovinian,</hi> obtaining the better of him, threatned his Army when they elected him Emperour, with a refusal to accept of that Office, except they would renounce <hi>Julian's</hi> and accept of the Christian Religion <hi>(Socrat. l.</hi> 5.) which had been a strange piece of Fool-hardiness, had not the Christian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Roman Legions been then more numerous, for all that so many Christians had parted with the military Belt, rather than continue in those Commands, which they could not injoy under that Tyrant <hi>Julian,</hi> except they would forsake the Ensign of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Nay, when the Imperial Laws were against the Faith, it so prevail'd, as the Idol-Temples under <hi>Trajan,</hi> were in a manner dis-frequented, as <hi>Pliny</hi> informs him <hi>(lib. 10. Epist.)</hi> This I here insert, that my Reader may know it was not by force nor might of the Secular Arm, that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was forwarded in its building. Marrie, that the Idol-Temples should go down without hands, that the Earth should open her mouth and swallow them up quick, or that God should beat them down with Thunderbolts, would have been a most groundless and presumptuous expectation. And therefore this Emperour <hi>Gratian,</hi> served Christ in putting his hand to that work, by demolishing the Altar in the Capitol, where the Senators till then had been Sworn, and confiscating the revenues of it; which gave a colour of Equity to the Petition of those, that begg'd of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> that it might be rebuilt, and the service thereof maintain'd, out of the Treasury: a colour which St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> handsomly wipes off, <hi>[quod enim vel fisco vel arcae est vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, de tuo magis conferre videbere, quàm de suo reddere. l. 5. ep.</hi> 30.] by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Emperour, that that would be a restoring of the Pagan service, at his own proper charges, and not a restoring of what belonged to that Altar, as its Revenues; for being confiscate, they were now become the Revenues of the Imperial Crown, but that <hi>Gratian</hi> did subvert any but that Altar, or set any mulct upon Idolaters, is more then I can find in any good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Elder was the first Emperour that universally prohibited the publick practice of Gentilisme through the Empire, commanding their Temples and Altars every where to be thrown down, and their Statues to be melted into Pans and Kettles for poor people. The execution of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree at <hi>Alexandria</hi> was committed to the care of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the Bishop of that See; who in ransacking those depths of Satan, those Cages of unclean Birds, brings to open light those shameful Mysteries and Obscenities, as the Revelation of them drives the Pagans to that rage as they furiously make head against the Christians, and slaughter such numbers of them, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, with his Military Bands, was fain to come into their rescue, and to aid the Bishop: by whose help he utterly abolished the Idols Temples, and all their Statues, but one, which he erected in the open Market, to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to future, of the folly of former Ages, in adoring such mis-shapen Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; at which <hi>Helladius</hi> was more vext than at his destroying all the rest. <hi>(Socrates lib. 5. cap.</hi> 16.) This Emperour pull'd down the Crows Nests, but restrain'd not the Boyes from climbing the tree: nor hindred the Birds from building Nests in private corners. For the Gentiles were still permitted their secret Chappels and Conventicles, even in the Imperial Cities and Courts: Some of whom were in that favour with the Emperours as that they were admitted to places of highest honour, emolument and trust. <hi>Macrobius,</hi> a Grecian by Birth, and a zealous Gentile by Religion, was Prefect of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bedchamber to <hi>Theodosius:</hi> and had so much interest in his Masters Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as for his sake he made that Decree; That they who bore that office,

should, in point of honour be equall to the chief Military and urbane Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, among whom <hi>Macrobius</hi> to have the precedency. <hi>(Isaac Pontan. in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad Macrobium pag. 1. ex Scaligero.)</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as those of our Divines, who date the binding of Satan so early, as the

And in very deed there can no other Salve be applied to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of a precise determinate number of years.

               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Millenium</hi> is not yet concluded, though more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years be run out since its Commencement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That that binding of Satan, that Chain of restraint, under which he shall be held, at least to the dawning of the day of Judgement, hath been laid upon him, ever since the Imperial Law made Gentilism capital.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that the expectation of a <hi>Seculum</hi> of a 1000. years yet to come, wherein Satan shall be any otherwise bound from deceiving the Nations, than he hath been this 1300 years, or wherein the Saints shall any otherwise reign upon the Earth with Christ, than they have done for the same space, is a Castle-built in the Air of Fancy without Scripture-grounds.</p>
               <p>I have given my reasons why I cannot subscribe to them that think the <hi>Millenium</hi> finish'd, and some, why I think it began where the Antimillenarians generally dated it; and shall make further proof of both those Points, in laying down the Reasons why I dare not follow those that think it is not yet begun.</p>

I dare not chuse for my Guides, in interpreting Scripture, such as have palpably misled their followers, as often as they have assayed to point out the beginning of their fancied <hi>Millenium.</hi> Of this Bran were they who a while ago have perswaded the world that Satan was to be bound in that <hi>[anno mirabili]</hi> that wonderful year 1642. (that very year when Hell broke loose.) And when those ductile Souls, who by their perswasions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into a belief that at the top of that hill, at the fulness of that Time,

they should touch the Moon with their fingers, found themselves abused. These Crafts-masters in perverting the Word of God, encourage their Idiot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proselites (who had not so much wit as Children, to dread the fire after it had burnt them;) to lift up their hands that hang down, to strengthen their knees, enfeebled by their disappointment of as great hopes as they have of Heaven, and to walk after those blind Guides (in hope still to see the Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this day of a 1000 years) from Hill to Hill, from Date to Date; till at last the frustration of their expectations, that the Heavens would fall and Men would catch Larks, <hi>anno</hi> 1666. converted most of their Scholars into Papists or Atheists; having gaped all that year after Christs Reign on Earth, (which they then hoped to see as verily as the <hi>Mexicanes</hi> expect the end of the World the last day of their <hi>Rota</hi> (an Almanack calculated for 52 years) they would have made work for the Tinker, had they, at every approach of their conceited <hi>Millenium,</hi> broken all their Pots, Kettles, Plate, and all kind of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils and houshold-stuff; as the <hi>Mexicanes</hi> do theirs, the last day of their <hi>Rota,</hi> as conceiving they shall never more have need of such things, <hi>(Scaliger de emendat. ad finem lib.</hi> 3.)

But the issue, saith <hi>Beroaldus (Chron. l. 3. c.</hi> 6.) shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what spirit he was led, and bewrayed the madness of the Prophet. And doubtless Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth would have been as mad as he, had he prick'd up his Ears, to have them claw'd by that wide-gaping Promiser; as our Fanaticks did theirs, to listen to the Alarms that <hi>Alsted</hi> gave them to their holy Wars. For to return to him. His first <hi>Aera</hi> of the Reign of Saints, of the blessed <hi>Millenium,</hi> should have commenc'd, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1622. when I was scarce got out of my Childs Coats; and therefore I my self could not make observation of any glorious Change, then happening: but I was told, that the Sun still kept the same station in the Heavens, and had the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration upon Earth, which it used to have within the Memory of Man; that the Moon retain'd the same spots in her face, which she had, when <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted</hi> first saw her; that Boyes were as towardly, Neighbours as loving, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as Gracious, Subjects as Loyal, the Rich as Liberal, the Poor as well reliev'd in times past, as since that year.</p>
               <p>His second <hi>Aera</hi> bore date, <hi>anno,</hi> 1636. I was then of age to observe, how the Bonny Scot got him up to this Hill to see Christ enthron'd on the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Tribunal, and all that would not submit to that his Government, sitting on the Stool of Repentance; who have since, without walking in the Counsel of the Ungodly, sate in the seat of truly divine Scorners of all such Bug-bears.</p>

The third <hi>an.</hi> 1642. upon that Mount were seen the feet of them that preach'd the everlasting Gospel (as they blasphemously called that Form of Government, they were then about to erect upon the ruines of whatever was Ancient, Sacred, and should have been dearer to us than our lives) that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd to our English <hi>Sion</hi> those glad tydings, that now the time was come that the Saints must reign, St. Rebels, St. Plunderers, St. Murderers, St. Regicides.</p>

But our hot-spurrs had not patience to wait so long; many of these covetous wretches, who under a cloak of Religion trouble the Waters that themselves may fish for Preferment and Estates, may have death gnawing upon them before that time come; and therefore, that they might be guawing the bones, and eating the flesh of the mighty, they antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the time, and pitch upon <hi>an.</hi> 1666. as the season appointed of God for the Conversion of the Jews, the Fall of Antichrist, the binding up of Satan, and the Reign of Saints: things ill put together; for though I believe that the Reign of Saints which they look for, will be coetanous to the Jews Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; that is, they will both be <hi>ad Graecas calendas,</hi> when Geese piss holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, yet I think the Reign of such Saints as they are, will rather be the Rise than Fall of Antichrist, and the effect rather of the loosing than bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil. As they mist it in the mis-joyning of things incompatible, so they were strangely wide in their Calculation, leaving out the round sum, a thousand, and pitching upon the fragments. However they did wisely at last, to trust to <hi>Alsted</hi> no longer, after he had mocked them thrice. For all that he himself is so confident of the futuriety of that blessed <hi>Millenium</hi> he dreamt of, and of its beginning to Commence at one of those Periods he had prescribed, as he concludes that discourse thus: <hi>According to the time that I have set down in my</hi> Speculum, <hi>the Boreal Empire shall arise, which God will erect by the Lim of the North, to the astonishment of all those that vili-pend this our Harmony, which we have demonstrated and pointed out, as it were, by the finger.</hi> The Harmony which he harps upon, is the concent of three Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; that of the Bible, or divine Prophesie; that of the Heavens, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Astrology, and that of History or experience: all which he thinks he hears in consort, playing this Lesson, singing this Song, as verily as the Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans heard the Musick of the Stars. This confidence of the Author threatned one of our Astrologers into an opinion, that this Lyon of the <hi>North</hi> was that King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who proved a dead Lyon by that time the Almanack was out of date, wherein he was proclaim'd. And therefore I would think all that are not resolved to run out of their wits in the pursuit of <hi>Chimaeras,</hi> should take the grave counsel which St. <hi>Austin</hi> gives <hi>(de Civitate</hi> 18.) where he adviseth us to let our fingers rest from all such Figure-flinging; for that all who have hitherto attempted to reckon, or rather guess, when their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Time shall begin, have been found to have been false Prophets; and whoever shall yet essay such Calculations, will speed no better in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of after Ages.</p>
               <p>§ 2.

               <p>To instance in such Points, as have both those bad Properties.

Now whether our Modern Millenaries, by deserting the ancient in their Opinion of the Jews final Rejection, do not also destroy the truth of as plain Prophesies, as any are in all the Bible, and (by consequence) the Foundation of our Religion, which is built upon the Veracity of the Prophets, I leave my Reader to judge, by what hath already been said upon that Point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Modern Millenaries make the binding of Satan Synchronise with the Subversion of Mahometanism and Popery: but the Ancients assign its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the downfal of Gentilism: <hi>(Lactant de divino praemio, lib. 7. cap. 19.) [Sic extinctâ maliciâ &amp; impietate compressâ (debellato, capto &amp; vincto improbo) requiescet orbis, qui per tot secula subjectus errori, nefandam pertulit servitutem, non colentur ulterius dii manufacti, sed Templis &amp; Pulvinaribus suis deturbata Simulacra, igni dabuntur.] Upon Satans binding, malice being extinct, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety supprest, the World shall rest (from Idol-worship) which for so many Ages had undergone a most wicked servitude; after that, Gods made with hands shall no longer be worship'd, but their Images shall be tumbled down from their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Altars, and committed to the flames:</hi> according to that of <hi>Sibyl.</hi>

               <p>In which Point, as they spoke consonant to the holy scripture (for that makes the Reign of God alone to concurr with the abolition of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols) so they laid a sure ground for the Fathers of the succeding century to conclude, that the <hi>beatum Millenium,</hi> the Reign of the Saints on the Earth with Christ, and the time of Satan's binding was then commenc'd when they saw Paganism wholly exterminated from the Earth. Idols ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther broken or cast into holes all the then known World over: For the Fathers generally never dreamt of the Antipodes, but in scorn of their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible being. For a Millenary I will name <hi>Lactantius: (Institut. lib. 3. cap. 24.) [Quid illi qui contrarios vestigiis Antipodes putant? Num aliquid loquuntur? aut est quispiam tam ineptus, qui credat esse homines, quorum vestigia sunt superiora quam capita? aut ibi quae apud nos jacent universa pendere? fruges &amp; arbores deorsùm versùs crescere, pluvias &amp; nives &amp; grandinem sursùm versùs cadere in terram? &amp; miratur aliquis hortos pensiles inter septem mira narrari, cùm Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophi &amp; agros &amp; maria, &amp; urbes &amp; montes pensiles faciunt?]</hi> For an Antimil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenarian, St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who <hi>(de Civitate</hi> 16. 9. (censures the relation of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi> to be an incredible Fable. Now St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who lived to see the utmost bounds of the Empire, and of this upper Hemisphere, subjected to Christs Septer, and freed from the service of Idols, speaks of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies which foretel that Christ should reign from Sea to Sea, and to the worlds end, as then fulfilled: and <hi>Lactantius</hi> would have joyned with him in that triumphant Song, had he lived to that Age, and seen that one God alone exalted in the Earth, who in his time was rival'd with so many false Gods.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But you will say, this was triumphing before the Victory, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of the Fathers, to think the whole VVorld was become Christs, when one half of it stood out against him.</p>
               <p>In answer to this Objection, some say and have perswaded themselves to think, that <hi>America</hi> hath not been long inhabited; but that it was first pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest by such Pagans, as from the Light of the Gospel, and the penalties of the Imperial Laws fled thither before the face of Jesus, as the Tyrians to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> from before <hi>Joshua.</hi> If this surmise were true, it would be a good <hi>Salvo,</hi> and give light to those passages in Old Testament prophesie; where it issaid, the Idols shall go under ground, be cast to the Moles and Bats, to that Hemisphere which was then uninhabited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is wholly against reason, that a place so near that part of the World, where <hi>Noah</hi>'s Posterity first seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves, as some question whether it be not the same Continent, (and others confess them sever'd by a narrow Sea, <hi>(Fullers Miscelan. l. 2. c.</hi> 4.) should not more early be found out; <hi>Noah</hi> having taught the World how the Seas might be made passable, and those parts where he seated his children so crowded with inhabitants, as men, to enlarge their quarters, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void hunger which breaks stone walls, forc'd their way to new seats through the most inhospitable Climates.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I therefore prefer here this answer, that this upper Hemisphere in the common dialect of the Prophets signifies the whole world, God being pleased to accommodate his language to the Conceptions of the vulgar: And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43715:240"/>
therefore he himself put that new Song into the Churches mouth, wherein she triumph'd in her Christ, as install'd sole King over the VVorld, when he gain'd that eminent part of it into his possession, that had been the Stage of Scripture-history, and of the Apostles Peregrination, and was at that time, both when they were given out, and began to receive their accomplishment, the only known VVorld. Not that I subscribe to that of Mr. <hi>Meed,</hi> that this Hemisphere is to be solely partaker of that universal Restauration which the Scriptures mention, and what Nation soever are out of its bounds, are reserv'd for Christs Triumph at the day of judgement, and to be destroyed with that fire which shall consume those Armies that shall compass the holy City, which that learned person conceives shall be listed by Satan in <hi>America,</hi> and thence drawn up against the Camp of the Saints (that is, as he opines) the old VVorld men wholly reigning with Christ. For this is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Experience, whereby we learn that that new VVorld is coming in a pace to Christ. <hi>(Vide Heylin. Amer.</hi> 2019.) But other express Prophesies that mention the round VVorld, and all that dwell therein; all Nations whom God hath created, as portions of Christs Inheritance, that mention every Tongue and every Knee, confessing to, and bowing to the God of the whole earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore, as those that lived before the discovery of this new found VVorld might, when they saw the old converted, appropriate that universal Restauration unto it in Faith and Charity, extending themselves to the utmost bounds of the explicite hope of those Centuries, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded that subjection of that old VVorld to the Royal Law: So we to whom the knowledge of the new VVorld is communicated, by our excluding of that from the benefit of Redemption, transgress the Law of Faith, Hope and Charity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Faith; for though the belief of the being of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> be no Article of Christian Faith, yet the belief of their future Call, upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being, is: that is, he that knows there are Tongues and Knees under the Earth, is bound to believe that in Gods appointed time, every knee there shall bow to, every tongue there shall confess to the only true God: Yea, were I sure by a certainty of Reason, or indubitable Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that men inhabit the VVorld in the Moon, I were bound to be sure, by an equal certainty of Faith, that the Inhabitants of that VVorld shall have their season of Grace as well as we.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of that Hope which the Primitive Church had, which expresly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it self to the expected Conversion of all Nations, and implicity (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supposition that there were Nations and Languages there) of those of the lower Hemisphere.</p>
               <p>And 3. Lastly, of that Charity wherewith the first Christians embrac'd all that VVorld they could grasp with their minds. From which Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how far do they deviate, from whose Pens fall such unmerciful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, such bitter things against the poor Americans, as the defence of their <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> naturally draws from our Modern Millenaries; from the guilt of which uncharitableness they will hardly be acquitted, by wiping their mouths, and ascribing this severity <hi>[justo, at nobis incognito, Dei judicio] to the just, but to us unknown judgement of God,</hi> upon that so great a part of the VVorld. For though the deferring of their Conversion so long, may pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously be ascribed to the secret and incomprehensible counsel of the all wise God: at the depth whereof in this case, (of his having mercy upon some of the most barbarous Gentiles, so early in the day of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and so long before he had mercy on far more civilized Nations) Reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion call upon us to stand astonish'd, and so much more as we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other Reason thereof but the Divine Will: yet for men to frame to themselves an Image of Divine Justice, inconsistent with that Mercy which God hath proclaim'd, he hath treasured up in his Christ for all Nations, to be manifest in its due and appointed time; and in defence of their own foolish imaginations, to plead Gods secret Counsel, against his reveiled
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43715:240"/>
Purpose, is to add the sin of Sacrilegious Impiety, to that of barbarous inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Thirdly, In both which, the Placits of the Millenaries, touching the Gogick War are so deeply immerst, as I wonder how such conceits could find place in the pious head of Mr. <hi>Meed,</hi> as those are which he lays down <hi>(rol 2. pag.</hi> 714.) where propounding to himself this Question, from what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the World, from what kind of men that huge Army was to come that should incompass the holy City? he resolves it must be raised in <hi>America,</hi> and consist of the Inhabitants of that Hemisphere that's opposite to ours. And next enquiring into the Cause of that their invading our World; into the Arguments whereby Satan should ensnare them into this engagement; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it can be for no other reason, but that they may mend their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, possess themselves of a more fertile Soile and live and die here in this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Hemisphere where they may enjoy a Resurrection; which perhaps they think is a priviledge appropriated to this World of ours. For this it is that they shall invade the holy City, that is, this upper half of the Earth, the sole Seat of Righteousness; and for their making this invasion in pursuit of these ends, God shall rise up against them, as so many Gyants fighting against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in an instant destroy them by Fire from Heaven <hi>(Volum. 2. book. 3. p.</hi> 712.) Let us examine these Responds of the greatest Oracle, of the most refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Learning, that ever opened its mouth in defense of the Millenaries Cause.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Say that World be now as horrid as <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>Gallia</hi> was in <hi>Caesars</hi> time, may not the Cultivation thereof, for more than a thousand years, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as fertile and delectable then, as our World is now? The old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent must be grown into his dotage, if he can (after a thousand years mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in his Den) study out no better an Argument, than that Topick affords, to engage the Americans to invade this upper World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How can it be a manifestation of the righteous Judgment of God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Americans, for that Crime, which the Christian Hemisphere is a thousand times more deeply immerst in the guilt of, than they; who have suffer'd those things by us (while we have been harasing those Countries,) as were enough to prejudice them for ever against the reception of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whose professors are so unjust and barbarously cruel, were it not that the Almightiness of Prophetick Truth will carry on the purpose of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the blocks that can be laid in their way to Christ, by man. <hi>Josephus</hi> scarce any where more bewrayes the spirit of a Pharisee, than in <hi>lib. 12. cap.</hi> 13. of his Antiquities: where he censures <hi>Polybius</hi> for saying, <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes</hi> came to a miserable end, for attempting to plunder <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple: for (saith he) the intention of Sacrilege, which he did not actually commit, seems not to have been a thing worthy of such a punishment: yet, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of his discourse, he recovers himself, and speaks like a man of Reason: If <hi>Polybius</hi> think, that to have been a sufficient cause of his ruine: with how much more probability may it be affirm'd, that the vengeance of Heaven overtook him, for that Sacrilege which he not only intended, but perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> with how much more reason may I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue against this cause of the Americans overthrow, assigned by this learned man? Must they perish for but designing an encroachment upon us, who have made so many unjust encroachments upon them? Must their thoughts of retaliation, of repaying the inhabitants of this upper Plane, that measure they have been meeting to them, be punish'd (by the Righteous Judge of all the Earth, that respects not persons) with so severe and suddain a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How much less can the inflicting of so dreadful a vengeance upon them be imputed to their seeking a place of burial amongst us, where they may lye down in hope of a Resurrection: as conceiving in this part of the World to be that <hi>Elizium,</hi> beyond, God knows what Hills, where the Souls of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43715:241"/>
righteous men rest in joy: (as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> reports of them in his <hi>America)</hi> can any thing be more strange or abhorrent to Christian ears, than that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satan should tempt them to, or God punish them for, such an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking?</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it is an Article of Faith that the Church is Catholick, that is, at once, in all its members, in point of necessary Doctrine: they all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, in all ages, and places, holding the same form of sound words. And successively, in respect of Place, as well as Time. And therefore to assert the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of any place (much more one half of the Earthly Globe) finally out of that Church, bids defiance to the Christian Faith: So 'tis the confession of all, that this Church shall be militant here on Earth, as to the state of every particular Member, (who have remains of corruption within them to grapple with) and, as to the general state of the whole, being incombred, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the bad neighbourhood of such visibly wicked ones, as either mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously excind themselves by separation, or are justly (for their contumacy) cast out of her Communion; (such as make up the Devil's Chappel, where-ever God hath his Church: From whence will necessarily flow these infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That to put such an Interpretation upon dark and prophetick Texts, as makes them present the Church on Earth in a state so triumphant, as leaves her neither spawn of Corruption within, nor the Seed of the Serpent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for the exercise of her Repentance, Faith, Hope, Charity, Patience; is a giving of the lye to those numerous, plain, and open-fac'd Texts, whose uncontroverted sence, (and words not capable of perversion) inform us the direct contrary. That the Net of the Gospel gathers good and bad, which shall not be sever'd one from the other till the last day; That the Tares grow with the Wheat till the end of the World; That is, the Local and visible Church shall have a mixture of formal Members in it, that are not of it; Insomuch as when Christ was personally present with the College of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, they were not all clean; that Church of his own gathering had a simpering <hi>Judas,</hi> who could cry, Hail Master, and Kiss his Lord, while he betray'd him. And as all the visible Members are not good; so the best and sincerest Member is not all good, <hi>Venus</hi> hath her Mole, the Moon her spots, the best Christian his infirmities; there is not a man upon Earth that sinneth not; and whoever saith he hath no sin, he sins in saying so. So that the old Serpent, when he shall be let loose again, will find wicked instruments of his malice against the Church, (his own evil Seed) among the Wheat where-ever that is sown; and therefore the Millenaries, in confining him to the lower Hemisphere to gather his Army in, by which he is to assault the Holy City) not only contradict their own Texts which assigns him the four corners, the four Quarters of the Earth, the whole breadth of the earth, the whole compass of the Globe, from East, West, North, and South (which I could bear with them, in knowing that the Prophets have a peculiar language by themselves in their Proverbials and Hyperbolics:) but the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of sacred Scriptures, commented upon, by the uninterrupted series of Providence in all ages.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Second. Nay that at the approaching of the general Judgement, when that War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> shall commence, The Churches most eminent Seat, and the most glorious entertainment of the Gospel will be, in those Chambers of the South, in that new discover'd World, to which it is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting apace, from our Hemisphere. The far greatest part thereof, all the West of <hi>Asia,</hi> the East, West, and South, of <hi>Affrica;</hi> and the sometimes most flourishing, and best peopled parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> being already over-run with Mahometan Barbarousness; and the remaining parts of it (by our great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and impieties against God, and by our dissentions and discord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selves) hasting to open a way for the Turk to enter the City of God, (through the breaches we dayly make, and widen, in the Walls of <hi>Sion.)</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:43715:241"/>
We sin, and he wins, we contend, and he conquers; we presume, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are the Temple of the Lord, the City of God, we are inconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in the mean while he takes our Forts, and batters our Walls about our ears; our ears which we stop, and will not hear the voyce of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, charm he never so wisely: and therefore I fear, I should but spill my Ink; in bestowing it in recording, the Turks dayly encroachment upon the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Pale; his making Conquests, by inches, over the Western, as he did, by Ells, over the Eastern Church: or in describing those Marks of future bane, those Prints of divine displeasure, and certain forerunners of Gods rejection of a people, as deeply imprest upon the Western, as they were upon the Eastern and Southern Patriarchates, when God deliver'd those Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his and their enemies hands, If we go to his place at <hi>Shilo,</hi> where once he put his Name, &amp; enquire for what wickedness he made his Glory depart from <hi>Jerusalem, Ephesus, Antioch Alexandria, Constantinople,</hi> we shall find the very same provocations reigning in these parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> the same infatuation of Counsels, the same strong delusions, the same debaucheries and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and our selves as ripe for excision, (looking as white for harvest, as they did when the Mahometans Sickle reaped those goodly Fields) Suppose ye that they were greater sinners,? I tell you nay, but <hi>except we repent, we shall all likewise perish.</hi> But I look too long upon the dark side of that clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Pillar, that has been passing from the East (the place where the Gospel first set out) towards the West, and as it moves deprives the Church of her Head attire (Christian Princes,) of those her dry Nurses and Guardians; yet not of her wet Nurses, or the inward Glory of her Garments; for she shall reign still with Christ, even upon this Earth, in those remnants of her seed dispersed over the face of it: The Sun of a Christian Magistracy shall not be seen, where this Night hath, or shall, encroach upon the Church: but her eyes shall see her Teachers still, and her ears hear; This is the good old way, walk in it and find rest; the Stars will appear behind the Cloud, as they did in the Primitive Church, before Princes became her Nurses; and as they do now within the Turks Dominions, where Princes have ceas'd to be her Nurses. And when Mercy, triumphing over Judgement, shall have left us such a Nail, such a stump of the Tree of Life in our Hemisphere. The Covenant that God has made with the Christian World, being like that he hath made with day and night; of which, he saith, <hi>if those ordinances shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, then shall the whole seed of Israel be cast off;</hi> the Covenant he made with, the Ordinances he gave to the Carnal Seed, were but Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore that seed was wholly cast off: but the Covenant he made with the Spiritual Seed, is an everlasting Covenant, and therefore that Seed of Gentile Believers shall never be wholly cast off; The new Israelites, in shew and profession only, when this Sun of persecution for the Gospel ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth (when the Temptations of the World shall be laid before them, when none shall live under the benign influence of their Mahometan Rulers, but those that wheel about with them to the embracing of that Brutish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) shall forsake Christ, and embrace the present World: But the Israelites indeed, (in Faith and Practice) shall never be prevail'd with to renounce Christ, but that poor and peeled People shall bear up his Name, in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon whom it hath been called, to the end and consummation of the World.) When (I say) the infiniteness of the divine compassion shall be so bounded and streightned (by the circumjacent Guilt of our multiplyed and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sins, and by the innate veracity of divine Menacies) as all it can obtain for us, against the pleas of both, is no more then this: when our golden Dreams of glorious days end in this; God will provide Kings and Queens to be Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the American Churches, who shall dandle them upon their knees, and that perhaps for as many ages as we have been dandled, I say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, because I would not pry into Gods secret Purposes, nor limit the holy One in that point, wherein I cannot observe him to walk by any Rule, but that of his own good pleasure, whereby both to Persons and Nations he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43715:242"/>
lengthens or shortens their day of Grace, so as the Sun hath been set near a 1000. years ago upon most of <hi>Asia;</hi> and yet shines upon us in the West of <hi>Europe,</hi> upon whom it rose before it did upon them; I mean the cherishing Light of a Christian Magistracy, for we had our <hi>Lucius,</hi> before they had their <hi>Constantine.</hi> However this is certain that (how long or short soever God hath in his eternal Counsel determin'd that space) that they shall have their time of Grace as well as we; and we shall have no more than our time; and therefore as the night shall grow upon us, that had day before them; the day shall grow upon them; and when the Sun is farthest from our Horizon, it will be highest in theirs.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And this affords us another Argument against those who limit the <hi>Millenium</hi> to a precise number of years, and yet will have it commence at <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign; not considering, that though the Revelation-prophecies have the Roman Empire for their Stage, and therefore we cannot pitch upon a fitter time for the beginning of the <hi>Millenium,</hi> than when the Laws of that Empire bound up Satan from cheating the World with Paganism; it being the common notion of the World then when St. <hi>John</hi> gave out his Revelations, that the bounds of the Empire were coincident with those of the habitable Earth: Yet now the bounds of the Earth being found to be of a far larger extent, we ought to stretch our conceptions touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of those Prophesies that are yet <hi>infieri</hi> and current (as the Reign of the Saints with Christ on the Earth is, and shall be as long as the Earth is inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as far as the earth is or shall be inhabited) to an extent answerable to that of the things themselves. And therefore are not to limit the Time of this Reign to any narrower compass of years than will be sufficient for the perfecting of the Call of that whole new-found World, inhabited by the seed of <hi>Adam</hi> and within the bounds of that inheritance which was promis'd to Christ: which as it cannot in reason be conceived to take up less time than will make the years since Satans binding so many more than a thousand, as a child may count them to exceed that precise number; so we cannot cast the call of those Nations into any other <hi>Epocha,</hi> but that of St. <hi>John's</hi> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years: for nothing is to intervene the expiring of that propheticall <hi>Millenium,</hi> and the Day of general Judgment, but that little space wherein Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan shall be let loose to deceive the Nations, a very unmeet season for such a work: and therefore I wonder that some, very Learned and Judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, should so soundly nap it here, as to dream that Satan hath been let loose, ever since the Turks took <hi>Constantinople;</hi> when on the contrary, God is making his Chain shorter than it was, and not allowing him to Reign all over <hi>America</hi> as he did before. Neither is he permitted, so much as to tempt this upper Hemisphere, to lick up its vomit of old Gentilism; which is the only thing he is during the <hi>Millenium,</hi> restrained from: as Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> well observes, and the sad experience of all Ages demonstrates, wherein he has been, is, and will be, Persecuting the Womans Seed, as far as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments dare; sowing his Tares among the good Seed, deluding those that receive not the love of the Truth, with as monstrous and damnable Errors, as the Pagan Ages were given up to; and tempting them to all the old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries and unnatural sins of that, and the new invented ones of this Age, which were not named among the Gentiles; soliciting the Saints themselves, and sometimes leading them captive to those sins, they feel the bitterness of as long as they live. Briefly, he is bound up from being the God of the World (as he was while he and his Angels were Worship'd as Gods:) but he is permitted still to play all other parts of a Devil in the World; and will be, till the Church exchanges the Armour of God, for the Garment of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, so long as she stands, having her Ioines girt about with Truth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the Breast-plate of Righteousness, and her feet shod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Gospel of Peace; while she wears the Shield of Faith, the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit; while shee's arm'd on the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43715:242"/>
right hand and left; while she stands thus <hi>[in praecinctu]</hi> upon her guard, and is bid to stand so, by the Captain of her Salvation, (which word of command she must be under till both Christ's and his Apostles Precepts be out of door.) we may be sure, she has not only Flesh and Blood to wrestle with, but Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, and spiritual wickednesses in the Etherial places.</p>
               <p>Besides that, it will be unseasonable, to assign that time, for a season of grace (to one half of the World) wherein Satan is let loose to reinforce Paganism: the shortness of that space of his loosing will not give room enough, for the preaching of the Gospel to such multitudes of Nations and Languages. It is an old Tradition of the Jews (quoted by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.) That in the day, when Judgment is upon the World, and the holy blessed God sits upon the Throne of Judgment, Satan, who deceives high and low, shall be found destroying high and low and taking away souls. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks St. <hi>John,</hi> in this Vision, speaks to the heart of those Jews, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> expounds this Text of the Revelation, by that Tradition: in his Treatises against the Manichees, <hi>(cap.</hi> 24.) and <hi>de Anima (cap. 35. and</hi> 38.) where he hath this passage <hi>[Post cujus regni mille annos, intrà quam aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem concluditur sanctorum resurrectio,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>after the thousand years of which Reign of Christ, within which age is included the Resurrection of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>§ 1 THat this loosing of Satan shall not be till the Dawning of the Day of Judgement, touching which I humbly submit to the candid Censure of the Church, these my conjectures, with my Reasons for them.</p>
               <p>That Text, <hi>Rev. 20. [He shall gather them together from the four corners of the Earth]</hi> seems to allude to <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. and to be subsequent to that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Elect. <hi>[He shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and they shall gather his elect from the four winds, and from the one end of the heaven unto the other]</hi> touching which first gathering of the Elect, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, it shall be in order to their meeting of Christ in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at the sound of which Trumpet the dead in Christ shall rise first, and then those Christians whom that day shall find alive, shall in the twinckling of an eye be changed into the same form and condition of body with those that arose from the Dead, and be caught up in the Air to meet Christ. <hi>[Qui merebantur compendio mortis per demutationem expunctae, concurrere cum resurgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.] (Tertul. de resur. cap. 41.) They who obtained by that short cut of death cancel'd by change, the priviledge to run together with them that rise, to the place of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ancient Church generally thought, that the Center, to which this gathering of the Saints should be, is the Valley of <hi>Jehoshaphat;</hi> whither she expected Christ would come to judge the World: and, in testimony of that her expectation (and that she might, in all her religious Assemblies, be found waiting for that appearance of her Lord, and be mindfull of that our general gathering unto Christ) she turn'd her face, while she worship'd, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that point of the Earth: and therefore the sacred Places of Publick Worship were built with their Chancells (where the Communion-Table, the visible Throne of Grace stood) at the East end, if the place were West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but at the West end of their Church, if the place were East of that Valley, that so, in what coast soever the Name of Christ was invocated, their Eyes and Minds might be directed thither; this is the very reason, why the Chancel of the Patriarchall Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> stood at the West-end; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt all the Churches within that Patriarchat, that stood East of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> were conformable to the Mother-Church, as that was to the Practise of the Universal; which, from every point of the Circumference, had its Lines
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43715:243"/>
drawn, to that Navel of the Earth, that Center of the general Assembly: And therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> is out, in his giving the standing of the Chancel of that Church, contrariwise to the Chancels of the European and Natolian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for an Instance of the different Usages and Rites of some Churches from others: for though in the rest of the Examples that he produceth, one Church differ'd from another (without breach of Charity, or contempt of Religion) yet in this Ceremony, of looking towards the Valley of <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> there was an Universal Conformity; no Church having so little manners, as to turn her breech upon the place of Judgment, while she worshipp'd the Judge, and made Confession of her belief, that she dayly expected his appearance, over that place, where, at his ascension, he was taken out of the sight of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into heaven: and his Angels after that assured them, that he should so come in like manner, as they had seen him go into Heaven. Which among other circumstances, must imply, that of the Place, if not mean that above any other: For as to other manner of his second Coming, it will be with a far greater Train of Angels than they then saw him ascend with, and in far greater Glory.</p>
               <p>§ 2. The Elect; that is, all that have profest the Worship of the true God, (or as <hi>David</hi> calls them, Gods Saints that have made a Covenant with him by Sacrifice) being gather'd to the place of Judgment, (or during their gathering thither: For it seems <hi>Tertullian</hi> thought, the Pagans would be at the heels of the rising Saints; and that they might not surprise the Saints then living, they should be changed in a moment, and, in the twinkling of an eye, be in readiness to march up to the place of Judgement, with those that are risen, before the Antichristian party (both of the then living, and immediately to be rais'd) could seize upon them. <hi>[Hujus gratiae privilegium illos manet, qui ab adventu Domini deprehendentur in carne, &amp; propter duritias tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum Antichristi moriebuntur compendio mortis,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>(Tertull. Ibidem)</hi> This Election I say being gathered, or a gathering to the place of Judgements; the reprobates, (that is all Idolaters, the whole Pagan World, that have lived and died in Gentilism;) shall be raised, and those that are living shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: And Satan now let loose (the whole Church waiting in the Air the Judges coming) will re-enter upon his old Demesne and drive all the Cattle he there finds, as his own, as weises and strays from the great Shepherd of Souls; and perswading them perhaps that he raised them from the dead, and would now at last be reveng'd on Christ and his Saints, and, dequoying them into an opinion that they had a fair opportunity of making havock of the City and People of God altogether, of swallowing up the little Flock of Christ at one morsel, now they were all in a body (and a body so contemptible, in comparison of those multitudes which he headed being as the Sand on the Sea-shore;) or by whatsoever insinuations, he will prevail with them to march up, under his and his Angels conduct, from all parts of the World, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, tectum &amp; intectum</hi> (as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> expounds, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. and 29) the hidden Climes of the lower, the known World of the upper Hemisphere, against the holy Land and the Camp of the Saints, which while they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassing, the Judge appears, and, with that devouring fire that goes before him, destroyes them in a moment. For they being taken in the act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion (as <hi>Cora</hi> and his Complices) divine justice shall not need to proceed against them in a formal way of trial, but the Earth, chapt with this Fire of the last Conflagration, cleaves asunder, opens her mouth and receives them with the dregs of the whole Creation into that Abyss, whither that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Fire, to which the Heaven and Earth that now are, are reserved, shall drive them. <hi>[Judicium quod est retributio pro peccatis, omnibus competit, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium quod est discussio meritorum solis fidelibus, nullo modo infidelibus nec An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis vel bouis vel malis:] (Aquinas sum. pa. 3. q. 89. art. 7, 8.) The Judgment of retribution appertains to all, the judgment of discussion to believers only, neither to Infidels nor Angels, either good or bad.</hi> The holiness of Elect Angels, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43715:244"/>
the impiety of Devils and Infidels is so notorious, as they need no discussion. He that believes not, is condemn'd already <hi>[Et quoniam de his sententia in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutionem]</hi> and cannot be absolv'd, and therefore they shall be destroyed from, not judged before Christs presence (saith <hi>Lactant. de divino praemio.</hi> 7. 20. They shall not stand in judgment <hi>(Psal.</hi> 1.) that is, of the general day, saith <hi>Aben Ezra [Nos juxta operum nostrorum mensuram judicabit, illos verò non ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicabit, sed arguet condemnatos,] (Jerom in Mic. c. 4.) We shall be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but Infidels God will not judge, but take them up short, as condemn'd already. [Ad judicium non veniunt nec Pagani, nec Haeretici, nec Judaei,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>(August. Serm. 38. de Sanctis) Neither Pagans, nor Hereticks, nor Jews, come into judgment; because it is written of them that they are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. [Alii judicantur &amp; pereunt, alii non judicantur &amp; pereunt: alii judicantur &amp; regnant, alii non judicantur &amp; regnant, &amp;c.] (Greg. Mag. moral 26.) Some are judged and perish,</hi> viz. <hi>the Goats of the Flock: some are not judged and perish,</hi> viz. <hi>they that are not of the Flock; some are judged and reign,</hi> viz. <hi>the sheep of the Flock: some are not judged and reign,</hi> viz. <hi>the Guardians of the Flock, Elect Angels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[Qui intrà Ecclesiam mali sunt, judicandi sunt &amp; damnandi; qui verò extrà Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam inveniendi sunt, non sunt judicandi sed tantùm damnandi (Isid.

After the Infidels are thus dispatcht (of the method of Gods proceeding with whom I know no Text in the whole Book of God that purposely and plainly speaks, but this of <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.) the great white Throne shall be erected, for the trial of such as have made Profession of worshipping the one God, through the seed of the Woman, or of embracing the Covenant of Grace in the various dispensations of it; the whole Flock of Christ, both Sheep and Goats, who shall have allowed them the benefit of the Book, (the Book of the Covenant) and be judged according to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace (implied by the white Throne.) <hi>[Fideles qui fuerunt saltem numero cives civitatis Dei; judicabuntur ut cives.] (Aquin.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43715:245"/>
the briskness of that Cup of Fury, with the sober Nymph, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of figurative Expositions: any farther, than to tame the killingness of the Letter, (its manifest either Iniquity or Impossibility) of which the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Exposition of these words which I give, are out of danger; for 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible enough that at the Resurrection of the unjust, when all the Infidels and excommunicate persons shall stand up out of the dust together, they will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the breadth of the Earth: the Wings of that Army, of Aliens from the Covenant of Grace, will reach North and South; and their Files be as deep, as from East to West; though they stand at no greater distance one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, than an Army in Battalia. It has been doubted by some, how so great a multitude could make their appearance together before the Judge; and therefore they have thought the judgment of the Heathen would take up a thousand years, while God called them one after another: but my <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> salves that doubt, without the help of such a subterfuge. However the raising of such doubts is an argument, that in common sence, there will be people enough, to fill the whole face of the Earth, saving that part of it that shall be railed in about the holy Mount. And that's an Argument, that the far greatest part of that Army must rise out of the Earth; for from whence else can so many be gathered, as shall cover the whole superficies of the Earth? <hi>(Caelum non habet unde cadat)</hi> and so many living together in a mortal state, would put the world into such a crowd, as might well excuse the Americans for seeking to enlarge their quarters. As for that other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>[as the sands on the Sea shore for multitude,]</hi> he that thinks it an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> may think it so still, for me, and without prejudice to my Position: for as it is manifest, that so many men as there are grains of sand upon the shore, would not have room to stand upon the Earth, and therefore (according to the caution I have given) we must fly to the Figurative sence here, the Literal being manifestly impossible, so all that I need affirm is this, that this Gogick and Magogick Army shall, for multitude, come as near the Sand on the Sea-shore, as an Army can do, that is pitched on the Earth.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Secondly, When Satan marcheth in the head of this Army, the Saints must be locally imbodyed: for it encompasseth the holy City, and the Camp of the Saints assembled, and <hi>in procinctu;</hi> into which posture how they could be drawn but by the summons of the last Trumpet is not conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: except we fancy that some lesser City and Assembly than the general of the Saints, shall be besieged by this General Army of Infidels: As the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> applies it to the Turks taking of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> whereas there is no mention, in the Text, of taking, but only of encompassing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City; in the act and attempt whereof, they are said to be destroyed, by Fire coming down from God out of Heaven. And though the Ottoman Family (the off-spring of the Lydians, who are called the People of <hi>Gog,</hi> from <hi>Gyges,</hi> their first King) or Scythians (stiled by <hi>Josephus Magogaei)</hi> might be a Type of St. <hi>John's Gogs</hi> and <hi>Magogs,</hi> encompassing the Camp of the Saints in their besieging <hi>Constantinople:</hi> yet as they did not in all points Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie this Gogick Army, so they did not in any one point Typifie it fully: not in multitude, for instance, for though the Ottoman Armies be very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet they are not comparable to the old Scythian Armies, under <hi>Tomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> nor the Lydian, under <hi>Gyges;</hi> much less to that Muster of this Army, which St, <hi>John</hi> brings in, and therefore, in that respect, cannot so much as be an Antitype of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> old <hi>Gog,</hi> much less the very <hi>Gog</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi> For Prophecies acquire strength in their motions towards a perfect accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Vespasian's</hi> sacking of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and captivating of the Jews, came higher up to the terms of the old Menacy, than that which was inflicted by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the Judgment of the last day will out-doc <hi>Vespasian's</hi> Desolation, and make up whatever that wanted of fulfilling every tittle of that Prophecy, which described those Judgements in Terms borrowed from the horror and greatness of this.</p>

Thirdly, It is the common Tenet of the Schools, that <hi>[Ignis ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae conflagrationis,]</hi> that Fire that shall refine and purge the Sublunary World, shall go before Christ when he comes to his Judgment-seat; and, by purging its dregs from the old, make a new Heaven and a new Earth wherein his white Throne shall be erected. <hi>[Quòd per ignem conflagrationis ultimae futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra sit elementorum purgatio, probatur: in Ps. dicitur, [in conspectu ejus ardebit ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,] &amp; posteà loquitur de judicio [advocabit caelum desursum &amp; terram dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernere populum suum,] 2 Pet. ult.

And therefore we must except, here, humane mortality (for that shall be removed by the resurrection of the dead, and the change of the living.)</p>
               <p>By the way, take notice that <hi>Thomas</hi> his <hi>[bonos probet]</hi> is a Popish No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, the dreggs of the School doctrine of purgatorie, brought in to doe that <hi>in instanti,</hi> which they fancy the fire of Purgatory to effect by degrees and in time.

But that which I observe, as truly Catholick, in the School Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning this last Conflagration, is, that this stream of Fire, that shall proceed out of the judges mouth, at his appearance, that flaming Fire wherein the Lord Jesus, when he shall be reveiled from Heaven with his mighty Angels, shall take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not his Gospel, (that is, Infidel-Jews and Gentiles.) 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7, 8. 9.) will deluge all those Infidels, and drive them and the Devil into the Abyss, or (in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> stile) shall punish them with everlasting destruction, from that presence of the Lord, and from that Glory of his power, wherein he shall appear, when he cometh to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.

It casts the whole Kingdom of Satan, all his profest Subjects, with its rowling waves into the uttermost Hell. But after that; the Angels gather whatsoever (upon trial) is found offensive, all the Tares in the Field of the Church, and shall cast them into it, after they have bound them in bundles. That at this Fiery appearance of Christ, at which the Saints shall lift up their heads, (they that are so indeed, confidently, and they that are so only by calling, hopefully; the first being assured of Heaven, the last not altogether despairing to receive Absolution:) For, <hi>[Aliud est ad veniam stare, aliud ad gloriam pervenire, aliud pendere in die judicii ad senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Domini, aliud statim a Domino coronari.] (Cyprian, ep. 52.

of time; not the first of the just, and the second of the unjust (as some men dream) but one of all men.</hi> This opinion (I say) I cannot subscribe to, as conceiving it to thwart the Assertion of Saint <hi>Paul, (1 Corin,</hi> 15. 23.) all shall be made alive in Christ: but every man in his own order; Christ the first fruits, then those that are Christs, at his coming, then the end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and (1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 16.) the dead in Christ shall rise first, first not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of those in Christ, that shall be alive, (for as we that are alive shall not prevent them that are asleep, so neither shall they that are asleep prevent us that are alive; seeing we shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, in a moment, in the same moment that they shall be raised, so that there will be no more <hi>prius &amp; posterius,</hi> betwixt us than is in a moment; neither can they whom that day finds alive rise at all.) But, first, in respect of them that are out of Christ; as the antients generally, and the best modern Expositors gloss upon these Texts. <hi>Musculus, [Non soli resurgent qui sunt Christi, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent omnes, sed ii primi. sic. 1 Thes. 4. mortui in Christo resurgent primum, post illas surgent &amp; reliqui.] Not only they that are Christs, but all, shall rise; but they that are in Christ shall rise first, and afterwards the rest, as the Apostle saith.</hi> St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> conceives St. <hi>Paul</hi> to give to them that are Christs both priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of time as to their Resurrection and change, and of place as to their trial and receiving of sentence: <hi>[Oportet namque ut aliquod habeant privilegium justi vel resurgendo; nam ut in aera obviàm Christo procedant rapiendi: ita &amp; primi à mortuis excitantur; quemadmodum contra &amp; peccatores in terra &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis inferioribus hisce judicem ut damnati operiuntur.] (Ex Christoferi translatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in 1 ep. ad Corin c. 15.) It is meet that the righteous should have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of rising before Infidels: for as they are snatcht up into the Air to meet Christ, so they also shall be first raised from the dead: whereas on the contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels as being damn'd already, shall wait for the judge upon earth, and these inferior places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Saints, though they rise before the Infidels, yet shall not be judged till the Devil and his Worshippers be cast into Hell, is the assertion of <hi>Tertullian, (de Resurrectione carnis cap. 25.) [Hîc ordo temporum sternitur—Diabolo in abyssum interim relegato, primae resurrectionis praerogativa de soliis or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinetur: dehinc &amp; igni data universalis Resurrectionis censuta de libris judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetur.] The order of time is here laid down. The Devil in the mean while being sent back again into the bottomless pit, the Prerogative of the first Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> (that is, their being gathered in the air to the place of Judgment) <hi>shall be put into order: and after that they are assembled, (the Fire of the last Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration having changed the world) the sentence shall pass out of the books upon them that rose first, that is, the Saints by calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these premisses it necessarily follows, That all the time that Satan hath allotted him, after his loosing, to go out again and tempt the World to Gentilism, to deceive the Nations after his old wont, is that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that small season that intervenes betwixt the general Resurrection of the Saints, and the Condemnation of Infidels; that short space, wherein the Saints shall, all in a body be waiting at the place of Judgment (whither the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels shall gather them) for the appearance of Christ. Against which <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> I cannot imagine what now can be excepted; but that it seems to suppose, that Infidels after their Resurrection shall be in a capacity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, contrary to the common, (and in my judgment the true) Opinion: that they will be then as they were since their dissolution, <hi>in termino.</hi> But there is no ground of such a suspicion in this case, as I state it: for I do not make their following Satan with their rebellious Arms, a contraction of new guilt (because it proceeds from that height of judicial obcecation, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice inflicts upon them, as their punishment) but an occasion of Gods justifying himself in their condemnation: (as that which speaks them, to have lived and died impenitent,) for all their willfull rebellions. I do not affirm, that God inflicts more punishment upon them, because of this, than what they had deserved before: but only takes the opportunity (of these
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43715:247"/>
Rebels being in Arms) to proceed against them, and to destroy them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as enemies. I cannot express my mind in more significant terms than those of <hi>Aquinas, (Sum. 3. q. 90. art. 7.) [Civcs judicabuntur ut cives, in quos sine discussione meritorum sententia mortis non feretur; sed infideles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnabuntur ut hostes qui consueverunt apud homines abs<expan>

               <p>That God may not keep his Citizens in suspence, and demurr the trial of their cause longer than need, he will not appear in his Glory, till his Rebels be all in arms; that so finding them, at his coming, in the Field, set in Battalia against his Subjects, he may cut them off at once.</p>
               <p>§ 7. I have but one Argument more, against the Chyliasts limitting the Saints Reign with Christ on Earth, to a precise thousand of years, to try the patience (as well as Judgment) of my Reader withal: to wit, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of the Authorities which they alledge for their Opinion. Of which I shall give but two Instances, because I would not quite tire my self or Reader.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They alledge the Authority of the Jewish Doctors, whereas the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenium</hi> they speak of, is the <hi>Septimum Millenarium</hi> (as <hi>Carpenter</hi> observes, in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Alcinous, pag.</hi> 322.) at the beginning whereof they think God will judge all men; and as Mr. <hi>Meed</hi> proves by several quotations <hi>(volume 2. pag.</hi> 667.) Now the seventh day thousand of years is confest by all to last to all Eternity, as being the holy Sabbath, wherein the Saints shall rest from their six days labour. And for any day of a thousand years long, before that, the antient Jews are wholly strangers: so they reckon the three Ages, before that, by two thousand of years apiece; two thousand before the Law, two thousand under the Law, and two thousand under the <hi>Messiah,</hi> before the eternal Sabbath: in which compute they intend not that any of those Ages shall be of so many precise years continuance; (if they do, they have foully mist it, in the two already past) neither do they mention any innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, after the giving of the Law; but the Age of the <hi>Messiah</hi> (that is to begin with their fifth <hi>Millenium</hi> from the Creation) and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of eternal rest, the seventh <hi>Millenium.</hi> So that if they, at any time, call the day of the <hi>Messias</hi> a thousand years, they mean by that number, about two thousand of precise years, that is, an indefinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How groundless then must be their building their Doctrine of a precise thousand upon those Texts, which the Jews first, and they from them alledge: for first, if they be sueh Texts, as the Jews do ground their <hi>Millenium</hi> upon, they cannot import a precise <hi>Millenium;</hi> that being more than the Jews conclude from them (and perhaps St. <hi>John</hi> might take up the Jewish use of that term, thinking none would be so simple, as to understand it in any other but that sence which their custome had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it:) and secondly, the Texts alledged imply not any precise number. I will instance in that which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> stands so much upon: <hi>Isa. 65. 28. The days of my people are us the days of a Tree,</hi> that is, the Tree of Life; as the Septuagint expounds it; and the Chaldee Paraphrase, (out of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 4.) he shall be like a Tree Planted by the concourse of Waters; <hi>i. e.</hi> those four streams that water'd the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where the Tree of Life was planted: this they rightly understand to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of the dayes of the <hi>Messias;</hi> but the Chyliasts misapply it to their thousand years, when they make this to be the resemblance, That, had <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> eaten of the Tree of Life before he fell, he should have lived a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years, before his Translation; but eating of the forbidden Tree he died
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43715:248"/>
in the day that he eat of it, that is, before the great day of a <hi>Millenium</hi> was expired.</p>
               <p>But first, <hi>Adam</hi> notwithstanding lived so near to a thousand years—(930) as makes the Divine Menacy (if that be all it imports) as good as ineffectual, and his returning to the dust so few years sooner, than he should have done, had he kept his innocency, so unproportionable to the severity of it, as speaks him in a manner to have sinned impune.</p>
               <p>And secondly, if we will choose rather to sit at Gods feet, than <hi>Gamaliel's</hi> and take his Comment, before the Glosses of those blind Hebrew Doctors; (to whom their own Scriptures are a Book sealed) we shall hear him teach, that that Tree was a Sacrament of a Life, not for a thousand years, but for ever, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. left the man put his hand to the Tree of Life and eat and live for ever. So that if I would single a Text out, for the probat of my As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, that the thousand years, (answerable to the life Typified by the Tree of Life) of the <hi>Messias</hi> Kingdom, shall be for ever, shall last as long as time, I could not pitcht upon one, that more clearly proves it, than this does (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Jewish application of it to the time of the <hi>Messias)</hi> which the Millenaries, from the Jewish Doctors application of it, alledge to prove a precise number of years.</p>
               <p>We see with how great absurdities, the limiting of the Saints Reign on Earth with Christ, to the precise time of a thousand years, is encumbred on all hands; whether we reflect on that Opinion, which presents these years as already run out; or on them, who to prevent those absurdities, assert the <hi>Millenium</hi> to be not yet begun, and fall into grosser absurdities. By which discourse we have gain'd that light to this Text, as presents that to be the mind of it, which is so much inculcated by the Old-Testament-Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> That after Satan is once bound up, by the Imperial Laws commanding for Christ, he shall never have power granted him, either to erect any new Sect of Gentilism (to introduce any new Gods, such as the Gentiles gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally before that, worship'd) into any part of the World; or to restore the old, into those parts, out of which it hath been ejected. In which state the world shall continue a thousand years, that is, for ever, a certain being put for an indeterminate time; than which there is no figure of speech more common, either in the Language of Scripture, or the Tongues of all men. During which period there shall be Christian Assemblies, Worshipping the one God through Christ, and thankfully commemorating the Martyrs that died for, and the Saints that died in, the Faith of Christ, so as they shall live again, in their blessed Memorials: and they that had been condemned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by the Pagan World, as irreligious Atheists. <hi>[Si quis impius, aut Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureus mysteriorum explorator accessit, discedat.]</hi> (Lucian Alexand.) <hi>If there be here present any prophane person or Christian, or Epicurean Sifter of sacred Rites)</hi> shall openly be proclaimed to live and reign with Christ, as the only truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious persons. But as for the rest of the dead, (the old Idolaters, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died either for, or in Gentilism) neither they nor the Idols whom they worship'd, shall ever be received again, or gain their ancient credit: but lye for ever under contempt; as they that are buried and out of mind, Satan, indeed, when that term is expired, that is, at the Resurrection of the Just shall be permitted to do his utmost, to tempt all the Idolatours that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, to own him, for their God, as he by whose power they were raised from the dead; and they will so far comply with him, and put their trust in him, as to march under his Banner against the whole Assembly of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, then gather'd to the place of judgment, and attending the appearance of Christ; who shall no sooner appear, but a Fire before him, and an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tempest round about, shall seize upon all the corruptible parts, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants (visible, and invisible) of the etherial, and earthly World; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and deluge the whole World of Infidels, as the world of the Gyants was formerly drown'd and purg'd by Water. And thus the wicked Idolaters and their Idols, <hi>(Margin. text. Mosora. in Psal. 1, [impii &amp; idola eorum non
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43715:248"/>
stabunt in judicio justorum.]</hi> not being able to stand in the judgement of the righteous, but receiving their judgment a part from them, by themselves, while they attempt to take the City of God (as those Gyants of old are feigned to have done) by force; Christ the judge will proceed to pass sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon all such, as can lay any claim to the benefits of the Gospel, the white Throne shall be erected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>§ 2. I Have been forc'd in the Explication of that part of this Prophecy, that is not yet fullfill'd, to larger excursions from my propounded Theme, then will stand with my Readers patience; or indeed with the Rules of Art; were it not that the right understanding of that, is a Key to unlock that part of it, that is fulfill'd: and the misapplication of either is a dangerous inlet to Atheisme, and a spawn of Infidelity; for when such Expositions and Applications of this Prophecy, as I have been opposing, are taken for the Word of God, upon the credit of their Authors, and found to make the time of the binding of Satan from deceiving the world, (after it hath been converted to Christianity) as he did under Gentilism, either to be past, or not yet come: who can be so short reason'd, as not to perceive how palpably St. <hi>John</hi> is hereby made to contradict the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: whose constant Song is this, that as the Light of the Gospel should arise, the Darkness of Paganism should vanish, and once vanish'd never come more to light. A truth so palpably experienc'd, as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> is driven to this confession [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] <hi>Since the time that Jesus began to be worship'd, no man has perceiv'd any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to be reap'd by the common Religion of the Gods (Euseb. praepar. Evan.</hi> 5. 1.) Whether in vindicating St. <hi>John</hi> from all suspicion of clashing with other, and elder, Prophets, and tuning his words into a consent with theirs, we have strained them from their most native sence, I leave to my Readers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while I press the present and manifest Effects of all Prophecies, upon this subject, upon the Atheists Conscience; as evidence of the infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending foreknowledge of the first Author of the Revelation of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of such pure Contingencies, so many Ages before they fell out: as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for Faith from Sence, his beloved <hi>Medium,</hi> through which only he will see Truth.

Let him inform himself of the present state of those Nations, which of old, when Israel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the God that made him, could not by any means be induc'd to forsake
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43715:249"/>
their No-God-Gods; whether all those Gods be not crept into holes, where the Light of the Gospel hath been communicated. Has there been any place for any of them, upon this upper Hemisphere? Are they not all descended into <hi>shades, ad inferos,</hi> as the Ancients call'd the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> since the Gospel made the one God known to it? hath any God been exalted, but the Lord alone, any where in all the earth, since it became the possession of Christ. If the Prophets (saith St. <hi>Austin de consensu Evang.</hi> 1 16.) in foretelling such great Changes to Fall, in the Christian Times, were deceived, how come their Prophecies so manifestly to be fulfill'd? And when we find, by the event, that they spake true, who can have the face to resist so clear a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of their being guided by an infallible Spirit.</p>
               <p>§ 2. But from these events is not only demonstrated the Omisciency of the Reveiler of those Prophecies, but the Omnipotency of him also, in bring<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing those things to pass. If he that foretold his own Reigning alone, were not the Omnipotent God; how comes he now to be alone worship'd, and all other Gods rejected? who can this God of Israel be, who was once so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known among the Gentiles, as they could not find him in that croud of Gods whom they then worship'd, but is now so well known, as, of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, he is alone worship'd? who can that God be who would not have any other God worship'd but himself; and whose will is of more force, to overturn the Temples; Altars, and Images of all other Gods, than all theirs to hinder the embracing of his Rites? Whereas the Gentile Gods were such tame fools, as they could endure to be rival'd by Gods of their own proclaiming: <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> himself induc'd <hi>Alexander</hi> into a belief that he was begotten by a God, and should share with him in divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, <hi>(Diodor. Sicul. Bibl. l. 17. p.</hi> 550.) Must not he be the All-knowing God, whose Prophets, not only answer'd those that consulted them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present emergencies, but being not consulted, foretold, so long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, those strange and unlook'd for changes, concerning whole Humane kind and all Nations, which we now read and see: Must not he be the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerful God who hath brought to pass what he foretold; to wit, that the Romans and all Nations should, by means of the Gospel, be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in one only God, and overthrow the Images, and discard the Worship of their Fore fathers Gods?</p>

Sure it concern'd the Gentile World, not to suffer such Oracles to have been spilt upon the ground as water, but to have preserved them in everlasting Tables, which they might have hung forth, upon the Pillars of their Temple, to affront the Oracles of the God of Israel, and to have born up the Spirits of Idol-worshippers, sinking under those burthens, which Gods Prophets saw against false Gods: whom according to their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, we have seen broken to pieces like a Potters vessel, with the Iron-rod of that Son of God, whom he hath set up as King upon the Hill of <hi>Sion;</hi> to whom he hath given the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for his possession: Who coming out of his Chamber as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, (that is, <hi>[Conjugatum carni humanae Verbum processit de útero virgina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,] August. de consens. 1. 16. the Word Married to humane flesh came out of the Virgins Womb.)</hi> Rejoyceth, as a Giant, to run his course; not only from one end of the Hemisphere unto the other (as they would bound Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom who exclude <hi>America</hi> from the hopes of it) but from one end of the Heaven to the other: and (if that be not plain enough) nothing is hid from the heat thereof; not any part of the round World, that the corporeal Sun visits. Mankind receives the cherishing warmth of its Beams; and basks it self in that Fountain of Light. The Serpent feels their scorching heat, and flees therefrom. <hi>[Et adhuc isti fragiles contradictiunculas garrientes eligunt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis isto igne, sicut stipula in cinerem verti, quam sicut aurum à sorde purgari?] And, will the crazy-headed Sceptick yet chatter and gaggle out his petit and bublie Exceptions, which break with the least touch, with the gentlest blast? and choose rather to be consumed to ashes in this fire, as stubble, than to be purged by it from his dross, as Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. Or is he of so thick-skin'd a Soul, as not to feel the heat of Christs Divinity, in those Prophetick Rayes, emitted from his Spirit, before he came in the Flesh; as not to conceive that the accomplishments of Old Testament-Prophecies, is a demonstration, not only of their own, but of the Gospels Divine Original: which can be the Workmanship of none other Architect, but of him who drew the Model and <hi>Idea</hi> of these new Heavens, that new Creation, that new face of things, which we see produc'd in the Age of Christianity. Humane Wit indeed might have drawn another Model per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly resembling that, might have fram'd an History parallel to Prophecy. (though they that could make the Counter-part, so exactly answer the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and write so perfectly after the Copy, as the Apostles have, must be Persons of a steady Hand; excellently composed Spirits, and solid Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore all the Inference we drew, in our Second Book, from the Apostles proportioning every Limb and Line of their Story to the Old Testament-Draught, was, that they had thereby demonstratively acquitted themselves from all suspicion of being themselves deluded.) But it is out of the reach of Humane power, to bring the Matters, there prophesied of, unto Birth, the erecting of the Structure it self; the production of what was fore-told into real existence, cannot be the Effect of any, but of him alone, who hath as great an Infinity of Power, to bring to pass, as he hath of knowlege to foresee them.</p>
               <p>And therefore having proved, the Truth of what the Apostles reported, that what they say was done, in order to the accomplishment of Prophecy, was done indeed; he must be a person of very short Reason, that from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Premisses, cannot improve the Conclusion, and draw this Inference. That as nothing but Omnisciency could foresee, so nothing less
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43715:250"/>
than Omnipotency could effect, That a Virgin should bring forth a Son, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally so mean, as those, among whom he convers'd, saw so little comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in him, as they Crucified him, (as an Impostor, for saying he was the Son of God, the King of the Jews, that <hi>Messia</hi> promised in the Law, and so much predicated by the Prophets) and yet really so full of Majesty, as he is become King of Kings, hath subdued the World to his Obedience, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd all the Gods of the Nations, and erected every where the Worship of that one God, that made Heaven and Earth: that God of whom <hi>Moses</hi> writes, known formerly only in <hi>Jewry;</hi> but now no where less known than among the Jews; they being the greatest strangers to their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and their Fathers God being the greatest stranger to them; of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the face of the Earth.</p>
               <p>§ 4. But that I may not put the Sceptick to the expence of all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he hath, and that he may not think it is through penury of New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-prophecies, that I pitch upon those of the Old: and that he may grope out the Divinity of the Blessed Jesus, in some palpable accomplishments of the Predictions he made in person, as well as by Proxy: I shall here mind him of this Note.</p>
               <p>That Christ espoused all the Old Testament-prophecies, commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, applied them, and not only attested the coming to pass of what the Prophets had foretold, in general; but, as it were individuated those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, by more particular and punctual Circumstances, not so much as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by them of old: and appeal'd to their accomplishment, in that way, and with those Circumstances, wherewith he cloath'd them: The prophets gave only the rough draught of what Christ drew to the life; he lickt their rude Lumps into so distinct and explicite forms; as the Prophecies became his own: his Gleanings were more than their Vintage: To instance in one for all, Christ, in his Prophecy of the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> referrs to <hi>Daniel</hi> (when you shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by <hi>Daniel)</hi> thereby appealing to its accomplishment, as that which he was content to stand or fall by, as to mens belief that he was the <hi>Messias:</hi> as if he had said, if you see it not within the Term of <hi>Daniels</hi> Weeks, within so many years after my offering an Attonement for sin, as <hi>Daniel</hi> states it, after the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Messias,</hi> believe me, not that I am he. But withal he leaves it not in such curious Calculations as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, but what he had writ in figures, Christ transcribes in words at length; and applies it to that Generation, with that perspicuity, and in such particularities, as an Historian can scarce tell what has been done more punctually, than Christ foretells what should be done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the time of its taking Effect: <hi>there be some</hi> (saith he) <hi>standing here, that shall not tast of Death, till all these things shall be fulfill'd;</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, St. <hi>John</hi> shall tarry till Christ come to avenge himself on the Jewish Nation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Instruments to be employed by Christ, for the destruction of their place and Nation, he describes them by their Banners, the Eagles, under which the Roman Legions, those Birds of prey, march'd, when divine Justice conducted them into <hi>Judaea,</hi> that they might flesh themselves upon that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whose Inhabitants (their sins being ripe) were as Carcasses fatted and prepared for them; signified (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> thinks) by that prodigy of a Dog bringing to <hi>Vespasian</hi> a dead mans hand, as if that Dog had set the Game for the Roman Eagles, and had wagg'd his tail before <hi>Judaea,</hi> as the place where the Carcasses (their prey) lay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the Deliverance of the believing Jews: in the Mountainous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Judaea,</hi> whither Christ warned them to flee when they should see the Roman Standards advancing towards <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> or at <hi>Pella,</hi> whither those that had not understood Christs direction repaired, after that voyce was heard in the Temple <hi>[migremus Pellam;] Let us march to Pella,]</hi> or into

whatsoever by-places or holes of the Rock, the Dove of Christ had betaken her self, till that indignation was over past. There was not one Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> when <hi>Titus</hi> laid siege to it, they being all removed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opportunity which Providence offer'd them by <hi>Gallus</hi> his suddain rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the siege some moneths before: <hi>(Euseb. hist. 3. 5. ex Josepho:)</hi> And being put in mind of Christs direction, a little before the Ruin of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the Prodigies reported by <hi>Josephus,</hi> and foretold by Christ. Such as mens not attending to them, mens not believing them to be signes and fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the approach of Divine Vengeance, neither <hi>Josephus</hi> a Jew, <hi>(Josep. de Bel. Jud.</hi> 7. 12.) nor <hi>Tacitus</hi> an Heathen, <hi>(Tacit. hist.</hi> 5.) can impute to any thing else, than Gods dementating that people, whom he meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy: A Starr in the form of a Sword brandishing it self a whole year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether over <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> a light shining, for the space of half an hour, about the Altar and Temple, at nine of the clock at night, while the people were assembled to celebrate the Feast of unleavened bread, (then falling on the eighth of <hi>April)</hi> so bright as one would have thought it the light of the clearest day. There were signs in the Air: they had some nearer hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet. The same day of unleavened bread an Heifer as she was led to be sacrificed, brought forth a Lamb in the midst of the Temple; could any thing more significantly shew, that the Legal Sacrifice, about to die, had left the Lamb for its heir: the first part of which Lesson was bellowed out to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> by that Ox that came into his Pavilion, and fell prostrate at his feet, pointing him out as the man at whose feet the Mosaical Sacrifices were to fall.</p>
               <p>The East-gate of the Inner Temple of Massie Brass, so heavy as twenty men could scarce shut it, being made fast over-night with iron Locks and strong Bolts, was seen at the sixth hour of the night, to open of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: of which Accident the Magistrate being inform'd, by the Keepers of the Temple, goeth up to the Temple, and with much ado got it shut again. This, though the ignorant and interessed party expounded it in favour of the Jews, yet the wiser sort (saith <hi>Josephus)</hi> understood it to presage, that the Temple wherein they trusted would, as it were by the instinct of that God who dwelt in it, deliver it self up into the enemies hands; and <hi>Rabban Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> by name; applyed to this Prodigy, that Text of <hi>Zachary, Open thy doors, oh Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy Cedars;</hi> of the truth of which he was so confident, as he caused his Scholars to carry him forth, as a dead Corps, upon a Bier, and by that means made his escape to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Lightfoot, (Harmony pag.</hi> 182.) tells the Story from <hi>R. Nathan:</hi> A few dayes after this Feast, <hi>May</hi> 21. appeared a Sign beyond belief (saith <hi>Josephus)</hi> but that those who saw it are yet alive, and such desolations followed, as were worthy to be usher'd in by such presages: Before Sun-set, were seen Chariots to be driven in the Air, and armed Bands sallying through the Clouds, and beleaguering the City. And on the Feast of Pentecost following, the Priests going after their custome into the Inner Temple to officiate, perceived, at first, a kind of rustling and confused noise; and after that, heard a suddain voice, saying, <hi>Lets depart hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these prodigies <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes mention, <hi>(Hist. 5.)

               <p>Fourthly, as to the miseries accompanying this Desolation falling, through the extremity of the Famine, most heavily upon Women with Child; that laying siege to two lives in one body, and on such as gave suck; they being in perpetual fear, either to have their little ones taken away from them (to relieve the hungar-starv'd Soldier) or to be forc'd themselves, either to pine them at their dry Breast, or to bury in their Stomack the fruit of their Womb: of the completion of which <hi>Josephus,</hi> an Eye-witness, gives us sad examples, <hi>(de Bel.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43715:251"/>
that rowled in upon that people of Gods Curse, it was a very signal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, saith <hi>Isidor. Pelus. (lib. 4. ep.</hi> 75.) that God stirred up a Jew, and one zealous of their Law and Traditions, to communicate to the World those Tragical disasters, which befell that People, at such time as Christ had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take vengeance of them, for those Narratives do so far exceed all Example, as they could not possibly have found credit, if they had been reported by a stranger, or by any other person than such an one as <hi>Josephus,</hi> who thus describes the extremity of the Famine: An infinite number died through hunger, 'tis inexpressible how many fell, either through the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Famine, or by striving to relieve themselves against it: you might see men at Daggers drawing in every house, where was the least mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Meat or crum of Bread; the dearest friends snatching victuals out of one anothers mouths, and rifling the bosoms of them that were a dying. You might see men in a rage (through disappointment of their prey, which they sought in desolate places) run like rabid Dogs up and down the City, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice or thrice over in the same house, and through want of better food greedily feeding on such things as the most fordid Brutes abhorr, sparing neither Girdles, nor Shooes, nor the Leather upon their Targets; esteeming the Orts of Hay so great a dainty, as a small quantity of it was sold at four Attiques; to stuff their craving bellies; buying at any rate the stuffing of Padds, Saddles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay so lamentable were the afflictions that came upon that People, and especially by Famine, as <hi>Josephus</hi> protests he could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have passed over the mention of them, for fear that Posterity should account him a Liar; but that he had many Eye-witnesses to attest them, and might seem, perhaps, to disregard and overlook the afflictions of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, if he should lightly touch their heavy sufferings; being some of them such as were never felt either by Greeks or Barbarians, things horrible to speak, incredible to hear: Of which I shall only mention one particular story, of one <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> a wealthy Matron, and of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family; who flying to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (moving counter to Christs direction) was there, among the many thousands, that upon the occasion of the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, were at that time in the City, when the Romans lay siege to it, coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; and being by the rude Souldiers plunder'd of her goods, and at last of all provision for the Belly: she takes her child and (saying to him, poor Child thou must be meat for me: a Fury to fright those sedicious Zealots, who have brought us to this extremity; and a Fable to all posterity) sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him, to the asswaging of her hunger; and at one meal devours one half of him, reserving the remainder till the strong man that breaks stone walls, should return again so arm'd, as to force her to break the bonds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Female delicacy once more; but she was prevented of the second Course of that Thiestean Banquet, by Souldiers (that had got the scent of it) breaking in upon her, and threatning her with death, if she did not bring forth and present to their eye that roast-meat which they had the smell of in their Noses. The wretched woman sets before them the reliques of her Babe, bids them fall too, if they had an appetite: but if they were more nice than a Matron, more pittiful then a Mother, they might be wellcome to leave it for her, to sustain her loathed life with. Of which and the like Immanities <hi>Titus</hi> being inform'd, made a solemn appeal to the Gods, that they, whom his Clemency could not induce to accept of Peace, and an Act of Oblivion, by him offer'd, were worthy to feed on such cates; protesting he would bury this abominable fact in the ruines of the Country where it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and not leave that City standing, for the Sun to behold, where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fed on so detestable food.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of that degree and measure of the Wrath that was then to be poured out upon that Place and People of Gods Curse, according to the Predictions of Christ, that it should be levell'd with the ground; not have one stone left upon another; be an utter and perpetual desolation, if I would give a punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Account; I must transcribe all <hi>Josephus</hi> his Books of the Jewish Wars,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43715:251"/>
whose Theme that is; and a great part of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his fifth Book of Histories, I therefore referr my Reader to those Authors, whose Relations, if he compare with Christs Predictions, he will find them accomplish'd in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And as to that Cities never being able to this day to obtain a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from those Ruines, wherein <hi>Titus</hi> buried it; Infidelity it self need no other proof, than ocular Demonstration, nor can require a better reason, why it has not so much as been attempted for above this thousand years, than the frustration of <hi>Julians</hi> purpose to rebuild it, (meerly to affront Christs Predictions) of which <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> an Heathen Historian gives this account, <hi>(lib. 23. initio.)

The care of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this work is committed by</hi> Julian <hi>to</hi> Alypius <hi>of</hi> Antioch, <hi>who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been the Deputy-governour of Britain.</hi> Alypius <hi>therefore setting amain upon the rebuilding of this Temple, and the Governour of the Province assisting him; dreadful Balls of fire breaking out and squibbing about the foundation, and many times burning the labourers made the place inaccessible: and the Element thus obstinately resisting, the place it self peremptorily rejecting the stones which were laid upon it, as refusing to bear such a structure, the enterprise was given over.</hi> And no man ever since hath been so fool hardy as to put his hands to that work which burnt the fingers of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Labourers.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Oh <hi>Jerusalem, Jerusalem!</hi> How art thou faln from Heaven! God was thy wall of Fire once, to burn up them that besieged thee; but he sent now, Balls of Fire, to consnme those that would have rebuilt thee. Who would have believed that this would have befaln thee and thy children, when thy rejected Christ dropt his Tears, and with them, those Predictions upon thee, which we now see fulfill'd! What Sign was there, in Reason, or Nature, or Politicks, of this thy fatal <hi>Catastrophe?</hi> didst thou ever lift thy cloud threatning head higher above, or cast a more supercilious look upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> than when Christ from thence, facing the sumptuousness of thy building, and the Ornaments of thy goodly stones, pronounc'd this fatal Sentence against thee? Thou wast then adorn'd with Donatives sent thee from <hi>Caesar</hi>'s houshold, honour'd with dayly Sacrifices offer'd, at <hi>Caesars</hi> cost, and by his appointment, on thy Altar to the most high God, who dwelt between thy Cherubims. <hi>Philo Jud. (legat ad Caium)</hi> tells, how high the Jews were in <hi>Augustus</hi> his favour, in particular, a great part of the trans-Tiberine City was possest by Jews, who were allowed their proseucha's there; and permitted to send their first fruits and offerings to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> whither most of <hi>Caesars</hi> family sent gifts, which remain (saith <hi>Philo)</hi> to this day, where <hi>Augustus</hi> commanded Sacrifices to be offered at his own charges to the most high God for the Emperours health, which custom (saith he) continueth to this day, and will for ever continue as a Monument of his Royal virtues; (he proved a false prophet in this, but in what follows he is a true Historian.) He appointed the Jews, at <hi>Rome,</hi> to have their share of the monthly largesses of corn and mony, and if the day of distribution happen'd on the Sabbath, he order'd, the Jews should have their shares the day following. These privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were continued to them during the reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> notwithstanding the spight of <hi>Sejanus</hi> against the Jews.</p>

                  <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whose ears were always open to their Complaints, against their own Deputies; whose greatest friends at Court could not procure their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if thy peoples Legates made motion for their removal out of Office.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Sacrilegious Pride would prophane thee, by affronting the divine presence with his own Image; it was no greater an indignity, than he put upon the Temples of his own Gods; and what they wanted, thou found, an <hi>Agrippa</hi> to intercede for thee, and a Petronius to suspend the execution of the Imperial Decree against thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claudius</hi> banish'd thy Children from the Roman Suburbs: but it was for their contempt of thy holiness; for daring to abuse the piety of Roman Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons towards thee; for diverting to their proper use the presents and rich donatives, which the proselytes of thy religion committed to their hands, to conveigh to thee: he vindicated thy honour, upon thy bastard Sons, not their crime, with thy ruine: as he did that of the Priests of <hi>Isis,</hi> at the same time: he left thy walls standing, and thy Religion free, and under the care of thy most indulgent foster-father King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> one of his greatest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites.</p>
               <p>Thy Clients under <hi>Nero</hi> found that favour in the Imperial Court (by means of his Wife <hi>Poppaea</hi> a zealous Votary to thy Religion) as they obtain'd a Decree, for the Demolishing of that Tower, which the Roman President had erected, to out-face thy holy of holies. Yea, by <hi>Poppaea</hi>'s interest in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s affection (so great, as to gratifie her jealousie (that the Womb that bare him corrival'd <hi>Poppaea,</hi> and had a greater share of <hi>Nero</hi>'s love, than she would spare from her self) that womb must be ripped up.) So benign an aspect did his Reign, (malevolent to all other) cast upon thy Children, as they were thinking once to have added twenty Cubits to thy height, and dimensions to those parts of thy Foundations that had proved too slender to bear that weight of magnificence, <hi>Herod</hi> had laid upon them, <hi>(Joseph. antiq.</hi> 15. 14.</p>
               <p>Under the Monster of men, the Bane of the World, thou makes shew of rising to greater renown, and when thy Children waxed so wanton, under the Indulgence of the Empire, as to kick against its Majesty (as I have seen children, when they are strutted with the Milk, Play with the Breast, till their scratching it procures them a Motherly blow) and play with its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to call for stroaks. Good God' what gentle correction was designed for them: <hi>Vespasian</hi> (the Love and Darling of Mankind, he who counted that day lost wherein he perform'd not some office of Humanity) is the Rod that's laid upon their back, the Empire takes up an handful of Marsh-rushes, to chastise her Rebels with; was she like to draw blood with such a Rod? Could the stroak of so soft an hand have caused blewness, much less Mortality of wounds, had not the vengeance of Heaven gangren'd the place? Could that gentle silk twine have pull'd down thy Towers, that Lambs Horn have pusht down thy walls, had they not been secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the unseen power of that Sentence Christ had past upon thee?</p>
               <p>Ask thy Neighbours, the Chaldeans, whether they could observe any Signes of thy Ruine among those Lights, God had plac'd in the Firmament to be Signs. That book was never more studied by the Eastern Astrologers than in that age, when the expectation of the arising of the Star of <hi>Jacob</hi> (that bright Morning-star) had put the whole East into as passionate a Contest who should see it first, as that betwixt the seven Princes of <hi>Persia,</hi> who hung forth the Imperial Crown, as his prize, whose Horse should first Neigh after the Sun was up. And for nothing more was that Book then studied, than to know the Fortunes of thy Children, when and where that person was to be born, who was to be King of the Jews; that thy King whose Star three of the <hi>Magi</hi> saw; but to the rest it appeared not. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had there been any sign, in any of the Heavenly Houses, of thy Ruine;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43715:252"/>
they would certainly have discovered it, whose eyes were then so intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Heavenly Volume, on purpose that they might there read thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, but in vain shouldst thou solicit the wisest of them; the rising of the Sun of Righteousness, which neither thou nor they observed, was the only Sign was given thee; that Sign of <hi>Jonas,</hi> his coming out of the Whales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly, the Bowels of the Earth, after he had been three dayes and three nights therein buried; that Sign thou mightst have known (if thou would) when time was: but now, that and all other Signs, of Christs coming against thee, are concealed from thee. And as vain am I in discoursing with thee, whose head layes so low in the dust, as thou canst not hear me. Nor have I more to say to my Reader upon this Argument for the divine Original of our Religion; but only,</p>

First, that he would weigh, not only the strength of the Argument but the Modesty of Religion, in her begging no more of the Sceptick <hi>pro concesso,</hi> than what <hi>Cartesius</hi> himself begs, and hath granted him without all dispute, as a Ground of his Philosophical Discourse; all he begs is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this Proposition, <hi>[Cogito, ergò sum]</hi> All that she begs, for the probat of her Author, is the consequence of this <hi>[praecogito, ergò praesum.]</hi> And if Thinking be an indisputable evidence of Being, Fore-thinking must be as good an evidence of Fore-being. If finite Cogitation will prove fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being, then infinite Precogitation will prove an infinite Fore-being, if the Argument <hi>à Conjugatis</hi> be of any force. And by what evidence can a Philosopher prove to another that himself thinks (without the proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no man is bound to believe that he is) by the like whereto it may not be proved, that there is an Eternal Fore-thinking Being. If he present me with a well framed Poem, or Oration, or some exquisite piece of Art; I should conclude, that his thoughts were not a wool-gathering, while he composed them; but is this any whit more evident, than that he must be all mind, who has form'd so excellent and comly a piece as the World is, which the Grecians therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it is so beautiful and of so exact a Symmetry of parts.</p>
               <p>Nay, (to speak properly) no man can prove that he thinks, but only that he hath thought: for the <hi>Medium,</hi> he proves it by, must be the Effect of thinking: be it a wise Word, or Action, before either of them can come to the knowledge of another person, the thinking which fram'd them, is past and gone. But God, by Prophecy, giveth us fore knowledge of his fore-knowledge, before the Effect thereof take place, and during that intervall, exposeth himself to the Censure of the World, giving us a larger time to think of his forethinking, and to ponderate the infiniteness of it, and to arm our selves against delusion, than we may with good manners, expend in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing the thoughts of men. And by this means we are render'd more expedite to judge thereof, when the Event falls out, than we can be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other kind of humane thoughts, but such as are employ'd in framing Prognostications; the sufficiency whereof any Child may judge of, when the time is come when the Effect should follow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to this Argument for the divine Authority of Scripture, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration will add no small weight; That All the Old Testament-Prophecies, according to their several times of accomplishment, have been fullfill'd to a Tittle in their Evangelical sence: but in any other sence thats put upon them, are a pack of as palpable Untruths as ever were asserted. Not one of them wants its mate, as we apply them to the blessed Jesus, and the things appertaining to his Kingdom. But they are barren of Effect, and most of them past Child-bearing, if they have not brought forth allready those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which the Christian Church fathers upon them. If their <hi>Messias</hi> be not already exhibited, he can never be exhibited in that place, at that time, and with such other Circumstances, as the Prophets assign. The Temple which he was to fill with Glory, is demolish'd; the Polity, during the standing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43715:253"/>
whereof <hi>Shilo</hi> was to come, is dissolv'd; the Weeks, within the compass whereof, <hi>Messias</hi> was to make attonement for sin; at the end whereof, desolation was to come in like a flood, are long since expired. The Idols, which at the appearance of his glorious Majesty were to creep into holes, are already exterminated from off the face of this Earth: so that if he has not already appeared, it is impossible that at his appearance he should find any Gentile Idols to abolish from off this Earth, and from under those Heavens which the Prophet pointed at, and taught the Jews to point at, during the Babilonian Captivity, in making this profession, <hi>Jer. 10. 11. Thus shall ye say unto them, the Gods shall perish from under those Heavens;</hi> that is, which are over <hi>Chaldea.</hi> Let the Atheist search if he can find in all that Tract one Heathen Idol.</p>

VVE have seen the Prints of incomprehensible Wisdom upon the Creatures, and thence demonstrated the Being of a God: we have seen the like impresses upon the Sacred Scriptures, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that God to be the Author of them, who contrived the Universe. The next demonstration of a Deity is the impressions of infinite Power stampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Works; those Rhetorical Figures sprinkled in the Book of Providence, which render the Contents of it more illustrious, the divine Eloquence of it more august and specious: For as in humane speech, the moderate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent aspersion of new and unusual words add a splendour to it; so Miracles add a grace to the divine Eloquence and an Emphasis to that discourse, God entertains the World with, while he speaks to it by the Dumb Creature. <hi>[Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut humana consuetudo verbis, ità divina potentia etiam factis loquitur; &amp; si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut sermone humano, verba nova, vel minus usitata, moderate, &amp; decenter asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, splendorem addunt: ita in factis mirabilibus, quodammodo luculentior est di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina eloquentia.] (August. ep. 49. quest. 6.)</hi> In which strain the God of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, the Father of the blessed Jesus, hath as far out-stript all other pretenders to Divinity and Authors of Religions; as the Feates of the Artillery Garden are exceeded, by the wisest Stratagems of the greatest Captains; the products of a Wheel-wright, by <hi>Archimedes</hi> his Engines; A blind mans catching an Hare by chance, by the success and Achievements of <hi>Diana</hi> and her Quire of Huntresses: or, <hi>Don Quixots</hi> Windmill engagements, by the Exploits of <hi>Caesar;</hi> or the Sorcerers Serpents, by that of <hi>Moses;</hi> which if we compare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we shall find the stupendious Effects wrought by the Heathen Gods, to have been,</p>
               <p n="1">1. So few as an hundred of those Deities may be allowed to club for the production of one Miracle: though no greater than the swelling of a Lake, while the Romans besieged the <hi>Vejentes, [Exoptatae victoriae iter miro prodigio Dii immortales patefecerunt.] (Val. Max.</hi> 1. 6. 3.) a multitude of Gods are fain to joyn hands to open this light door; What is this in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the way through the red Sea? No less than two durst venture to cast the scales, at the Regil-lake, on the Romans hands, when their Army
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43715:253"/>
and the Tusculancs were so equally pois'd, as neither would give one foot back. It was as much as two of them could do, and (that on horse back,) to bring <hi>P. Vatinius</hi> word to <hi>Rome,</hi> in a whole day, of King <hi>Perses</hi> his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, in <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Briefly, put together all the miracles, that Authors of any credit have father'd; upon all their Gods, or have reported to have been done in their names: and the Miracles wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> alone in the Name of the God of Israel, to prove that he was his Messenger, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by Christ alone, in his own Name and Person, to prove that he was the eternal Son of Israels God: the Miracles wrought by St. <hi>Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, in the name of Christ, to prove his Masters Resurrection, and his own Delegation, will far out-vie them. Nay, the after gleaning of Christs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, I mean those which were wrought at the Memories of Martyrs, as low as the third and fourth Centuries, are more than the whole Vintage of Pagan Prodigies; deposited in Authors of undoubted credit, as in <hi>Barnes (Cypriani tract. 1. cont. Demetrianum) [O si audire eos velles &amp; videre, quando à nobis adjurantur &amp; torquentur spiritualibus flagris &amp; verborum tormentis de ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessis corporibus ejiciuntur: quando ejulantes &amp; gementes voce humanà &amp; pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state divina flagella &amp; verbera sentientes, venturum judicium confitentur. Veni &amp; cognosce esse vera quae dicimus. Et quia sic Deos colere te dicis, vel ipsis quos co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis crede, aut si volueris &amp; tibi credere, de teipso loquetur audiente te, qui nunc tuum pectus obsedit, qui nuno mentem tuam ignorantiae nocte caecavit. Videbis nos rogari ab eis, quos tu rogas, timeri ab eis, quos tu times, quos tu adoras: vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis sub manus nostras stare vinctos, &amp; tremere captivos quos tu suspicis &amp; veneraris ut dominos. Certe vel sic confundi in istis erroribus tuis poteris, cùm conspexeris &amp; audieris Deos tuo's, quid sint, ad interrogationes nostras statim prodere &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentibus licèt vobis praestigias &amp; fallacias suas non posse caelare.</hi> So plentifully was this sweet and powerful savour of the Ointment of Christs Name pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, in the Age of St. <hi>Austin;</hi> as that Learned Father, having (in his Book <hi>de vera Religione)</hi> given Reasons, why Miracles were not then so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as formerly, lest he might thereby be understood to deny that the Church retain'd the gift of Miracles in his time: upon second thoughts, dares not commit that Tractate to the hands of Posterity, without this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversion upon it (in the unparallel'd Books of his Retractations, <hi>(lib. 1. cap.</hi> 13.) I argued indeed (saith he) in that Book (of the true Religion) that the Pagans had no reason to expect Miracles now: but I never affirmed, that no miracles are wrought now; for, even then when I writ that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, I knew a blind man who was cur'd at <hi>Millain,</hi> and several others: nay there are now so many Examples of the like miraculous Cures wrought in these times, as I cannot possibly know them all; and yet I know more than I am able to reckon up. And the same Father <hi>(epist.</hi> 137.) tells us, that at the memory of St. <hi>Felix</hi> at <hi>Nola,</hi> Miracles were then so usually wrought by Invocation of Christs Name, as he purposed thither to send <hi>Boniface,</hi> (a Priest of his Church) and one who accused him of Incontinency; the one firmly attesting, the other as peremptorily denying; conceiving that though in <hi>Africa,</hi> where no Miracles were wrought. (A thing which he wonders at, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Climate abounded more with Religious persons, than <hi>Italie;</hi> and I wonder as much at his wondring; for that which he alledges as the reason of his astonishment, was the reason of the thing he admires, and therefore should have put a stop to it, because <hi>Italy</hi> swarm'd more with Pagans than those parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> therefore was that power of working Miracles continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there; Tongues, and all other supernatural Gifts, being not for those that believe, but for Infidels.) One of them might persist in their lie against Conscience: yet that the reverence of the very place, where the power of Christ had been so manifestly seen, would extort from them the confession of the Truth. To which he was encouraged, by what had happen'd at <hi>Millan,</hi> in the like case; where a Thief, who strongly denyed he was guilty of a Theft that was laid to his charge; when he came to the Church, there to swear in the presence of that God, in whose Name so many Miracles had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43715:254"/>
been wrought in that very place, durst not swear as he had boasted he would, but confessed the Fact, and restored the goods he had stoln. Before I close this point, I will give one Instance more, of the multitude of Miracles wrought, for the Conversion of one peevish Heathen, reported by this great Light of the Church, who for Learning, Judgment, and Integrity, deserves more credit, than the whole Tribe of Pagan Scriblers, who (in his 67. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) gives this account of the Conversion of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> the <hi>Architheater.</hi> It was not like that this mans stiff neck would be bowed, nor his petulant Tongue tamed without a Prodigie; It pleased God therefore to smite his only and exceedingly beloved Daughter, with a dangerous sickness, of whose recovery, without Miracle, he despairing, implores the aid of Christ, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing if he might see his Daughter restor'd, he would embrace the Christian Faith, his request is granted, his Daughter recovers, but he procrastinates the payment of his vow: he hath not long seen her restored to health, when Christ retracts the benefit, and strikes him blind. He vows, the second time, to become a Christian, if he might recover his sight: he obtains his sute, regains his sight, and sets forward toward the receiving of Baptism: but they could not get him to learn the Creed, till he is surprized with such a Palsey, as deprives him of the use of his Tongue: upon this he betakes himself to his Pen, and writes the Confession of his former Hypocrisie, and subscribes to the Confession of the Christian Faith: upon which he is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the use of his Tongue, and to perfect health. I am perswaded, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an impartial search, here are more indications of a Supernatural power made out, for the conversion of this one man, than ever God permitted all the Heathen Daemons to shew, in proof of all false religions: Of which perswasion I make no question but my Reader will be, by that time he hath well weighed this example, and studied an Answer to that Question of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius: To what purpose is it for the Defenders of the Pagan Impiety to shew one, or perhaps two, cured by</hi> Esculapius, <hi>when none of their Gods relieve so many millions, and all their Temples are throng'd with wretched, and unhappy Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who tire</hi> Esculapius <hi>himself with their Prayers, and invite him with their most miserable vowes to help them. [Quid prodest ostendere unum vel alterum fortasse curatos, cum tot millibus subvenerit nemo, &amp; plena sint omnia miserorum infeliciúmque, delubra? qui</hi> Aesculapium <hi>ipsum precibus fatigare, &amp; invitare miserrimis votis.] (Arnobius.)</hi> And that by that time I have laid down the rest of the differences, betwixt those which occur in prophane Authors, and those reported in the Sacred Scriptures,</p>
               <p>§. 2. 2. For as to the Miracles reported to have been wrought by the God of Israel (or by his servants in his name and power) they are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the greatest Evidence of Truth, that matters of Fact are capable of, (as hath already been demonstrated.)</p>
               <p>But the Prodigies, said to be done in confirmation of Paganism, labour under the burden of a very great suspicion, that they are (most of them) lying Miracles. Not one hath been found, among the various Sects of Christians or Jews, that ever question'd the Truth; those of the Old, those, of either Old or New Testament-relations, Though some of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (had they seen the tendency of them) would have necessitated them to it. The Manichees, who denied the God of Israel to be the best and greatest God, did yet believe that the History of the Old Testament was true. The Sadducees, who denied the Existency of Angels or Spirits, yet owned the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> wherein the God of Israel is declared to be both great and good, by the merciful wonders he wrought, by the Ministry of Angels. The Arrians denied Christ to be the Eternal God, yet confest he did those stupendious works, which none but God can do (some whereof he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly did, on purpose to manifest himself to be equal to his Eternal Father,) Monsters of men! they deny the Conclusions, and yet grant Premisses, most necessarily and demonstratively proving those Conclusions. But of all those
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43715:254"/>
Pagan Writers, that have escaped the Teeth of time, and made mention of Pagan Prodigies; there is not one, but hath question'd the Truth of their own Legends, so far as by the diligent reading of them, I can find. To the many instances that have allready been produc'd in my First Book <hi>(Sect. 3. chap.</hi> 5. I shall here add the Censure of that Famous Critick <hi>Agellius,</hi> who (in his 9. 4. <hi>noct. Attic.)</hi> telling a story, how that upon his coming to <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium,</hi> he heard a fellow crying Books, to whom he repairing, bought the works of <hi>Aristaeus Proconnesius, Isagonus Nicaeensis, Ctesias, Onesicritus, Polyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> and <hi>Hegesius,</hi> Authors of great Authority (as he stiles them) and yet he calleth their Histories of such miraculous Accidents, as made most noise, and had been most universally believ'd, in the Age of Paganism, Books full of Miracles and Fables: out of which, repeating those that had best born up their credit unto his Age, he mentions none but such stories, (of men with one eye, of <hi>Pigmeis,</hi> &amp;c.) as there is no man, vers'd in the Affairs of the World, but knows to be as meer Fictions, as any of the Poets Fables. And of that greatest of Humanists, <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who, in his Book <hi>de Pythiae oraculis,</hi> brings in <hi>Diogenianus</hi> suspecting that <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracles were meer forgeries, because they were given out in such beggarly Verses; when he himself, upon whom they were father'd, was the God of the Poets, and in Eloquence did far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod:</hi> and <hi>Boethus</hi> comparing those over-religious persons, who, in spight of their native Draught, would invert those Oracles into good and plausible Poetry, unto <hi>Pauson</hi> the Painter, who being hired to draw the Picture of an Horse tumbling on his back, painted one running; at which he storming who had fore spoke that Picture, <hi>Pauson</hi> turns the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble so, as presented the heels of the Horse upwards: and <hi>Bio</hi> thus concluding that Argument: We ought therefore not to conclude they are good Verses because of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s making; but that they are not of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s making, because they are naught.</p>
               <p>To these I might add <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the Collector of all such strange stories, who gives his Reader a caution, not to be over hasty of belief, by his stiling his Books by the Names of the Muses, and by his frequent sorting such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages as that which he subjoynes to his stories of <hi>Rampsinitus:</hi> whosoever thinks them credible may believe them, <hi>(Euterp.)</hi> and that wherewith he concludes the disapparition of <hi>Zamolxis [ego autem de hoc neque non credo, neque valde non credo,] (Melpomene.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Pausanias</hi> who in his <hi>Corinthiacis,</hi> makes the same of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> his raising of men from the dead (upon account whereof he was deified,) dwindle into the pittiful story, of his bringing <hi>Archias</hi> out of a Convulsion Fit, which took him as he was hunting: for which cure <hi>Archias</hi> bestowed Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours upon him, and built him a Temple at <hi>Pergamus.</hi> But it would be endless to number particulars: and it may be enough to invalidate all strange Pagan Stories that the most antient and authentick History in the Gentile World (which was thought worthy to be hung up in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple <hi>(Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stephens</hi> Fragments of <hi>Stesichorus</hi> out of <hi>Athenaeus)</hi> the Homerial Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Troy,</hi> is confuted by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his <hi>Euterpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. 3. A great part of the Miracles father'd upon Demons, are manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly mis-father'd; they are made gay with the Lambs-wool, and trick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Feathers, which the eternal Word of the ever-blessed God made to grow. For all forreign Miracles that have been delivered by indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tradition, and were really such as exceeded the whole power of the Creature, were not effected by those Heathen Deities, that bare away the praise of them, but the products of Israels God, To instance in the most eminent of them; <hi>Diod. Sicul. (Bib.</hi> 16.) reports that the Phocians (after they had rob'd the Temple of <hi>Delphos</hi> discumfited by the Beotians, 500 of them took Sanctuary in a Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> where by a fire by accident, they were all burnt alive, and the Temple it self consumed: had this been <hi>Apollo</hi>'s doing (and not that Gods; who equally abhors Sacrilege, and such Idols as that sacrilege was committed against, he would, sure, in punishing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious,

have had a care of his own Temple: and not have punish'd it, with a greater Sacrilege than they committed. When the Ship, wherein the Mother of the Gods was, was brought from <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and was so stranded in <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as all the strength of Men and Oxen, that they applied thereto, could not make it stir; <hi>Claudia</hi> the Vestal Nun, being suspected of Incontinency, tying her Girdle to the Ship, and praying the Goddess, that if she were an immaculate Virgin, she would follow her forthwith, haled the Vessel to shore: this Virgins Statue, in memorial of this, was erected in <hi>Cybel's</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and stood firm and perfect upon its own base, after the Temple had been twice consumed with fire, <hi>(Livii 2. de bello Punico.)</hi> He must be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Legend of this salacious Goddess, that can think she had any hand in vindicating the innocency of this Virgin; who her self was the veryest Strumpet and impure Drabb that ever liv'd, and whose Mysteries, wherein her story was represented, were so obscene, as common Harlots would have blusht to have such obscenities laid to their charge <hi>(Aust. de Civit. cap. 4. lib.</hi> 2.) as <hi>Cybeles</hi> Priests celebrated her memory with. It was not therefore through her procuration that <hi>Claudia's</hi> Chastity was thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously vindicated but by his Providence, who hath declared himself the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of oppressed Innocency, that filthy Goddess was forc'd contrary to her own Genius, to follow the halings of that unjustly accused Vestal; who had made her appeal to the Tribunal of the Deity, <hi>generali complexione,</hi> in an interpretive and general sence, though she mist it in the application. <hi>(Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius de jure 2. 13. 12.)

               <p>That wonderful success, which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Arms found in <hi>Aegypts</hi> Conquest, though he ascribed it to his Gods, was given him by the true God, in pursuit of making good the Menacies of his Prophets, against that Nation. <hi>I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar, my servant, and will set his Throne upon these stones, that I have bid (at the entry of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>house) and he shall stretch his Royal Pavillion over them, and I will kindle a fire in the houses of the Gods of Aegypt, and he shall array himself with the Land of Aegypt and he shall go forth from thence in peace, (Jer 43. 10.) Cyrus</hi> his victorious arms over <hi>Chaldea</hi> and the circumjacent Countries were born up upon the wing of that Prophecy, which named him an 100 years before he was born, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 43. 28.) in order to the fulfilling whereof <hi>(Isa.</hi> 44. 1, &amp;c.) Gods right hand upheld and strengthen'd him, to subdue Nations before him. God loosed the Loines of Kings, and open'd the two leaved Gates before him: he went before him, made the crooked places straight, brake in pieces the Gates of Brass, and cut in sunder the Bars of Iron. It was not the <hi>Heroes</hi> of <hi>Media, Persia, Assyria,</hi> whom he so religiously supplicated, and so devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thank'd, but that God of the Jews, whom he knew not then, but at last acknowledged his hand to have been alone, in all thosegrand Transactions. As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> also understood not, who that God was, that had done such great and marvellous things for him, till convinc'd (by the deliverance of the three Children) he proclaimes to all the World, that their God is he, that had shewed signs and wrought wonders towards him, <hi>&amp;c. (Dan. 4. 2. 3.) Daniel</hi> had prophecyed of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that he should be Mighty, and do according to his Will, <hi>(chap.</hi> 11. 3.) when God raised him up against the Persians, to destroy that Empire, and he had no other way thither, the Pamphylian Sea open'd to him and his Army, as the Red Sea had done to <hi>Moses, (Joseph, Jewish antiq. l. 1. cap.</hi> 7.) This Story saith <hi>Josephus</hi> is mention'd by all, that write the Acts of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. In order to the punishment of other Nations, God frequently does, as it were by Miracle, advance some one Nation, perhaps no better than the rest. The Assyrian was the Rod of Gods anger, and the Staff in his hand, that that sustain'd him was Gods indignation; though he thought not so, but triumph'd over the God of Israel, as one of those feeble Idols that was not able to defend his own Territories, any more than the Gods of <hi>Calno,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43715:258"/>
Carchemish, Hamath</hi> or <hi>Arpad. (Is.</hi> 10. 5, 11.) In which case, the wicked may oftentimes devour the man thats more righteous than himself, <hi>(Hab.</hi> 1. 12.) And when that Nations sins are brim full, and Gods whole work done, for which God raised it up, some of those subdued Nations are raised up, (by no less a Miracle) out of the Grave, out of the ashes, to bringdown that stout heart, and avenge the blood he hath shed. Thus <hi>Greece</hi> was stirred up for the Ruine of the Caldean Empire, and <hi>Rome</hi> for the destruction of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; in all which great and stupendious Mutations of States, the strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that fall out, are the Effects of divine Vindicative Justice, though each Nation, for whose raising they were wrought, conceiv'd them to have been the Fruits of the Favour of their Idol-Gods. It was an higher wisdom than <hi>Minerva</hi>'s, that managed the affairs of <hi>Athens:</hi> the Lord of Hosts, not their God of War, that put courage into the Spartans. The unknown God, not any of their Tutelars, that made them great, and arm'd the Sons of <hi>Greece</hi> against the Bratts of <hi>Babel:</hi> all the wonders of that age (reported by <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus,)</hi> and of the next Empire, (reported by <hi>Dion, Dionysius, Livy,</hi> &amp;c.) were the Operations of his hands, that only doth Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that sets up the low Tree, and brings down the high Tree, by ways past finding out, Judgments unscrutable, either as to Methods or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Lastly, if at any time the World hath been so equally pois'd, in respect of the Virtue or Vitiousness of her several Inhabitants, as it seemed not good to vindictive Justice, by extraordinary impulses, or incanonical courses of his Providence (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls Miracles) to animate one Nation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge its quarrels upon another: By what prodigious accidents hath God made the Empires that then were in Being or arising, conspicuous, in order to the preservation of the general Peace, and that the whole Earth might sit still and be at quiet. <hi>Melanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This would not be if God had not a peculiar care of them, and gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest tokens of that his care; by his wonderful erecting of them by mean persons (in respect of such undertakings) such as <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Julius Caesar,</hi> made famous by nothing, but Gods signal owning of them, in his giving them success beyond their own expectation, and the natural accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments of Unity, Power and Policy: and by his furbishing and setting a new gloss upon the splendour of his own Creature, when at any time (through length of time) it was grown obsolete: and in some places fixing a standing badge, of an honourable discrimination of them from others, upon the persons of the chief Governours, as that wonderful gift of healing, otherwise incurable Maladies, by a touch, intail'd upon our Kings. Instances of that other way of Gods setting occasional Remarks, upon his own great Ordinance, when it grows into contempt, occur every where in History.

               <p>Briefly, Christs Miracles were beneficial to Mankind, even in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Effects; how many went from him rejoycing in the recovery, of their own health, of their limbs, sight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the restauration of their friends, from death to life? The Old Testament-Prophets indeed (sutably to the courser grain of that Dispensation) sometimes called Fire down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but Christs Miracles were all healing his very cursing the fruitless Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, was advantagious to the owner, whose ground was hereby cleared of that, that did but cumber it, and takeup the room of a more fruitful Plant: there was <hi>[Nihil nocens aut noxium, sed opiferum, sed salutare, sed auxiliaribus plenum bonis, potestatis munificae liberalitate donatum:] (Arnobius contra gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, l. 1.) In Christs miraculous acts no harmful, no burtful, ingredients; all was healthful, helpful, full of relieving goods, and flowing from the largess of courteous Power.</hi> And the Apostolical Rod, (though it had its Prickles to let out impostum'd matter) budded Almonds, and brought forth fruit, for the healing of the Nations; being never inflicted, but in order to the saving of the Soul, by bringing down the Body: towards which if it was not avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon the persons, on whose backs it was laid, it was always of use, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bettering of others.</p>
               <p>The Deputy gain'd spiritual, by <hi>Elimas</hi> his miraculous loss of corporeal Eye-sight, the Church learn'd to beware of Sacrilege, by the exemplary punishment of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> and if <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> by being delivered to Satan, did not learn not to blaspheme; the Prints of the strokes of that Apostolical Rod could not but deterr others. Not one of all theirs or their Masters mighty Works was labour in vain, but accomodated to Humane use, to common Good, to the benefit of Mankind, even in their natural operations, and immediate products.</p>
               <p>§ 2. 2. How much more advantagious were they to the VVorld, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their ultimate tendency and designed end? <hi>viz.</hi> to convince men of the Truth and Divine Original of a Doctrine, so every way suited to the procurement of all sorts of Happiness to Humane kind: a Doctrine, which (if observ'd,) would restore those golden Times, which preceded <hi>Astraeas</hi> Flight from the corrupt Earth; would have turn'd Devils into Men, and Men into Angels; so as Ideot-Christians, that are true to their Religion, are so far free from all Lust, Rapine, Injustice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they live at the rate of most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Priests; and exhibit in their Manners, that Gravity, Purity, Probity, and Simplicity, as is not to be found amongst the wisest of any other Sect (as <hi>Origen</hi> tells <hi>Celsus, (lib. 7. cal.</hi> 14.) and evidently declare the Author of so pious and just a Religion, to be the holy God, to all who have not lost all sense. It being impossible, that an enemy to Mankind should promote the embracing of a Doctrine so beneficial, either by revealing it, or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Authority by the Seal of Miracles. <hi>(Origen. lib. 1. cont. Celsum.)</hi> But the design of all Pagan Miracles was, to bring into credit a Doctrine of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tendency, to countenance such brutish Immortalities, as Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the greatest degree of Debauchery, it can possibly degenerate into, would certainly have abominated; if they had not been commended to the VVorld by its Devil gods, and urged upon men, by lying VVonders, <hi>(Austin de Civit. l. 4. cap.</hi> 26.) Gods Ape, the old Serpent, scarce ever counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand more dexterously, than in his practising upon <hi>T. Latinus,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his sorcing him to acquaint the Senate, that it was the Divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to have the Scenical Games renewed: the story is mentioned by <hi>Cicero (de divinat.</hi> 1.) out of <hi>Fabius, Gellius,</hi> and <hi>Caelius,</hi> by <hi>Livy, Val. Maximus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellius,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius, viz.</hi> That the Games, in the first Day of their Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, being profaned, by the execution of a Malefactor (the Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, being displeased, to have the delight, they look in beholding those Games, interrupted by so sad a Spectaticle:) this <hi>Titus</hi> was warn'd in his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43715:261"/>
sleep, to go and tell the Senate, that they must begin anew their Celebration; he not daring the day after to communicate this Dream, as he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is the next night more severely charged; which he neglecting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of, that day looseth his son by a suddain death; and being the third night threatned with suffering a more grievous punishment, in case he would not obey the Vision; and still not daring to tell the Senate, he himself fell into a sharp and horrible sickness: and then, by the advice of his friends, carried in his bed to the Senate, he acquaints them with the whole business; upon which he is presently restored to health, and walks home on foot as sound as a Roach: the Senate, astonisht with so great a Miracle, forthwith decrees the instauration of the Sports. Who, in his right wits (saith St. <hi>Austin)</hi> may not here see persons in vassalage to malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Daemons, compel'd by force to exhibit to such Gods such things, as in right Reason may be judged dishonest. For in these Games, which those Gods compell'd the Senate to restore, are repeated those flagitious Crimes, which the Poets father upon them: such as the veriest Wretch would blush to have laid to his charge; the Scenical Actors of those turpitudes of the Gods sparing neither filthy words nor actions; <hi>(Herod. Commod.)</hi> upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them (with a strange kind of lasciviousness) with the most foul and sordid Actions imaginable: and by those upbraidings and representations, insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to the World the laudableness of the most dishonest Vice, as having the Gods for their Fautors, and cancelling at once all the Precepts of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophers; which if they had not been retunded by this basilick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (by counter-ballancing their Reasons with Divine Authority) might have bid fair for the civilizing of the World, and the ridding it of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism and Devillism: <hi>[Magis intuentur quid</hi> Jupiter <hi>fecerit, quam quid docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit</hi> Plato,] <hi>(August. dc civitat. lib. 2. 7.) [Exemplo suo velut divinam authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem praebere sceleribus] (Austin de Civ. 2, 25.) They designed hereby to give the face of Divine Authority to the most impious kind of Villanies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the no less impious, though less frequent, secular Games, were the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans invited, by a like Satanical Sign and lying Wonder, wrought upon the Children of <hi>Valesius Sabinus, (Vives in Aug. de civit.</hi> 3. 18.) who as he was offering Prayers and Vows, for his three Children, dangerously sick, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, heard a voice that assured him his Children should recover, if he would carry them up <hi>Tyber,</hi> at a full water, vnto <hi>Tarentum:</hi> and refresh them with (what they desired) warm water fetcht from the Altar of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dis</hi> and <hi>Proserpina, Valesins</hi> thinking that the Oracle meant the City <hi>Tarentum</hi> (though that was a great distance from his Habitation, and had no passage to it by <hi>Tyber)</hi> in obsequiousness to the Oracle, Ships himself and his Children, and Sailes as far as <hi>Campus Martius:</hi> There, to ease the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Navigation, he brings his Children on shore; and desirous to kindle a fire, asketh the Pilot where he might fetch fire, from <hi>Tarentum</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Pilot) a place hard by, where you see the Shepherds fires shining: he over-joy'd at the hearing of that name, conceives that must be the <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> to which the Divine voice directed him: commands the Vessel to stear thither, and while he hasts to the City to buy an Altar, orders his men to dig a place, where he might erect it: they digging twenty foot deep, find there an old Altar, with this Inscription [To <hi>Dis</hi> and <hi>Proserpina.]</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, returning from the City, sacrificeth upon that Altar to those Infernal Deities, and three nights together (answering the number of his late sick, but now recovered, Children) makes Funeral Banquets to the Gods with Songs and Dances. With what strange obscenities those Games were celebrated, is more obvious, than that it needs be related. It is sufficient to evince the Diabolicalness of those seeming Miracles and therefore only seeming) that they manifestly tended towards the erecting of the Worship of infernal Fiends, to the robbing the one Supreme God, of that honour, thats his peculiar due: and to the introducing of most barbarous Immoralities into the VVorld. And therefore (being Seals set to a Law directly thwarting that Law of God
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43715:261"/>
writ on the hearts of all men,) if they had more exactly counterfeited the Scal of Heaven than they did, may easily be deprehended, to be nothing else but feigned Miracles.</p>
               <p>§ 3. This should have, at least, awaken'd the VVorld, to a more scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inspection and prying into them: and to have weighed them with those Sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s which were set to the contrary Doctrine. In comparison with which, they would have been found if not lighter than vanity; yet at least wanting many grains weight of real Miracles; that is, productions by the God of Nature, above the power of Nature, and beside its ordinary Course. I insert this last clause into the description of a Miracle, to distinguish it from the Effects of ordinary Providence: which though they proceed from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power, yet are not Miracles, but issue from the natural order of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, Mutation, and Mutability of Bodies. The water (saith St. <hi>Austin de Trinit. lib.</hi> 3.) is poured ordinarily upon the earth: but when, at the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Elias</hi> after so long a serenity, when there was no appearance of a cloud, it was made to fall; this was the immediate effusion of Divine Power. God ordinarily makes the voyce of his Thunder to be heard, and sends out the Lightning from the bright Cloud: but when on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual manner, those thundering voyces were sent forth, which did not make a confused din, but articulately sounded forth the VVill of God, this was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous: who draws moisture, by the root of the Vine, to the Clusters, and by degrees ripens the Grapes; but God? who giveth the increase, while Man Plants and VVaters? But when, at our Lord's beck, VVater was turn'd into VVine by an unusual celerity; he must be a fool with a witness, who denies that to be a witness of a divine Power in him, who commanded and it was done. Earth is the common Matter, for the bringing forth and nourishing of all Plants, and of all Bodies of Animals; and who produceth these things from the Earth, but he that said to the earth, bring forth? But when, of a suddain, he turn'd the same Matter, out of <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod, into a Serpent; and back again out of that Serpent, into a Rod (immediately and in an instant) he wrought a Miracle, the things indeed were changable, but this change of them was unusual. Who but God cloaths the Shrubbs with Leaves and Blossoms? But when the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> blossom'd, the divinity did, after a sort, discourse with doubting Humanity. Who is he that giveth life to every living thing thats born, but he that gave life to that Serpent of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> for an hour? Who restored to Bodies, when they were dead, their Souls; but he that animates flesh in the Mothers Womb, which is born to die? of the same common Matter, which subsists in the Elements, God produceth (in time, or <hi>ex tempore,)</hi> a Ram, or a Dove, who are of the same fleshy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, at their coming in and going out of the World; whether they were made in an instant or by degrees, they are not of different constitutions: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which was produced <hi>ex tempore,</hi> appeared after an unusual manner; but when those Creatures are brought forth, by a kind of continued Flux of sliding and remaining things, passing out of secret into open light, and out of light into obscurity, in the usual road, they are called natural, which same Creatures, when they are thrust in upon us (for our admonition) by an unusual mutability, are called Wonders.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet, it is not every unusual Conflux of those primordial, seminal Causes, towards the production of a thing into being, that makes a Miracle, for, (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes upon the story of the Aegyptian Magicians,) <hi>Ex. 7. de Trin. 3. cap.</hi> 8.) there are certain seminal Causes, hid in corporeal things (through all the Elements of the World) which Daemons may pick out (more easily than the cunningest Gold-finer can single parings of Gold out of heaps of Sand into one Mass) and make up into strange Effects; and of them produce new Species of things in a trice. <hi>[Omnis spiritus ales est mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento ubi<expan>

               <p>To the first of these Degrees the Pagan VVorld, never so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>To the second, none ever attain'd, who pretended to act in the Name of any God, but the God of Israel. For all Pagan Stories, that commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate such Mutations, are either so manifestly fabulous, as they carry their condemnation on their foreheads, or else ascribe those strange Effects to Art; or, at least wise, impute them to the true Gods designing, thereby, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the person that wrought them, more august and conspicuous in the VVorld, for a common good; as is manifest from the account which both <hi>Josephus, Suetonius,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives of <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s curing a blind man. <hi>[Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas &amp; quasi majestas quaedam ut scilicet inopiniato &amp; adhuc novo principi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat: haec quoque accessit,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>(Sueton. Vesp.</hi> 7.) Vespasian <hi>coming thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly from a new Family to the Empire, wanted Authority, and as it were a kind of Majesty; but this also he obtain'd, by Omens and Prodigies. Suetonius</hi> indeed, siath, that the blind man was directed in a Dream by <hi>Serapis,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Vespasian</hi> to lay Spittle on his eyes (and it is no wonder, that an Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian should fancy, that <hi>Serapis</hi> injected that motion into him; since the chief God in that Country went under that name) but that <hi>Serapis</hi> was so much as invocated by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> when he applyed himself to perform the Cure, is not in the least hinted, but rather the contrary implyed: not only in the Historians silence, as to <hi>Vespasians</hi> applying himself either to that or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particular Deity, but from his mentioning that Alexandrian Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie's putting the blind man upon the business, who was to <hi>Vespasian</hi> a strange God, and therefore not to be invocated by him; and from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing this, amongst other instances, as a subsequent to and an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Oracle of the God of <hi>Carmel,</hi> deliver'd to him (or at least commented upon) by <hi>Josephus.

Gods climbed to, that is, the introducing of a Natural Form, into a Subject naturally capable of it, in an unusual and extraordinary way. In which attempt how far the greatest VVonders they did came short of true Miracles wrought in the Name of Israels God; will be evident, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, first, with such of this Rank which were done in the Name of the one true God: and secondly, out-vie them with those of the higher Formes, the second and first Degrees.</p>

To give them more than Huntsman's play: we will yield them more, than they can challenge by the evidence of their own VVritings, grant them a greater power than any Records, but those in the Churches custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, make mention of. Seek their Books from end to end, and all we find them say, as to this point of the exerting a miraculous power, amounts not to the one half of what <hi>Moses</hi> reports <hi>(Exod.</hi> 7.) That the Aegyptian Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did, by their diabolical Inchantments, affront the Messenger of the high God in three of those VVonders, he did before <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> (the turning of Rods into Serpents, of VVater into Blood, and Slime into Frogs; by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible celerity) when he challenged <hi>Aaron</hi> to shew his Credentials, to make it evident by some Miracle, that the God of Gods had sent him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Embassie, which he delivered in his Name to the King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

Briefly, God permitted the infernal Powers to run the whole length of their Chain, in this Contest. But yet they cannot reach to the lowest Form of a real Miracle in these real Transmutations. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They only prepared the Matter, but did not introduce the substantial Form: that being the natural result from the last preparation of the Matter; so that Nature did the same office here, that the God of Nature performeth, in introducing the rational Soul, after the Body is organized and ultimately prepar'd for its reception, whereupon St. <hi>Austin (de Trinitate lib. 3. cap.</hi> 8.) piously and wittily saith, as we neither call Parents the Formers of Men, nor Husbandmen the formers of Fruit: though the Divine Power makes use of the one, to prepare the matter for the reception of the Reasonable Soul; and of the other, for the accelerating the disposition of Plants, not only to bear Fruit, but Fruit of such a colour, taste, smell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so we must not think, that Angels (whether good or bad) are introducers of the substantial Form; but that they (by reason of their subtilty) knowing where the Seeds of things lay (which we cannot discern) and secretly sowing them through congruous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed Elements, do only administer occasions, of the Birth of things, and of hastening their growth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What the Gods did, whom the Magicians invocated, they took time to do. It is like that they singled out a time most convenient for such like operations, in respect of the Planetary hour, and Positions of the Heavenly Bodies. <hi>Macrobius (Sat. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 17.) observes that the victory which the Romans obtain'd over the Carthaginians, when they implored the aid of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that is, the Sun, upon the motion of the Prophet <hi>Martius,</hi> (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them victory, if they would observe the Oracle which he delivered to them) was in such a Juncture as the Sun was then, in the vertical point, directly over <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore strongliest abilitated to heat their blood, and put courage into them, who were born under that Planet. <hi>Aaron</hi>'s God in an instant both alter'd the Matter, and chang'd the Form of his Rod into a Serpent: but the Egyptians used Inchantments, in order to the Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Rods, and thats enough to evince it not to have been instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous. Had nature, indeed, been left to her own Genius, she would have taken far more leasurely steps, than those Daemons did; that Handmaid of God keeps that state, in her ordinary pace, as a club-footed <hi>Vulcan</hi> may out goe her: she perhaps may spend a thousand years in making such Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in Mettals, as a Chymist will perform in a week, and yet not come near the celerity of these winged spirits in their Operations; there being a far greater disparity betwixt them, and the most dexterous Operator in the whole Colledge of the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> than there is betwixt these and the most dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated-club-fisted Mechanick. Briefly, the change of the Egyptians Rods was indeed subitaneous: Nature was there put out of her pace, but not out of her way; The workers of that Wonder gain'd time enough to perform that feat in, while the Magicians were at their Inchantments (and doubtless one Reason of the institution of such Diabolical Ceremonies is the advantage of gaining time) time enough for such agil Creatures to procure all those alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in, which in a natural way of causation were pre-requisite towards the ultimate Change. But the instantaneous change of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod put Nature beside her course, for seeing no Body can move, but in time, as well as place, <hi>[Natura non agit per saltum,]</hi> it implies a Contradiction, that the Rod should pass into a Serpent, by any other kind of Corruption, than that of Annihilation: or the Serpent be produc'd out of it, by any other kind of act, than that of Creation.</p>

3. VVhereas some scruple whether that saying [Aaron'<hi>s Rod devoured the Rods of the Sorcerers,]</hi> imply not the returning of their Serpents into Rods; St. <hi>Austin,</hi> by removing that Scruple, clears our way to the observing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther material difference betwixt these wonders. This (saith he) is spoken <hi>[initialiter &amp; finaliter,]</hi> in respect to what they had been, and to what one of them (that is <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Serpent) would return to be; but whether the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Serpents became Rods again, I will nor dispute. However 'tis most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they did not; it being the common Opinion, that <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, when turn'd into a Serpent, did devour their Serpents, and prevented their beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Rods again, <hi>(Alensis sum. 2. quest.</hi> 43.) which Opinion seems to be well grounded upon that word in <hi>Moses</hi> Text, <hi>[swallowed up]</hi>

The old Serpent may croud Serpents into the World, but he can't lay them; he could pester Egypt with bloody VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but leaves the cure of them to him, thats higher than himself: He could make <hi>Nilus</hi> be delivered of Frogs, before the time came of her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry travel, and in all likelihood plague <hi>Goshen</hi> with that crawling Vermine (for I cannot find any room for them elsewhere, in all the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> since <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Frogs had already fill'd all the VVaters and Houses of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.)

Such

as was, the Sun's standing still in the days of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> and its going retrograde upon <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Dial, at the request of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> which I instance in, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accidents indisputable as to Matter of Fact: the first being so famously known, and universally taken notice of, as it occasion'd that Fiction of the VVorld's expending a whole day upon the Birth of <hi>Hercules: [Cujus in ortu mundus expendit diem. Senec. Her. fur.]</hi> though Asterages turn'd day into night, and misapplyed that to the Grecian, which belonged to the Phaenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>Hercules, Joshua,</hi> and the last being observed as far as <hi>Babylon,</hi> whence <hi>Merodac Baladan</hi> (having heard it was done in favour of <hi>Hezekiah)</hi> sent his Embassadors into <hi>Judaea, (who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land (2 Chron.</hi> 31. 31.) to congratulate <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and to enquire concerning the Circumstances of that Miracle, so famously known, as <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Areopagite, <hi>Ep. 7. ad Polycarpum,</hi> affirms that the Persian Priests and <hi>Magi,</hi> kept up the Memorial thereof in the Rites [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>of the triple</hi> Mithra. Not because this day was almost as long as three days (as <hi>Pachymerius</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> mis-expound <hi>Dionysms,)</hi> for that makes this day longer than that in <hi>Joshua,</hi> whereas the Text, <hi>(Josh.</hi> 10. 14.) saith, there was no day like that (equal to it in length) before or after it. Nor is their Argument so conclusive; if we expound it of the Sun's going back as well as the shadow (with St. <hi>Austin de mirabil. script. l. 2. c.</hi> 48. and the Fathers generally) as that <hi>Vatablus, Burgensis,</hi> and <hi>Montanus</hi> needed, by its force, have been put to that miserable shift, they betake themselves to: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sun kept its ordinary motion, and its shadow only, by the Ministry of Angels, was made to fall back on <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Dial. For it might go ten Degrees back, and over those ten degrees forward again, and so on his daily Course, and not make that day from Sun-rise to its Setting 32 hours; If the degrees of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Dial were either Quadrants or half-hours, the Sun might keep his ordinary pace, in going back and forward, and not reach the length of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>'s day: or he that could make it go back, might make it to mend its pace, as to redeem so much time, that that day might possibly be not much longer than an ordinary one: and yet sufficiently miraculous, and so conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous (for the Sun's going back) as the Persians might well take notice of it, and celebrate its memorial in the Rites and Denomination of the Triplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sun; because of that threefold course it then took, first forward, next backward, and then forward again. So that the authority of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> still stands firm, notwithstanding the Learned <hi>Vossius</hi> his so easie rejecting it, upon that mistake which <hi>Pachymerius</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> led him into: as if the Areopagite had affirm'd, the Persians to have given that appellation to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra</hi> or the Sun, by reason of its tripling the length of that day: when in truth all he affirms of them is, that they kept the Memory of this Miracle, in the Celebrities of the <hi>Triplasia:</hi> which he might certainly know they did, (that being a Matter of Fact) and which they might do, in commemoration of the Suns tripling his Course. It is true indeed <hi>Dionysius</hi> thought that day to be tripl'd, and from thence to have arisen that Persick Name; but in this (being matter of Opinion, and an Opinion so directly opposing the Text in <hi>Joshua)</hi> we may safely forsake him, and question his judgement. But we cannot reject him, in what he barely reports, as a Matter of Fact, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out questioning his honesty; to wit, that the Persians kept up the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Suns going back and changing its Course.</p>
               <p>I will not here enter a Debate, with our Modern Philosophers, about that question, whether it be the Sun or the Earth that moves: for let it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is natural to one of them to move, in that course, that hath been traced above 5000 years; and I matter not, to whether of them they assign the Task of Motion, or bequeath the Privilege of Rest: which of them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that moves, what Second Cause can be imagin'd to make it once stand still, and once to move back ward? Did some hooked prominent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom catch hold of some weightier quiescent Body, and forc'd the Earth or Sun to lie at Anchor a whole day; or put a stop to one of them as a long
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43715:264"/>
Skewer (for Kitching-similies are fittest to illustrate their new Kitching-Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy) stays the Spit from turning, if it touch the Drippin-pan. What second Cause can be imagin'd of its going back? <hi>ubi pedem fixit?</hi> Where set he his foot, while he wheel'd one of those Orbs, Westward and Eastward, backward and forward, as we turn a Globe in a Frame? Or was it with so great a violence, as lasted ten hours, driven back by falling foul upon some other Vessel, sailing in the Super-lunary Waters, through neglect of crying, Ware Oars? untrain'd curiosity may quest through the Universe, before it can set any other Author of this Motion, but him that is the Author of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: none could set back this Universal Watch, this measure and standard of every Inch of Time; none could slacken or hasten the going of it but its Maker.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Though it will not be granted me, that 'tis natural for the Sun to move, yet I hope Providence will bless these Lines out of the hands of such Brutes, as question whether it be not as natural for the Sun to shine, as for Fire to burn; whether its Beams of Light flow not necessarily from its very Being, as streams from the Fountain. I demand then, whence proceeded its Opacity, and the suspension of its Light, at our Saviour's Passion? That it was at that time exempted from the Dominion of all second Causes, which by their intervention could possibly rob the lower World of its Light, may easily be made appear, by an enumeration of such Particulars, as have been observed (for this 5000 years) to hinder its illuminating at once the Hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of the Earth: and so much more easily, as the impediments are fewer, than to take up a long discourse, being but these two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Interposition of the Body of the Moon, which in that juncture could not be the impediment: for at the Passover, when our Saviour suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, the Moon was at the Full, and visibly arising that evening in the East when the Sun set in the West: we may therefore with as much reason charge a Theft committed at <hi>London,</hi> upon a person that was in <hi>India</hi> when that fact was done, as charge the Moon with this Robbery of the Suns Light, I shall run no hazard of my credit, before equal Judges, by becoming her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgator in this case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Cloudiness of the Skie: But the Air was at that time so serene, as the Stars appeared, and might be seen all over the Heavens, as <hi>Phlegon</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Chronologer, hath left upon Record: <hi>[Dies horâ sextâ in tenebrosam noctem versus, ut stellae in caelo visae sunt:] (Chron. Euseb.)</hi> and that record, probably, taken out of the Roman Rolls, where it was extant in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time. If the Clouds were not so thick, but that the Stars might be seen through them, they could not hinder the shining of that greatest Light, the Sun. Besides, this Darkness was universal, <hi>[Mark</hi> 15. 33. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Darkness was over the whole Earth.] Erasmus</hi> indeed limits this to the Land of <hi>Judaea:</hi> but <hi>Melchior Canus (lib. 11. cap.</hi> 2.) Doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confute that Opinion: which needs not any other Confutation than this, that it was observ'd at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> and if that Testimony of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onysius</hi> be scrupled, that of the Graecian Historians who write of it cannot be excepted against. <hi>(Scaliger animadvers. in Chron. Euseb.)</hi> But Clouds do but screen, and stand in the light of some particular and small Regions: so that, when the Sun hath nothing else to hinder its shining, it will cast its beams on one City, on one part of a City, when the other part is clouded. This Darkness therefore could not proceed from any Natural Cause, but was simply and nakedly the Effect of the suspension of its most natural power of giving Light, <hi>[Ex retractione radiorum solarium,] (Voss. harmon, Evang. l. 2. cap.</hi> 10.) the retraction of its Beams, from the unthankful World, at the Will of its Creator (on purpose to convince men, that that Jesus who was then a crucisying was both Lord and Christ, or as the Centurion (from that Argument concludes) the Son of God, the King of Israel.) according to the sign given by the Prophet <hi>Zachary (chap. 14. 6.) In that day the light

               </p>
               <p>§ 7. I will conclude with that, which is both the sum of the Christian Faith, and the seal of it, the Resurrection of the blessed Jesus. The sum of it; <hi>(If thou shalt believe in thine heart, that God raised up Christ from the dead, thou shalt be saved;</hi> Rom. 10. The Seal of it; <hi>whereof he hath given assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> (made demonstration) <hi>to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. (Act.</hi> 17. 31.)</p>
               <p>Shall I need to shew the demonstrableness of this Argument? so cogent, as he must shut his eyes against the clearest and most undoubted Sentiments of common Reason, that does not acknowledge the Finger, the Hand, the Arm of inconquerable Omnipotency, to have been at work, in breaking the Chains of Death, and bringing Christ thence, after the pains and anguish of the Cross had exhausted his Vital Spirts, and made his sacred Body inhospitable to that his precious Soul, which he breathed into the hands of his Father; after they who were set to watch him, were so well satisfied that he was dead, as they thought it needless to break his Legs, and yet (to make all sure) ran a Spear to his Heart; whence issued (as an indication that there was no need of that neither, in order to his dispatch, but only that the Prophecies of him might be fulfill'd) Water and Blood. And lastly, after he was buried, and a Guard of Soldiers set about the Sepulchre, by the procurement of his most watchful Adversaries, who feared he would rise again (as he had said) and thereby declare himself to be the <hi>Messias.</hi> These Circumstances speak a total privation of Life, the extinction of the vital Flame, the breaking of the golden Cord and Marriage-ring, which coupled together that lovely Pair (the Humane Flesh and Reasonable Soul) whereof the Man Christ consisted. And I appeal to common Principles, to give sentence and determine those Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. Whether the Flame of Lifes Taper can be blown in again, but by the blast of that Breath; which blew it in at first? Whether that Cord can be knit again by any hand, but that which drew it? Whether the Bowels of the Earth (our common Mother, whither Bodies return that they may see corruption) be a fit Matrix, wherein the Corps may be ripen'd, naturally, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an aptitude for the reception of the Soul? In our first moulding, the Spermatick Matter Courts the humane Form, and when by Second Natures hand (the Hand maid of the first Nature) its gradually purified into an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fittedness for the reception of its Bridegroom, God knits first the Band. And after the Band, is broke, the Soul (after a sort) courts the Corps, by its propensity to a reunion to that, without which it cannot be perfect. But the fullen Corps is deaf to all such motions, resists all methods of cure; all applications of Medicines, which the (now more illuminated and intelligent) Soul can possibly make (and doubtless if an herb grew any where, that could restore these beloved Mates; the Souls of Philosophers, that could see so well through the Casement, being now in the free Air, and having their eyes cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the dust of Death, would spy it out) are fruitless; this work must be let alone for ever: as no man can redeem his own Soul, so no Soul can restore its own Body. As the matter in the Womb, would never have had its desires of Union to a reasonable Soul gratified, if God had not infused the Soul: so the Soul in a state of separation, will never have its longing after reunion gratified, till God restore to it its Body. He that brought the Man to the Woman at first, must after the sleep of Death bring the Woman to the Man, or they will never meet.</p>
               <p>Nay the bringing of soul and body together again, after their Divorce, implies that seeming Contradiction, as the Disciples by the Illumination of Faith, could not understand what Christ meant, when he spake to them of his Resurrection, and were ready to give up their hopes that he was he that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43715:265"/>
should redeem Israel, when they saw him giving up the Ghost, and hanging down his Head upon the Cross; as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> though he had seen <hi>Lazarus</hi> rais'd from the dead, and heard it reported by credible Witnesses that Christ was risen, would not believe it. As <hi>Celsus, (Orig. cont. Cels. l. 2. cal.</hi> 41.) rather than grant the Truth of the Christian <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> denied the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of it. As it seemed good to the holy Ghost, to confirm the report of Christs Resurrection, by all those Signs which the Apostles wrought after his Ascension, by the name of the Holy Child Jesus; while with great power they gave witness of his Resurrection, <hi>(Acts</hi> 4. 33.) Yea so much did divine Goodness condescend to Humane imbecility, as to give a fuller proof of that point (so far above Reasons comprehension, and much more out of the Sphere of Natural Power) than the report of Eye-witnesses, than the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Adversaries, than the Seal of those Miracles afforded; by that Grace, that was upon all the Publishers; and fell upon all the Receivers of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: a Grace enabling them to live up to the Gospel, and to bring forth those Fruits of Holiness, Righteousness, Temperance, Meekness, as sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, to the morallized part of the World that Root of Faith, from whence they issued; as far outstript the most glorious glittering productions of the Moral Philosophers; as infinitely transcended the results of fantastick Credulty, and put all other Religions to the blush, at the sight of their own impotency.</p>

HEre (Christian Reader) I must crave thy help, and beg thy aid, towards the convincing the World of the Divine Original of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion; which, though it apparently bear the stamps of heavenly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in its Prophecies: of in finite Power, in its Miracles; commends it self more to the Consciences of men by engaging its Fautors to a Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answerable to its Sacred Rules; than by affording the most substantial Grounds of discoursing in its Defence by any other Arguments. Religion is better maintain'd by Living than Disputing. A Gospel-becoming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse falls under the Observation and speaks to the Hearts of all men; even of those who are not able to fathom the depth, nor feel the ground of the most rational verbal Discourse: well exprest by the Apostle of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1.

another spirit, than the rest of that Nation: and upon that account might revere them for their good works, and glorifie God (the Author of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) that had made them so much more meek, regular, and quiet under the Heathen Government which was over them, than the other Jews were,) when the Proconsuls should be sent, to make enquiry of the Commotions made by the unbelieving Party of that Nation. It was by this Argument that the old Laic-Confessor silenc'd, convinc'd, and converted that proud and subtile Philosopher, who bore up himself against all the Reasonings of the Learned Teachers of the Nicence Council, <hi>(Crab. tom. 1. pag.</hi> 249.) In the name of Jesus Christ (saith he) O Philosopher, hear the Dictates of Truth: There is one God, Maker of Heaven and Earth, who Created all things visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and invisible, by the power of his Word, and confirm'd them by the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of his Spirit. This Word therefore (which we call the Son of God) having mercy on Mankind, vouchsafed to be born of a VVoman, to converse with Men, and die for them, and will come again to give sentence upon the Lives of all men. By the belief of those things we Christians are freed from Error, and from that Religion, wherein Men live like Beasts; into a state of living like Men. Upon this the Philosopher cries out, that he is a Christian, and assures his Fellows he was drawn to it not upon light grounds but by that ineffable Vertue which attended the embracing of Christianity. In this Argument the ancient Patrons, of the Christian Cause triumph'd, over all other Religions, and Disciplines. The Christian Churches (saith <hi>Origen contr. Cels. lib. 3. cal.</hi> 8.) compared with other Societies, are really the Lights of the VVorld; who is there that must not confess (if he make an impartial collation of them) that the worst part of the Church excells vulgar assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? for the Church of God at <hi>Athens</hi> (for instance) is meek and quiet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Pagan Assemblies, seditious, turbulent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to that Calumny of <hi>Celsus,</hi> that the Christians invited the worst of sinners, <hi>Origen</hi> makes this Reply; that the Christian Philosophy did dayly reform the most dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Natures, not by converting one or two in so many Ages (as <hi>Phaedo,</hi> who coming Piping hot out of the Stewes into <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, took those impresses from his Doctrine, as <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogues brings <hi>Phaedo</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of the Immortality of the Soul; Or <hi>Palemon</hi> who by attending to Philosophical Discipline, became, of a Ruffian, so temperate, as he succeeded <hi>Xenocrates</hi> in his School: (but great multitudes.

But a Christian, his Soul being averse to Lust, can save his Eyes, and look on Women without danger of sin. If in point of probity. <hi>Diogenes,</hi> for all his pretence to Humility, trampled on <hi>Plato's</hi> Pride with greater Pride: whereas a Christian doth not insult over the poorest man.

Yea, so palpable was the inefficacy of their own Rules, to make the best of them throughly honest: as <hi>Seneca</hi> is forc'd to cast over them (and himself for company) the Cloak of this Excuse. <hi>[Omnia quae luxuriosi faciunt; quaeque imperiti, facit &amp; sapiens, sed non eodem modo, eodemque proposito.] That the wise man may do the same things which fools and the luxurious do, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner, and to another end,</hi> (as if the goodness of the Intention could either rectifie the pravity of an Action, in it self vitious; or remove the scandal, seeing the badness of the example is apparent, but the drift of the mind out of sight.) Thus <hi>Aristippus</hi> defended his Familiarity with the Strumpet <hi>Lais,</hi> by saying, there was a great difference betwixt him and the rest of <hi>Lais</hi> servants: for <hi>Lais</hi> had them, but he had <hi>Lais.</hi> Oh brave Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (cries <hi>Laciantius)</hi> and deserving to be imitated by good men! who would not send his Children to this Philosophers School, to learn to have a Whore? who can assign no other difference, betwixt himself and persons of profligated honesty, but this; That they wasted their Fortunes in that Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, which he enjoy'd <hi>gratis?</hi> In which point yet, the strumpet overwitted him; who so held the Philosopher for her Pandar, that all the Youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted (by the Example and Authority of their Master) might flock unto her without any shame. And yet this is he whom the Censors of Manners, the Satyrists prefer, before the rest of the Gown'd Crew. Such an empty sound of words were all Philosophical Precepts, as the Teachers of them could not hear themselves speak, with an obediential Ear: whom therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmeth, not to have sought the bettering, but delighting, of themselves, in the study of Morals.

               <p>But Evangelical Precepts do not only gingle in the Ear, but ring in the Conscience, and come, not in word only, but in power, being accompanied into the hearts (of such as do not resist the holy Ghost) with such a Majesty, as commands Obedience, (like that Word, whereby God called things, that were not, into being) by vertue of that Spirit, which in the Old Testament-prophecies, God promiseth shall never be separated from his Word: and which, in the New Testament, and subsequent Ecclesiastical History, we find always moving upon the Face of those sacred Waters, making the Souls of men take the Impress of the Soul of the Gospel, forming in them the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and converting the most wicked persons (that embrace it) from all their Debaucheries, wherein they were immerst, to a life most sutable to Nature, and Reason, and to the practice of all Virtues, [<gap reason="foreign">

From the colluvies of their vitious distempers, how many had their beastly Manners tamed, by occasion of the Evangelical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? which ought to have been embraced of all men, with thankfulness; if not as true, yet as a new, and compendious, Method of curing Vice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly advantagious to Humane kind. He that can think the malignant Powers would contribute towards the bringing of such a Doctrine, as this, into credit, by their Sealing to it, in those wonderful Operations, which gain'd it an Authority over Conscience: may, with an equal likelihood of Reason, conceive it worth the while to milk Hee-Goats. To which labour I remit him, while I commend to wiser persons the conclusiveness of this last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Divine Original of the Christian Faith, in general; and in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, for the probat of Christs Resurrection, the Center wherein all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Christian Faith meet, and the demonstration of the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and heavenly Mission of the blessed Jesus, to communicate that way of Salvation to the World: as being the Doctrine of Christ, that dyed, or rather, is risen again from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, whence he communicates that Grace, of which we have been speaking, and wherein Christianity triumphs over the greatest pravities of corrupt Nature as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by her Discipline, and overall other Methods of cure as insufficient as unable to reduce lapsed man to a state of health.</p>
               <p>§. 5. The strength of this Argument would be more apparent, if we of this Age could make good the assumption; as easily as those Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did, of whom the Patrons of the cause of Christ made these holy boasts, and such as that, <hi>[Non aliunde noscibiles quam de emendatione vitiorum pristinorum,] (Tertul. ad Scapulam.) Christians are not to be known from other Sects but by the emendation of their pristine vitious manner:</hi> were we, who embrace the form of those sound and healing words, as much under the power of Godliness, as they, whom that saving Grace taught to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and worldly lusts; and to live godly, righteously, and soberly: did we more study the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ; so as to know him, in the power of that Resurrection of his, which we make profession to believe the truth of: and in the fellowship of his sufferings, so as to be made conformable unto his Death. In which point (notwithstanding that, never to be enough bewail'd, Apostacy of these latter times) God hath not left himself without witness: But reserv'd a remnant of persons, who cordially embracing the truly Catholick Religion of Christ, (as it is profest in the Church of <hi>England)</hi> and mourning over the Irregularities of, and Scandals given, by such as conform not to its sacred Precepts; really exhibit to the Worlds view a Specimen of ancient Holiness; in their harmless and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Conversation, with, and towards all men: in their serious piety towards God, their reverential observance of their Superiours, their Justice, Charity, Love towards all men; their Continency, Chastity, Sobriety, Temperance in respect of themselves. And for the rest of the Professors of the pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Religion, (who deviate from the rule of this Sacred Discipline) they cease to be Christians, <hi>[Sed dicet aliquis; etiam de nostris excedere quosáam à regula disciplinae, desinunt tum Christiani baberi penès nos: Philosophi verò illi cum talibus factis in nomine &amp; honore sapientiae perseverant.] (Tertul. apol. 46.)

Christ has past the same Decree against all vitious Livers, that <hi>Severus</hi> past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Thieves: <hi>[per praeconem edixit, ut nemo salutaret Principem qui se fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem esse nosset, ne aliquando detectus capitali supplicio subderetur,] That none salute him with Lord, Lord, who knows himself to be guilty, under pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convict and suffering the extream punishment.</hi> None must enter into his Courts any more than to the Eleusine Rites, or into the Emperours Palace, <hi>[Nisi qui se innocentem novit,]</hi> but he that knows himself free of those sins, which by the sanction of the Royal Law exclude from the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

Can he be ignorant that the sentence is past, the prohibition <hi>[à mulieribus famosis matrem &amp; uxorem suam salutari, vetuit,] (Id. Ib.)</hi> is seal'd, that none presume to joyn themselves to my Church, to associate with my Love, my Dove, my undefiled Spouse, whose Lives are infamous, Christians may not eat with such; and can they expect to eat bread in my Kingdom? And therefore they who either by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from us do more openly declare; or by a Conversation unbecoming the Gospel (while they are with us) more secretly insinuate, that they were not, that they are not of us; in an impartial judgement should neither preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the holiness of that Society, whereof they are no Members: nor the Efficacy of that Religion, they either never came under the power of, or have rejected the yoak of; what, must it be presum'd that the Sun shines not, that its beams warm not; because those men, see not its Light, are not refresh'd, and vegetated with its Warmth; who either shut their eyes, or remove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Clime it never visits? Dr. <hi>Hammond (An. in Heb.</hi> 4. 2.) But the word that was heard did not profit those, who were not by Faith joyned to them that obeyed it: Shall we condemn the Seed, because it thrives not to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Fruit, in the ground of a dishonest heart: where either the fowles of the Air, pick it up, or it wants depth of earth, or is choak'd with Thorns and Weeds? Shall we question whether Christ be risen; because men, whose affections are so strongly set upon the earth, as they cannot elevate them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, are not risen with him, when we see such palpable Effects and Demonstrations of it, in his raising those to a newness of Life, who do not resist, grieve or quench his Spirit; but, with an humble teachableness, follow its conduct, in that way of holiness his Word hath chalk'd out before us.</p>
               <p>In order to our perseverance in this way, and confirmation in our assurance that it will infallibly lead us, to Peace here, and eternal Glory hereafter: I have undertaken this vindication of the Christian Faith against the prejudices which our modern either Scepticks or Atheists have taken up against it; which as they took their rise from the Scandals which have been cast upon Religion, by the woful miscarriages of men professing it in guile and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, so they must fall before a Spirit of Grace and Glory, resting upon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers of it in Truth and Sincerity, and shining out upon the World in their so peaceable, humble. meek, and every way Christian deportment, and men seeing their good works may glorifie their Father who is in Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere that Discipline (as proceeding from that Father of Lights) by whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the wildness of common Nature is abated, and its vertuous Seeds so improved, as to bring forth Fruit chearing the heart both of God and Man. To which if thou beest instigated (Christian Reader) to aspire by the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of this Discourse, and so become one of Christs Witnesses, by sealing to the Truth of the Gospel, by a Life answerable to its most holy, just, and yet easie,

Precepts, thou wilt lay up for thy self a good Foundation for time to come, and contribute towards the conviction of the Adversaries of the Christian Faith, by an Argument so familiar, as it incurrs into every mans sense; and so strenuous, as the most stubborn Atheist will not be able to resist it: but be forc'd to confess the unreasonableness of his own Exceptions, against a Religion that brings forth such Divine Effects. Would we all study thus to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; such real exornations would render Religion more venerable in the eyes of the VVorld, than all verbal <hi>Encomiums;</hi> those whom the close fist of the most Logical Arguings cannot force the commanding beck of that open-handed Eloquence would allure to a silent admiring of that sacred Fountain whence they see such heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing VVaters flow. That this my Request to my Readers may take effect, I shall back it with that Request to God, which my Dear Mother, the Holy Church of <hi>England</hi> hath put into her Childrens mouth. <hi>[More especially we pray for the good estate of the Catholick Church, that it may be so guided and govern'd by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians, may be led into the way of Truth, and hold the Faith in Unity of Spirit, in the Bond of Peace, and in Righteousness of Life.
