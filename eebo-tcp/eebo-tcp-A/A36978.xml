            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>HE who comes hither with design to hiss,</l>
            <l>And with a bum revers'd, to whisper Miss,</l>
            <l>To comb a Perriwig, or to shew gay cloathes,</l>
            <l>Or to vent Antique non-sence with new oaths,</l>
            <l>Our Poet welcomes as the Muses friend;</l>
            <l>For hee'l by irony each Play commend.</l>
            <l>Next these we welcome such as briskly dine,</l>
            <l>At <hi>Locket's,</hi> at <hi>Gissord's,</hi> or with <hi>Shataline.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Swell'd with Pottage, and the <hi>Burgundian</hi> Grape,</l>
            <l>They hither come to take a kindly nap.</l>
            <l>In these our Poet don't conceive much harm;</l>
            <l>For they pay well, and keep our benches warm.</l>
            <l>And though scarce half awake, some Playes they dam,</l>
            <l>They do't by Whole-sail; not by Ounce, and Dram.</l>
            <l>But when fierce Criticks get them in their clutch,</l>
            <l>They're crueller then the Tirannick Dutch.</l>
            <l>And with more Art, do dislocate each Scene,</l>
            <l>Then in <hi>Amboyna</hi> they the limbs of men.</l>
            <l>They wrack each line, and every word unknit,</l>
            <l>As if they'd find away to cramp all Wit.</l>
            <l>They are the terror of all adventurers here,</l>
            <l>The very objects of their hate and fear,</l>
            <l>And like rude Common-wealths they still are knit</l>
            <l>'Gainst English Plays, the Monarchyes of wit,</l>
            <l>They invade Poetique Lisence, and still rail</l>
            <l>At Plays, to which in duty they should vail.</l>
            <l>Yet still the' infest this Coast to fish for jests,</l>
            <l>To supplement their Wits at City feasts.</l>
            <l>Thus much for Criticks: to the more generous Wit,</l>
            <l>Our Poet Frankly, does each Scene submit;</l>
            <l>And begs your kind Allience to ingage</l>
            <l>Those Hogen interlopers of the Stage.</l>

                     <speaker>Pen.</speaker>
                     <p>Now I perceive the vanity of your Sex; because a Lady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps accidentally smiles upon you, or grants you an occasional Salute, you presently think shee's in love.</p>

                     <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                     <p>No; but when a Lady writes to a man she do's not; and sends it by a Gentleman; and in her Letter terms the said Gentleman with the terms of sweet Mr. such a one, Dear Mr. such a one, Worthy Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and the like; what should a man think, is not this Love?

                     <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                     <p>But praises with such attributes Madam, There's the point. Praise is the Friend of Love: And that Woman that praises a mans parts, undoubtedly covets what she commends; as we extol that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty most we desire to enjoy.</p>

                     <p>And can you think, if I did ever love you, which assure your self I do not, I could ever be brought to confess it, when you upbraid me thus; no, I look upon you as a man unworthy—base, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd—and perhaps unmanly—I'le curb him in a little, though my heart akes for't.</p>

                     <p>Ah,—dull, dull, Madam,—dull to the tenth degree, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but prolix phrases, and bombast, hardly a word of sense, or fancy in 'em; our Poets now take it from me Madam, have nothing of conceit: One writes of Rural Wit bubbled by Carmen, another of Inchantments, Bears and Monsters, and such a coil they keep with their new fancies,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58075:17"/>
that wit and sense are lost, quite lost, abolish't; nothing remains but the meer dregs of fancy; you may believe me Madam.</p>

                     <p>Had she been a degree above a Chambermaid, I had been pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but since 'tis as 'tis, I Gad I will Lampoon the whole world, Criticise upon all sorts of Persons and Things; be very envyous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proud, foolish, and ill natured, and then I shall be sure to outwear my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces and be famous.</p>

                        <hi>Bernard,</hi> give me thy hand, since our Fortunes have been much alike, let's now forget past Injuries, and unite a firmer Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then ever: I have done thee wrong I confess, but my amends shall be equally to it. For both Sword and Heart shall henceforth be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to thy service.</p>

                     <p>This Cancells all distasts, and therefore know as I desire not to be thought Treacherous, so I have a perfect value for the generous, which your Action in this demonstrates you to be. Be but my Friend, I shall ne'r wish other, nor shall a Mistress make us Jarre again: Thy Temper made thee false, and I well know</p>
                     <l>As too much Zeal can oft distract the Wise,</l>
                     <l>So Love has power to break what Friendship tyes,</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <l>OLd Plays, like Mistresses long since enjoy'd,</l>
            <l>Long after please whom they before had cloy'd;</l>
            <l>For Fancy chews the Cud on past Delight,</l>
            <l>And cheats it self to a new Appetiet.</l>
            <l>But then the Second Fit comes not so strong,</l>
            <l>Like second Agues, neither fierce nor long:</l>
            <l>What you have known before, grows sooner stale,</l>
            <l>And less provokes you, then an untold tale.</l>
            <l>That but refreshes what before you knew,</l>
            <l>But this discovers something that is new;</l>
            <l>Hence'tis, that at new Plays you come so soon,</l>
            <l>Like Bride-grooms, hot, to go to Bed e're noon!</l>
            <l>Or, if you are detain'd some little space,</l>
            <l>The stinking Footman's sent to keep your place.</l>
            <l>But, when a Play's reviv'd, you stay and dine,</l>
            <l>And drink till three, and then come dropping in;</l>
            <l>As Husband after absence, wait all day,</l>
            <l>And decently for Spouse till bed time stay,</l>
            <l>So, e're the Brethren's liberal fit was spent,</l>
            <l>The first wise <hi>Nonconformists</hi> under-went</l>
            <l>With ease, and batten'd in imprisonment.</l>
            <l>For greater gains, his zeal refus'd the less;</l>
            <l>Each day to him was worth a Diocess.</l>
            <l>But he who now, in hopes of equal gain,</l>
            <l>Will needs be Pris'ner, tryes the trick in vain;</l>
            <l>He melts in durance half his Grease away,</l>
            <l>To get, like us, poor thirteen Pounds a day.</l>
