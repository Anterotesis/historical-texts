         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Kings Maieſties Anſwer to the Petition of the Houſe of Commons, ſent on <date>Saturday laſt, the nine and twentieth of this inſtant <hi>Jan.</hi> 1642.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Majeſty having ſeriouſly conſidered of the Petition preſented to him from the Houſe of Commons, on Wedneſday the ſix and twentieth of this moneth, returnes this anſwer.</p>
            <p>That he was in good hope his gracious Meſſage, the twentieth of this moneth, to both Houſes would have produced ſome ſuch overture, which by offring what is fit on their parts to do, and what is proper for his Majeſty to grant, might beget a mutuall confidence in each other.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> His Majeſty did not expect, that having preferred a perſon of a known fortune, and an unqueſtionable reputation to that truſt, he ſhould be preſſed to remove him without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charge objected againſt him, and therefore returns this anſwer, That if upon due examination any particulars ſhall be preſented to his Majeſty, whereby it may appeare that his Majeſty was miſtaken in his opinion of the Gentleman, and that he is unfit for the truſt committed to him, his Majeſty will make no ſcruple of diſcharging him, but otherwiſe his Majeſty is obliged in juſtice to himſelfe, to preſerve his own work, leſt, his favour and good opinion may prove a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage &amp; misfortune to his ſervants without any other accuſation, of which his Majeſty doubts not this Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons will be ſo tender, (as of all buſineſſe wherein his Majeſties honour is ſo much concerned) that if they find no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall exceptions againſt his perſon, they will rather endeavour to ſatisfie and reform the feares of other men then (by complying with them) preſſe his Majeſty to any reſolution which may ſeem ſo much to reflect upon his honor &amp; juſtice.</p>
            <p>For the Forts and Caſtles of the Kingdome his Majesty is reſolved that they ſhall alwayes be in ſuch hands (and onely in ſuch) as the Parliament may ſafely confide in: But the nomination of any perſon to thoſe places, being ſo principall and inſeparable a flower of his Crowne, veſted in him, and derived to him from his Anceſtors by the Fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome he will reſerve to himſelfe; In beſtowing whereof, as his Maieſty will take care that no corrupt or ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter courſes ſhall prevaile with him, ſo he is willing to declare that he ſhall not be induced to expreſſe that favour ſo ſoon to any perſon as to thoſe whoſe good demeanour ſhall be eminent to him or his Parliament: And if he now hath or ſhall at any time by miſinformation confer ſuch a truſt upon an undeſerving perſon, he is and alwaies will be ready to leave him to the wiſdome and juſtice of his Parliament.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome (which by the Law is ſubject to no command but of his Majeſty, and of authority lawfully derived from him) when any particular courſe for ordering the ſame (which his Majeſty holds very neceſſary for the peace and ſecurity of his Kingdome) ſhall be conſidered and digeſted by his Parliament, and propoſed to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, his Majeſty will return ſuch an anſwer, as ſhall be agreeable to his honour and the ſafety of his people, His Majeſty being reſolved only to deny thoſe things, the granting whereof would alter the fundamentall Laws, and endanger the very foundation upon which the publike happineſſe and welfare of his people is founded and conſtituted, and would nouriſh a greater and more deſtructive jealouſie between the Crown and the Subjects, then any of theſe which would ſeem to be taken away by ſuch a ſatisfaction: And his Majeſty doth not doubt that his having granted more then ever King hath granted will ever perſwade his Houſe of Commons to aske more then ever Subjects have asked. And if they ſhall acquaint his Majeſty with the particular grounds of their doubts and feares, he will very willingly apply remedies proportionall to thoſe fears. For his Majeſty cals God to witneſſe, that the preſervation of the publick peace, and the laws and liberties of the Subject, ſhall alwaies be his Majeſties care and induſtry as of his life, and the lives of his deareſt Children. And therefore his Majeſty doth conjure the Houſe of Commons by all the acts of juſtice and favour they have received from him this Parliament, by their hopes of future happineſſe in his Majeſty, and in one anothers love of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the peace of this Kingdome (in which that of Ireland cannot be forgotten) that they will not be tranſported with jealouſies and apprehenſions of poſſible dangers, to put themſelves and his Majeſty into reall and preſent inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, but that they will ſpeedily purſue the way, propoſed by his Majeſtys former meſſage which in humane reaſon is the only way to compoſe the diſtractions of the Kingdom; and with Gods bleſſing will reſtore a great meaſure of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to King and People.</p>
