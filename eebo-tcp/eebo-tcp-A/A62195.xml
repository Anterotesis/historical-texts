            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SATYR AGAINST MARRIAGE: Directed to that Inconsiderable Animal, called HUSBAND.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>HVsband</hi>! thou Dull unpittied Miscreant,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Wedded</hi> to Noise, to Misery, and Want;</l>
            <l>Sold an Eternal Vassal for thy Life,</l>
            <l>Oblig'd to Cherish, and to Heat a Wife:</l>
            <l>Drudge on till <hi>Fifty</hi>; at thy Own Expence</l>
            <l>Breath out thy Life in one Impertinence;</l>
            <l>Repeat thy loath'd Embraces every Night</l>
            <l>Prompted to Act, by Duty (not Delight:)</l>
            <l>Christen thy froward <hi>Bantling</hi> every Year,</l>
            <l>And carefully thy Spurious Issue Rear:</l>
            <l>Go once a Week to see the Brat at Nurse,</l>
            <l>And let the Young Impostor drein thy Purse:</l>
            <l>Hedg-Sparrow-like, what <hi>Cuckoo's</hi> have begot</l>
            <l>Do thou maintain, Incorrigible Sott.</l>
            <l>Oh! I could curse the Pimp that could do less,</l>
            <l>He's beneath Pitty, and beyond Redress:</l>
            <l>Pox on him! let him go: what can I say?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Anathema's</hi> on him are Thrown away;</l>
            <l>The wretch is marry'd, &amp; has known the worst,</l>
            <l>And now his Blessing is, he can't be Curst.</l>
            <l>Marry'd! O Hell and Furies! Name it not,</l>
            <l>Hence, hence you Holy Cheats; a Plot, a Plot.</l>
            <l>Marriage is but a Licens'd way to Sin,</l>
            <l>A Nooze to catch Religious Wood-cocks in:</l>
            <l>Or the Nick-name of some Malicious Friend,</l>
            <l>Begot in Hell to Prosecute Mankind.</l>
            <l>'Tis the Destroyer of Our Peace and Health,</l>
            <l>Mispender of our precious Time and Wealth;</l>
            <l>The Enemy to Wit, Valour, Mirth, all</l>
            <l>That we can Virtuous, Good, or Pleasant call.</l>
            <l>By Day 'tis nothing but an endless Noise;</l>
            <l>By Night the Eccho of Forgotten Joys:</l>
            <l>Abroad the Sport and Wonder of the Crowd,</l>
            <l>At Home the hourly breach of what we vow'd:</l>
            <l>In it's Opium to our Lustful Rage,</l>
            <l>Which sleeps a while, and wakes again in Age.</l>
            <l>It heaps on all Men much (but useless) Care,</l>
            <l>Forthwith more Trouble, they less Happy are;</l>
            <l>It checks Youth, shortens life, &amp; taints the mind,</l>
            <l>Our Sences pauls, and strikes our Reason blind.</l>
            <l>Ye Gods! that Man by his own Slavish Law,</l>
            <l>Should on himself such Inconvenience draw:</l>
            <l>If we would Wiser Natures Laws Obey.</l>
            <l>Those chalk him out a far more pleasant way,</l>
            <l>She bids freely Look, Like, and Enjoy.</l>
            <l>Therefore when lusty Youth &amp; Wine conspire</l>
            <l>To Flame the Blood unto a Generous Fire;</l>
            <l>We must not think the Gallant will Indure</l>
            <l>The Durient Raging of his Calenture:</l>
            <l>Nor always in his single Pleasures Burn,</l>
            <l>Tho' Natures Hand-maid sometime serves the turn:</l>
            <l>No, he must have a sprightly youthful Wench,</l>
            <l>In equal floods of Love, his flame to quench;</l>
            <l>One that will hold him in her Clasping Arm,</l>
            <l>And in that Circle all his Spirits Charm;</l>
            <l>That with New Motion, and unpractis'd Art,</l>
            <l>Can raise his Soul, &amp; then insnare his Heart.</l>
            <l>Hence springs the Noble, Fortunate, and Great,</l>
            <l>Always Begot in Passion, and in Seat:</l>
            <l>But the Dull Off-spring of the Marriage-Bed,</l>
            <l>What is it? but a Humane shape in Lead:</l>
            <l>A Sloathful Lump Ingender'd of all Ills,</l>
            <l>Begot like <hi>D</hi>—against the Parents Wills.</l>
            <l>If it be Cukoldiz'd, it's Doubly Spoil'd,</l>
            <l>The Mothers Fear's Intail'd upon the Child.</l>
            <l>Thus whether Illegitimate, or Not,</l>
            <l>Cowards and Fools in Wedlock are Begot:</l>
            <l>Let no Enobled Soul himself Debase,</l>
            <l>By Lawful Ways to Dasterdize his Race;</l>
            <l>But if he must Pay Natures Debt in Kind,</l>
            <l>To check the growing Danger, let him find</l>
            <l>Some willing Female out; What tho' she be</l>
            <l>The very Scum and Dregs of Infamy:</l>
            <l>Tho' she be Linsey-Woolsey, Baud &amp; Whore,</l>
            <l>Close-stool to <hi>Venus,</hi> Natures Common-shore,</l>
            <l>Impudence, Folly, Brandy, and Disease,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Sundays</hi> Crack for <hi>Suburb</hi>-Prentices;</l>
            <l>What then? she's better then a Wife by half,</l>
            <l>And if thou'rt still Unmarry'd, thou art safe.</l>
            <l>with whores thou can'st but venture, what is lost</l>
            <l>May be Redeem'd again with Care and Cost;</l>
            <l>But a Damn'd Wife, Inevitable Fate,</l>
            <l>Destroys, Soul, Body, Credit, and Estates.</l>
