            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I meane this by our frendly fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp together at <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston Chelsey,</hi> and here at <hi>Hatfield</hi> her graces house: our pleasant studies in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng together <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rethorike, <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie:</hi> our free talke mingled alwayes with honest mirth: our trimme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferences of that present world: and to true iudgementes of the troublesome tyme that followed.</p>
            <p>These commodities I now reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber with some grief, which we then vsed with much pleasure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other fruites of frendshyp that faythfull good will could affourd.

countrey: And because I was not, I pray you let me be partaker by your letters of some fruite of that your iourney.</p>
            <p>We heare of great sturres in those parties: and how the Emperour a Prince of great wisedome and great power hath bene driuen to extreme shiftes, and that by the pollicie of mean men who were thought to be hys frendes, and not by the puisant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of others who were knowne to be his open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes.

No it

is not all one thing to know perfectly by reading and to performe perfectly in doyng I am not so vnaduised to take so much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, nor you so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frendly to looke for so much from me. But that you may know that I haue not bene altogether idle in this my absence, and that I will not come home as one that can say nothing of that he hath sene and heard abroad: I will homely and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (yet not altogether disorderly) part priuately vnto you such notes of affaires as I priuately marked for my selfe: which I either felt and saw, or learned in such place and of such perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as had willes to seeke for, and wayes to come by, and wittes to way the greatest matters that were to be marked in all these affaires.

Therefore let my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:379:5"/>

               <p>And although <hi>Octauio</hi> by good nature was harmeles in not seekyng reuenge, yet he was not careles by good reason in seekyng hys remedy but made oft &amp; great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaintes of his grieues to the Emperour, which were not so hotely made, but they were as coldly heard, that at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uio</hi> findyng least comfort, where of right he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for most ayde, &amp; seyng that displeasures could not be ended in <hi>Gonzaga</hi> nor could not be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Emperour: then he compelled agaynst his nature turned his hate due to <hi>Gonzaga</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge this vndeserued vnkyndnes in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, euen as <hi>Pausanias</hi> dyd with <hi>Phillip</hi> kyng of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> who conqueryng with pollicie and power all outward enemyes, was slayne when and where, he thought him selfe most sure of his dearest fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for vnkindnes, because <hi>Phillip</hi> ought and would not reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge <hi>Pausanias</hi> on him that had done him a foule displeasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octauio</hi> seyng what was done to his father euen when hys graundfather was Byshop of <hi>Rome,</hi> thought, that now as his house decayed, so his iopardy encreased. And therfore agaynst a desperate euill began to seeke for a desperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, which was set from <hi>Rome</hi> a shop alwayes open to any mischief as you shall perceiue in these few leaues if you marke them well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octauio</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained to <hi>Iulio tercio</hi> of the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges of <hi>Gonzaga</hi> &amp; of the vnkindnes of the Emperour, desiryng that by his wisedome and authoritie, he

would now succor him or els not onely he should leese his life but also the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should lose her right in <hi>Parma,</hi> as she had done before in <hi>Placentia.</hi> The Byshop gaue good eare to this talke, for he spied that hereby should be offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, a fit occasion to set the Emperour and <hi>Fraunce</hi> together by the eares. He thought the Emperour was to bigge in <hi>Italy</hi> hauyng on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side of <hi>Rome Naples</hi> vnder his obedience, on the other side <hi>Siena, Florence</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, besides <hi>Placentia, Millan, Montefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Piemount.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour beyng thus strong in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Byshop thought his own state to be his so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as it pleased the Emperour to let him haue it: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Parma</hi> were not left an entry for <hi>Fraunce</hi> to come into <hi>Italy,</hi> he might ouersoone be shut vp in present miserie when all outward ayde should be shut out from him.</p>
               <p>The Popes counsel was that <hi>Octauio</hi> should put him selfe vnder the <hi>French</hi> kynges protection whom hee knew would most willingly receiue him: <hi>Parma</hi> lying so fit for the <hi>French</hi> kyng, when soeuer he would set vpon the enterprice of <hi>Millan.</hi> This practise of the Pope <hi>Monsieur de Thermes</hi> the <hi>French</hi> kynges Ambassadours dyd vtter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consistorie of Cardinals at <hi>Rome:</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the Pope, not the kyng his master was the occasion of that warre.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Octauio</hi> with the whole house of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesia</hi> became thus <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch,</hi> the Emperour more fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the state of <hi>Millan</hi> then lamentyng the losse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:379:12"/>
of <hi>Octauio</hi> persuaded on his side the Byshop of <hi>Rome</hi> to require <hi>Parma</hi> as the Churches right, &amp; to punish <hi>Octauio</hi> as the Churches rebell, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that he him selfe as an obedient sonne of the Church would stretch out his arme and open his purse in that recouery of the Churches right: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles the Byshop must beare the name of the warre because hee might not breake peace with <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Thus Princes openly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; priuily brewyng debate although they got others to broch it, yet God commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly suffreth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to drinke most of the misery thereof in the end. The Byshop seyng that he must either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn the mischief or els it would not on so fast as he wished to haue it, set lustely vpon it: and first cited <hi>Octauio,</hi> after excommunicated him, and shortly after besieged <hi>Parma</hi> ayded both with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and money by the Emperour: which thyng the <hi>French</hi> kyng began to stomach,<note place="margin">Breach w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  </note> thinckyng that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour dyd offer him both wrong &amp; dishonor in not suffring him beyng a kyng to helpe a poore man that fled to his ayde. And thus these two Princes first helpyng others began by litle and litle to fall out them selues. And that the Pope dyd set these two Princes together, a <hi>Pasquill</hi> made at <hi>Rome</hi> and sent to this Court doth well declare. And seyng that you so well vnderstand the <hi>Italian</hi> toung and that if it were turned into English it would leese the whole grace therof, I will recite it in the toung that it was made in.</p>

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> king in the sommer .1551. proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med warre against <hi>Charles</hi> kyng of <hi>Spayne,</hi> abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that name for a sottlety to separate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole quarell from the Empire: when the Emperour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:379:13"/>
would not be persuaded at <hi>Augusta</hi> that either the <hi>Turke</hi> would, or the <hi>French</hi> kyng durst make him open warre, or that any Prince in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> could be entised to breake out with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur Mariliacke</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour at <hi>Augusta</hi> euer bare the Emperour in hand that such rumors of war were raysed of displeasure &amp; that his master intended nothyng so much as the continuance of amitie, yea this he durst do, when many in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours court knew that the war was already proclaimed in <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour blinded with the ouer good opinion of his own wisedome, likyng onely what himselfe listed, and contemnyng easely all aduise of others (which selfe will condition doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follow, and as commonly doth hurt all great wittes) dyd not onely at this tyme suffer him selfe thus to be abused: but also afterward more craftely by the Pope for the continuaunce of warre at <hi>Parma,</hi> &amp; more boldly by Duke <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> for his repayre to <hi>Inspruke,</hi> and not the least of all, now lately at <hi>Metz</hi> by some of his owne counsellours for the recouery of that towne.</p>
               <p>But Princes and great personages whiche will heare but what and whom they list, at the length fayle when they would not, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame whom they should not: But it is well done that as great men may by authoritie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the good aduise of others: so God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide by right iudgement that they haue leaue in the ende to beare both the losse and shame therof them selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:379:14"/>Thus ye see how the Pope was both the brewer and brocher and also bringer of ill lucke to both these Princes, and as it came wel to passe dranke well of it him selfe both with expences of great treasures, and with the losse of many lyues and specially of two noble gentlemen, the Prince of <hi>Macedonia</hi> &amp; <hi>Il Seign<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Gionan Baptista di Monte</hi> his owne nephew: but the Popes care was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of money nor men, so that he might set the two Princes surely together. And therfore was not onely content (as a man might say) to hasard <hi>Parma</hi> on the meyne chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but to make the two Princes better sporte &amp; fresher game, set also eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then <hi>Mirandula</hi> on a bye chaunce that mischief e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough might come together.</p>
               <p>When the Princes were well in and the one so lusty with good lucke that hee had no lust to leaue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pope.</hi>
                  </note> and the other so chafed with leesyng, that still he would venture. Besides their playing in sporte for the Pope at <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Mirandula,</hi>

                     <hi>Parma.</hi>

               <p>And when the Pope saw they were so hote at it as he well knew as the one would not start in so great good lucke: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other could not leaue by so much shame of losse. And although it did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:379:14"/>
him good to see them cope so lustely together: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles he thought it scarce his surety that they should play so nere his elbow so earnestly, least if they fell to farre out and the one should winne to much of the other, then he peraduenture would compell at length the Pope himselfe which bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the play to kepe him sport afterward for that that he had in <hi>Italy.</hi> And therfore very craftely he gat them to play in an other place,<note place="margin">The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</note> and tooke vp the game for <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Mirandula</hi> taking truce with <hi>Fraunce</hi> for certaine yeares, and bad them make what sport they would farther of in <hi>Loraigne</hi> &amp; <hi>Picardy.</hi> And that there should lacke neither iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nor spite in the Popes doynges, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour saw that whether hee would or no, the Pope would needes fall in with <hi>Fraunce,</hi> then he desired the Pope that such bastilians and fortes of fence as were made about <hi>Mirandula</hi> when it was besieged might either be deliuered to hys mens handes or els defaced that the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> might not haue them, which request was very reasonable seyng the Emperour had bene at all the charge in makyng of them: But they were neither deliuered nor defaced, nor left indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but so put into the <hi>French mens</hi> handes, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula</hi> now is made very strong to the <hi>French</hi> faction by Emperours money and the Popes falsehode.</p>
               <p>This fact was very wrongfull of the Pope for the deede: but more spitefull for the tyme: for euen when Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> had wonne <hi>Augusta,</hi> euen then the Pope gaue vp the siege of <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:379:15"/>
and fell in with <hi>Fraunce</hi> that care enough might come vppon the Emperour together both out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and out of <hi>Italy</hi> at once. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day .25. Iune. 1553. when I was writyng this place, commeth newes to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> that the Pope hath of new played with the Emperour more foule play at <hi>Siena,</hi> then he dyd before at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula:</hi> For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour had bene at pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing charges in kepyng a great host, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of <hi>Siena</hi> from December last vnto Iune: the Pope would needes become stickler in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betwene the Emperour, the <hi>French</hi> kyng and <hi>Siena</hi> promising such conditions to all, as neither of the Princes should lose honour and yet <hi>Siena</hi> should haue had liberties. The Emperour good man yet agayne trustyng him who so spightfully had deceaued hym before dismissed hys hoste, which done <hi>Siena</hi> was left still in the <hi>French me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: who therby haue such oportunitie to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor is not like by force to recouer it <hi>Piramus</hi> Secretary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor told this tale to Syr <hi>Phillip Hobby</hi> &amp; the Byshop of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster openly at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table: which <hi>Piramus</hi> is a Papist for his life: &amp; beyng asked how he could excuse the Popes vnkyndnes agaynst his master y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: Hee aunswered smilyng <hi>Iulius tercius</hi> is a knaue but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope is an honest ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which saying is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this court.

<q>Out out alas alas, I dye for lacke of goodes.</q>
But euery one singeth this song:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:379:16"/>
                  <q>Out out alas alas, I dye for lacke of frendes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For a Prince that will take me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goods when he listeth without order shall want mens hartes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he needeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out pitie: but in hauyng their hartes he shall neuer lacke their goodes, as the good kyng <hi>Cirus</hi> sayd to the rich kyng <hi>Craesus.</hi> And to haue the peoples hartes the next way is to be gentle to euery one, iust to all and liberall to many and especially to such as either by excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of wit or good will in true seruice do well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it. Also to set his chiefest ioy not in priuate pleasure like <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> but in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth as we haue example of <hi>Titus Vespasianus</hi>: and to thinke his treasure greatest, not when his coffers be fullest as <hi>Craesus</hi> dyd, but when his subiectes be richest as <hi>Cyrus</hi> dyd &amp; that through hys wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and care as all prayse worthy princes haue euer hetherto done. And what will the people re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der agayn to such a Prince? A small subsidy, with a great grudge? no, but their whole hartes to loue him: their whole goodes to ayde hym: theyr handes ready to defende hym, and theyr lyues as ready to dye for hym when soeuer he shall haue neede. A Prince that thus doth lyue and thus is loued at home may be enuyed with much prayse, and hated with smal hurte of any power abroad.</p>
               <p>And therfore haue I heard wisemen discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the gouernement in <hi>Fraunce</hi> in makyng theyr people almost slaues, and from thence a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying of some in England,<note place="margin">Syr Iohn Gates wish.</note> that would haue the people neither witty nor wealthy when wit is the meare gift of GOD: So that to wish
<pb facs="tcp:379:17"/>
men lesse wit that haue it, is to count God scarse wise that gaue it. And wealth of the people as Scripture sayth: is the glory of a Prince, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety of hys raigne. But suspition in all gouerning breedeth such sayinges, when wrong doth beare such swynge, as ill conscience doth alwayes wish that men should lacke either wit to perceaue or habilitie to amende whatsoeuer is done amisse. But God send such <hi>Achitophels</hi> better ende then their counsels doth deserue which would sene wise by other mens folly, and would be rich by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens pouertie.</p>
               <p>To returne to the Uiceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of those in this Court which haue priuate cause to say wel on him do speake it bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly, that he was such a one as neuer could content his couetousnes with money, nor neuer satisfie his crueltie with bloud: And so by this foule meane many gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Naples</hi> haue lost some theyr liues but moe theyr liuynges, and almost all theyr libertie. And there be at this day as men say here that know it a good sort of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes <hi>Neapolitanes,</hi> named <hi>Foriensuti,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng spoyled at home by violence, robbe other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for neede, which comber so the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> as no man departeth commonly from <hi>Rome</hi> without company which commeth to <hi>Naples</hi> without robbyng.</p>
               <p>The whole body of the kyngdome of <hi>Naples</hi> was so distempered inwardly with this misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with a litle outward occasion it would ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue burst forth into a foule sore. A lesse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

then the rauishyng of <hi>Lucrece,</hi> A meaner ayde then the helpe of <hi>Brutus,</hi> was thought sufficient to haue stirred vp this inward grudge to open reuenge. But see how God prouided for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the quyet of that kingdome: For God in takyng away one <hi>Spanyard</hi> hath made <hi>Naples</hi> now more strong, then if the Emperour had set xx. thousand of the best in <hi>Spayne</hi> there: for euen this last Lent. 1553. <hi>Don Pietro di Toledo</hi> dyed at <hi>Florence</hi> by whose goyng away mens hartes in <hi>Naples</hi> be so come agayne to the Emperour, as he shall now haue lesse neede either to care for the fyne fetches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or to feare the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Turke.</hi> A gentleman of this Court a true seruaunt to the Emperour sayd merely in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany where I was, that his master the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had won more in <hi>Naples</hi> by the death of the Uiceroy, then he had lost in <hi>Lorraigne</hi> by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng of <hi>Metz.</hi>

               <p>The Prince beyng here at <hi>Bruxels</hi> humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought hys Maiestie to pitie the miserie of hys poore subiectes: who by this sute gat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for hys cliantes, wordes without hope: and of the Uiceroy for him selfe hatred without ende. The Prince yet alwayes bare hym selfe so wisely, that he could not without some sturre
<pb facs="tcp:379:18"/>
be thrust downe openly: and ridyng on his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he was once shot with a dagge secretly.</p>
               <p>Thus he seyng no ende of displeasure in the Uiceroy no hope of remedy in the Emperour, when he saw the <hi>Turke</hi> on the Sea, the <hi>French</hi> kyng in the field, Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vp, and a good part of <hi>Italy</hi> either risen, or ready to rise, thinkyng the tyme come of theyr most hope for helpe by the Princes, and of least feare of punishment by the Emperour, came forth to play his part also amongest the rest: who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flying first to the <hi>French</hi> kyng and after by hys counsell as it is sayd to the <hi>Turke,</hi> is compelled to venture vppon many hard fortunes. And what succes he shall haue either of helpe in <hi>Fraunce</hi> or comfort of the <hi>Turke,</hi> or mercy of the Emperour I can not yet write.

               <p>And here a writer may learne, of Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires a good lesson to beware of parcialitie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in flattery, or spight: For although thereby a man may please his owne Prince presently yet he may perchaunce as much hurt hym in the end as <hi>Luis de Auila</hi> dyd hurt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour his master in writyng of this booke.

vnto it with his own rod: for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former warres of <hi>Germany</hi> being on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours side he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the handes of Duke <hi>Iohn Fridericke</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he is charged sore withall by <hi>Luice de Auila</hi> and that with so spightfull and open a mouth, as moued the Marches to offer hym the combat as I sayd before.

The Emperour shortly after came downe hether to <hi>Bruxels</hi> hauyng the Marches in his company, who lookyng for a great recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of hys costes, and receiuyng litle, and seyng his honor not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defaced in the field presently when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner, but also defamed for euer by writing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the Emperours priuiledge to grow abroad in the world began to take the matter so vnkindly, that he left comming to the Court, and kept his owne house: rising euery day very early: and writing all the forenoone very diligently yet what he did no man knew: so that his absence breed a talke in the Court, and his soddein and secret study wrought a wonderfull gelousy of his doynges in the Emperours head: for he knew the Marches to haue courage enough to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ouer great: and therfore sent <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sieur Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:</hi> vnto the Marches house as of hym selfe to grope out his doynges, who declared vnto the Marches y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours great goodwil towards hym, shewyng that his Maiestie was purposed to make him a great personage, &amp; to begyn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all had in mynde to geue hym a goodly and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table office in all his Mintes.</p>
               <p>The Marches aunswered roundly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the first, that the Emperour could not make him greater then he was, beyng Marches of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge:</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:379:22"/>
And as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office in the Minte, he said smiling, he vsed not oft to tell his owne money, &amp; therefore he thought not to make the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; so made nothing of the Emperours offer: onely hee desired <hi>Grandeuill</hi> that the Emperour would geue him leaue to go home to his owne, which he obtained: And at his departure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour gaue him a patent of 4000. crownes by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare: But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marches was not well foure miles out of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> when he sent the patent by post to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour agayne saying: his Maiestie might better bestow it on some that had more neede of it. And in deede the Marches is as loth to receiue of his frendes by beneuolence, as he is ready to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys enemies by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which commeth somewhat of to stout a courage.</p>
               <p>Thus the Marches came home not best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as it may well appeare: nor saw not the Emperour after till he met hym at the siege of <hi>Metz. Casmirus</hi> his father and the Marches hym selfe were great spenders and deepe detters: the one for his stoutnes in warre, the other for his lustines in youth. And therefore became quicke borrowers &amp; slow payers, which thyng brought the Marches into such trouble as hee had with the City of <hi>Noremberge</hi> with his neighbours the Bishop of <hi>Herbipolis</hi> and with his Godfather the Byshop of <hi>Pamberge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marches was no sooner come home, but these Byshops spying their tyme, when he had left the Emperours Court, and had quite lost or much lessened his frendship there, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trouble
<pb facs="tcp:379:23"/>
him with new suites for old debtes in <hi>Camera Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periali,</hi> at <hi>Spires,</hi> where the Marches because hee lacked either fauour in the Court, or experience in young yeares, or good matter on his side, was alwayes wrong to the worst, and to stuffe vp his stomach with more matter of vnkindnes against the Emperour, it is sayd that letters from the greatest in the Emperours Court were neuer lackyng at <hi>Spires</hi> to helpe forward processe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Marches.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this tyme bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the siege of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi> where Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> by the Emperour was appoynted generall. The Marches either weery of leesyng at home by sutes, or desirous to winne abroad by warre, or els purposing to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise some way to reuenge his displeasures made him ready to serue against <hi>Madenburg</hi> with 500. horse. And in the begynnyng of the spryng of the yeare .1551. he set forward and in his way went to visite <hi>Ernestus</hi> his cosin Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Iohn Fridericke</hi> the prisoner with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.

               <p>Duke <hi>Ernestus</hi> told the Commissary that he his landes and lyfe were at his Maiesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, his Maiestie knew how quietly he bare him selfe alwayes, &amp; therfore his trust was as he willingly serued the Emperour with true obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so he might as freely serue God with right conscience: for he would rather leaue hys landes and goodes and all to the Emperour, and go beg with his wife &amp; children, then they would forsake the way of the Gospell which God hath commaunded them to follow.</p>
               <p>And marke how euidently God dyd declare both how much such a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission sent out abroad in <hi>Germany</hi> agaynst him and hys word dyd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him: and also how much the prayers and sighyng hartes of iust men do in tyme preuayle with hym: for as a man of much honesty &amp; great

knowledge in all the matters of <hi>Germany</hi> did tell me, assoone as this Commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was once abroad, the practises in <hi>Germany</hi> began to styrre, yet not so openly as the Emperour might haue iust cause to withstand them, nor so couertly but he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion enough to mistrust them: and thereby he both lacked helpe for open remedy, and wanted no displeasure for inward grief.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> Marches <hi>Albert,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus Swendy</hi> sate at supper togethers: &amp; as they were talkyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>The Duke liked not this hoate talke in hys house and at his table, but sayd: Cosin you speake but merely, and not as you thincke, adding much the prayse of the Emperours gentlenes shewed to many, and of his promise kept withall. Well (quoth the Marches) if he had bene either kynde where men haue deserued or would haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that hee promised: neither should I at this tyme accuse hym, nor you haue sit here in this place to defende hym, for he promised to geue me this house with all the landes that thereto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: but ye be affrayd Cosin (quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marches) lest this talke be to loud, and so heard to farre of: when in deede if the Commissarie here, be so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

a man as I take him, and so true to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as he should be, he will not fayle to say what he hath heard, and on the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary I bryng thee good lucke, and drancke of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym a great glasse of wine. <hi>Lazarus Swendyes</hi> talke then sounded ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and quietly, for he was sore affrayed of the Marches. But he was no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at home with the Emperour, but word was sent straight to Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> that the Marches who was as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to <hi>Madenburg</hi> if he would needes serue there, should serue without wages.</p>
               <p>Ye may be sure the Marches was chafed a new with this newes who already had lost a great sort of hys men and now must leese hys whole labour thether, and all his wages there, besides the losse of hys honour in takyng such shame of hys enemies, &amp; receiuyng such vnkynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Emperour.</p>
               <p>The Marches was not so greeued but Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> was as well contented with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: for euen then was Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> Secretary practisyng by Baron <hi>Hadeckes</hi> aduise with the <hi>French</hi> kyng for the sturre which dyd follow: and therfore was glad when he saw the Marches might be made hys so easely whiche came very soone to passe: so that the Marches for the same purpose in the ende of the same yeare went into <hi>Fraunce</hi> secretly, and was there with <hi>Shertly</hi> as a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Launce Knight, and named hymselfe Captaine <hi>Paul,</hi> lest the Emperour spials should get out his doynges: where by the aduise of <hi>Shertly</hi> hee practised with the <hi>French</hi> kyng for

the warres which followed after. This matter was told vnto me by <hi>Iohn Mecardus</hi> one of the chief Preachers in <hi>Augusta,</hi> who beyng banished the Empiere, when and how ye shall heare after was fayne to flye, and was with <hi>Shertly</hi> the same yeare in <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marches came out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of the yeare .1552. and out of hand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vp men, but his purpose was not knowne, yet the Emperour mistrusted the matter, beyng at <hi>Insburg,</hi> sent <hi>Doct. Hasius</hi> one of hys counsell, to know what cause he had to make such sturre. This <hi>Doct. Hasius</hi> was once an earnest protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and wrote a booke on that side, &amp; was one of the <hi>Palsgraues</hi> priuy counsell: But for hope to clime higher, he was very ready to be entised by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to forsake first his master &amp; then God: By who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour knew much of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes Protestants purposes, for he was commonly one whom they had vsed in all their Dietes and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate practises: which thing caused the Emperour to seeke to haue hym: that by his head he might the easelyer ouerthrow the Protestantes, &amp; with them God and hys word in all <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>Horsemen and footemen in great companies still gathered to the Marches: and in the ende of March he marched forward to <hi>Augusta,</hi> where he, Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> the young <hi>Lansgraue,</hi> the duke of <hi>Mechelburg, George,</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> with <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunswycke,</hi> and other Princes confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate met together and besieged that Citie, Where I will leaue the Marches till I haue brought Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> and hys doinges to the same time, and to the same place.</p>

               <p>And as hee doth thus read with such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, euen so he can report with such a memory what soeuer he doth read, and namely histories, as at his table on euery new occasion he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to recite some new story which hee doth with such pleasure and vtterance as men be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leaue their meat to heare him talke: and yet hee hym selfe is not disdaynfull to heare the meanest nor will ouerwhart any mans reason.

such in a great house is able to turne and tosse the quietnes of all.

                  <hi>Francisco</hi> Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> Agent with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was asked, I beyng by at <hi>Augusta,</hi> how he could excuse his masters vnkindnes towards <hi>Iohn Fredericke</hi> who had bene such a father vnto him. He graunted that Duke <hi>Fredericke</hi> had bene great frend vnto him, and might haue a greater if he had would, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lesse strife had followed then did. And troth it is (sayd he) as Duke <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke</hi> kept my master in his right, so afterward he put him from part of his right, when in his yong yeares hee chopped and chaunged landes with him when he listed: which thing my master com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to mans state much misliked, and oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnyng could neuer obtayne remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Kyndnes should rather haue kyndly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so vnkyndly haue decayed specially when the one was trusted withall, and the other of

such yeares, as he had neither wit to perceiue nor power to amend if any iniurie were offred vnto hym. Troth also it is that my master was brought vp in Duke <hi>Frederickes</hi> house: but he hath more cause to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine on them that brought him thether, then to thanke such as brought him vp there, where he had alwayes plentie of drinke and as much scant of good teachyng to come to such vertue and learnyng as dyd belong to a Prince of his state.</p>
               <p>Now whether this talke was altogether true, or, an ill excuse was made to couer a foule fact I can not tell: but sure I am <hi>Francisco</hi> sayd thus. I haue heard wise men say that it is not lyke, that for such a priuate strife Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> would haue so forsaken not onely his frend and kinsman, but also his father in law or would for the losse a litle, or rather for the chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of a peece haue so hassarded his whole estate, which was once in the first warre all gone saue <hi>Lypsia,</hi> and one other towne, beside the losse of loue in whole <hi>Germany</hi> and his good name amongest all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes, in the middest of whom all hys li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges do lye.</p>

                  </note>Well surely there was some great cause that could sturre vp so great a strife, and that was as wise men and wel willyng on Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> side in myne opinion haue truly iudged, the foule vice of ambition.</p>
               <p>O Lord how many worthy men hath this one vice beareft from good common weales, which for all other respectes were most vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:379:29"/>
of that end they came vnto. My hart weepes for those noble men of England, whose valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in warre, whose wisedome in peace this Realme shal want and wayle and wish and wish for in tyme to come, which of late by this onely vice haue bene taken from vs. Examples, lesse for our grief and as fit for this purpose be plenty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in other states.</p>
               <p>Ouer many experiences do teach vs, though a Prince be wise stout liberall gentle mercyfull and excellently learned, though he deserue all the prayse, that vertue nature and fortune ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affourd him, yea that wit it selfe can wish for as we read that noble <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> had, and that by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of those that loued him not, neuertheles if these two foule verses of <hi>Euripides.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Do right alway and wrong refraine.</l>
                  <l>Except onely for rule and raigne.</l>
               </q>
               <p>If these verses I say do not onely sound well in his eare, but sincke deepe also in his hart, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is neither kindred, frendship, law, othe, obedience, countrey, God, nor his owne life, but he will hassard to leese all rather then to pursue this foule vice: For <hi>Polynices,</hi> for whom this verse was first made in <hi>Greeke,</hi> did fill not onely his owne countrey full of dead carcasses, but also whole <hi>Greece</hi> full of weepyng widdowes. And <hi>Caesar</hi> for whom the same verse was turned into <hi>Latin</hi> did not onely turne vpside down the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest common wealth that euer GOD suffred to stand vpon the earth: but also lossed the whole
<pb facs="tcp:379:30"/>
world with battayle and slaughter euen almost from the sunne setting vnto the sunne rising. And did not stop to bryng souldiours to do mischief further then any man now dare iourney by land either for pleasure or profite.</p>
               <p>But see the fruite and end which this vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great growing bringeth men vnto: Both these Princes were slaine the one by his brother the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his owne sonne, of whom in life, nature &amp; benefites would they should haue taken most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of. But men that loue to clime to hye haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes least feare, and therefore by reason fall most soddenly and also fardest downe: yea the very bowghes that helped hym vp will now whip him in fallyng downe: For who so in cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng trusteth when he is goyng vp any bough at all ouer much, though hee seeme to tread ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so surely vppon it yet if he once begyn to slyp the same selfe bough is reddiest to beat him that seemed before surest to beare him. Examples hereof be seen dayly and forgotten hereby.</p>
               <p>An other mischief chaunceth commonly to these high climers: that they will heare no man so gladly as such which are euer hartenyng them to clime still. If wise and good men durst speake more freely then they do: great men should do both others and them selues lesse harme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are wont to do. He hateth him selfe and hasteth his owne hurt that is content to heare none so gladly as either a foole or a flatterer. A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full follie in a great man him selfe and some peace of miserie in a whole common wealth, where
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:379:30"/>
fooles chiefly, and flatterers may speake freely what they will and wise men and good men shal commonly be shent, if they speake what they should.</p>
               <p>And how commeth this to passe? it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plague of God for great mens sinnes, and the plaine high way to their iust punishment. And when God suffreth them so willingly to graunt freedome to follie and so gladly to geue hearyng to flattery: But see when the great man is gone and hath playd his part, fooles and flatterers be stil vpon the stage. Such liue in all worldes, such laugh in all miseries: such <hi>Daui</hi> and <hi>Getae,</hi> haue alwayes the longest partes: and go out who shal they tary in place still. I know also many a good <hi>mitio,</hi> which haue played long partes whom I pray God kepe long still vpon the stage. And I trust no man will be miscontent with my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall saying except conscience do pricke him of his owne priuate ill doyng.</p>
               <p>There be common wealthes where freedome in speakyng truth hath kept great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in doyng ill: for free and frendly aduise is the trimmest glasse that any great man can vse to spye his owne fault in: which taken away they runne commonly so farre in foule doyng, as some neuer stay till they passe all remedy saue onely to late repentaunce. And as I would haue no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery but wish for freedome: So in no wise do I commend ouermuch boldnes, or any kind of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But that libertie in speakyng should be so mingled with good will and discretion, as no
<pb facs="tcp:379:31"/>
great person should be vnhonorably spoken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or any meane man touched out of order either for sport or spite: as some vnquiet heades neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with any state are euer procuryng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either secretly with raylyng billes, or openly with taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng songes, or els some scoffing common play.</p>
               <p>An other kynd of to bold talkers surpasse all these selly rumors, who are called, and so will be, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> discoursers of all Princes affaires. These make a great accompt of them selues and will be commonly formost in any prease, and lustly with out blushing shoulder backe others: These will seeme to see further needes, in any secret affayre then the best and wisest cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellor a Prince hath. These be the open flatterers and priuy mislikers of all good counsellors doynges. And one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon note, the most part of this brotherhode of discoursers commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly cary with them where they be bold to speake: to like better <hi>Tullies</hi> Offices, then S. Paules Epistles: and a tale in <hi>Bocace,</hi> then a story of the Bible.</p>
               <p>And therfore for any Religion earnest setters forth of present tyme: with consciences confirmed with <hi>Machiauelles</hi> doctrine to thincke say and do whatsoeuer may serue best for profite or pleasure. But as concernyng flatterers and raylers to say mine opinion whether I like worse, surely as I haue read few men to haue bene hurt with bitter poysons: so haue I heard of as few great men to haue bene greatly harmed with sharpe talke: but are so ware therin, that commonly they wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of theyr hurt before they feele harme. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:379:31"/>
flattery agayne is so sweete, that it pleaseth best, when it hurteth most, and therfore is alwayes to be feared: because it alwayes delighteth, but in lookyng aside to these hye climers, I haue gone out of the way, of mine owne matter.</p>
               <p>To returne to Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> he saw that Duke <hi>Frederickes</hi> fallyng might be his rising, and perchaunce was moued with some old iniuries, but beyng of young yeares and of nature full of desire and courage he was a trimme pray for old practises to be easely caryed away with fayre new promises sounding altogether to honor and profite, and so he forsoke his father and his frend, and became wholy the Emperours till hee had brought both them into prison. Duke <hi>Fredericke</hi> was taken in the field and so became the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours iust prisoner. Yet as long as the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> was abroad, the Emperour thought his purpose neuer atchieued, and therefore practised a new with duke <hi>Maurice</hi> to get him also into his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> with <hi>Ioachim</hi> Elector of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge</hi> became meanes betwixt the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> and the Emperour. Conditions both of mercy from the one, and of amendes from the other were drawen out. <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Marches bound them selues sureties to the <hi>La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgraues</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for their fathers safe returne: for amongest the rest of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions this was one of the chiefest, that he should come in no prison. And so at <hi>Hala</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> he came boldly to the Emperours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, who receiued him not very cherefully, nor gaue him not his hand which in <hi>Germany</hi> is the
<pb facs="tcp:379:32"/>
very token of an assured reconsiliation.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> made the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and called also thether Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the Marches of <hi>Brade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burg</hi> where they had great chere: but after supper it was told Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Marches, that they might depart for the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> must lodge there that night.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, they reasoned of the matter wholly to this purpose that the Emperours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises not the <hi>Lansgraues</hi> person ought to be kept. Aunswere was made that the Emperour went no further then conditions led him which were that he should not be kept in euerlastyng prison: and they agayne replyed he ought to be kept in no prison. When I was at <hi>Villacho</hi> in <hi>Carinthia</hi> I asked Duke <hi>Frederickes</hi> Preacher what were the very wordes in <hi>Dutch,</hi> wherby the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> agaynst his lookyng was kept in prison. He sayd the fallacion was very pretty and notable and tooke his penne and wrote in my booke the very wordes wherin the very controuersie stode, duke <hi>Maurice</hi> sayd it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicht in emig gefengknes .i. Not in any prison.</hi> The Imperials sayd no, but thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicht in ewig gefengknes .i. Not in euerlastyng pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> And how soone <hi>emig,</hi> may be turned into <hi>ewig,</hi> not with scrape of knife, but with the least dash of a pen so that it shall neuer be perceiued, a man that will proue, may easely see.</p>
               <p>Moreouer <hi>Luice d'Auila</hi> in his booke doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce that the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> did so deceaue hym selfe with his owne conditions in makyng of which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:379:32"/>
as <hi>d'Auila</hi> saith, he was wont to esteeme his own wit aboue all other mens. Well, how so euer it came to passe the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> was kept in prison. And from that houre Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> fell from the Emperour thinckyng hym selfe most vnkyndly ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, that he by whose meanes chiefly the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had won such honor in <hi>Saxony,</hi> must now be rewarded with shame in all <hi>Germany,</hi> and be called a traytor to GOD, and hys countrey, his father, and his frend. And though he was greeued inwardly at the hart, yet he bare all thynges quietly in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance purposing though he had lost will yet would he not leese his profite, and so hiding his hurt presently, whilest some fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time should discouer some better remedy, he went with the Emperour to <hi>Augusta,</hi> where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to hys promise he was made Elector. Yet the same night after hys solemne creation, two verses set vppon his gate might more greue him, then all that honour could delight hym, which were these.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Seu Dux, seu Princeps, seu nunc dicaris Elector.</l>
                  <l>Mauricij Patriae proditor ipse tui.</l>
               </q>
               <p>After that he had gotten that he looked for, he gat him home into his countrey: from whence afterward the Emperour with no pollicie could euer bryng hym, he alwayes alledgyng, the feare that he had of some sturre by Duke <hi>Frederickes</hi> children.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the <hi>Germaines</hi> much mislyked the doynges of Duke <hi>Maurice.</hi> But after that he had
<pb facs="tcp:379:33"/>
felt him selfe so vnkyndly abused as for his good seruice to be made the betrayer of his father, he tooke such matters in hand &amp; brought them so to passe, as he recouered the loue of his countrey and purchased such hate of his enemyes, as the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> tooke their displeasure from all other, and bestowed wholly vppon the Duke <hi>Maurice</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet he bare him selfe with such wit, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage agaynst them, as they had alwayes cause to feare hym and neuer occasion to contemne hym: Yea if he had liued he would sooner men thinke haue driuen all <hi>Spanyardes</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> then they should haue hurt hym in <hi>Saxony,</hi> for he had ioyned vnto him such strength, and there was in him such pollicie, as they durst neuer haue come vppon him with power, nor neuer should haue gone beyond hym with wit. He had so displeased the Emperour as he knew wel neither his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: nor his life could make amendes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> x. poundes of Benefites which he was able to do, could not way with one ounce of displeasure that he had already done: and therefore neuer after sought to seeke his loue which he knew could neuer be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: but gaue him selfe wholy to set vp <hi>Maximilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> who beyng him selfe of great power, and of all other most beloued for his worthynes in all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and now vsing the head and hand of duke <hi>Maurice</hi> and his frendes, and hauyng the helpe of as many as hated the <hi>Spanyardes,</hi> that is to say almost all Protestantes and Papistes to in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> he should easely haue obtained what soeuer he had gone about.

for euen this day when I was writyng this place, came word to this Court, that Marches <hi>Albert,</hi> and Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> had fought, where the Marches had lost the field, and Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> had lost his life: which whole battaile because it is notable, I would here at length describe, but that I should wander to farre from my purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed matter: and therfore I in an other place, or els some other with better oportunitie shall at large report the matter.</p>

could for his purpose be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent at one time to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all: &amp; for to do hurt enough to the Emperor would become at once by solemne league, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Papish, Turkish, &amp; deuillish. But such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that cary nothyng els but the name of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp Gods word, deserue the same prayse and the same end that that Prince dyd, who semed so ready to beare vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arke of the Lord, &amp; yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise pursued Gods true Prophetes &amp; his word.</p>
               <p>Agayne how much the <hi>French</hi> kyng cared for the libertie of <hi>Germany</hi> he well declared in stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng away so vnhonorably from the Empire the Citie of <hi>Metz.</hi> But he thinckyng to abuse Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> for his ambitious purpose, in very deede &amp; in the end Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> vsed him as he should: for first he made him pay well for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole warres in <hi>Germany</hi> as it is sayd .200000. crownes a moneth: And after when the <hi>French</hi> kyng fell to catching of Cities, duke <hi>Maurice</hi> tendryng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of his countrey brake of with hym, and began to parle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the good kyng of <hi>Romanes</hi> at <hi>Luiz,</hi> which thyng whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch</hi> kyng heard came within ij. miles of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> he straight way hyed more hastly &amp; with more disorder, for all his great hast, out of <hi>Germany,</hi> as they say that were there, then the Emperour being sicke without company and pressed by his enemy dyd go from <hi>Insburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And see how nobly Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> did which for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, durst fall from the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch</hi> kyng before he atchieued any thyng agaynst the Emperour. And rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Germany</hi> should leese her Cities so by the <hi>French</hi> king, he had leuer has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sard,
<pb facs="tcp:379:35"/>
both the leesing of his enterprice, &amp; also the leauyng of hys father in law still in prison with the Emperour. But as he had wit to take money ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of the <hi>French</hi> kyng: so had he wit also to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him selfe so fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home as he durst first fall out with the <hi>French</hi> kyng, &amp; durst also after to set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour till he had brought his honest pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to passe. For there is not almost any in this Court but they will say duke <hi>Maurice</hi> did honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in deliuering his father by strong hand, which before left no fayre meane vnproued to do that humbly by entreaty, which after, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to bryng to passe stoutly by force. And I pray you first marke well what he did and then iudge tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if any thing was done that he ought not to do.</p>
               <p>For first he him selfe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marches of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge</hi> most humbly by priuate sute laboured for the <hi>Lansgraues</hi> deliuery offring to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, princely offers, and not to be refused: as a huge summe of money: a fayre quantitie of great ordinaunce,<note place="margin">Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> offer for the <hi>La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgraues</hi> deliuery.</note> certaine holdes of his, some to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, some geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour: and also perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pledges of great houses for hys good habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce all the residue of his life.</p>
               <p>After whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this sute was not regarded they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine procured all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes &amp; states of <hi>Germany</hi> beyng at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diet at <hi>Augusta.</hi> an .1548. to be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble intercessors for him, offring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> selfe same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions rehearsed before addyng this more to become su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reties them selues in any bande to his Maiestie for his due obedience for tyme to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly by the Prince of <hi>Spayne</hi> Duke <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:379:35"/>
neuer left to entreat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, yea he was so carefull of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, that his Ambassadors fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Prince euen to his shipping at <hi>Genoa:</hi> who had spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presently before, &amp; wrote ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to his father for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Lansgraues</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery, &amp; it would not be. And wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may say it was not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wisest deede that euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor did, to deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince this sute: for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince had bene made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuerer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ij. princes out of captiuity, he had won therby such fauor in all <hi>Germany,</hi> as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all doubt he had bene made coadiutor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the k. of <hi>Romaines</hi> his vncle, And afterward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Which thing was lustly denyed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by the Electors, though he laboured in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so sore as he neuer dyd in any other before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly this last yeare a litle before the open warres duke <hi>Maurice</hi> procured once agayne, not onely all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes and free Estates of <hi>Germany,</hi> but also the kyng of <hi>Romaines Ferdinand, Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> his sonne king of <hi>Boeme,</hi> the kyng of <hi>Pole,</hi> the kyng of <hi>De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke</hi> the king of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to send also their Ambassadors for this suite, so that at once xxiiij. Ambassadours came before the Emperour together at <hi>Insburge.</hi> To whom whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had geuen very fayre wordes in effect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng a double meanyng aunswere, &amp; that was this: That it did him good to see so noble an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage at once. And therfore so many Princes should well vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would make a good accompt of their sute. Neuertheles because duke <hi>Maurice</hi> was the chiefest partie herein he would with speede send for him, and vse his head for the
<pb facs="tcp:379:36"/>
better endyng of this matter. But Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> seyng that all these Ambassadors we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t home with out him, and that the matter was referred to his present talke who was neuer heard in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, he wisely met with this double mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aunswere of the Emperours with a double meanyng <hi>replica</hi> agayne: for he promised the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to come, and at last in deede came so hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so hotely as the Emperour could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the heat of his breath: For when duke <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> saw that all humble sutes, all quiet meanes were spent in vayne, &amp; had to beare him iust wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therin all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany:</hi> First with close pollicie, after open power both wittely and stoutly, he atchieued more by force then he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by suite: For the Emperour was glad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend (which surely in an extreme aduersitie was done like a wise Prince) without money, without artillery, without defacyng of holdes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out receiuyng of pledges, to send the <hi>Lansgraue</hi> home, honorably acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with (at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors charges) the nobilitie of <hi>Brabant</hi> &amp; <hi>Flaunders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This last day I dined with the Ambassadour of <hi>Venice</hi> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of many wise heades, where duke <hi>Maurice</hi> was greatly praysed of some for his wit: of other for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> execution of his purposes. Well sayth a lusty <hi>Italian</hi> Priest, I can not much prayse his wit, which might haue had the Emperour in his handes &amp; would not. Loe such be these <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auels</hi> heades, who thincke no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue so much wit as he should, except he do more mischief then he neede. But Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> purposing to do no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:379:36"/>
harme to the Emperour, but good to his father in law, obtainyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one pursued not the other. Yea I know it to be most true whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we fled from <hi>Ins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> so hastly, Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> sent a post to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good kyng of <hi>Romanes,</hi> &amp; bad him will the Emperor to make no such speede for he purposed not to hurt his person: but to helpe his frend, whereupon the Diet at <hi>Passo</hi> immediatly folowed.</p>
               <p>I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend rather the iudgement of <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist Gascaldo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldo.</hi>
                  </note> the Emperours man and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng of <hi>Romanes</hi> generall in <hi>Hungary,</hi> who is not wont to say better, or loue any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then he should specially <hi>Germaines,</hi> &amp; namely Protestantes. And yet this last winter he wrote to the Emperour that he had marked Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> well in all his doynges agaynst the <hi>Turke,</hi> and of all men that euer he had sene, he had a head to forecast the best with pollicie and wit, and a hart to set vppon it with courage and speed, &amp; also a discressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to stay most wisely vpon the very pricke of aduauntage.</p>
               <p>Marches <hi>Marignan</hi> told some in this Court foure yeares ago that Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greatest enemy to the Emperour that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Emperour had: which thing he iudged (I beleue) not of any troublesome nature which he saw in Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> but of the great wronges that were done to Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> knowyng that he had both wit to perceiue them quietly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a courage not to beare them ouer long.</p>
               <p>Some other in this court that loued not duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> &amp; hauyng no hurt to do him by power, went about to say him some for spight &amp; therfore
<pb facs="tcp:379:37"/>
wrote these two spightfull verses agaynst him.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Iugurtham Mauricus prodit Mauricius vltra,</l>
                  <l>Henricum, Patruum, Socerum, cum Caesare, Gallum.</l>
               </q>
               <p>He that gaue me this verse added thereunto this his iudgement, well (sayth he) he that could finde in his hart to betray his frend Duke <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> his nigh kinsman Duke <hi>Fredericke,</hi> his father in law the <hi>Lansgraue,</hi> his soueraigne Lord the Emperour, his confederate the <hi>French</hi> kyng, breakyng all bondes of frendshyp, nature, law, obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and othe, shall besides all these, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue all men if at length he do not deceaue hym selfe. This verse and this sentence, the one made of spight, the other spoken of displeasure be here commended as men be affectioned. For any part as I can not accuse him for all: so will I not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him for part. And yet since I came to this Court I should do him wrong if I did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that which as wise heades as be in this Court haue iudged on him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Duke Mau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rice.</hi>
                  </note> euen those that for countrey &amp; Religion were not his frendes, that is, to haue shewed him selfe in all these affayres betwixt the Emperour and him: first, humble in intreatyng, diligent in pursuyng, witty in purposing, secret in workyng, fearce to foresee by open warre, ready to parle for common peace, wise in choyse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and iust in performyng of couenaunts.</p>
               <p>And I know he offended the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all remedy of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: So would I be loth to see as I haue once sene, his Maiestie fall so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne into any enemyes handes: lesse peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:379:37"/>
lesse gentlenes would be found in him then was found in Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> who when he was most able to hurt, was most ready to hold hys ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and that agaynst such an enemy, as he knew well would neuer loue him, and should alwayes be of most power to reuenge. If Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> had had a <hi>Machiauels</hi> head or a cowardes hart, he would haue worne a bloudyer sword the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did, which he neuer drew out in all these sturres, but once at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Cluce</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was to saue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperors me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Hetherto I haue followed the order of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which hath caused me somewhat to misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both tyme &amp; matter, yet where diuers great affaires come together, a man shall write confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly for the matter, &amp; vnpleasantly for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader, if he vse not such an apt kinde of partitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will best affourde, which thyng (<hi>Plato</hi> sayth) who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not do, knoweth not how to write. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Herodotus</hi> deserueth in myne opinion a great deale more prayse then <hi>Thucidides,</hi> although he wrote of a matter more confused for places, time, and persons, then the other did.</p>
               <p>In this point also <hi>Appianus Alexandrinus</hi> is very commendable, and not by chaunce but by skil doth follow this order, declaryng in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue iust causes why he should do so. Our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in later tyme, both in <hi>Latin</hi> &amp; other tounges commonly confound to many matters together, and so write well of no one. But see master <hi>Astley</hi> I thincking to be in some present talke with you, after our old wont do seeme to forget both my selfe and my purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:379:38"/>For the rest that is behind I will vse a grose &amp; homely kind of talke with you: for I will now as it were cary you, out of England with me, &amp; will lead you the same way that I went euen to the Emperours Court beyng at <hi>Augusta.</hi> an .1550. And I will let you see in what case it stode, and what thyngs were in doyng when we came first thether. After I wil cary you and that a pace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the chiefest matters be throughly touched in this my former booke, through the greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of ij. yeares in this Court. Yet in order till we haue brought Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> (as I promised you) to ioyne with Marches <hi>Albert</hi> in besiegyng <hi>Augusta.</hi> And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> because priuy practises brast out into open sturres I might better marke thynges dayly then I could before. And so we will depart with the Emperour from <hi>Insburg,</hi> and see dayly what chaunces were wrought by feare and hope in this Court till hys Maiestie left the siege of <hi>Metz,</hi> and came downe hether to <hi>Bruxels:</hi> where then all things were shut vp into secret practises till lastly of all, they brake forth into new mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, betwixt the Emperour and <hi>Fraunce</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> &amp; also betwixt Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the Marches in hyghe <hi>Germany</hi> which thynges I trust some other shall marke and describe a great deale better then I am hable to doe.</p>
