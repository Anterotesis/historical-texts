         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, That which the Word of God condemns as a grand oftence, is not to be practiſed, countenanced or tolerated: But divining by the Stars is condemned by Gods Word: as Deut. 18. 10, 11. <hi>There ſhall not be found amongſt you any one that uſeth Divination, or an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of times, or an Enchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50956:5"/>
                  <hi>or á Conſulter with familiar ſpirits, or a Wizard, or a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer: for all that do theſe things are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And the looking after them is expreſſed by <hi>going a whoring after them,</hi> Lev. 20. 6. So Iſa. 2. 6. <hi>Thou haſt forſaken thy people the houſe of Jacob, becauſe they are repleniſhed from the Eaſt, and are Soothſayers like the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines.</hi> And Iſa. 47. 13, 14. <hi>Thou art wearied in thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: Let now the Astrologers, the Star-gazers, the moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prognoſticators ſtand up, and ſave thee from thoſe things that ſhall come upon thee: Behold, they ſhall be as stubble, the fire ſhall burn them.</hi> God forbids his people to learn theſe Arts, Jer. 10. 2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, learn not the way of the Heathen, and be not diſmayed at them.</hi> They are called Liars, Iſa. 44. 25. <hi>That fruſtrateth the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the Lyars, and maketh the Diviners mad.</hi> Such are reckoned up with other Diabolical Arts, as being of the ſame kind, Dan. 22. &amp; Acts 19 18, 19, 20.<hi>—Many which uſed curious Arts</hi> (ſuch as this is) <hi>brought their books, and burned them before all men, and counted the price of them, and found it fifty thouſand pieces of ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. and this is aſcribed to the power of the Goſpel, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Art whereby men aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what is peculiar unto God, muſt needs be ſinful, neither to be practiſed, countenanced, nor tolerated: But this is done by ſuch as take upon them to divine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents to perſons &amp; Nations by the Stars; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear from Iſa. 41. 22. <hi>Shew things to come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that we may know that ye are gods:</hi> where we ſee that knowing, and declaring things to come, is as peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar a prerogative of God as to know mens hearts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That which withdraws the heart from God the Father, and Chriſt the Son, from conſidering the works of the one, and heeding the words of the other, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil not to be practiſed, countenanced, or tolerated: But Aſtrological predictions draw from God and Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50956:5"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is evident: Not to conſider Gods works, is a ſinful omiſſion condemned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 12. and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is as ſevere againſt every one that withdraws from Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8, 18, 19. Now that theſe Prognoſticators withdraw mens minds from Chriſt, may be gathered from that oppoſition that is put between them by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 18. 10. to 16. where they muſt not hearken to Sorcerers, that they may hearken to Chriſt: and whilſt men aſcribe ſucceſſes good or bad to the Stars, they withdraw their mindes from beholding God in his works.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That which is falſe, deluſive, &amp; uncertain, is not to be practiſed, countenanced, or tolerated: but ſuch is foretelling things by the Stars; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they are falſe, is clear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 15. That fruſtrateth the tokens of the Lyars, and makes the Diviners mad. If they ſpeak true at any time, it's more by hap than skill. For though Eclipſes of the Sun, and Moon, and Conjunction of other Planets may be certainly foreknown; yet there is no ſuch certainty of the effects, that we may divine thereby, for they are but general, partial, and remote cauſes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in States, and affairs of men: and there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain connex on between Cauſes general, partial, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and their Effects. Beſides, thoſe Effects which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on other Cauſes, upon which the Heavens have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none, or no direct power, cannot be certainly known by the Poſitions of the Heavens: but ſo it is with humane affairs: therefore the affairs of men depend principally on Gods Providence, and under him, on the wills and minds of men. That Gods Providence ordereth things concerning Men and States, is proved, Eph. 1. 11. <hi>He work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things after the counſel of his own will;</hi> and that not alwaies according to the ordinary diſpoſition of ſecond Cauſes; but turning and over-ruling things in a ſecret way, beyond the intentions of men, and the ordinary vertue of ſecond Cauſes: ſo we ſee in <hi>Rehoboams</hi> folly,

experience we have not: for experience ariſeth from often obſerving the ſame thing, as a Phyſitian knows by experience that <hi>Rubarb</hi> purges Choler, becauſe he hath often tried it: and ever finds it ſo: but we can have no ſuch experience of the effect of the Stars: 1. Becauſe the Heavens do ſcarce ever return to the ſame Poſition: for though ſome great Conjunctions be the ſame, yet there are infinite numbers of Stars (which alſo have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences) that agree not with, and ſo may vary the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the other. 2. When Events follow theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, it cannot certainly be known that they are the effects of them, for that many things fall out together ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, without connexion or dependance one upon another 3. We ſee experience is uncertain, for that Twins born under the ſame conſtellation differ extreamly in diſpoſition, and event, as we ſee in <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> And whereas they ſay, that by reaſon of the ſwift moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heavens, a little time makes a great difference in their Poſition; Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwers, that yet their conceptions were both in an inſtant, though their birth differed a little: and <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> adds, that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes all certainty of divining by the Stars, becauſe by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of their motion, they ſuddenly alter their poſitions, ſo that a man can never give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act judgment of any birth, becauſe he cannot exactly know the minute of his nativity. 5. Identity of effects doth not only depend upon the efficient, but the matter alſo: ſo that if we could be ſure that the Poſition of the Heavens were the ſame as they were a hundred years ago, yet the ſame events will not follow, becauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of men in divers ages and climates, of divers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, educations, moral and intellectual principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why may not the influence of the ſtars produce divers effects upon men of divers diſpoſitions, as we ſee a hen ſomtimes hatches chickens, other times ducks, partridges,

               <p>Thirdly, More is aſcribed to Aſtrologers in point of truth from ſome tricks they uſe, than indeed they deſerve: For as the Devil uſed of old in his Oracles, ſo they uſe ambiguous expreſſions which admit of a double conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and men interpret them according to their events: they add alſo many ifs, and cautions to their predictions, whereby if the event anſwer not their prediction, they do with the vulgar avoid the ſhame of it, but if it fall out right, they go about with credit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Its the opinion of judicious Divines, that much of that truth that is in their predictions, is from the aſſiſtance of the Devil, who either by an open contract, or elſe in a voluntary ſecret way inſinuates himſelf to draw on a league, and aſſiſts them with his knowledge, and gueſſes, which exceed any mans.

               <p>That which moſt godly and learned men upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have renounced, and repented of, that is neither to be practiſed, countenanced, nor tolerated: But godly men have renounced and repented of their ſtudy of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved; St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> the glory of his age for piety, learning, and ſolid judgment, confeſſes that he had been adicted to theſe vain ſtudies: But by the grace of God he afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them, as an art condemned by true piety, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it was a great errour, a great madneſſe, and a ſuſpition that might eaſily be refelled: He alſo menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons another on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. that repented of, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this wicked Art, as being as bad as <hi>Paganiſm</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50956:9"/>
cauſes to their natural effects.

               <p>Thirdly, Diabolical, which are by Gods juſt judgment ſuffered to be upon a people: and theſe are either by the Devil, or by his inſtruments, as <hi>Witches, Sorcerers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologirs,</hi> &amp;c,</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No For 1. It is only the property of God and of the Scriptures to foretel things to come: and therefore ſuch Aſtrologers as take upon them to foretel things not natural, but voluntary, and ſuch as are meerly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to mens wills, do not only undertake a vain, raſh, and falſe thing, but that alſo which is very abominable and wicked.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It hath been the Devils way alwaies to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Church, and to endeavour the damnation of many mens ſouls, by making them credulous in theſe things. And as Chriſt hath ſet in his Church Paſtors and Teachers, to inſtruct them in the way to Heaven: ſo the Devil hath raiſed his <hi>Witches, Sorcerers, Soothſayers</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> to ſeduce the world out of the right way. As <hi>Cardan,</hi> who roſe to that height of impiety, as to calculate Chriſts birth; and made his power to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to flow from the influence of the ſtars under which he was born Others have been bad, though not ſo bad; as <hi>Petrus de Aliaco,</hi> who thought that the time of Chriſts birth might have been foretold by the ſtars: and <hi>Kepler</hi> contends, that thoſe <hi>Wiſe men</hi> by the Rules of Aſtrology might have preſaged, not only ſome ſtrange event, but the birth of ſome great Monarch: as if Chriſt were not born after an extraordinary and miraculous manner. I deny not but that the Heavens have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50956:10"/>
upon mens Bodies: hence that man poſſeſſed with a Devil was ſaid to be <hi>lunatick,</hi> probably becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil took the opportunity at that time of the Moon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in humours do moſt abound, then to diſturb and diſtract him: but the Heavens were never made for Books to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal what ſhould come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Witches, Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>Astrologers</hi> are oft condemned in Scripture, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 26. and 20. 27 <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 11. &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, all the Fathers ſpeak with much vehemency againſt them: Many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels have condemned them: yea, divers of the wiſer fort of Heathens have cried out upon them. <hi>Tully</hi> wrote ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral books <hi>de divinatione,</hi> condemning ſuch Diviners In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing that before a great battel, the Mice had gnawn the Buckler of a Souldier, whereupon the Soothſayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that that war ſhould be fatal and unlucky: as if (ſaith <hi>Tully)</hi> becauſe mice did gnaw ſome books that I have of <hi>Plato's, De Republica,</hi> therefore I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that our Common-wealth ſhall be deſtroyed. And we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. of many who being converted, brought their books about ſuch curious arts, and burnt them. We may read more hereof in <hi>Perr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, If the Heavens were true and proper cauſes, or neceſſary ſigns, yet no man could certainly prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any thing by them; becauſe no man knowes the number, nor the vertue and efficacy of the ſtars. The Scripture makes it peculiar to God only to know the ſtars, and to call them by their names; but if any man could certainly divine by the ſtars, he muſt know their number, activity and influence, yea, and the degree of their activity, without which they cannot but groſſely erre.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If the Heavens be Cauſes, yet they are only univerſal cauſes: now from an univerſal, indeterminate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50956:10"/>
cauſe, there cannot be any ſpecial particular effect fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: for beſides univerſal cauſes, all particular inferiour cauſes, which are many and uncertain, muſt be known alſo.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If Aſtrological Predictions were allowed, it would bring in a contempt of God, and flat Atheiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word, The Scripture carries us out to God in all things, to his Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe would bind us to the Planets: yea by this means alſo the Scripture would be deſpiſed and laid aſide, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe would be introduced thereby: and every one would excuſe his vices, with <hi>How could I help it, ſeeing I am born under ſuch a Star?</hi> As St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tels us of the ſervant of a certain Aſtrologer, who having robbed his Maſter, his Maſter went about to correct him for it; whereupon he cried out, that he could not help it, for he was born under <hi>Mercury,</hi> (and the Aſtrologers ſay that ſuch as are born under that Planet, are given to ſtealing) and thus he ſilenced his Maſter by the Rules of his own Art.</p>

               <p>Secondly, If ſuch things as they foretel do come to paſſe, its either from their expreſſe, or vertual contract with the Devil.

               <head>Queſt. <hi>What uſe may we make of this which hath been ſaid?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Let all be perſwaded to flee the ſtudy, and to abandon the practiſe of this black art. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemns it as abomination to the Lord, Reaſon witneſſes againſt it, as being irrational and uncertain. There is vanity in it, danger by it. Satan is a ſubtil Serpent, and inſinuates into many this way before they be-aware. Find you pleaſure in it? Its but a ſweet poyſon. Think you to get honour by it? you may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by vain men, but are diſallowed by God: <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> reckons it up amongſt the kinds of witchcraft: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> counts it ungodly dotage, and inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity. Doth profit entice you? Its but <hi>Balaams</hi> gain, the wages of iniquity, money that will periſh with you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers will perſiſt in their wicked practiſe; all ſhould take heed of countenancing them, leſt partaking of their ſins, they partake in their plagues: Have therefore no fellowſhip with theſe unfruitful works of darkneſſe; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor all commerce with, and reſort to ſuch perſons: flee from them, as from the devil himſelf: thou breakeſt thy Baptiſmal Vow, if thou renounceſt not ſuch Diabolical practiſes. Shall we countenance what God abominates? and ſtrengthen men in that which makes both them, and the Land liable to wrath? Let them not have the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of thy coſt to buy them, nor of thy time to read them, no of thy tongue to mention or applaud them, nor of thy affections to fear, hope, or rejoyce in any thing they ſay. Forbidden, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 2, 3. If there were no buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſuch <hi>Almanacks,</hi> there would be no Sellers; and if there were no Sellers, there would be no Makers, at leaſt no Publiſhers of ſuch lying vanities, and truly if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50956:11"/>
the Aſtrologer be guilty, the Buyer and Reader cannot be innocent. God hath forbidden ſeeking to ſuch, under a grievous penalty, Lev. 20. 6<hi>—I will even ſet my face againſt that ſoul, and will cut him off from amongſt my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Indeed learned men have obſerved that ſuch delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have prevailed amongſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>anabaptiſtical</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. But that <hi>England</hi> ſhould countenance ſuch! and in a time of Reformation, Oh let us bluſh for ſhame! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How often (ſaid <hi>Tully)</hi> did I hear ſuch men promiſe <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that they ſhould live long, and die a peaceable death! whereas both of them not long after were murdered. And <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> the Jeſuit, in his Comment on <hi>Acts</hi> 19. bewaileth, that whilſt he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> they were ſo much given to this wickedneſſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Aſtrologers promiſed to ſome long life, to others a Cardinalſhip, to others the Popedom, and yet at laſt all were miſerably deluded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If Aſtrologers ſhould be tolerated, then they which are in authority are to be entreated, Firſt, That their books be not ſuffered ſo ordinarily to paſs the Preſs: O how doth the world dote upon them! I have been credibly informed, that neer thirty thouſand of <hi>Lillies Almanacks</hi> have been vended in a year. If devout men burnt their own books of this kind, how ſhould devout Governours ſee to the burning of ſuch Books? ſure if thoſe Books deſerve the fire which derogate from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Princes, how much more ſuch as withdraw the minds and hearts of men from God? It were well, if Aſtrologers were put into the ſame Catalogue with other Sorcerers in the Statute of the firſt of King <hi>James,</hi> chap. 20. and to ſuffer the ſame puniſhment with the other: for the Scripture makes them birds of a Feather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See as before.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Certainly ſince God hath hidden the future time from us, to go about to lay it open, is a work proper to the profeſt Undoer of Gods words.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Curioſity to know the future, carrieth many ſo far as to make a Covenant with the Devil, who yet ſtands not ſo much upon his points, as to refuſe to be conſulted with by thoſe that have made no Covenant with him: No doubt but his pride is tickled with a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous delight, when he ſees men ſeeking to him for that which is proper to God; and thereby yielding him Divine ſervice.</p>
               <p>Which ſervice that he may receive in a hidden way from the finer ſort of wits, he hath deviſed ſome ſeeming ſublime Divinations, perſwading them that the decree of God about humane events is written in the motions, and ſeveral aſpects of the ſtars, and that therefore this kind of Divination is lawful, yea, Divine.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The worſt evil is, that thereby mans mind, which ought to dwell at home, is tranſported out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and in ſtead of repoſing upon the wiſdom and love of God, is ſuſpended upon the <hi>Dragons Tail,</hi> and the <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent</hi>

Thirdly, It cuts in ſunder the very ſinews of induſtry, and makes men idle, greedy, and inconſiderate. The Hiſtories of the Greek Emperors, <hi>Alexius</hi> and <hi>Manuel,</hi> are lamentable examples how credulous perſons are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the impoſtures of Aſtrologers, when they expect from the ſtars thoſe ſucceſſes which ſhould have been wrought out by Piety, Prudence, and Valour.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider, that all affirmation is grounded either upon Reaſon, or Authority.

And humane authority in this caſe is of no weight: for who hath given power to men to diſpoſe of the ſeveral Offices, and Pre-eminencies of Celeſtial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: It remains then that theſe Maximes are grounded upon Diabolical authority. In brief, ſince they are not grounded upon reaſon, either they are forged by men, or delivered by revelation: and if that revelation comes not from God, it muſt needs come from the Devil.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt general maxime whereby Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers endeavour to gain credit and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their documents, is what all men readily confeſſe; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Stars are not meer ſigns, but alſo natural cauſes of very many effects; as if men were bound to admit the ſame Poſition for truth concerning other effects which they boaſt the divination of aforehand. It is well known (ſay they) that inferiour natures are not ſubjected to ſuperiour in vain, ſince they are ſo manifeſtly cheriſhed, moved, and governed by them. That the Sun is the cauſe of light and heat, and that by its acceſſe and receſſe annually, it doth introduce the Series and Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſeaſons, that it doth procreate Plants, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and in particular men, according to that common ſaying, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem:</hi> that it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Vapours from the earth, which become the matter of rain, of winds, and the like. That the Moon doth fill and empty all ſhel-fiſh, the bones of animals, the brains of Conies, and hath great power over all moiſt bodies; and eſpecially the Sea, whoſe Tides are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50956:13"/>
to her Motion. Laſtly, That there are certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, by which not only theſe two principal Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but alſo the other leſſer ones exerciſe their vertues upon ſublunary bodies: For ſince the ſtars ought not to be conceived idle and ineffectual, and that there are ſome certain effects which cannot be referred to any other cauſes but them, as the critical mutations of diſeaſes, and the inequality of ſeaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is the ſum of what our Aſtrologers alledge for ſupport of their pretence, and whereby they ſtudy to endear their art, and prepare the minds of men for the more ſmooth and eaſie admiſſion of what they afterward impoſe with prodigious confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and indeed what they urge concerning the Sun and Moon, ſeems ſo plauſible, that judicious men at firſt are drawn diligently to liſten unto what they ſay concerning that, thinking they would proceed to prove the reſt of their ſuppoſitions with the like evidence, not ſuſpecting that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſpecious foundations they ſhould ſo ſoon erect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ridiculous Fables and wild abſurdities. But alas how far are they from making the members of their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial body reſpondent to the head of it; but they have no ſooner laid down this ground, but with admiration we may ſee they inſtantly run out to ſuch ſuper-ſtructures which have no ſolidity nor ſtrength, either from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or reaſon. Indeed I cannot but wonder and bluſh when I obſerve the firſt writers of this art, <hi>Ptolomy, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus</hi> and <hi>Manilius,</hi> after they have begun their diſcourſes ſeriouſly and with gravity beſeeming Philoſophers, and men profeſſing the ſeverity of reaſon, in a moment to fall upon meer childiſh toyes, and old wives dreams. It is very diſhonourable for learned men, by the pretext of ſuch Poſitions as are generally confeſſed, ſo to impoſe upon the credulity of their Readers, and would make them believe that theſe fopperies which they intend to foiſt in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were of the ſame evidence and certainty with the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50956:14"/>
premiſes. Yea it is not only diſhonourable, but odious and deteſtable to delude men, by drawing ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as really is no conſequence, that the Sun doth vary the ſeaſons of the year, and the Moon fatten ſhell-fiſh in her Full, and make them lean in her Wane, this common experience will aver for a truth; but doth experience atteſt the like of the twelve Signes in the Zodiack, and of their ſeveral degrees, and the Planets poſitions in the twelve Houſes with their aſpects one towards the other, adding the influence of the fixed Stars to them? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no, nor can any of our Aſtrologers by obſervation, ſhew any one of the leaſt effects that ought to be referred to this or that particular Conſtellation or Star rather than to any other cauſe that is ſublunary. What then, have they any reaſon to flee unto? No, doubtleſſe none at all; ſince all reaſon reſteth on experience, and of that here can be none; and all that can be inſerted is this, that each Luminary being a Lucid Body, doth in proportion to his Orbe enlighten, warm and work ſuch effects as ariſe from ſuch light and heat. I add, that foraſmuch as the Stars are general Cauſes only in reſpect of ſublunary things: I may well demand a reaſon why any ſingular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may not be aſcribed to ſome ſingular cauſe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, where are ſuch multitudes of natural and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Actives and Paſſives, rather than to thoſe remote ones, the Planets and fixt Stars. Inſtance, When we give an account of the cauſes of odours in compound Ointments, we refer one kind of ſmell to the Roſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to Jaſmine, a third to the Orange flowers, and no particular ſmell to the Oyl which is the common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the compoſition, and the cauſe of the fragrancy, neither to one nor to the other of the Ingredients: as for example, in a Garden, this Plant groweth here and not there, and this there and not here, we refer it to their ſeeds, which were ſown in thoſe places where each one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50956:14"/>
groweth, not to the water where with they are irrigated, which is only a general cauſe of the growth of the Plants, and indifferent nouriſhment to each ſort: So are we to Philoſophiſe concerning thoſe effects that are aſcribed to Heavenly Bodies: For ſince the heat of the Sun (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) is general, why it ſhould harden clay and ſoften wax, is to be referred to the different diſpoſitions of thoſe bodies, not to any various efficacy in the Suns heat; and why the Sun produceth a Plant in this place and not an animal, an animal in another place and not a Plant; this is to be referred likewiſe to the vertue of the ſeed which is plantary in one place, and animal in another. The ſame may be ſaid of other things that ariſe from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Suns heat (as for example) the Sun raiſeth Vapours from this part of the Earth and not from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe in one part is moiſture, in another none: One year it raiſeth more vapours than in another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one year yields more moiſture than another; one year the exhalations are healthy and good, another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious and Peſtilential, becauſe of the different matter from which they are drawn: Hence we learn, that ſince it is beſides all reaſon, when there may be many cauſes of any particular effect, without the concurrence of all, which that effect will not follow, for us to think it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to our Prognoſtication of that effect abſolutely and poſitively that we know any one of all theſe various cauſes that muſt concur to the production thereof; it muſt be likewiſe beſides all reaſon, when beſides the ſtars there are other the Inferiour cauſes, that muſt conſpire to the production of particular Effects, for any man to foretell the contingency of thoſe effects only, becauſe he knows but generally the influx of the ſtars, but not any of the other inferiour particular cauſes that are required thereunto: again, when there are ſome effects which have no dependance at all (or what is exceedingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50956:15"/>
upon the ſtars, but a manifeſt and neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon ſublunary cauſes. I would willingly know what reaſon there is why we ſhould not rather have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thoſe ſublunary and particular cauſes, than to thoſe ſuperlunary and general ones, the ſtars: thus when grounds manured and enriched by compoſt, do yield more plentiful crops of come than before. It is plain that we are to aſcribe this fertility, not to the influence of the Sun and ſtars, but the faming of the ground by the dung or ſoile, ſeaſonably laid upon it by the careful Farmer.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to add any thing more by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumental confutation of Aſtrology, as to ſhew you the vain Fictions concerning the fixed ſtars, the 12 Celeſtial Houſes, the 7 Planets, poſitions in them, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral aſpects one towards another, with the ſeveral ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary effects they attribute to them. I think for my own part enough hath been ſaid in the general diſcourſe for the confutation of it; and I hope every judicious man that reads it, will be ſatisfied with it. I ſhall onely add ſome memorable examples of the fruſtration of the tokens of theſe Liars, and end this work.</p>
            <p>One eminent Example. All Hiſtories aſſure us that <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>France</hi> died in the Fourtieth year of his age com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, of a wound received in his eye, in the exerciſe of Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet ſee the Propheſie of <hi>Gaurious,</hi> concerning him in his Prognoſtication of the year 1556, becauſe in the Scheam of his Nativity, he had the Sun almoſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titely conjoyned to <hi>Venus:</hi> under the degrees of his alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and alſo the Moon and <hi>Venus</hi> advancing through his Horoſcope, under the Conſtellation of <hi>Arics,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall live moſt happy and glorious till the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his age, deducting only two moneths; and if by the favour of God he eſcape the dangerous years of ſixty three and ſixty four, it will be very long before there be an end of his renowned life. You have alſo the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50956:15"/>
of <hi>Cardan,</hi> when ſpeaking of the ſame King <hi>Henry,</hi> he ſhall be (ſaid he) in his old age ſo much the more happy, by how many the more difficulties he hath paſſed through before. And how acutely theſe two famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did foreſee theſe things, let the Event be Judge.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Example is that of <hi>Cardans</hi> predicting the lamentable mis-fortunes of men that were his dear friends, <hi>Check</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Raconet</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and divers others, all whoſe Nativities he erected, with all poſſible exactneſſe, and afterward printed them.</p>
            <p>I cannot hold from noting that <hi>John Rudolphus Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius.</hi> when writing againſt <hi>Sextus ab Heminga,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the certainty of Judicial Aſtrology, collected an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeveral Genitures, and amongſt them put the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Late Kings of <hi>France, Henry</hi> the 3d. and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th joyning alſo the judgment of <hi>Fredericus Rutelius:</hi> as to <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. the buſineſſe ſucceeded accordingly, he told his diſaſter after it had befaln him. But as for <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. who was then living when his Century was publiſhed, in the year 1607, nothing was leſſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by him than the time of his death: for though that beſt of Kings was murdered by a ſacrilegious hand, in the year 1610, and that in the Moneth of <hi>May,</hi> our famous Prophet never ſuſpected the leaſt danger to him in that year or moneth, but caſt his death upon the year 1613, and the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> as threatning ſome eminent danger to his life, in the 59 year of his age, nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths and one and twenty dayes, he being born on the 24 of <hi>December,</hi> at two a Clock after Midnight, in the year 1553, and that becauſe the Sun would then come to the body of <hi>Saturn</hi> by direction, the Horoſcope to a Quartile of the ſame, and the middle Heaven to a Quartile of the Sun: but truly as the death of that Prince was deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo was the hariolation ridiculous.</p>
            <p>A Third Example is that which <hi>Suffredus</hi> Judge of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50956:16"/>
ſhewed ſome friends of his his Fathers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, with the judgments thereupon given, under <hi>Noſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> his own hand-writing; they were pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him concerning his Father, whom he knew well, a not dying till his Son was almoſt arived at mans eſtate. The Father according to that ſcheam was born in the year 1544, on the 13 of <hi>January,</hi> 22 minutes after high Noon, the altitude of the Pole being ſuppoſed to be 44 degrees, which is more by the third part of a degree than ought. The Son <hi>John Suffredus</hi> not being able to give any account of thoſe accidents which <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> had foretold ſhould befal the Father in his youth: as that in the 16th. year of his age he ſhould fall into a dangerous Dyſentery, or bloody Flux: that he ſhould fall into a violent Feaver in the 17th. year of his life; and in the 20 fall into love, and relinquiſh his ſtudies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There were ſome accidents which he did certainly inform his Friends of, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prophet told him that the Father ſhould wear his Beard long, &amp; criſped (but he alwaies ſhaved his chin bare) that in the middle of his age his Teeth ſhould be rotten) but he had very white and firm Teeth to his dying day) that in his old age he ſhould go almoſt croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and double (but he went to the laſt upright and ſtraight as any young man whoſoever) that in the 19th. year of his life he ſhould become exceeding rich by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting a ſtrangers eſtate (but beſides what his Father left him, he never had any wealth or eſtate) that he ſhould ſuffer by the treachery of his Brethren; and in the 37th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>year be wounded by his own Mothers Son (but he never had any Brother, nor had his Father more than one wife) that he ſhould marry a Forreigner (but he married a <hi>French</hi> woman of <hi>Salona)</hi> that in the 25 year he ſhould be ſo addicted to Natural Philoſophy, and the ſecrets of Magick, as no man more; as alſo to Geometry, and Arithmetick in an extraordinary manner; but he never
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50956:16"/>
had any particular affection to, or care of any of thoſe ſtudies (but entirely devoted himſelf to the knowledge of the Lawes; that in his old age he ſhould apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Navigation and Muſick (but he never delighted much in Muſick, nor was ever at Sea in his whole life) that he ſhould not paſſe the 75th year (but he paſſed not the 54th. year of which <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> ſaid not a word) And theſe things are the more particularly handled, to the end that men may judge what credit is to be given to ſuch vain predictions. I may ſay, old women, children and fools ſomtimes do tell truth, and why may not Aſtrologers? Its more by hap than skill if they do. <hi>Cardan</hi> himſelf gives this advice to his Aſtrological Friends, if you have (ſaith he) an itch to be divining, be ſure you foretel the quite contrary to what Aſtrologers promiſe or threaten.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hiſtorians report of a pregnant exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an Aſtrologer, that predicted that <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. of <hi>England,</hi> a wiſe, valiant and proſperous King, ſhould die in ſuch a year; the King ſent for him, and asked him, if he could tell in what place himſelf ſhould be in the next Chriſtmas (then near at hand) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet being ſurprized with this unexpected queſtion, ſtood mute a good while, and at laſt confeſſed he could not tell (thereupon the King ſmiling, ſaid (then my friend) I am more skilful in Divination than you are, for I can foretel that you ſhall keep your Chriſtmas in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and accordingly commanded him to be ſent Priſoner thither, as a juſt reward of his impudence, and beſides, the King did not die in the year predicted.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Example: It is memorable what we read in Hiſtory, that when ſome Aſtrologers had (by ſome great Conjunctions of the Planets in watery ſigns) predicted a general Deluge, and ſo great calamities to men and beaſts, and that by the waters, that never the like was ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime; and this deluge to happen in <hi>February</hi> 1524,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50956:17"/>
the people in <hi>Spain, France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> being terrified with this Prognoſtication, provided themſelves of Shipping, Beats, Victuals, and other neceſſaries for a long voyage, it ſo fell out that all that moneth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> was fair and clear, and more temperate than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: (and we may take notice of a ſpecial Providence of God in it, in regard of the great ſerenity that was at that time: and we may juſtly deride the vain predictions of our ſtar-Prophets; for it is not uſual to ſee <hi>February</hi> paſſe away without Rains:) That <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Origanus</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not diſſemble their ſorrow, for being ſo much diſappointed in their expectations.</p>
            <p>Example 6. There is another Remarkable Example recorded by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> out of <hi>Rigordus,</hi> who wrote that the Aſtrologers had foretold ſo general a deſtruction by the violence of winds and tempeſts, becauſe of a Conjunction of as well the Inferiour as Superiour Planets, in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1186, there being an Eclipſe of the Sun on the 11th. of <hi>May,</hi> immediatly foregoing, that many did expect the univerſal diſſolution of nature then to come; and yet when the time came, there was not ſo much as a ſtorm enſued: So that the contrary event derided the skill of the Aſtrologers, and fooliſh credulity of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, theſe Examples, the commonneſſe of every daies experience (if diligently conſidered) will produce the like Fallacies. Do but read over the monethly Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of ſeveral Aſtrologers in their Almanacks for this preſent year, 1659, and you will find how groſſely they are miſtaken: Its worthy of your noting.</p>
            <p>There are many more examples recorded, which I might have added, but then my Book would have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bounds I intended.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add the ſayings of a worthy man (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Mathematician) concerning Judicial Aſtrology,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50956:17"/>
and alſo add ſomthing by way of conſideration and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and finiſh this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I am very credibly informed, that Mr. <hi>Norwood</hi> a very worthy man, and well known amongſt the Merchants of <hi>Barmoodas,</hi> ſhould ſay (ſpeaking of Aſtrology) to an eminent Friend of his, that he thought that it was a very hard matter (if not a thing impoſſible) to be a noted man in Judicial Aſtrology, and yet a good Chriſtian: This will be teſtified by two known witneſſes. But thus much I can ſay concerning it, that the very Principles of Judicial Aſtrology are inconſiſtent with the lively and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actings of the Grace of God; and there can be no other agreement between them, than between light and darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>The conſiderations and perſwaſions againſt the ſtudy and practiſe of it, are briefly theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Its a practiſe that the Word of God condemns. Do not ſtudy it leſt ye be found fighters againſt God; For who is able to contend with the Almighty, who is wonderful in knowledge and wiſe in Counſel?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Its a practiſe that cuts in ſunder the very Sinews of common Induſtry, and makes a man careleſſe and ſlothful in buſineſſe; for diligence is the life of buſineſſe: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that its <hi>the diligent hand maketh rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider how miſerable the lives and terrible the deaths of thoſe Kings and Princes have been that have confided in their predictions: Hiſtories are full of ſuch Examples.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider another example as notable as the former, of ſome perſons being told by Aſtrologers, that they ſhould die by a Rope, to prevent the ſhame of a common Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, were the horrible Executioners of themſelves. Then be adviſed (in the fear of God) to flee from all ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable practiſes, and have nothing to do with the Art or Artiſt in any thing you may be enſnared either by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50956:18"/>
it or them (I ſay) flee from it, as you would flee from the Plague or any other Infectious diſeaſe: and in all your neceſſities make your addreſſes unto God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and then whatever you want, asking of it in Chriſts Name, and according to his Will, he will grant you your deſire in it, or ſome other thing that is better for you. To his Care I commit you.</p>
