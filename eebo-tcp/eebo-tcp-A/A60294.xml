            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WIth burthened hearts as once the two Disciples travelling unto <hi>Emaus,</hi> spoke to Christ a supposed stranger, so speak we unto thee, Art thou a stranger in our Island, and hast not known the things that have come to pass in these daies, while the father hath been divided against the son, and the son against the father, three against two, and two against three, Even a mans foes they of his own houshold; so great have been our Divisions like <hi>Reuben,</hi> that no sooner light hath been by Gods grace manifested to the begetting Children of the Free-woman, but presently they are persecuted by the Children of the Bond-woman; and how unpleasing this is to Iesus Christ, and how unlike his golden Rule that saith, <hi>And all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the Law, and the Prophets.</hi> We say how unpleasing this is to him, judge upon thy serious perusal of this following Treatise, which we commend to thy perusal in thy most retired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, when thou canst read with thy thoughts, least cumbred with other business, our design in what we beg may be perused, is general good, in setting at liberty that which God made free, even the Conscience. Thou canst not bee ignorant of the great Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie that now is on foot as to uniformity in Worship, to impose by violence, where they cannot perswade, under seeming pretence of Scripture warrant and antiquity, the contrary to which is asserted in the words of truth and soberness, by Scripture, reason, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>And lest violence and oppressing of conscience, should run up to that height till it terminate in the blood of some who are dear, and their blood precious in the eyes of the God of all the Earth, therefore have we committed this unto the view of all men as part of the work of our Generation in singleness of heart, and remain lovers and prayers for all men that we might live a peaceable, and a quiet life in all godliness and honesty.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S all the holy Scriptures have been written afore-time for our learning and admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come; So that particular Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is of such excellent worth, <hi>That blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophesie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14.8. Chap. 17.2. and 18.3.</note> 
               <hi>and keep those things that are written therein, for the time is at hand.</hi> In which Book, in no less than three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Texts it is testified, that the Nations of the world, and inhabiters of the Earth, with their Kings, would drink the wine of the fornication of that abominable Harlot, that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations and Tongues, and by her sorceries deceiveth all Nations until they become drunk, and altogether uncapable (in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) to receive the pure waters of life, tendred to them in the plain way of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>This with grief of heart we see too visible, for the Doctrine and Traditions of <hi>Rome</hi> (who is mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> and since her Apostacy the Mother of Harlots, <hi>For the woman which thou sawest, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the earth</hi>) have so corrupted the earth,<note place="margin">Chap. 17 18.</note> and clouded the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings of the sons of men, that the great and most important truths of God cannot bee received or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
            <p>The reason why the Nations are so generally beguiled in the concernments of their souls, is because the greatest

part being carnal and unregenerate persons; they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to such wayes of worship, as are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with external pomp and glory, and therefore the Spirit of the Lord testifies that the great Harlot filleth her abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,<note place="margin">Chap. 17.4.</note> and filthy fornications in a golden cup, like the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian that guilds his bitter Pill, that his Patient may the better swallow it.</p>
            <p>Thus doth the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and her followers, who to make their carnal Ordinances finde the better reception, deliver them to the inhabitants of the earth by such as are honourable amongst men in worldly Sanctuaries, most magnificently built and adorned, endowed with Lordly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, accompanied with Musick and Voyces, and Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vestments, yea many Superstitions and Customes meerly earthly and sensual (if not worse) which we say so pleaseth the earthly and unregenerate man, that he is ready to say, This is the best Religion, which is of most esteem in the Nations, and accompanied with all earthly glory and delights, altogether forgetting, that strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that finde it,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14. Luke 16.15.</note> And that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>And if it had been the minde of the Lord Jesus, that the Gospel should have been recommended unto the world, and accompanied with these Ceremonies and Formalities that are practised in the worship of the Nations, or were used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> it is very strange we should not have one word for it in all the Scriptures of the New Testament, when Christ was as faithful over his house,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.2, 5, 6. Deut. 18 18, 19</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> was over his, and is to be heard in all things as <hi>Moses</hi> himself commanded; and there will be little encouragement to touch with the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations in their superstitious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, when it shall be considered, that the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Mosaical law being once the appointments of God, did far exceed in glory what the shallow inventions of the <hi>Romish,</hi> or any of the National Churches are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, yet wholly taken away; which the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> notably proves, saying, <hi>Then verily the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had also Ordinances of Divine service, and a worldly

            <p>As little respect hath God to persons, because of any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or esteem they may have in the world, either for birth or natural endowments, but such as usually are foolish, weak, and base in the eyes of the world, doth he make use of in the work of the Gospel, that so the learned Doctors and Masters of Arts may not have wherewithall to boast.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26, 27, 28, 29.</note>

            <p>But the bare rejection of Truth, and imbracing of error is not all the evil, that the Nations generally are ingaged in by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her followers; but for to compleat and fill up the measure of their iniquities, like <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> nothing less must be inflicted on the servants of the most High God, that cannot bow down to the golden Image of their Inventions, than the fiery furnace of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, many times unto death it self.</p>
            <p>And this the people of the Lord must endure, it being as certain their portion to be persecuted, as it is the practice of the false Church to persecute, who build their superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Will-worship, on no other foundations but Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Cruelty; else what mean these imprisonments, banishments, wars and massacres, which have been made in <hi>Europe</hi> for Religion; what troubles and desolations in <hi>Germany,</hi> civil commotions in <hi>France,</hi> cruelties exercised in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> by that Darling of the Romish Church, the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> &amp; others? what M<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

those remote and simple people had so much as known the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> much less done any injury unto him; our own Nation hath also felt the rage of this fury, both before, and in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the wise may judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bishops endeavours to impose their Liturgy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with their cruelties in <hi>England,</hi> did not contribute much to our late unhappy troubles.

            <p>But on the contrary it will evince to all that have their eyes open, how like they are to that woman which is drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the blood of the Saints,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.6.</note> and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus,<note place="margin">Chap. 18.24.</note> in whom will be found the blood of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of Saints, and of all that were slain on the earth.

            <p>Lest therefore those unchristian principles of persecution for conscience, which troubleth the world, should take root in this Nation, to the stirring up mens mindes to shed the blood of the innocent, the guilt whereof is able to sinke the most flourishing Kingdomes into an ocean of misery and calamity, we have here following written some arguments (which we humbly offer to all men) to prove, how contrary to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus, and good reason it is for any Magistrate by outward force to impose any thing in the worship of God, on the consciences of those whom they govern, but that liberty ought to be given to all such as disturb not the civil peace, though of different perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religous matters.</p>

                  <item>3 Because the Apostles themselves (that gave forth those Commands which are written in Scripture to be obedient to Magistrates) refused to be obedient to their Rulers; when they were commanded to forbear, that which they judged part of the worship of God,<note place="margin">Acts 4.19.20.</note> and said, <hi>Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge yee.</hi>

                  <item>5 If Magistrates as such, have power from God in the dayes of the Gospel, to command in spiritual matters, and to punish those that obey not, then must Christians surely be actually obedient, not only for wrath, but also for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, because else they should resist the Ordinance of God; but if this were true, the way to heaven would be so far from being strait and narrow,<note place="margin">Luke 14.27.</note> that any might be a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Christ without taking up the cross and following him; yea all sufferings and persecutions should wholly be at an end, and they that undergo them should utterly be condemned (for it is not to be supposed there could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, if all the commands of the Magistrate in spiritual causes were actually to be obeyed) It therefore reasonably follows,<note place="margin">Rev 7.14, 15.

            <p>It is answered, that all Magistrates suppose what ever they impose to be so; but the question is, who is to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, for if the Magistrate, or any other man, or men, have power from God to judge and determine what is lawful for men to obey, then no room is left for them to dispute the lawfulness of any of his commands, it being their duty to obey what ever is commanded, and so as it hath been said before, the Cross of Christ ceases; but if every one shall give account for himself to God, then it reasonably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that every man judge for himself in matters spiritual,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.12.</note> and therefore for the Magistrate to compel,<note place="margin">Josh. 24.15.</note> cannot be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by Scripture or Reason.</p>
            <p>Again, that the power to judge and determine in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual matters, is not in a Magistrate as such, <hi>Gallio</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Deputy of <hi>Achaia,</hi> well understood, when the <hi>Iews</hi> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection with one accord against <hi>Paul,</hi> and brought him to the Judgement seat, saying, <hi>This fellow perswadeth men to worship God contrary to the Law</hi> (which almost ever since hath been the great cry by all sorts of the National Clergy, whose turns it hath been to have the Magistrate on their sides, against all others that have differed from them) but <hi>Gallio</hi> said,<note place="margin">Act. 18.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note>

            <p>So for the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to Decree that the Service in the Church should be performed in Latine, how contrary is it to the Doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> who said in the Church, <hi>He had rather speak five words with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that he might teach others, than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand words in an unknown Tongue.</hi> So also have they clashed one with another,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.19.</note> the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Picturing of God the Father, the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> altogether disallowing of it, and in the great <hi>Arrian</hi> Controversie, which was no circumstantial bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, how many Councils and Conventions, were both for, and against it.</p>

            <p>As it is no waies lawful from the word of God, for Christian Magistrates in the daies of the Gospell, to destroy, and root out the contrary minded in religious matters (although Idolaters,) so such proceedings may somtimes prove inconsistent, with the very being of Nations, for suppose any Nation were wholly Heathenish idolators, and the word of God coming in amongst them, should convert, the cheife Magistrate, and one twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of the Nation more; must he then with that twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part, destroy all the other nineteen, if they will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but continue in their Heathenish Idolatry? it cannot possibly be suposed to be warrantable: and this reason holds good likewise against the rooting up and destroying Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, out of the world, because if the Church proceeds against any of her members to Excomunication, the Churches deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards him so cast out, is to be the same as towards a Heathen, so saith Christ himself, If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen man, and a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,<note place="margin">

If the judiciall Law be a rule, for Magistrates under the Gospel to walk by, then why must it be mangled in peeces, and just so much taken of it as suites their interest, and all the rest rejected? Is it left to Magistrates now, or was it ever left to the Jewish Kings, to take what part of it they please to be a rule to them, and reject all the rest, and it is eminently remarkable, how this plea is by the Clergy themselves that most contend for it, made together invalid, for by it they will stirre up the Civill Magistrate, to punish those that dissents from them about the Doctrine and worship, under the notion of Blasphemers or Hereticks, and against such this Law must be held Authentick, but he that smiteth or curseth his Father, or Mother, or stealeth a man, or him that committeth Adultery, or breaketh the Sabboth; who were all of them sure to be put to death by the same judiciall Law, yet in these cases they will not tell the Magistrate it is any rule, but is to be rejected, because here they cannot much make it reach their supposed Hereticks, who
