            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>All the Doctors above mentioned were in their Scarlet Robes, and diſtinguiſhed by the ſeverall Scholaſtical Habits belonging to their Faculty.</p>
               <p>Afterwards both the Proctors of the Vniverſity, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> Fellow of New Colledge, and Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:97700:285"/>
of Chriſt Church, were in their black Gownes and Miniſters Hoods. Then followed the Batchelers of Divinity and Maſters of Arts wearing their Gownes, Hoods, and Caps, according to their Degrees about the number of 100. more or leſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe came from Chanon-Row into Whitehall through the Garden, the Stone Gallery, and ſo paſſed through the Court, the Guard Chamber, the Chamber of Preſence, and ſo along to the long Gallery towards the Park Staires, where they made a ſtop for ſom conſiderable time untill they were fairly conducted into the Privy Gallery, having very cheerfull reception in their paſſing through the ſeverall Guards which were richly furniſhed with perſons of remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gallantry.</p>
               <p>A Chaire of State being placed in that ſame Gallery for his Majeſty, the Oxonians ſtaied not long there till they had notice of his Majeſties coming, the Right Honorable the Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi> ſupplying the Chancellors place; his Majeſty being entred, the Schollers bowed themſelves very low ſeverall times, and at due diſtance did kneel. When the Vice-Chancellor was ready to deliver his Speech kneeling, his Majeſty ſignified to him that he ſhould ſtand, in which poſture he did pronounce his Speech in Latin, his Majeſty ſtanding all the time, being attended by the Right Honorable the Marquis of Oxmond, the Earle of Mancheſter, the Lord General Monck, and many other perſons of Honor. The ſubſtance of the Speech was to acquaint his Majeſty how highly pleaſing to the Vniverſity his returne to his Kingdom was, and that that Vniverſity having for ſo long time been honored with his Majeſties preſence, they could not but be more acquainted with his Princely vertues and ſo be more deeply ſenſible of their and the whole Kingdoms ſufferings in his ſo long abſence. Next he humbly ſignified to his Majeſty that the eyes not only of the Vniverſity but of the whole Nation was towards him, wiſhing his Majeſty a long and happy Reigne, and ſo to govern, that the Land may be preſerved and Religion eſtabliſhed. After the Speech ended
