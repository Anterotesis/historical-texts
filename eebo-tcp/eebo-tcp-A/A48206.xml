         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have received your Lordſhips Letter of the 10th of this inſtant, with much more trouble and ſadneſſe of mind then any thing you have ſent me this whole ill yeare. All your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Votes, Ordinances, and Orders with your Generall's powerfull Commiſſion to kill and ſlay all good People, made not halfe that impreſſion in me (though I have not been tender in letting you know what I think of the beſt of thoſe) as your <hi>Sacred Vow and Covenant</hi> (as you call them) which with M. <hi>Pym's</hi> Speech at the Common-hall of the diſcovery of the great Plot (I received incloſed in your Letter) hath done. Are all your humble and earneſt deſires and ſolicitations for Peace, all your Pangs and Throwes for a Reformation in Religion, delivered at laſt of a <hi>ſacred Vow and Covenant</hi> againſt both? Have you at laſt thought fit to tell the World that there is no poſſibility or hope of Peace, but by blood and deſolation? Have M. <hi>Burroughes,</hi> and M. <hi>Caſe</hi> ſo perverted all Texts of Scripture, and Sergeant <hi>Wild,</hi> and M. <hi>Glyn</hi> ſo confounded all Rules of Law, that your Conſciences are grown ſo dead to the one, and your Vnderſtandings ſo dull to the other, that in plain Engliſh you promiſe God Almighty to aſſiſt any body to kill the King; and ſet up new Covenants of your owne,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104335:3"/>
poynt blank againſt your Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and publiſh all this to the People as the Articles of your new Creed? And yet that your Lordſhip ſhould tell me that your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Duty to the King continues ſtill the ſame you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it; that you have ſtill not only the ſame deſire, but the ſame hope of Peace; and that you are confident that the Anabaptiſts and Browniſts (whom me thinks you have ſworn to defend) will ſhortly ſhip themſelves for another Climate, is ſo ſtrange to me, that Amazement it ſelf is not more confounding. You tell me of a trick your Lordſhips have found out, to ſave you harmleſſe from any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation by this Oath, a <hi>Salvo</hi> to all your other Oathes Lawfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thoſe being in a Diameter contrary to this, you have upon the matter engaged your ſelves to nothing by this new Covenant, and ſo have cunningly evaded the deſigne of the Contrivers: Oh (my Lord) can you pleaſe your ſelves with theſe ſhifts? Is this the Wiſdome, Vigilance, Integrity, and Courage of the Higheſt Court of Iudicature (for ſo the Houſe of Peeres in Parliament is) to lead the People by their Example to ſo ſolemne an Act as a Covenant with God Almighty, which at the inſtant you took it you intended ſhould ſignify nothing? Will the poor People of <hi>England,</hi> whereof it may be too many have looked upon your example with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and thought many things fit or lawfull only becauſe you did them, when they ſhall find that you have <hi>vowed in the preſence of Almighty God, the ſearcher of all hearts, as you ſhall anſwer at the great Day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed, that you will, according to your power, aſſiſt the Forces raiſed and continued by both Houſes of Parliament, againſt the Forces raiſed by the King;</hi> will they (I ſay) think that your Lordſhip intended nothing by this Vow, but what you were obliged to by your Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, that is, <hi>to defend the King to the utmoſt of your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, againſt all Conſpiracies and attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made againſt His Perſon, His Crown and Dignity, and to doe your beſt endeavour to diſcloſe and make known to Him all Treaſons and Conſpiracies which ſhall be againſt Him, to your power to aſſiſt all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences and Authority belonging to Him, or united to the Imperiall Crown of this Realme;</hi> and indeed to doe all things which by this your new ſacred Vow you have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104335:3"/>
to doe? Will this <hi>Salvo</hi> reconcile all thoſe contradictions? &amp; is this ſubtilty the firſt fruits of your <hi>Humility and Reverence of the Divine Majeſty, your hearty ſorrow for your own ſinnes and the ſinnes of the Nation, and your true intention to endeavour the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your own wayes?</hi> For Gods ſake (my Lord) talk not of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, and oppoſing Papiſts and Popery, when your Actions deſtroy the Elements of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and admit a latitude to your Conſcience to introduce Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, &amp; Rules, which the Turkes in pure naturall honeſty abhorre and deteſt. Get your ſelf to an opinion and avow it boldly, ſee what you hazard, and play your game out above board, be a deſperate Gameſter, if you cannot be a skilfull one, &amp; ſo be capable of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by good luck; but to be cozened and cheated to ſerve other mens turnes, and to help to cozen your ſelfe by little ſhifts and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, makes you be hated by them you ſerve, deſpiſed by us, and will make you be laught at when you are dead.</p>
            <p>But (my Lord) admit you were indeed too hard for them by this <hi>Salvo,</hi> and by the interpoſition of three or foure other words (<hi>in order to the ſecurity &amp; preſervation of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion &amp;c. according to your power and vocation &amp;c.</hi>) had notably reſerved a liberty to your ſelves of complying with your former Oathes; That Oathes were to be interpreted according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Perſon that takes them, (which being an inſtrument between God and us, and ſo every Covenant being to be taken ſtrongeſt againſt our ſelves, cannot be admitted;) yet if another man who hath taken this vow believes himſelfe obliged by it, to the utmoſt Act even againſt the Life of the King, hath not he reaſon to believe, that you have bound your ſelfe to aſſiſt that Perſon in what he ſhall doe in purſuance of that Oath? I would I were able to make an anſwer for you; but admit farther, that in all the promiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part which containes what you will doe, or what you will not doe, that you were ſafe and had engaged your ſelfe to doe no more or no leſſe then your Duty: pray conſider the poſitive part, what <hi>Salvo</hi> have you for that? you doe <hi>believe that there hath been &amp; now is a Popiſh &amp; Traiterous Plot for the ſubverſion of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion and the Liberty of the Subject, and that in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof a Popiſh Army hath been raiſed, &amp; is now on foot in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104335:4"/>
               <hi>parts of this Kingdom;</hi> which Army you imply to be the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my raiſed for the King, and therefore you promiſe to aſſiſt againſt it. Now it ſeems your Lordſhip doth not beleeve the Preamble to be conſiderable, or any part of the Oath, for I am ſure you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any Popiſh or Traiterous Plot to be on this ſide; where the Treaſon is the Law will judge, and where the Papiſts are will beſt be found in the Muſter-Rolls of both Armies; you have had whole Troopes of that Profeſſion and no fault found with their Religion, till they have given over being Rebells; whileſt they are with you, they defend the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, but when they revolt to their Allegiance, they are Papiſts, and ought to be disbanded; indeed you take the courſe to compell the King to doe His duty, by driving them to Him for Protection, which he cannot deny to His Subjects, but you keep them from performing their duty in aſſiſting their Prince, by ſtripping &amp; Plundring, and leaving them naked to the World. In good faith (I ask pardon of Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Truth for being ſtartled) your conſident diſcourſes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Armies and Supplies from Papiſts made me once imagine the King might in truth receive ſome notable Supplies from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that profeſſion, and it was not hard for me to beleeve, that that party which felt ſo much rigour &amp; cruelty from you, and were ſure to ſuffer an utter extirpation, if you prevailed, ſhould willingly ſacrifice all they had to that Soveraigne Power which might mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully allay that fury, and preſerve them ſtill in the number of His Subjects; but I find there is a narrowneſſe, a vulgar ſpiritedneſſe, and a ſcandalous parſimony in all Religions, even theſe men will have the comfort of being ſtarved with Mony in their Purſes; for I am aſſured by thoſe who are converſant with thoſe Accounts, that all the Mony His Majeſty hath received from all the Papiſts of <hi>England,</hi> ſince He hath been put to raiſe and con inue theſe Forces, is not halfe ſo much as is in truth due to Him by the Law upon thoſe moderate Compoſitions made with them; And for any Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance He hath by their perſonall ſervice, you have long agoe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (and I have reaſon enough to beleeve) that the Papiſts in all His Armies will not make one Regiment: how many more you have, and how many more you would be glad to have, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can better judge then I.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104335:4"/>Well, there hath been <hi>a treacherous and horrid Defigne lately diſcovered, to ſurprize the Cities of London and Weſtminſter,</hi> and God knowes what; and <hi>you doe abhorre and deteſt that wicked and treacherous Deſigne.</hi> 'Tis well done whether you know it or not: but what may this treacherous Deſigne be, that, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pym</hi> ſayes, would <hi>have deſtroyed the City and the Kingdome, and in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines have buried Religion and Liberty?</hi> another Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, like that of the Proteſtation againſt the firſt Remonſtrance? The King hath ſent a Commiſſion (for now 'tis printed all the World knowes what it is) to certain perſons to uſe their utmoſt power to ſuppreſſe thoſe who are in Rebellion againſt Him, and aſſiſt thoſe who are oppreſſed by them. Is there one Popiſh or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected perſon in that Commiſſion, or to be imployed in the whole Deſign? Is there one Clauſe in it on the behalfe of Papiſts, or againſt the Liberty of the Subject? Indeed it may ſeem ſtrange that the King ſhould ſo much conſider that Apoſtate City (where the Rage of ſome, and the Tameneſſe of others have made up one generall Guilt) as to offer them any countenance to releeve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but that it ſhould be a horrid &amp; treacherous Deſign, (when you have in all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> Commanders of your <hi>Militia</hi> and Commiſſioners, even at this preſent, to aſſeſſe, rate, and collect Money for the maintenance of your Rebellious Army) for the King to be willing to have an Army in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Middleſex,</hi> whereby all other Armies, and that too, might be ſpeedily disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, will need an Orator no leſſe powerfull then M. <hi>Pym,</hi> or his Excellency himſelfe (who in theſe nice Arguments is the better Orator) to make evident to the World. Beleeve it (my Lord) whilſt there is one honeſt man left in that City, there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a Plot to reduce it to its Loyalty, and to deſtroy this wicked Rebellion: neither will that unparallell'd Act of Inhumanity, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon the two famous Citizens of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (who will live glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in the Annalls of this Nation, as the ſtout Champions and Martyrs of Allegiance, when the name of their Murtherer (<hi>Fiennes</hi>) ſhall not be mentioned but with Infamy) ſo farre fright good men from their Duty, that your wild fury will rage long uncontrouled.</p>
            <p>Another of your propoſitions is, that <hi>you doe beleeve in your Conſcience, that the Forces raiſed by the two Houſes of Parliament,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104335:5"/>
               <hi>are raiſed and continued for their juſt defence, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the true Proteſtant Reformed Religion, and Liberty of the Subject, againſt the Forces raiſed by the King;</hi> does your Lordſhip in truth beleeve this? take it in peeces. The two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, being convened by the Kings ſole Writ to adviſe with Him about the great Affaires of the Kingdom, formed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells with ſuch ſucceſſe, that in above fifteen Moneths (time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have reformed and repaired all former miſtakes and irregularities in Church and State) they never found the leaſt non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concurrence with them from His Majeſty in any particular propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for the eaſe or benefit of the Common-wealth; what was, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, done by His ſingular Iuſtice and exceſſe of Bounty, is ſo well and ſo particularly known to all the World, that if your Treaſon and Rebellion were away, there would be ingratitude e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough left to make you odious to the preſent, and infamous to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages. When did the firſt Act of your defence begin? not till you came to <hi>Edge. hill;</hi> then I muſt confeſſe you were put to it, for it cannot be denied, the King went eight Miles out of His way to find you; from thence you took your ſtile of defenſive Armes; except you will needs date them from the tenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> when you had been overrun by the Law, if that defenſive Army of the City had not been raiſed to reſcue and preſerve the good Lord of <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> &amp; his five pretious Members from a legall proceeding. In this ſenſe you have, I confeſſe, been much upon the defenſive part, otherwiſe you never pretended ground or Argument for your taking Armes, but Feares and Iealouſies, no danger of an aſſault from an active Enemy, except ſome few Papiſts under ground, whom your vigilancy hath kept ſtill there. When you firſt voted your great Generall, and raiſed your wanton Army, 'twas to fetch up the King to you from <hi>Yorke,</hi> not to defend your ſelves againſt Him; and you cannot but know you were ſo farre from being in danger to be aſſaulted, that ſetting aſide your acts of Hoſtility in your Votes and Ordinances, by which you had ſurprized Forts, Townes, and the whole Navy, when you had a formed Army of Horſe and Foot (I believe much greater then you have now) the King had not ſo many Muskets as you had Cannon, nor ſo many Swords as you had Companies; and on my Conſcience (I will ſo

farre excuſe you from intending it ſhould come to this) if you had thought He could have got any, your Lordſhip and many more of your good friends, who for quietneſſe ſake have done much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, would have prevented theſe troubles. But why are you leſſe aſhamed to be couzened ſtill, then to confeſſe you have bin ſo; you expreſſed well in your own honeſt Speech, how much you have been deceived; truſt them no more that deceived you, much of that is fallen out you then foreſaw, the reſt will follow; 'is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to foreſee, and not to prevent, at leaſt bearing a part in doing the miſchiefe which you foreſee muſt deſtroy the Doers. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you were told, there was no Deſigne againſt Biſhops to alter the Government of the Church, you ſee they are now inconſiſtent with the Proteſtant Reformed Religion, and a new way muſt be found out of Government; and then as M. <hi>Martin,</hi> and M. <hi>Morly</hi> uſe you now, M. <hi>Caſe</hi> and M. <hi>Calamy</hi> will uſe you then, between both, you will be a great Lord. Remember you were promiſed when this Army was firſt raiſed, there ſhould be no fighting, no Reſiſtance (and in truth when you ſaw Votes could enable you to raiſe Armies, who had no power, 'tis no wonder you believed they could keep the King from raiſing any who had Power) that the King ſhould be brought gently up to you, and you ſhould have what Places you pleaſed. There hath been fighting and reſiſtance; the King is not yet broughtup to you, &amp; I do not find the Places are like to be diſpoſed as you deſire. You were aſſured all poſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was to the ſafety of the King, &amp; you were your ſelf required by your Proteſtation to promiſe to defend His Perſon, you have ſince been aſſured in what danger His Perſon hath been, by the aſſault of your Army, and you are now compelled to ſweare you will aſſiſt that Army againſt Him. When will you think your ſelfe conzened enough to abhorre theſe men? do you not yet apprehend that theſe men every day, whileſt they perſwade you they intend a Peace, doe ſomewhat to make Peace impoſſible? Is the impriſoning the Kings Meſſengers who come to move you to Peace; the accuſing the Queen of high Treaſon for loving Her Husband, and for doing that for which the preſent Age muſt reverence, and poſterity will envy Her; the Murthering the two good men of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> in cold Blood (a Murther that will call for Vengeance from God, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104335:6"/>
from the King till a full expiation) and this new ſacred Vow, excellent ingredients towards a Peace? Are you awake, and doe not ſee thoſe things throwne in only to make Peace impoſſible, but content your ſelfe with a Vote that yout Armes are defenſive, when all the diſtractions and all the Violence throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are the effects of thoſe Armes?</p>
            <p>The next Article of your Creed is, that theſe godly Forces of yours are for the defenſe of the true Proteſtant reformed Religion. This indeed hath alwayes been your care, and your Reputation; but give me leave to tell your Lordſhip I much feare you rather hate that which is not the Proteſtant Religion, then love that which is. I will not grieve your memory by repreſenting to you the happy flouriſhing State of the Proteſtant Religion in this Kingdome, till your Counſells diſturbed and endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face it. Let Vs only conſider what you have acted and what you have deſigned towards this defence, and to uſe your owne phraſe of your Covenant <hi>in order to the Security and preſervation of this Religion.</hi> There is not a Godly, Learned, Orthodox Divine in <hi>England,</hi> whom you have not traduced, impriſoned, or eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached and diſcountenanced, even thoſe whoſe Learning and Integrity firſt gave credit and reputation to your great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; you have not only diſuſed and ſuppreſſed that Excellent Book of Common-Prayer (the firſt and glorious inſtance in this Kingdome of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion) but ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly and prophanely reviled and ſcoffed at it to the ſcandall of Chriſtianity; you have carried your ſelves with ſuch impious and deboſh behaviour in Churches and Conſecrated places, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch horrid and Beaſtly outrages that the Heathen themſelves would tremble at the mention of them, and all this out of <hi>pure zeale to the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion.</hi> This you will ſay is done without your conſents by the diſorderly Souldiers, whom you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtrain. By your Lordſhips favour you have very pretty Votes of one or both Houſes, which directly encourage thoſe Souldiers to moſt of this. What Remedy have you provided for theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if the King concurred with you in all you propoſe to your ſelves? you have preſented Him a Bill to pull downe the whole Fabrick of Church Government, to leave Hereſie, Inceſt, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104335:6"/>
and Adultery, as unpuniſhable as any other Acts of good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, to take away His Supremacy, and ſo cancell the Oath you have all taken to Him, and to take away Biſhops, and ſo cancell the Oath He hath taken at His Coronation to defend and protect them, and have not yet ſo much as fancyed amongſt your ſelves into what ſhape you will lick that monſtrous <hi>Chaos</hi> you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; this you leave to your Synod, of ſuch men, as moſt of them no Schooles or Nurſeries of Learning ever knew, men never knowne or heard of but by their Faction, Treaſon, and Rebellion, ſuch who never had title or ſubſiſtance in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till your Votes, as Patron and Ordinary, impoſed them upon Pariſhes, and over Cures in the places of thoſe, whoſe Religion was not Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Oh (my Lord) can you forget the excellent times in which you were borne, and the happy times in which you have ſince li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the flouriſhing State of Religion here in Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, in the Lives and Learning of ſo many Reverend Divines famous throughout Chriſtendome, can you ſo much forget this, to beleeve theſe courſes the way to defend the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion? If you were a Proteſtant two yeares ſince, I am ſure they are none whoſe directions you now follow; Is the countenancing and joyning with Anabaptiſts, and Browniſts, (names as odious to you, and ſo mentioned by you even in your laſt Letter, as the Papiſts) to advance the Proteſtant Religion? But 'tis no wonder when you take your Rules of Allegiance and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from Traitors and Rebells, that you ſhould take your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion from Hypocrites and Schiſmatiques. I doe not know your face better then your heart in this point, you are no more of my Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> mind in Religion, then Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> is; when you have recovered the Courage to love Truth againe, this Clauſe, if there were nothing elſe in your Covenant, will take your Sleep from you, and leave you no comfort, but in the Charity of thoſe you have endeavoured to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>A word now of the Liberty of the Subject, the laſt pretence of your Army, and I have done. In ſo ſad an Argument I ſhould not be merry with you, and ſay, that by this Liberty of the Subject, you meane Liberty in every Subject, to doe what he liſt, which indeed ſeemes to be the proper buſineſſe of your Army; and yet I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104335:7"/>
would you would leave men this liberty, that you would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to be worſe then they have a mind to be, and you would be contented to abſolve them from the Law, and truſt them with their owne Inclinations; though you pull downe the Incloſures, uſe no violence to hunt them from their knowne Pathes; let their owne love of Liberty lead them, without being driven by your fury. Conſider the Liberty of the Subject before you found out this device to defend it; how ſtrongly was it guarded and fenced by knowne, cleere, excellent Lawes, not capable of any dammage or inconvenience, to which there was not a proper reparation &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy prepared; if any little breaches had been made in this Fence (for in compariſon of the gappes you have ſince made in it in one hower, what was done in 16. yeares before was but little) with what diligence, Induſtry and Bounty did His Majeſty comply with you to make them up, and ſo finiſhed the Worke, that if you had not taken all this monſtrous paines to deſtroy it, your Country now had been the wonder and Envy of Chriſtendome, in Peace, and all the Ornaments of Beauty, Plenty, and Luſtre which Peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be adorned with. What preſſure or violation was offered to this Liberty, when you firſt took up your defenſive Armes? See now to what degree you have advanced it, as it hath reference to our Goods and Eſtates, your Ordinances of ſequeſtration, your weekly Aſſeſſements, and your Order for the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part, abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſes your Care; as it hath reference to Our Perſons, the full Gaoles in all places, and the very many Houſes you have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Gaoles for the ſafe keeping of Our Liberty, will be Rare Monuments to Poſterity; as it concernes Our Conſcience, you need no other Evidence (though you have ſtore) then this <hi>your ſacred Vow and Covenant.</hi> If this be your courſe to defend Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I would you would for variety ſake practiſe ſome way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, it may be it might prove the more Soveraigne Remedy to the Common-wealth. 'Tis M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pyms</hi> third Obſervation <hi>of the evill Conſcience of thoſe who were in the late Plot, they that pretended to take Armes to defend their owne Property, obtained a Commiſſion to violate the Property of others, they would take the Aſſertion of the Lawes of the Land, but aſſumed to them ſuch a power, as was moſt contrary to that Law, to ſeize upon their Perſons without due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:104335:7"/>
               <hi>to impoſe upon their Eſtates without Conſent, to take away ſome lives by the Law Martiall;</hi> this is a Text I hope your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will beleeve, and is ſo truly an inſtance of evill Conſcience, that if His Majeſty had uſed theſe words in any of His Meſſages or Declarations they had been Voted at leaſt an imputation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both Houſes, and a Cenſure of their Proceedings. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pym</hi> may Libell againſt you (aud in earneſt you will find moſt of his ſpeeches to be ſuch) without breach of Priviledge, he hath found out too new Conſervators of our Liberty which we never heard of till now, inſtead of King, Lords and Commons, <hi>The Parliament,</hi> (that is the Cloſe Committee) <hi>the City, and the Army are the three vitall parts of the Kingdome, in which</hi> (he ſaies) <hi>not only the well being, but the very life and being of it doth conſiſt;</hi> and yet they perſwade your Lordſhip they are willing to disband this Army. You will ſay theſe Invaſions upon Liberty are the effects of theſe diſtempers, which 'tis your buſineſſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, which being done the Subject ſhall have no more cauſe to complaine. But, my Lord, We that live at a diſtance have well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the principles and foundations for all this miſchiefe were laid, long before your Miſtreſſe Neceſſity was owned by you, long before your Armies were raiſed; all your Rapines, all your Plunderings &amp; Impriſonings are not more deſtructive to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject, then your Votes of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming power ſo to declare Law, that what you ſaid or did, was therefore Law becauſe 'twas yours. How many men were impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and undone by you, expreſly againſt the Law and the Petition of Right? How many Acts of Parliament ſuſpended and Actions done by you in a Diameter contrary to Acts of Parliament: ſo that in truth all yout exceſſes ſince which you excuſe by imputing them to your Army, and the raiſing that Army, are but ſuperſtructures upon the foundations you laid in your calmeſt and moſt undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Government, and there is nothing that you of the moderate Party have ſince refuſed to conſent to, which might not very well have followed from ſome of thoſe propoſitions which even your ſelves have before admitted, defended, and contrived.</p>
            <p>I have troubled your Lordſhip longer in this Argument then I meant, and have the vanity to beleeve, that your often reading this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104335:8"/>
over, thought it be no more then you knew before, may make ſome impreſſion in you, doe not think that which is in it ſelfe ſimply ill can be made good by a Vote, or that the word Parliament can give Reputation to Actions abſolutely wicked in themſelves: M. <hi>Pym</hi> tells you in this goodly Speech of his, <hi>that a Parliament is but a Carkaſe when the freedome of it is ſuppreſſed, that if it be deprived of its own Liberty, it is left without life or power to keep the Liberty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> Alas (my Lord) though you will anſwer no other part of my Letter, tell me upon your Honour, would you have taken this laſt Covenant, if you had had liberty to have refuſed it; if you had not, where is your freedom of Parliament? can you yet look upon that Aſſembly with reverence? think of your number, think of their quality, think ſadly of their Actions, and you will eaſily find a way (and there is but one that I know) to evade your Covenant. It was unjuſtly, impiouſly impoſed upon you, raſhly, unlawfully (to ſay no worſe) taken by you, you ought not, you muſt not keep it. But that's not enough, winde your ſelf out of this Labyrinth with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Magnanimity, and in your Evening doe ſomewhat that may redeem the faults of the day. Conſider that theſe men who by your Aſſiſtance proſper in their bad wayes, are doing their own buſineſſe, and every day make a Progreſſe to their own ends. My Lord <hi>Say</hi> ſince all honeſt men have been undoing, hath bettered his own Eſtate above twenty thouſand pounds, beſides advancing his younger Sonnes to full and ample Revenues. M. <hi>Pym</hi> hath ſwet to purpoſe, and hath thrived ſo well in two years, that he is your equall atleaſt. They who abhorre Biſhops revenge themſelves at your charge, and every Action that advances that Deſigne is more pleaſant to them then life. Your great Generall hath the Soveraign delight of oppoſing the King, and having his Health drank with lowd Muſique. <hi>Pennington, Ven, Fulk,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> are from broken, beggerly, contemptible Varlets, become your fellow Peeres, &amp; no doubt when they have reconciled your Lordſhips &amp; the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons into one Houſe, will have the negative voyce, (which you two have ſnatched from the King,) depoſited in their hands. That vitall part of the Kingdom, the City, will never be truſted in your Cuſtody who have managed all the reſt ſo ill. If any Accident ſhould happen, Providence or Victory to defeat them, theſe men
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104335:8"/>
have been good and wary Husbands, and have the fortitude to love any Country equall to their own. Is your Lordſhip of a conſtitution fit to mingle with theſe men? Is your Revenue improved, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer inlarged ſince theſe troubles? Is any one deſigne of yours ſatisfied by your concurrence, or can you be content to dye a Peere of <hi>New-England,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Providence?</hi> Is not your Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Intereſt with all good men loſt, and have you one friend left whoſe face you knew a year before this Parliament? Theſe are Melancholique conſiderations, but you muſt paſſe through them, and then if ſome Noble, at leaſt honeſt reſolution doe not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe you, reſolve to dye the laſt of your name, and to leave this Character behind you, That notwithſtanding all your diſcourſe and pretence of Religion, you would have turned Turke, if the Major part of both Houſes, and the ſtronger part of the Kingdome had required you to take a Covenant to that purpoſe.</p>
