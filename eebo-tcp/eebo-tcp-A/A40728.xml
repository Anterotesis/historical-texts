            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>They had enjoyed their Son twelve yeares together, and now it was their hard hap to loſe him: Longer have we enjoyed him by farre then they did. We have had him in his Word rightly taught, in his Sacraments duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and for a ſigne and confirmation of his bleſſing upon theſe, more then fourſcore yeares of peace, to the wonder of our friends, and envy of our adverſaries: But what ſhall I ſay now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the Angel ſaid to <hi>Gideon, The Lord is with thee thou mighty man; Gideon</hi> anſwered, <hi>O my<note place="margin">Judges 6. 13.</note>

            <p>When Chriſt beheld Jeruſalem, he wept over<note place="margin">Luke 19. 41.</note> it, and ſaid, <hi>O if thou hadſt known in this thy day the things which belong to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eies.</hi> He ſaw their ſin, and foreſaw their ſufferings, and the one as the other cauſed him to weep: oh! our ſins are hideous, and our ſufferings will not come ſhort of theirs, if we prevent them not, our ſtate will prove <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi>

But at her return, (the word, for ſympathy of griefe, will ſcarce come out) he ſtaies and leaves her. But why did ſhe go to it? ſhe had <hi>a continuall Feaſt,</hi> a quiet conſcience within her ſelfe: beſides, ſhe had the Lord of the Feaſt, her Son with her.

            <p>And withall ſhe muſt be taught that her Son<note place="margin">3.</note> had a Father in Heaven, whoſe buſineſſe he muſt go about: All the world muſt be profited, as well as ſhe pleaſed, and they muſt be redeemed, as well as ſhe ſatisfied; therefore as our firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid, <hi>A man ſhould leave Father and Mother for his Wife,</hi>

Would they yet travell a whole day without a ſight of him, to advance their opinion into a knowledge, and ſo to have been aſcertained he was amongſt them? Thus even the beſt will grow ſometimes remiſſe; <hi>Can a Mother forget her childe?</hi> It ſeems ſhe can;<note place="margin">Iſay 49. 15.</note> the beſt of Mothers here forgets the beſt of ſons, and ſo jealous is God of thoſe he loves, as he will not endure the leaſt Act of unkindneſſe or undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſſe in them: Servants and ſtrangers may goe away with greater errors, when the Son that is beloved ſhall finde a laſh for the leaſt offence: The not beloved ones, wicked and ungodly men,

may run on in ſin even till they <hi>grow old,</hi> and ſin like withered leaves ſhall drop and fall from them before they leave it, and in all that time never meet with a whipping; but thoſe that are<note place="margin">Zach. 28.</note> deare to God, deare to him as the <hi>Apple of his eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Thus have we ſeen Chriſt loſt. The Saints in heaven ſo happily have him, as they cannot loſe him, the <hi>Bridegroome</hi> cannot now be taken from them; the damned in hell have ſo unhappily loſt him, as they can never finde him againe, <gap reason="foreign">
