         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as to Vn-church and Damn the greater and better part of
the Reformed, because they imbrace not as Divine that

these of 'em whom the common and unsatiable Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
most implacably hate: for, above all others, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
<hi>Puritans</hi> (as they speak) are acknowledg'd to be
most irreconcilable to the Roman Catholick Doctrine, and
on this account, the prime Object of their Malice. This
<pb facs="tcp:94326:3"/>
is obvious in the Writings of the Romanists; but chiefly
in these of the Jesuites; witness (to name no more) <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
in his books of the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and Appendix thereto,
and another Papist the Author of <hi>Presbytries Triall,</hi> prime
Armories whence our present Adversaries fetch most of their
weapons. The Papists in this, as in many things else, are
followed by the Quakers, as is evident from most of their
Pamphlets, but more especially from a pretended Answer
to a part of a Book, wherein I gave some further Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
than had been already made of the Impieties and
Self-contradictions of that Sect. This Answer they (for
I do not think that it belongs all to one Parent) name

receiv'd all along thro't, in stead of a Confutation, a
most strong Confirmation of the Truth of the Doctrine I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn'd,
and much more ground to abhorr the Impieties of
Quakerism, and to bless God who hath brought to pass that
their very Attempts to palliat their Abominations, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a further Detection thereof. Read, pray, earnestly,
and compare it with mine, and you shall find them most
frequently yealding the whole Controversy, as also over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skipping
the marrow of what I had adduc'd, and yet anon
triumphing as if they had never, in the least, been guilty
of such dealling; you shall find that the most pardonable
pieces of their Book are wild Gibberies, extravagant Rove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
meer Impertinencies, palpable Perversions, loud Lies,
Heresies, Blasphemies, and, in a ward, a lump of stuff so
Atheisticall, that it proclaims the Authors neither to fear
God, nor regard man, never to have consulted Conscience,
nor to have remembred of future Judgement, or of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:94326:3"/>
they must give at the tremenduous Tribunal of God.
Yet all this is but what I expected, and is not unworthy
of these, who, with Satan's sworn Slaves, renounce their
Holy Baptism, and, therewith, whatsoever is constitutive
of a Christian. For a further Manifestation whereof, hear
the Quakers themselves, who are now split into Factions;
to wit, into <hi>Keithians,</hi> after <hi>George Keith</hi> a prime Pillar

               <hi>To many of the Quakers</hi> (saith <hi>G. K.) all are Christians [to
wit,</hi> Jews, Mahumetans, Painims] <hi>in whom any good seed
of Religion appeareth, and which they say is from Christ, yea is
Christ himself.</hi> And<note n="k" place="bottom">ibid. pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Many, yea the most, or rather
almost all the Ministers among the</hi> Quakers (<hi>very few
excepted) do affirm, that this inward Light is sufficient
to bring forth the new Birth, and to give eternall Salvation,
without any thing, without us, that is, without the man Christ
that was outwardly born, and crucified and rose again, whom
some of their Ministers in my hearing, hath called an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thing, a shell, a husk, that doth little or nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
us, and the Faith of which doth nothing profit us. And</hi>
William Penn (continues <hi>G. K.) in that Meeting at</hi> Ratcliff,
<hi>where he falfly called me an</hi> Apostate, <hi>did publickly proclaim
after this manner: Friends, said he, I see no great need of
preaching, the Faith of Christ's Death and Sufferings, for all</hi>
England <hi>and all Christendom hath that Faith, and it doth
not profit them. But the Faith which profiteth Men is the
Faith of Christ within, and that Friends preach. Let now</hi>
(saith <hi>G. K.) the Author judge, or any other intelligent
Person (professing Christianity) whether</hi> William Penn <hi>hath
not sufficiently by these words proved himself an Apostate from
the Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have a taste (for it is no more, compar'd with
what I could produce) of Quakerism from the Quakers
themselves. Surely most admirable and adorable is divine
Providence in so prodigiously strange, and clear a Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of these infernal Blasphemies and Abominations, from
the very Mouths of the chief Actors themselves; to the
end, doubtless, that all may hear and fear, tremble and
quake indeed to meddle, in the least, with these Quakers,
<pb facs="tcp:94326:4"/>
least God (as is the Lot of these Wretches) by giving them
up to so strange Delusions and damnable Lies, make their
Plagues wonderfull. May God mercifully grant, (as the
Effect of this Discovery) that the sound and stable Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may regard the Operations of his Hand, and give due
Praise to him that preserves them from so deadly an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
that the Weak may be confirm'd in their Belief of
these Divine Verities which are reveal'd in the Holy
Scriptures, and that these who are catch'd in the Gin may
yet escape, like a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowler.</p>
            <p>But of Quakers enough; only I must repeat that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think my <hi>Plow-man</hi> to be the sole Author of the Book
that bears his Name; no, I think some good part thereof
belongs to some, who own neither Name nor Profession of
Quakerism. It's true, they hate all Protestants, and, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Presbyterians; yet, there is in that Book something sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
its Author appears rather to have studi'd the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and bespattering of Presbytry, than either the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or Palliation of Quakerism: for in lieu hereof, I
find, in many places, only Libells larded with such Lies,
Calumnies, and Slanders, as the more invective Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
and other invective Hierarchicks used to throw
at all true Protestants, but mainly at the Puritan Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians.
There is, moreover, in some places, more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
express'd, but all along couch'd, yet obvious enough to the
observant, a warmth and kindness for these of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chick,
or Prelatical Principles. In a word, much of the Book
breaths forth another <hi>Species</hi> or sort of Malignancy, than is
that of Quakerism, a Malignancy peculiar to the Author of
<hi>Presbytries Triall,</hi> and such professed Romanists; to <hi>Heylen</hi>
and <hi>Le Strange,</hi> and such barefac'd Papaturians, much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to these more fallacious and spiritual Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
Neither can any sensible Man earnestly read their
<pb facs="tcp:94326:5"/>
Book, and not perceive so much. Strange! Cann't they not
uphold their Hierarchy, except they thus study to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Christianity, and join with its deadly Enemies, and
that too with such Varlets of 'em whose Brutishness and
molish despicableness, as was the good fortune of <hi>Aesop's
Ass,</hi> are their only security, and set them too low for any
Man to nottice them? I'm also inform'd that the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author us'd to have most closs and frequent Converse
with an Episcopal Minister of no mean Rank. Moreover,
seeing many of the Prelatists oppose the sometimes receiv'd
Sentiments, yea and common Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for which they pretend such Veneration, by Espousing,
with Papists, Quakers, and the like Opposers of Truth, the
Tenets of <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> no great wonder tho'
they syncretize with such Sectaries against the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Calvinians</hi> (as they speak) and accordingly the Neope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian
Hierarchicks (for there are Episcopals, surely of a
better Mind, and Judgement more Orthodox) make a third
Squadron of this unsanctifi'd Army, and in Railing, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Sophistry, and such unworthy Methods, labour to
come short of neither Quakers nor Papists. Such a black
Combination would well nigh move one to say of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> said of Christians, <hi>There must needs</hi>
(saith he) <hi>be some good thing among Christians, seeing they
were chiefly persecuted by such a Monster as</hi> Nero. <hi>It's a
sign of your greater Glory</hi> (saith <hi>Hierome</hi>
               <note n="l" place="bottom">Inter Epist, <hi>Augustini</hi> 25.</note> to <hi>Augustine)
that all the Hereticks abhorr you.</hi> And here I cannot but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how the Author of <hi>The fundamental Charter of Presbytry</hi>
&amp;c. (having most untruly insinuated, as if we ascribed to
our first Reformers an Impeccability, and espoused every
particular Sentiment or Expression of every one of 'em, as
infallible) no less falsly gives out and earnestly studies to
<pb facs="tcp:94326:5"/>
perswade the World that all these our first Reformers, and
especially Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> were nothing but a pack of treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bloody Rebels and most odious Men: see, to name no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, from page 334. to 346. and is not this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Evidence that the Author has a large measure of the
Spirit of <hi>Ham</hi> the curs'd Exposer of his Father's nakedness,
but he knows who'll thank him,
<q>Hoc Italus velit &amp; magno mercetur Abaddon.</q>
The matter is, these Men are much grieved that ever we
were fre'd from <hi>Rome</hi>'s Tyranny and Superstition, and so
know not how to be even with these precious Instruments
of that our most happy and admirable Deliverance. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Arts is that they use boldly to pretend the
Doctrine of their Hierarchy to be most Catholick and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, and so Vn-church most of the reformed
Churches; and, which is no less Vn-christian, they strive
to support it with such Arguments as equally serve to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
an universal Papacy. Again, they use to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
these Romish Sophisms, and yet quite dissemble the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
and Refutations the Reform'd have giv'n thereto, as,
to name no more, is the constant Practice of A. M. <hi>D. D.</hi>
Moreover they now darr to assert, contrary to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of all Men, and the Concessions of the greatest
Prelatists, that our first Reformers were of the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Perswasion. They would possess Men with the same
thoughts of the Transmarine Reformers, and therefore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Means to effect it, they use to work on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessituousness
or ambition of some forraign Protestants, as
the Romanists do on needy Greeks and other Easterns, and
bribe them to publish, for the receiv'd Doctrine of the
Churches they were bred in, what is quite contrary to their
known and common Sentiments and publick Confessions. I
only give some Examples of these their Arts (for who can
<pb facs="tcp:94326:6"/>
recount them all) this is certain that if ye ransack and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
their Methods, you shall find none of 'em without some
noteable Cheat and fallacy at bottom. Their Hierarchy
leans on three Props, as its fundamental Supporters: The
first is their wretch'd perversion of some Scriptures, the
second is their Fancy that it still obtain'd in the primitive
Church, the third, that 'twas believ'd by all Ages to be of
Apostolick Institution. These Conceits are the very Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of the Hierarchy, which I here examine, and, as
I trust, disprove, and accordingly so Intitulat the subsequent
Papers. I repeat as little as is possible of what has been
said before, and especially meet with the Hierarchys most
applauded and latest Asserters, and among these A. M. <hi>D.
D.</hi> and the Author of <hi>the Fundamental Charter</hi> &amp;c. the far
more considerale part, yea the very substance of both which
Books I examine and exartuat. I discuss moreover the
Plea they bring from <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, as also detect most
of the foremention'd Artifices together with many such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Methods not hitherto so fully discovered Hence
I hope I cannot be justly accounted an Aggressor or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocker,
nor yet my Papers superfluous: I don't notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
impeach as guilty of these Deallings all Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
men, for of these there have been and doubtless now
are both good men and stout Protestants, and such, I know,
will never be offended if I lay open open the Weakness and
unworthy Deallings of such as anathematize whosoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
the Model of the prime ptimitive Church-Government,
the Apostolick Humility and Simplicity, to their Diocesan
Hierarchy, the secular Grandeur of subsequent and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat
Times, if I, among many other Demonstrations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
bring a Cloud of most competent and unsuspected Witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
who depone that during the Apostolick Age and the prime
Primitive Church, there was a Bishop for each Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:94326:6"/>
an Identity of Bishop and preaching Presbyter, and, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
a compleat Parity of ordinary Pastors; if I make
appear that the greatest Enemies to this Truth and Adorers
of the Hierarchy are (maugre all their Cunning) compell'd
to subscribe and seall it. If yet some hesitat and admire, how
then so many of the Learn'd can give their Hierarchy a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sanction, or set it so high as the times of the Apostles,
such wowld remember that to fewer, at least, and these of no
less Learning, no less confidently pretend a Divine Origen
for many things, the Foundation whereof notwithstanding is
undenyably in the dust of humane Corruption. How many
Torrents of Wormwood hide their little heads in sources in
that Christian <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the space of about an hundred years after
the Canon of the Scriptures was sealled, whereof so few gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Monuments now remain, and wherein Christians (as
they were also for a good many yeares after that time) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
astonish'd at these more prodigious Heresies, and wholly
imployed in quelling these Hydra's, were kept from watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against more fly and subtile Assaults of the Enemy, the
Danger of whose Tares was scarce discernable till they were
hardly to be eradicated.</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis to be remembred that there are vast Ods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Cases of the Contending Parties; many things
tempt and invite men to patronize the Hierarchy, whereto
the other side is not obnoxious: for whosoever confides in his
own Parts and Abilities may probably promise to himself
a graduall Ascent even to the satiety of worldly Ease, Riches,
and Honour. Did not these and such Motives byass too
many men, together with the Liberty Prelacy gives to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox

should there be found to agent its Cause? On the other hand

<pb facs="tcp:94326:7"/>
nothing in Presbytry but a mediocrity of Stipend with a hard

Protestants, whom yet God protects, and I pray may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
maugre all the malicious Machinations of wicked
Men. God yet continues to call us to the same Duty of
Christian Concord, to name no others, by terrible Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
for at one Quarter we are besieg'd by nominal Theists
but real Atheists who ridicule God's Sacred Word as the
product of Rogues or Sots, and explode the Doctrine of the
Existence of Angels and Spirits, and consequently of the
Beeing of God the Father of Spirits, as the Dream of some
Brainsick Weaklings, and below a man of sence: and at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Quarter, by a direfull Combination of Infernal Fiends
and wretch'd Mortals. It's pleasant notwithstanding to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how the latter of these Satanical Machines split and
undoe the former: for the well known and confess'd Compacts
and Commerce between these wicked Spirits and Miscreants
of human Race, and Operations of Demons, and such Effects
undenyably proceeding from preternatural and incorporeal

mostly owe themselves to this Controversy, our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
Ignorance, want of Church-Discipline, and other
such its odious Effects. How many, thro' God's Blessing,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE purpose of our present Discourse is not directly to
handle that much tossed Debate; <hi>if an Office in the
Church for</hi> species <hi>or kind superiour to that of dispensing the
Word and Sacraments hath any footing or warrant in the
Word of God?</hi> Neither will this be judged necessary by
any who call to mind that many Treatises disproving
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94326:15"/>
the divine right of Episcopacy, as <hi>Altare Damascenum,</hi> and <hi>Rectius
Instruendum,</hi> have had so good success that, for ought I know, they
stand intirely without any shadow of an Answer. Yea the most learned
that ever pleaded for the Lawfulness of Episcopacy, will not blame
us, though we yeeld no Scripture-ground to it, but only consider it
in it self as a thing indifferent; of which mind, among the Ancients,
were, not only those who denyed not the exercise of his Office to be
Lawfull, as <hi>Hierome;</hi> but also the very Bishops themselves, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
all of them founding this Office, not upon <hi>Jus Dominicum,</hi> the
Law of God in the Scriptures; but <hi>Ecclesiasticam consuetudinem,</hi> the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Add hereto that both Fathers and Councils equally in Opinion and
Practice, stuck no less to the lawfulness of <hi>Patriarchat,</hi> than that of
simple Episcopacy; and yet I believe few among real Protestants will
either assert the Divine Right of this Office of <hi>Patriarchat,</hi> i. <hi>e.</hi> that it
had any Warrant for it in the Word of God; or yet that those Fathers
and Councils so believed. Which present Consideration furnisheth us
with another Argument sufficient to evince that the ancient Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rch
founded this Office only upon Custom; and, as they thought, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prudence, and not at all upon the Books of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Neither do the most Learned of the Modern Episcopals in
the least swerve from this Opinion; amongst whom I reckon D. <hi>Forbes,</hi>
who,<note n="a" place="bottom">Iren. lib. 2. Caput 11.</note> having, for a while with the greatest tenderness and fear,
handled this Matter, propones at length the Question, <hi>If Episcopacy
be of Divine Right?</hi> And yet declares himself highly difficultated what
to Answer; for absolutly deny it, he will not: and positively assert it
he dares not: he therefore confounds it with a Synodical Moderatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and then fairly tells us <hi>that it is of Divine: Right; because of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Scripture-Precepts of Church-Order and Decency.</hi> And indeed he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
himself all along in this Matter with so much nice Caution, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
and Fear, that he evinces the desperation of the Episcopal Cause,
to which so learned a Man could afford no better Defence, than really
to destroy what he pretends to vindicat.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the most Learned <hi>Bishop Vsser</hi> of another mind, who has

                     <hi>but what meant</hi> Mr. Harding <hi>here to come in with
the Difference between Priests, or Presbyters and Bishops? Thinketh he, that
Priests, and Bishops hold only by Tradition? Or is it so horrible an Heresie, as
he maketh it, to say, that by the Scriptures of God, a Bishop, and a Priest
are all one? Or knoweth he, how far, and unto whom, he reacheth the Name
of an Heretick? Verily Chrysostom saith,</hi> Inter Episcopum, &amp; Presbyterum

Christ's Religion.</hi> And, <hi>In the New Testament, he that is appointed to be a
Bishop or a Priest, needeth no Consecration by the Scripture; for Election or
Appointing thereto sufficient.</hi>

Bishop of St.</hi> Asaph, Therleby, Redman, <hi>and</hi> Cox, <hi>were all of the same
Opinion with the Arch-Bishop, that at first Bishops and Presbyters were the
same; and the two latter expresly cite the Opinion of</hi> Jerome <hi>with Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus we see by the Testimony chiefly of him who was Instrumental in Our
Reformation, that he owned not Episcopacy as a distinct Order from Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry

better governing in the Church.</hi> And having proved that <hi>Whitgift,</hi>

ye acontrary to the express Mind of his Brethren, when he says <hi>that the

to flow from Episcopacy, that it may appear if it have such Effects as
they Promise; As also inquire if the Hurt and Dammage does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderat
all the Good they can pretend to be linked to their Hierarchy.
Neither shall we neglect to examine, if what the most Learned of that

                  <head type="sub">The Aphorism No Bishop No King discuss'd.</head>
                  <p>A Chief Argument whereby they would prove the necessity of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
they bring from the great Support which they say it affords
to Monarchy. Hence with them <hi>No Bishop No King</hi> is an axioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Aphorism, which cannot be readily granted, seeing, to name no
more, the charges the Hierarchy stood the King and Kingdom made
a dear Bargain. Much was spent in their stated Revenues, but more
by their clandestine Exactions, and other sinistrous means of draining
the Country, and places of their pretended Jurisdictions, throw which
there are Incorporations that, even at this day, groan under the Debts
they then contracted: And yet more by sustaining Standing-forces to
be Janizaries to the Prelates and their Complices, and persecute the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
part of Protestants, for else there was <hi>then</hi> no use of such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Yet their Maxime may be thus far granted, that Prelacy may
much contribute to the introduction of a Despotick and Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
And indeed the great Power they usurped, and manifold
Influences they had over both Cities and Country, either to wheedle or
menace them to elect such Members of Parliament as pleased them; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94326:17"/>
to Cajole or awe these Parliament-men to speak in their own Dialect:
And the being of a good number of them prime Lords of the Articles,
whereby they had either the mediat or immediat Flection of the rest,
made them well nigh able to effect no less: Which kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no Wise and Paternal Prince will desire.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. Moreover that Princes have no great reason to be fond of
them is apparent from their great unfitness to manage Politick and
State-Affairs.</p>
                  <p>There are two Ways whereby one may be fitted for being a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
either when Natural induements are extraordinary, which I
doubt if many of our Prelats could affirm of themselves: Or else that of
Education and continued Industry whereby to be fitted for State-imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but so far were they from any thing of this, that during their
greener years, they had quite other Studies and Imployments, being
designed for the Ministry; and so were obliged to prosecute hard the
Study of Divinity, which, I am sure, will give any Man his handsfull of
Work, who makes earnest of it.</p>
                  <p>From this they are taken to feed some Flock, which, at least, will
give them no less exercise. Now, how these Men can be fit for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
State-affairs, or, how they can be well kept from falling into
Solecisms therein, whose skill is so small, is not very discernable. But
though they were never so well fore-armed for such high State-imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how find they leisure to exercise them? Is not the Ruling, and
Governing so many Ministers and Churches, which they alledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be entrusted with, a Work heavy enough to exercise, if not
to bruise any one Man? Or, where have they found Warrant to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the Ministry, and turn themselves to Offices of State when offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or to undertake both together? Do they not believe that either of
them is heavy enough? Know they not that not only the Apostle, but
also the ancient Canons, and, to name no others, these which (though
not truly) are called the Canons of the Apostles, most clearly condemn
this their Practice?</p>

when they palpable contemn and trample what themselves count
the most venerable Precepts thereof. Moreover it's observable how
they, so far as their Interest led them, still studied the ruine of those to
whom they owed their Being, as Bishops. Thus the Roman Prelats
studied the Ruine of both the Eastern and Western Emperours: Thus
the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> brought no small Vexation to both King and
Nobility, in the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. And so <hi>Becket</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

their Successours treat <hi>Richard</hi> the II, whom, in his Absence, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived

seeing the ambition of Prelats is well enough known of whatever Name
they be: Yea such also have been the Practices of Prelats who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
no Pope, as divers of the Greek Patriarks, who helped not a
little to Dethrone their Emperour. And the English Bishops (as Sir
<hi>Francis Knols</hi> complains in a Letter to Secretary <hi>Cicil</hi>) encroached not
a little upon the Priviledges of the Crown, kept Courts in their own
Name, and still give out, that the Complex of their Office, <hi>i. e.</hi> the

more clearly expresseth in Answer hereto, is, <hi>that this was a Corruption
in</hi> Edward <hi>'s Reformation: And that some other Courts in</hi> England, <hi>as well
as these of the Bishops are not kept in the King's Name.</hi> But sure, it's not
very credible that this was a Corruption seeing nothing else, since <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
Days, hath been done, during the succeeding Reigns, for that
Church's further Reformation; but 'tis an odd Paradox if we consider
the Author, for it was <hi>Mary</hi> who Abolished this Act of <hi>Edward,</hi> and
restored their Power when she brought back the rest of Popery: And
though other Courts, as he says, be not kept in the King's Name, yet
reason teacheth, and former experience proves, how dangerous it was
to give Ecclesiasticks ought that looks like an Absolute power, and
worldly Grandure, whereby, like the Pope, they may, by his Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
arrive, at length, to a real Independency. And indeed B. <hi>Laud</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94326:18"/>
made large steps towards it, who, as <hi>Roger Coke</hi> relates,<note n="c" place="bottom">Detection of the Court and State of <hi>England.</hi> Vol. 1. Page 361.</note> 
                     <hi>copt
with the King himself, and maugre both his Will and Authority must visit Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
not as his Commissioner, but by his own Metropolitan right, and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
(thus saith the Author) <hi>in his own Feathers, all black and white, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one borrowed from</hi> Caesar <hi>whereby the more he assumes to himself the less he
leaves to the King, he now soars higher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And notable here is Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s disingenuity, who always gives
out that the <hi>Marian Act,</hi> which he still compares with, yea prefers to
that of <hi>Edward,</hi> was never repealed by any succeeding Parliament. But
we are informed by the same <hi>R. Coke (d) that by the 1. Tac. 25. the
Marian Act was repealed and so that of</hi> Edward <hi>revived.</hi> And now to
see him, who pretends to be a Minister of the Gospel (whose Office is
only Ministerial and spiritual, exercised only in spiritual things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaching Men's Bodies, inflicting only Rebukes, and such verbal
punishments) to see such I say keeping Courts altogether Civil, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
corporal mulcts and Punishments after the manner of Worldly
Potentats, but especially when all this is done in their own Name, would
really make the indifferent Beholder averre that such imitated, to the
Life, his Romish Holiness, and believed much better his Doctrine of
his receiving both spiritual and temporal Sword, than that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
whereby he prohited his Apostles and their Successours all such
earthly Grandure and despotick Power, as resembles the Lordship and
Dominion of worldly Princes.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. But their Maxime not only intimats that Prelacy well accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with Mouarchy; but also, that any other Form of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is destructive thereof. Which how they will evince I know not:
How they can shew that Presbytrie, with which I am only here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is destructive of, or in the least inconsistent with Monarchy I cannot
perceive. They can, I am sure, neither deduce their Inference from
the Practice of Presbyterians, nor the Principles of Presbytrie: Not
from the first, for though they load them, as if they had been the Cause,
of many Civil Broyls and Calamities, and especially of these ensuing the
Year 38. We may justly, yea with the allowance of the Hierarchie's
greatest Favourers, reject the Charge, and send it home to the Prelats,
who, by their attempting to introduce into the Church a Mass of
Romish Superstitions, and their Pride and Tyranny exercised on all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94326:18"/>
sorts, were become unsupportable to both Nobility and People.</p>
                  <p>B. <hi>Laud, Montegue</hi> and such Papaturients were then earnestly labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reintroduction of a Mass of Romish Leaven into <hi>England,</hi> though
there were but too much there already which had never been cast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut.
Take one Instance or two in the words of <hi>R. Coke</hi> a high Church-of-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-man,
and no Lover of Presbyterians, I'm sure. <hi>The Bishops</hi> (saith he<note n="e" place="bottom">Vol. 1. Pag. 361.</note>) <hi>of the Province of</hi> Canterbury <hi>in their own Names, enjoin the removal
of the Communion-table in the Paroch Churches &amp; Vniversities, from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Church or Chancel to the east of the Chancel, &amp; cause Rails to be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Table, and refuse to administer the Sacrament to such as shall not come
up to the Rails, &amp; receive it Kneeling: that the book of Sports, on Sundays, be read
in Churches, and enjoin Adoration. I do not find that Adoration was ever enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, nor any of the forenamed Injunctions in any Canon of the Church.</hi> Our
Bishops were of the same mettal with these Innovatours in <hi>England,</hi>
and their most docile Schollars: <hi>Laud</hi> therefore and his Faction
apprehending that we would make but a small resistance against them to
whom <hi>England</hi> was likely to yeeld, prepared for us all her Cup with
some other additional Drugs more Romish, than what was obtruded
on the <hi>English.</hi> Witness <hi>the Form in the Administration of the Sacrament
which</hi> (as R. Coke<note n="d" place="bottom">Pag. 368.</note> acknowledges) <hi>was the same in the Mass.</hi>
But seeing, the knowledge of the state we were in, when the Nation
entred into a Covenant, and opposed that Stream of Romish Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
contributes not a little to repell their fierce charges of Rebellion
and Sedition; the Reader will pardon me though at some length I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a Passage from one who is beyond suspicion of being partial in
favours of Presbytrie, Covenant, or ought of that nature: I mean Dr.
<hi>Burnet</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="bottom">Memoires of the D. of <hi>Hamiltoun.</hi> Pag. 29. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>The Bishops</hi> (saith he) <hi>therefore were cherished by him</hi> (the
King viz.) <hi>with all imaginable expressions of kindness and confidence; but
they lost all their Esteem with the People, and that upon divers Accounts. The
People of</hi> Scotland <hi>had drunk in a deep prejudice against every thing that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of Popery. This the Bishops judged was too high, and therefore took all
means possible to lessen it, both in Sermons and Discourses, mollifying their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and commending their Persons, not without some reflections on the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.
But this was so far from gaining their Design, that it abated nothing of
the Zeal was against Popery, but very much hightned the rage against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as favouring it too much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94326:19"/>
                     <hi>There were also subtile Questions started some Years before in</hi> Holland <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Predestination and Grace; and</hi> Arminius <hi>his Opinion, as it was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Synod at</hi> Dort, <hi>so was generally ill reported of in all reformed Churches,
and no-where worse than in</hi> Scotland: <hi>but most of the Bishops, and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
undertook openly and zealously the Defence of these Tenets. Likewise
the Scotish Ministers and People had ever a great respect to the Lord's-day,
and generally the Morality of it is reckoned an Article of Faith among them:
but the Bishops not only undertook to beat down this Opinion, but by their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
expressed their neglect of that Day; and after all this they declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
avowed Zealots for the Liturgy and Ceremonies of</hi> England, <hi>which were
held by the Zealous of</hi> Scotland <hi>all one with Popery. Vpon these Accounts it
was, that they lost all their Esteem with the People. Neither stood they in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Terms with the Nobility, who at that time were as considerable as ever</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>saw them; and so proved both more sensible of Injuries, and more capable
of resenting them. They were offended with them, because they seemed to have
more interest with the King than themselves had, so that Favours were mainly
distributed by their Recommendation; they were also upon all Affairs, nine of
of them were Privy Counsellers, divers of them were of the Exehequer,</hi> Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<hi>Arch-Bishop of S.</hi> Andrews, <hi>was made Chancellour, and</hi> Maxwell
<hi>Bishop of</hi> Ross <hi>was fair for the Treasury, and engaged in a high rivalry with the
Earl of</hi> Traquair, <hi>then Treasourer, which tended not a little to help foreward
their Ruine. And besides this, they began to pretend highly to the Titles and
Impropriations, and had gotten one</hi> Learnmonth <hi>a Minister presented Abbot
of</hi> Lindoris, <hi>and seemed confident to get that state of Abbots, with all the
Revenue and Power belonging to it, again restored into the hands of Churchmen;
designing also, that according to the first Institution of the Colledge of Justice, the
half of them should be Churchmen. This could not but touch many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the quick, who were too large sharers in the Patrimony of the Church,
not to be very seusible of it. They were no less hatefull to the Ministry, because
of their Pride, which was cried out upon as unsupportable. Great Complaints
were also generally made qf Simoniacal Pactions with their Servants, which was
imputed to the Masters, as if it had been for their advantage, at least by their
allowance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>They also exacted a new Oath of Intrants, (besides what was in the
Act of Parliament for obedience to their ordinary) in which they
were obliged to obey the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and submit to the Liturgy
and Canons. They were also dayly making Inroads upon their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94326:19"/>
of which the Ministers were very sensible; and universally
their great rigour against any that favoured of Puritanism, together
with their medling in all Secular-affairs, and relinquishing their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses
to wait on the Court and Council, made them the Object of all
Men's fury. But that which heightned all to a <hi>Crisis</hi> was, their
advising the King to introduce some Innovations in the Church by his
own Authority; things had prospered so ill in general Assemblies, that
they thought of these no more. And in the Parliament 1633. that
small addition to the prerogative, that the King might appoint what
habits he pleased to the Clergy, met with vigorous opposition, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the King seemed much concerned for it; those who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it being sharply taken up, and much neglected by his Majesty,
which stuck deep in their Hearts, the Bishops bearing all the blame
of it. At this time a Liturgy was drawn for <hi>Scotland,</hi> or rather the
English reprinted with that Title, save that it had some Alterations
which rendred it more invidious and less satisfactory; and after long
consulting about it and another Book of Canons, they were at length
agreed to, that the one should be the Form of the Scotish-worship, and
the other the model of their Government, which did totally vary from
their former Practices and Constitutions: and as if all things had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
to carry on their Ruine, the Bishops not satisfied with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
High-commission-court, produced Warrants from the King for
setting up such Commissions in their several Diocesses, in which with
other Assessors, Ministers, and Gentlemen, all of their own Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they might punish Offenders. That was put in practice only by
the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> who though he was a pious and learned Man,
yet was fiery and passionate, and went so roundly to work, that it was
cryed out upon as a Yoke and Bondage which the Nation was not able
to bear. And after all this the King (advised by the Bishops) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Service-book to be received through <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be
read according to the New Book at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on Easter-day in the
year 1637.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> of which kind much more might be taken from his,
and the Writings of other Adversaries themselves, and yet far more from
these of the Disinterested. And now judge under how wofull a Burden
we then groaned, and if it was not high time for the Nation to curb such
Tyranny over Bodies and Consciences, and stemm the tide of these
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94326:20"/>
hatefull Corruptions, which not softly and by a stelth, but by violence,
like a mighty torrent, were bearing all before them, and at once ready
to sweep away both Religion and Property: Should they not by sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
still and quietly yeelding both Sacred and Civil Rights, have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the highest degree treacherous to their God, Countrey and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
And seeing the Prelats were either the Authors, or great Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of all this Mischief. and the Office it self asserted only upon human-right,
and so as a thing indifferent, by its ablest Advocats; and by the
King himself<note n="h" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Nalson</hi>'s Collections Vol. 1. Page 247.</note> yeelded <hi>to be contrary to the constitution of the Church</hi> of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> And, finally, by the body of the Nation held to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
Tyrannical and Antichristian: Were they not then highly obliged,
not only, to cashire the Officers, but also to abolish the Office it self?
In the mean while, though their Supplications were both most humble
and reasonable, yet so had B. <hi>Laud</hi> and his Faction mislead and abused
the King's Majesty, who otherwise was both Vertuous and Laudable,
that the Suppliants were at first answered with terrible Menaces, then
with dilatory and ambiguous Speeches, which were seconded with
earnest Preparations for a most destructive War, and vengeance on the
supposed Delinquents. Nor was ever ought granted but by inches as
the urgency of the Courts Affairs compelled them, resolving in the mean
while only to gain time, and practise such Artifices untill strength being
recovered, the Suppliants, either broken among themselves, or lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into security, might be overwhelmed at unawars, and with the more
ease sacrificed to the fury of the <hi>Canterburians.</hi> As for the black and
criminal Actions imputed, during these Times, to the Covenanters
(<hi>i. e.</hi> to the body of the Nation, seeing not only the Bulk of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,
and Gentry, but also the Nobility well nigh to a man, save the
Papists, as is acknowledged on all hands, joined in opposing these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities)
as I shall ever most frankly condemn them when the charge
is proved, and doubt not (which falls out in the best of Actions) but
that divers who joined them might drive sinistrous Ends; so I averre
that all the impartial will distinguish between <hi>Scelus</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi>
and ascribe any Escapes or Solecims, any way chargeable on
others, not to their want of Conscience and Loyalty, but at worst to
their want of fore-sight: to which byass the odd dealings of the
Court, and their want of Experience of these with whom they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94326:20"/>
joined, doubtless contributed not a little to incline them. They
were not ignorant that King <hi>James</hi> who (as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Memoires Page 29.</note> intimats)
opposed Presbytry, not out of Conscience, but <hi>Policy,</hi> rarely minded to
keep what he promised; and, at every innovation he introduc'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr'd
that it should be the last, while he only designed to make it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
for more. And indeed, to name no others, King <hi>James</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicating,
temporizing, promising, and consenting to what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mean'd to stand longer than untill by force, he should be able to
undoe them, is not altogether conceal'd even by his own <hi>Spotswood</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="bottom">Hist. Page 447, 453.</note>
himself, though rarely, I acknowledge, guilty of so much ingenuity.
Neither made he any bones to obtrude on this Kingdom inquisition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
High-commission-courts, <hi>without</hi> any Law<note n="l" place="bottom">Memoires Page 47. &amp; <hi>alibi</hi>
                     </note> or <hi>Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These his steps were troaden by his Successour, who, being Prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by the <hi>Canterburians,</hi> with all imaginable severity, urged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
these lawless Innovations, and yet stuck not to averre that <hi>he
took Arms only to surpress Rebellion, and not to impose Novelties</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">Memoires Page 60.</note>. And
that all Concessions then given were only to gain time, till sufficient
strength to overwhelm this Kingdom, might be recovered, is not only
colligible from the more impartial Accounts of these Times, but also
from <hi>Nalson</hi> himself. <hi>The King</hi> (saith he<note n="n" place="bottom">Collections Vol. 1. Page 245.</note>) <hi>was prevail'd with, by this
reason offered by</hi> Traquair <hi>to sign the following Instructions. That his Majesty
notwithstanding whatever the Parliament could do, might, whenever he was in
a better Capacity, introduce Episcopacy, because the Bishops being by all the
Laws of</hi> Scotland, <hi>one of the three Estates of Parliament, no Act that passed
without them would be of force, much less an Act for their Abolition, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they not appearing or consenting to it, but protesting against it.</hi> Now, as the
same <hi>Nalson</hi> relates, In these Instructions the King allows his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
to cousent in his Name to the abolishing of Episcopacy when it
should be enacted by the General Assembly. And now judge what strange
Policy this was, which left the King at Liberty to null all Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein Bishops had not a Vote, even tho' himself had ratified the
Abolition of Episcopacy, and added never so positive a Sanction to these
Acts made without Bishops, which presuppos'd his Ratification of
their Exclusion from voting in Parliament. Now I say, such strange
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94326:21"/>
dealings as these, and thereupon the dreadfull Effects of the Court's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so soon as it could gather strength to exercise them, might promp
Men to an extream sheiness of believing any of its Promises, and incline
them to a closser Conjunction with these of whose Arts they had less Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And doubtless when they made the League with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Parliament, they were far from believing that some of them drove
such Ends as afterwards appeared, and far from foreseeing (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were many of the <hi>then</hi> English Parliament) the dismal Alterations
which ensued; otherwise certainly they had never join'd with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
or done ought of that kind. And indeed, as to their second entry
into <hi>England,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Memoires Page 235, 236.</note> ingenuously demonstrats that it was well
nigh impossible for them at that time to do otherways. Moreover that
the Crime of Selling his Majesty is falsly imputed to the State or
Church of this Nation, and that they abhorr'd and detested so wicked
a Parricide as was committed on his Royal Person, may be attested even
by the greatest of Royalists themselves; whereof, their Reception of,
and standing for King <hi>Charles</hi> the II, and that in opposition to Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicks,
untill they together with him were broken by the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Enemy, is a sufficient evidence.</p>
                  <p>And as I shall not defend the separate actings of some call'd the Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats,
so I say that every just Estimator of these Affairs will, after seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reflection, be ready, at least, to excuse and pity them; seeing they
not only had fresh memory of the scarce paralell'd dealing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Reign, but also perceived evident Specimens of a strange Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
in the Successor; whence they might collect how sad and terrible
things might be feared from him, should he be permitted to give the
reins of Affairs to the Popish and other Incendiaries, whom even at that
time he was observed most to favour; and if his subsequent Actions have
not given these too much to say for themselves, I leave to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the unbyass'd. However things be, seeing these were but a
handfull never approv'd by the body of the Nation, or the most part
of Presbyterians therein, their doings cannot in the least infringe the
instance. Another instance is that of the Presbyterians their assisting
and preserving of King <hi>James</hi> the VI in his Minority.</p>
                  <p>But now put case many foul and unjustifiable things might be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and these their Actions accompanied with many Circumstances and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94326:21"/>
Concomitants not to be defended; yet how levels this at the core of the
Controversie? <hi>Jam dic Posthume de tribus capellis?</hi> Let them either speak
to the purpose, or acknowledge their extravagancies: It's evident, and
we prove, yea even from their own most approved Writers, that then,
Liberty, Religion, and all morality was struck at and well nigh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed;
the Body of the Nation jointly oppos'd themselves, that
they might stop the Torrent. Now the Question is, if this was Lawfull
and well done? and with this they rarely dar medle, or if they do, it
must be on presupposition of pure passive obedience, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and of other such Hypotheses as not only equally level at the
Reformation of most of the Churches from Popery, but also transform
regular Monarchy into an absolute Tyranny, ruine all Subjects, and at
length prove really destructive of what they pretend to advance: either
I say they must use these or the like Hypotheses, and so give what is well
nigh nothing to the purpose, or else adduce what is wholly forraign
thereto, and only load our stout and worthy Opposers of that Mass of
Romish Superstition, Irreligion, and Prophanity, with most heavy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
as false and perfidious, acting from bad and base Motives, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
unworthy Methods, driving sinistrous Ends, and thus only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to bespatre and blacken their Adversaries, not to handle the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie:
And this minds me of what I have observ'd in some of the
Popish Historians, and others of their Declaimers against our first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
for their bad cause permitting them to speak little or nothing
directly to the Purpose, and their Malice allowing them as little to be
silent; they spend most of their Harangues in decrying and reproaching
all who were active in that Reformation as guilty of many foul personal
Blemishes, acting nothing sincerely but out of base Principles, and to
as ill Designs: and amongst other things is chiefly objected the Crime
of Rebellion, whereon the Romanists most commonly expatiat: and
some of them add much about Conspiracies between these Rèformers
and the <hi>Turk</hi> against the Catholicks as if <hi>He</hi> had been at the bottom of
most was then done: just as our Adversaries make <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi>
and the <hi>French,</hi> the Authors and chief Promoters of our opposing <hi>Laud</hi>'s
Popish Innovations: surely the former is less ridiculous and carries
more colour of possibility than the latter. In the mean while it will
make their Calumnies of less Credit with all true Protestants, that they
load <hi>Knox</hi> and the rest of our first Reformers with no less black detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94326:22"/>
and slander, than they do these of the 38, accusing and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them of an anarchick and ungovernable Temper, hatred against
all Kings, Faction and Rebellion: and on this false pretence they
breath out their malice and bitterness against them, and that no less
fiercely than they do against the Opposers of the <hi>Canterburian</hi> Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries.
And thus much of the Practice of Presbyterians.</p>
                  <p>Neither have they any more reason to alledge the second, that the
Principles of Presbytry are contrary to Monarchy, none of them yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any such Inference. Their peculiar Hypothesis wherein they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Prelacy is, <hi>that no Pastor ought to usurp a Dominion or Superiority
over his Brethren:</hi> And how this Principle can induce any to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the eversion of Monarchy, is not easily conjectured.</p>
                  <p>They have yet another Principle, <hi>that whosoever is call'd to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
ought not to intangle himself in any Civil Affairs, but to lay out himself
wholly for the Souls of Men, and to this end be instant in season and out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
Which is consonant enough to the former, but opposite to
the Principles of Prelats; who assert that Civil and Ecclesiastick Offices
are compatible, and may be lodged in the same Subject: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they grasp and inhance whatsoever Places of State they can come by,
both of higher and lower degree. Now, whether that Government

opprest and rent with innumerable Schisms, hatch'd and sustain'd by
Bishops, in opposition to Bishops; no less, at least, than by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in opposition to Presbyters. Yea it is certain that these, whom
they contend to be Diocesans, were either the Inventers, or, at least, the
main Propagators and Abettors thereof. Were not <hi>Victor</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and

<hi>Fidus</hi> in <hi>Africk, Photinus</hi> of <hi>Syrmium,</hi> with many others. And
in short, few Heresies or Schisms sprang up in these Times, but they had

either Bishops for their Authors, or else for their great Abettors; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

they were raised through the Pride and Competition of men aspiring to

                  <p>But take one Instance further, in respect of which the rest are but
Grasshopers, in the Person of the <hi>Romish Bishop,</hi> or Bishops; who have

Pharisees: thus the Christians answer'd the Heathens alledging the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity

indeed to the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which, to say the best, are in divers

all along; but of this more afterward.</p>
                  <p>Other Catalogues and Memorials of the Bishops of the ancientest
Times, were written long after, when Prelacy had got a higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendant,
and the Mystery of Iniquity was more palpably working:
therefore these Authors spoke according to, and in the Style of their
own times, and not in the Style of the times wherein these Pastors liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

having taken notice <hi>that</hi> Eusebius <hi>makes it a most hard Matter to know who

hard a Matter to find, out who succeeded the Apostles in the Churches planted
by them, unless it be mention'd the Writings of Paul? What becomes then of
our unquestionable Line of Succession of the Bishops of several Churches, and
the large Diagrams made of the Apostolick Churches with every one's Name
set down in his Order, as if the Writer had been</hi> Clarenceaulx <hi>to the Apostles
themselves? Is it come to this at last that we having nothing certain but what we
have in Scriptures? And must then the Tradition of the Church be our Rule to
interpret Scriptures by? An excellent way to find out the Truth doubtless, to
bend the Rule to the croocked stick,</hi> &amp;c. Again it's certain that, for divers
Centuries, Bishops were nothing like what they are now, either in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
Civil Power, or Jurisdiction over other Pastors, or yet in the
largeness of Dioceses; so that the Term <hi>Bishop</hi> in respect of the two is
little better than an equivocal. It's certain also that the ancient Church
wanted not her own Blemishes: which was well perceived by her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,

and Manners, on which they never founded the Episcopal Superiority.

concern'd therewith, seeing we have the greatest Opposers of Arrians,
intirely Aërians (to speak in the stile of our Opposits) in the matter
of Presbytry, as we have already shewed. But I must here add, that it

others; but none of these or any others mention a word of the Schism
of <hi>Aërius,</hi> which if we believe <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> was a Schism among the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
themselves: for he tells us that Eustathius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Sebastia <hi>in</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<hi>from whom</hi> Aërius <hi>made the separation, was a down-right</hi> Arrian, <hi>and

the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie which is the last before the Appendix, he promises
more) make a good proof that it's not easie to discern the genuine part
of that Tractat from the Spurious. However this be from what is

                  <p>§. 11. They accuse <hi>Eustathius</hi> of Levity, Deceit, Macedonianism,
or the denial of the Holy Ghost's Divinity, a most damnable Heresie,
yet different from Arrianism. And herein also they represent him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
variable and unfixed, than intirely wedded to this Heresie. He
once subscrib'd to the Orthodox Doctrine, and was approv'd as such
by <hi>Liberius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome, then</hi> Orthodox, and other Catholick
Christians. But they write that he relapsed. In the mean while, when he
was most for the Macedonians, he said as he would not call the Holy-Ghost
God, so he durst not call him a Creature; hence, he may rather
be counted among these who were most dangerously shaken, than a
down-right Macedonian; and may for all is said of his Opinions plead
for some Charity from all that well consider, the most dismal and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Age wherein he lived.</p>

§. 12. But let him be an Arrian blacker than <hi>Arrius</hi> himself, it will
be hard thence to draw any Conclusion concerning <hi>Aërius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>First, Basil,</hi> in the forecited place, tells us, that <hi>Eustathius</hi> was
so cunning, as to perswade the ablest of these times that he was Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox;
and why might he not then put a Cheat on his own Presbytry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Eustathius,</hi> as is related, was much given to Covetousness,
and altho' <hi>Epiphanius</hi> carri'd out with Passion, for his Innovations justifies
and praises him, that he may reach a harder Blow to <hi>Aërius:</hi> yet this
his Avarice was one of the Grounds wherefore <hi>Aërius,</hi> (as he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth)
deserted <hi>Eustathius:</hi> and this I think is no less to be believ'd,
than ought else we have from <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> uncharitably at least, wresting
both his Words and Actions. And it is not improbable that he, who had
the Conscience to dislike <hi>Eustathius</hi> for his Vices, might do no less on
the account of his Errors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Aërius</hi> was priviledg'd by God with, both, eyes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and courage to oppose the unwarranted <hi>Festivals,</hi> superstitious
<hi>Fasts, Prayer and Sacrifice for the Dead,</hi> and other such then growing
Dottages, notwithstanding that they were so kindly imbrac'd by most
Christians. Now I believe that hardly an Instance can be adduc'd, of
any who set himself in Opposition to the whole World, by condemning
such growing Corruptions, and attempting at least to stop the beginnings
of <hi>Anti-christianism,</hi> and yet fell into this damnable Heresie wherewith
they brand <hi>Aërius.</hi> I hope therefore, that henceforth all true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
shall inlarge their Charity, and be more backward to join with
Romanists in bespattering the memory of him who did amongst the first
declare his Detestation of the leaven of <hi>Romanism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 13. Had any thing written by <hi>Aërius,</hi> come unstain'd to our
hands, I doubt not but we had got a far other account of his Creed and
Doctrine: but the Zeal of these Innovatours prompted them to make
all Opposers of their Fopperies grand Hereticks, and fasly stigmatize
Truth's Witnesses with what really deserved that name, and then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
them with Calumnies; and gave their Writings to the Flames
for a Repository. This was the Fate of <hi>Vigilantius, Claudius Taurinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
and others, of whose Writings nothing, except some mangl'd and
deprav'd scrapes found in the bitter Invectives of their most partial and
disingenous Adversaries, remains.</p>

From all which is evident the falsehood of what <hi>Philastrius</hi> alledges,

                     <note n="f" place="bottom">Ibidem <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the</hi> Aërians <hi>were banish'd from Churches, Lands, Villages, and Cities, and
that often times they lodg'd only in the open Air, all covered with Snow, and were
oblig'd to seek shelter in the Woods and Rocks.</hi> Now what was the cause of
this so violent hatred and hot Persecution? Was it their being guilty of
<hi>Arrianism?</hi> sure not: For if we believe <hi>Epiphanius</hi> they were a branch
of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and, as he insinuats, liv'd among them. But suppose
they did not, we find no such Persecution of the <hi>Arrians</hi> on the account
of their Faith in these times, but only their Exclusion from the publick
Churches. They being permitted in the mean while to keep their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles

Add hereto (which we trust we have evinc'd) that <hi>Aërius</hi> never Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniz'd,
and so they could not persecute him, and his Followers upon
this account. From all that is now said, 'tis clear, that we most seek
another spring of this violent Hate and Persecution. And this I think

any others in the World at that time, and so had presently War made u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

                  <p>THo' their Argument brought from Antiquity, be already satisfi'd,
we shall yet give some Instances of Churches, which, for several
Centuries, were really without Diocesan Bishops. St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Apostle, is commonly said to have ordain'd several hundreds of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who, I'm sure, could not be Diocesans. Dr. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Defence of Diocesan Episcopacy. Page 153.</note> being displeas'd with this Instance, rejects <hi>Nennius,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
from whom we have the account of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s ordaining 365
<hi>Bishops,</hi> as fabulous. But it's not in their accounts of the numbers of
Bishops, but of the Deeds and Miracles wrought by Bishops, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of their Saints, that the fabulousness of the Writers of these
times is commonly to be observ'd.</p>
                  <p>He next quarrels with the common reading of that Author, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>He speaks only of the Bishops in</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Britain, <hi>in communion
with</hi> St. Patrick, <hi>not of his</hi> Irish <hi>Bishops.</hi> But, I think, we may, in such
critical Learning give Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> the Preference, who<note n="b" place="bottom">Of the Religion of the <hi>Irish.</hi> Page 59.</note> neither
judg'd this Book fabulous, nor its common reading to be suspected.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94326:29"/>
And this account of the great number of Ancient Irish Bishops, is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm'd by what <hi>Clarkson</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Primitive Episcopacy. Page 40.</note> cites out of <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Baron,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>there were well nigh as many Bishops as Churches.</hi> This the Doctor
passes over in silence, which was scarce fair enough dealling. Neither
can the Doctor's ordinary <hi>salvo, viz.</hi> that the Practice was not generally
approv'd, nor of primitive Constitution, here serve them; for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
differ'd from the Roman Model, was presently made a Novelty.
And tho' <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Lanfranc</hi> dislike the Practice of having so many
Bishops, yet they adventure not to instance any time wherein the <hi>Irish</hi>
had been rul'd by a few Diocesans. And lastly, the Authors most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardable
herein, inform us that this Practice of having so many Bishops
had place even in St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s time, and meer infancy of the Irish Church.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Most visible footsteps of this also appear in the <hi>African</hi> Church,
during the time of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> for in that Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he
presided, there was no smal number of Bishops conveen'd, tho' doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there were many moe Bishops in <hi>Africk,</hi> who could not be all Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesans,
seeing few then were Christians in <hi>Africk,</hi> save a small part of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies only. Yea the hamlets and villages, these Bishops
had for their Jurisdictions, are so obscure, that the learn'd <hi>Pamelius</hi>
is at a stand where to place them. And, long after, in the time of the
<hi>Vandalick</hi> Persecution, as <hi>Victor Vticensis</hi> relates,<note n="d" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. Vnde factum est ut post obitum <hi>Carthaginis</hi> Episcopi <hi>Zeugitanae,</hi> &amp; procensulari Provinciae, Episcopos interdice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret ordinarios quorum erat numerus 164.</note> 
                     <hi>there were in the</hi>
Zeugitan <hi>or proconsular Province alone 164 Bishops:</hi> others reckon moe.
Now this was but a small part of what the <hi>Romans</hi> possess'd in <hi>Africk,</hi> and
few, beside the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, were at that time Christian; for the
<hi>Moors,</hi> or old <hi>Africans,</hi> who, beside what they had in the Cities,
possess'd almost the whole Country, are by the same <hi>Victor</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
call'd <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and many of the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves had not yet
imbrac'd Christianity. Now subduce, from that small number of the
<hi>Zeugitan</hi> Province who were Christians, the many <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other
Hereticks, and Schismaticks, whom these Bishops did not reckon as a
part of their Flocks, and surely there shall scare be found so many as to
make up above 164 Parishes. Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> tells us<note n="e" place="bottom">Page 164.</note> that <hi>all the
African Bishops in Cyprian's time, could not have suppli'd the Dioceses of one
Province, in the V or VI Century.</hi> Which, if true, is a strong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94326:30"/>
of what we plead for, <hi>viz.</hi> that they then were nothing less
than Diocesans: seeing as is now evident, there were, even in the fifth
Century, but a very small number of Christians in <hi>Africk,</hi> compar'd
with the rest of the Inhabitans. And in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, it may well be
judg'd that there were some hundreds of Bishops in the <hi>Roman Africk.</hi>
But in such Cases, not the extent of Bounds, but number of Souls is to
be considered. Wherefore he should be a wild Reasoner, that should
conclude from <hi>Africa</hi>'s having a dozen, or such a number of Bishops,
or Pastors, for surely there were but few at the entry of Christianity,
that there needed be no more afterward, and so make that number the
Standard to discern how many Bishops, by primitive Right, were to be
plac'd in all <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is a Kin to what he says<note n="f" place="bottom">Page 185.</note> elsewhere, <hi>that tho' there were
Bishops in small Towns, this was not the primitive State of the Church;</hi> it may
be indeed; nor yet, at the first entry of the Gospel, were there Bishops
in most part of the great Towns: but was this for fear of Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Dioceses? no surely; but these few were all could be then gotten.
The substance of his Answer here is, that Africa <hi>was most large, fertile,
popolous.</hi> The first of which is readily granted, but the second not so
easily, much of these Regions being more fertile of sand and Serpents
than of Corn and Wine: and this in part discredits the third; seeing
so much as was barren, is not to be suppos'd Popolous; wherefore it's
surprising to find him making the Old <hi>Roman Africk</hi> more Popolous
than <hi>France</hi> is now. He<note n="g" place="bottom">Page 165.</note> supposes that <hi>Africk had but 500 Bishops,
and yet might have 40000 villages.</hi> But I answer, that if the villages were
considerable, and had Christian Inhabitants, for otherways this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this purpose, then had <hi>Africk</hi> 40000 Bishops: for <hi>H. Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="bottom">Right of Churches, review Page 153.</note> acknowledges <hi>that Bishops in</hi> Africk <hi>were so plentifull, that every
good village must needs be the Seat of an Episcopal Church.</hi> Which words of
<hi>H. Thorndick</hi> are cited by <hi>Clarkson</hi> but dissembl'd by the Doctor. In the
mean while, I can find nothing which can shake what I have said above,
or overturn, as for example, what I have noted from <hi>Victor</hi>'s words,
and oblige me to lessen my substraction. Add to what is said the words
of Dr. <hi>Burnet. In St.</hi> Augustin's <hi>time</hi> (saith he<note n="i" place="bottom">Conferences. Page 348.</note>) <hi>it appears from
the journals of a Conference he had with the</hi> Donatists, <hi>that there were about
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94326:30"/>
five hundred Bishopricks in a small tract of ground.</hi> But we need not cross
Seas in pursuit of ancient Churches free of Diocesans, seeing our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<hi>Scotland</hi> affords us so luculent a proof of our Assertion. The words of
<hi>Prosper Aquitanicus,</hi> in his Chronicle annex'd to that of <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
are most clear and cogent. Palladius (saith he<note n="k" place="bottom">Ad Scotos in Christum credentes ordinatur à Papa <hi>Caelestino, Palladius &amp; primus Episcopus mittitur.</hi>

                  <p>§. 3. Yea so clear is this Truth, that the most learn'd of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
have found no better way to elude, when they cannot clide it, than,
as <hi>Torniellus</hi> in another case said of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to endeavour the <hi>penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

but both he and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> are nervously refuted by the learn'd
Sir <hi>George M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>kenzie</hi> Advocat; and that their main purpose and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
was utterly desperat, he makes soon appear. <hi>And tho</hi>' (saith
he) <hi>this</hi> Author <hi>could prove, that we were not settl'd here, before the year 503
yet that could not answer the Argument. (viz.</hi> that is brought against Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
from the Scotish primitive Church-government <hi>for the</hi> Culdees
<hi>might have been settl'd before that time.</hi> And thus, in a few syllables, he
demonstrats that the Bishop, as to his ultimat design, had only his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for his cost. But Sir <hi>George</hi> being too sagacious not to foresee, that,
from the mutual strugglings between himself and the Bishop, any man
might easily conclude, that <hi>Presbytry</hi> was the primitive Government of
the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and having been one of the prime Instruments
to put in execution the prelatical Fury, judg'd himself concern'd, in
credit, to say somewhat in favours of Episcopacy, and attempt the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such an Inference. Wherefore, to this purpose, in a Letter to
the Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> prefix'd to the <hi>defence of the Antiquity of the Royal Line
of</hi> Scotland, He makes several assayes: The first whereof is,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>this is one of the meanest Arguments, that ever were us'd by a</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rian:—
<hi>And that it is a weak Argument,</hi> (saith he) <hi>appears
from this, that I have met with very few</hi> Laicks <hi>in all our Countrey, who had
heard of it; nor with one, even of these few who had valu'd it.</hi> But be it so that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94326:31"/>
the Argument seem mean, we gain notwithstanding a most sufficient
<hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> seeing our ablest Adversaries value it so much;
yea, Sir <hi>George</hi> himself clearly acknowledges this, while he saith, <hi>and
what can the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>think of their other Arguments, which they value
much? since this, which they valu'd so little, is thought of such force by a learn'd</hi>
Bishop, <hi>as to deserve a whole book, the cutting off of</hi> 44 Kings, <hi>and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
a</hi> Nation of Friends. But it's nothing tho' the <hi>Laicks</hi> had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
valu'd nor heard it, seeing, as himself grants, <hi>Blondel,</hi> with whom
join the rest of the Presbyterian Writers, urg'd it. Hence appears, that
this Argument is, by both Parties, judg'd to be of great force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence:
for the solution whereof, the Advocat brings nothing save
what is altogether unworthy of any ingenous man. As for example, <hi>since</hi>
(saith he) <hi>it cannot be deni'd, but that these who ordain'd our</hi> Presbyters <hi>were</hi>
Bishops; <hi>it necessarly follows, that</hi> Episcopacy <hi>was settl'd in the Christian
Church before we had</hi> Presbyters <hi>or</hi> Culdees. Wherein, as to the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Argument, which was the scope of his Letter, he only begs
the Question, and gives us what is impertinent thereto, and contradicts,
moreover, these our Historians, whose credit he so excellently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,
seeing, as we heard, they plainly tell us, that our ancient Anti-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesan
practice was the very custom of the primitive Church. And,
<hi>when our Historians say that the Abbots of</hi> Icolm-kill <hi>had Jurisdiction over all
the</hi> Bishops <hi>of the Province, that is to be understood, as</hi> Beda <hi>observes,</hi> more
inusitato; <hi>after an unusual manner.</hi> And yet he compares this practice
of the Abbot to that of <hi>a King who makes one a Bishop,</hi> and to the practice
of <hi>a Mother who makes her Son a Church-man:</hi> now if it be any strange or
surprising thing for a King, by his <hi>Congé d'eslire,</hi> to make one a Bishop,
or for a Mother to educate her Son in order to be a Church-man, and
procure some place for him, let any man judge. And, <hi>later Historians</hi>
(saith the Advocat) <hi>meeting with these ambigous words in our Annals</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signatus,
Electus, Ordinatus, <hi>were, by a mistake, induc'd to appropriat these
words to the formal Ceremony of Ordination and Imposition of hands.</hi> As if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man in his wit could take these words to mean any other thing than
Ordination, providing they be, as they are in our Annals, spoken of
one Church-man in relation to another. Moreover, he knew suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
that the best Records of our Country expresly say, that our Church
was rul'd by Presbyters without Bishops, and so leave not the least room
for tergiversation. <hi>Bede</hi> is one of these Authors who creat them so

uses to have for its Rector an Abbot, who is a Presbyter to whose Jurisdiction the
whole Province and even the Bishops themselves, after an unusual manner ought
to be subject according to the example of their first Teacher, who was no Bishop
but a Presbyter.</hi> Hence it's clear, that even in <hi>Bede</hi>'s time, Bishops were
but of smal note here, and their power much less than in other Churches.
They are therefore much pain'd with <hi>Bede</hi>'s words, and chiefly St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph,</hi>
who, amongst other odd things he excogitats, tells us, that <hi>the
Superiority this Presbyter had over the Bishops, was only in respect of the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Isle which the King gave the Abbot.</hi> As if ever <hi>Bede,</hi> or any man
else could have mark'd such a Superiority as strange and unusual, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but what every Prince or Lord of any place still practises;
who, altho' he subject himself to a Bishop in Spirituals, yet in respect
of Temporals and the <hi>Royalty,</hi> uses to retain the Superiority. But,

invested with the Royalty thereof, or any other Island: and <hi>yet to
him</hi> were all the Bishops of the whole Province (all the Bishops of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
saith the Saxon Chronicle, cited by the Bishop himself) subjected,
so that this pretended Royalty of <hi>Columban</hi> over the Island, becomes a
vain dream, &amp; tho' 'twere real could do him no kindness, the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
being certainly a far other thing than any such Island; wherefore
the Superiority this Presbyter had over these Bishops, must needs have
been in Ecclesiastick affairs; and this was really remarkable and unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
But of this enough; for, whosoever believes that the errand of this
most ancient Preacher and Propagator of Christ's Kingdom, was to win
an earthly Kingdom to himself, and that the King shar'd with him his

—The Scots (<hi>he says) were instructed in the Christian Faith by Priests
and Monks, without any Bishops. But from the instruction of the</hi> Scots <hi>in
the Faith to conclude, that the Church after it was gathered had no other form of
Government, will not stand with any reason. For be it as they speak, that by
the Travels of fome pious Monks the</hi> Scots <hi>were first converted unto Christ;
it cannot be said that the Church was ruled by Monks, seeing long after these
times it was not permitted to Monks to meddle with matters of the Church, nor
were they reckon'd among the Clergy.</hi> But it's strange how he can alledge
<hi>Buchanan</hi> to be supported by no Authors, except <hi>Major,</hi> for <hi>Palladius</hi>
his being <hi>Scotland</hi>'s first Bishop: he could not but know, that not only
<hi>Major,</hi> but also <hi>Fordun, Bede,</hi> with many others within the <hi>Isle; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
Bergumensis,</hi> and, among the later Historians, the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses,
Baron,</hi> with many other Transmarines, assert it. And this last
affirms that <hi>none can deny it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 4. It's true, <hi>Spotswood</hi> says<note n="x" place="bottom">Hist. Page. 4.</note> that Boeth <hi>out of ancient Annals
reports that these Priests were wont for their better Government to elect
some one of their number, by common suffrage, to be Chief and Principal among
them, without whose knowledge and consent nothing was done in any matter of
importance; and that the person so elected was called</hi> Scotorum Episcopus,
<hi>a</hi> Scots <hi>Bishop, or a Bishop of</hi> Scotland. But they reap little advantage
here, for in <hi>Boeth</hi>'s words (y) there is no mention, as the Bishop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
book affirms, whether these Annals were ancient or modern. But
whatever they be <hi>Hector</hi> gives ground to believe that he had Annals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the contrary, as appears by his words above cited, where he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologated
that common sentiment of Christians, and told us <hi>that</hi> Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
<hi>was our first Bishop, and that none before him had any Hierarchical Power
in</hi> Scotland. To alledge therefore <hi>Boethius</hi> as espousing their cause here,
is ony to set him at variance with all Christians, and by the ears with
himself. But grant it were as <hi>Spotswood</hi> says, yet there should no small
dammage accreu to their Cause, seeing, on supposition hereof, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that the <hi>Episcopal Ordination</hi> was altogether wanting in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> it not being supposeable that this one man could
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94326:33"/>
Ordain all the Pastors in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yea, that even this their great Bishop
had no other Ordination himself, but what he receiv'd from Presbyters.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. The Bishop's following words, <hi>from the instruction of the</hi> Scots
<hi>in the Faith &amp;c.</hi> are altogether void of reason. For it's granted that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the coming of <hi>Palladius</hi> (which is the time whereunto he must refer
the <hi>gathering of the Church</hi>) she then indeed began to have another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and never man yet pleaded, that, because the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> was not govern'd by Bishops before <hi>Palladius,</hi> therefore 'twas
not really govern'd by them after his coming; which is the Inference
the Bishop's words seem to deny. But I believe there is more in them,
for they are abstruse: and judge their meaning to be, that tho' we had
no Bishops before <hi>Palladius,</hi> yet this can be no ground to conclude that
we ought to have none afterward, our Church being then rude and in
her infant state. The Advocat is of the same mind, saying, that <hi>before</hi>
Palladius <hi>his time our Church was</hi> constituenda <hi>or unsettl'd.</hi> But who can
believe it? For, <hi>first,</hi> it's generally suppos'd that <hi>Palladius</hi> came to
free this Church from <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> and not to establish Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is't credible that the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after so long a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
and flourishing of Christianity, had been, rather than any other
Churches, without any certain form of Government? This is certainly
a thing unparalellable, even according to our Adversaries, who tell us
that every Church very soon after its beginning had its Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and so a certain form of Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Yea altho' many other Churches had been without all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for such a tract of time, there is ground to believe that <hi>Scotland</hi>
could not; they lying most of this time under the persecuting Sword,
whereas we read of no persecution in our Church, even while our <hi>Kings</hi>
were <hi>Pagan;</hi> and our King <hi>Donald</hi> the I, the first crown'd Head in the
World that ever subject'd it self to Jesus Christ, very much encourag'd
the Christians, and was seconded herein by severals of his Successors.
And altho' some of 'em were vitious, and their Reigns short, or vex'd
with Wars, yet such trouble never struck directly against Christianity,
like the fury of the Pagans throngh the rest of the World: and others
were both excellent Men, and had longer and peaceable Reigns, as
<hi>Findochus,</hi> and <hi>Cratilinthus,</hi> but especially <hi>Fincormachus,</hi> an excellent
man and a great promoter of Religion, and therefore, as is most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumable,
was a great Instrument under God, for the settlement of our
Church-affairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94326:33"/>
Add to all this, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the terrible Storm of Persecution
through the <hi>Roman</hi> World, drove then from the Brittons, and other
places, no small number of excellent Men to <hi>Scotland,</hi> who doubtless did
no small service to God therein, and especially in the time of <hi>Fincorma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
when, as all observe, a great many fled hither who were famous
both for Life and Doctrine, yea long before this even in the time of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
our Church was well known to much of the Christian World, as
appears from his clear Testimony. <hi>The places of</hi> Britain (saith he<note n="y" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Contra Judaeos. Cap.</hi> 7. Loca Britannorum Romanis inaccessa, Christo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men subdita.</note>)
<hi>to which the Romans could not yet pass, are notwithstanding subject to Christ.</hi>
And if any have called <hi>Scotland</hi> barbarous, or not well reform'd before
the coming of <hi>Palladius,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> learn'dly refutes them; and names
severals, and among them even <hi>Stannihurst,</hi> otherways an enemy to our
Nation, who have done it: and he well observes, <hi>that the reason why
some speak of us as then not well enough reform'd, was because of our want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with the Church of Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. As to the last part of the Bishop's discourse, saying, <hi>that it was
not permitted to Monks to meddle with the matters of the Church</hi> &amp;c. And
wherein he is seconded by St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> who falls foul on Presbyterians on
this account, as if they were darkners of all Church History <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
should know, that as our Historians call'd these <hi>Monks,</hi> they also call'd
them <hi>Priests,</hi> sometimes <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Doctors,</hi> and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

time to embrace the Doctrine of Christ, by the guidance, and exhortation of some</hi>
Monks; <hi>who, because they were most diligent in Preaching, and frequent in
Prayer, were call'd by the Inhabitants,</hi> Worshippers of God: <hi>which name
took such deep root with the common People, that all the Priests, even to our time,
were commonly without difference call'd</hi> Culdees, <hi>i. e.</hi> Worshippers of God:
Elsewhere this Author call'd these Teachers and Guides indifferently
<hi>Priests, Monks, and Culdees.</hi> Thus also speaks the best of our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
some of whom we have heard calling them <hi>Presbyters, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators
of the Sacraments.</hi> Hence 'tis clear, that when they call them
<hi>Monks,</hi> the word is not to be taken in the later Popish sense, for a <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hermite;</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94326:34"/>
for these our primitive Pastors were only call'd Monks, by
reason of their strictness of life, and frequent retirement to Devotion,
when the publick work of the Ministry did permit it, and perhaps also
divers of them abstain'd from Marriage, that they might keep themselves
free from the World, and its care, without urging this on others, as
was the practice of the famous <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in the council of Nice: From
all which I conclude, that before the coming of <hi>Palladius,</hi> we had a
settl'd Church without the least umbrage of their Hierarchy.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. I add, that long after that, it had but very slender footing here;
seeing, according to <hi>Spotswood,</hi> they had no distinct Titles or Dioceses,
whose words<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. Page. 4.</note> are, <hi>neither had our Bishops auy other Title (then that of</hi>
Scotorum Episcopi, <hi>or Scotish Bishops) whereby they were distinguish'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the days of</hi> Malcomb <hi>the III, who first divided the Country into Dioceses,
appointing to every Bishop the limits &amp;c.</hi> Yea, after most strict search,<note n="b" place="bottom">Book 1.</note>
for a long time posterior to <hi>Palladius,</hi> he can scarce find the least footsteps
of Episcopacy. And again, long it was after the distinction of Dioceses,
before they were admitted to any civil Places or Votes in Parliament,
Hence nothing is more certain than that, for many Ages, the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> knew nothing of their Hierarchy: the first Rudiments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were bronght from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was sent packing thither again, when
we renounc'd our obedience to Anti-christ.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. Take but one other particular, and I take leave of the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat:
he's much displeas'd with St. <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ph</hi> terming him <hi>a Caresser of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
for affirming that <hi>in consequence of this our Argument taken from
the confess'd Practice of our primitive Church, we might reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that when we covenanted against</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>we had only us'd our own
right; and thrown out that which was a confess'd Innovation; in order to the
restoring of that, which was our primitive Government.</hi> A notable and never
to be forgotten Concession of so learn'd an Adversary as is this Bishop.
Let's hear what the Advocat returns him. <hi>It will not follow</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that because our Church in its infancy and necessity was without</hi> Bishops <hi>for some
years; therefore it was reasonable for Subjects, to enter into a solemn League
and Covenant, without, and against the Consent ef their Monarch; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpat</hi>
Episcopacy <hi>settl'd then by Law, and by an Old Prescription of 1200
years at least.</hi> But this most unfair Representation of our Arguments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
is, I trust, now sufficiently discover'd: wherefore, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94326:34"/>
to do here with it, not yet am oblig'd to evince the consequence
he denies, seeing 'tis not to be accounted ours but his own, who
made the antecedent. Of the Grounds why the Nation entred into a
Covenant, I also discours'd already. In the mean while, I can't but take
notice of his <hi>settling Episcopacy by Prescription;</hi> a Romish Argument, which,
whatever it may do in Law, has no place here. His <hi>Prescription,</hi> I'm
sure, essentially differs from that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> against the Heresies of his
time, seeing he liv'd in a very early Age, when especially, if ever, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
could have place in the Church, and the Doctrines which he
defended were generally and uninterruptedly held by the Pastors, even
from the Apostles times, and more ancient than the Heresies, against
which he prescribes, whereas in the present case all things are clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For, as the Advocat himself here supposes, the original of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Episcopacy</hi> is several Ages posterior to that of the Apostles; so that
if the Argument could militat for either Party, it serv'd well the Church
of <hi>Scotland</hi> against Prelacy, and not at all <hi>e contra.</hi> But tho' things had
been quite otherwise, there had been no fear of harm from their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions;
seeing, as <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> admonishes<note n="c" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 39. Caeterum dilatatae &amp; inveteratae Haereses nequaquam &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>In refutation
of inveterat Errors, we must recurr to the sole authority of the Scriptures.</hi> And
<hi>Optatus Milevit.</hi> plainly asserts that <hi>Christ's Testament abundantly suffices
to determine all, and every particular Controversie among Christians.</hi> Thus
we see how pleasant a spectacle these two Champions afford us; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
forms the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition, and asserts, on supposition of the
Antiquity of our Royal Line, and veracity of our Historians, <hi>that our
Church acted with reason enough, and was only recovering her own Right, when
she cashier'd Prelacy.</hi> The Advocat, in attempting to disprove this the
Bishop's Proposition, has only giv'n such prevarications and elusions, as
most strongly confirm all the dis-interested of the truth thereof. As
for the <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition, that our ancient Royal Line is not forg'd but
real, and our historical Monuments most true and credible, the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
himself, to the conviction of all the unbyass'd, in both his Books,
makes appear. It remains therefore as a conclusion of undoubted veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that our Church was acting most rationally, and only recovering her
own Right, when at any time she expell'd Prelacy, together with all its
Innovations.</p>

§. 9. There is yet another Advocat of the Party, whose look is more
stout than his Fellows. We shall try if his reason be answerable to his
confidence. I mean <hi>A M.</hi> D. D. (I shall design him D. <hi>M.</hi>) The
Author of a late Book call'd, <hi>An Enquiry into the New Opinions (chiefly)
propagated by the Presbyterians in</hi> Scotland. Who,<note n="d" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 227. Et sequentibus.</note> in opposition
to the <hi>Defender of the Vindication of the Church Scotland,</hi> handles the
same Argument at large, and supposes, as a main Ground of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that his Antagonist denies, that there is any force in <hi>Argumento
negativo. To require</hi> (saith D. <hi>M.</hi>) <hi>that a matter of Fact be attested by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Witnesses is, in the language of our Author to raze the Foundation of
all History.</hi> He spends therefore about 14 pages, to prove that a negative
Argument in some Cases may have place. But vainly, seeing the Author
of the Vindication does not once insinuat<note n="e" place="bottom">Defence of the Vindication of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Page 36.</note> that a negative Argument
can in no Cases be us'd, or that to require competent Witnesses in a
matter of Fact, is to raze the Foundation of all History. Yea he believ'd
that there were Witnesses so competent for his Assertion, that no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whither negative, or of whatsoever kind else, shall ever be able
to darken their Testimony, and that we have as good ground for our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church, her being without Bishops, as for any other part of our
Nations Antiquities. And indeed the Argument the Apologist, whom
D. <hi>M.</hi> would vindicat, us'd, levels at all parts of our ancient History,
no less then at the thing under debate. The Argument was, <hi>There were
none that lived near that age that wrote the History of it, and the Monks who
wrote any thing were extreamly ignorant.</hi> Now this, if it do any thing to
the Author's purpose, equally shakes and overthrows all parts of our
ancient History, seeing with the like force and success it may be brought
against any of 'em. Justly therefore repones the Defender of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
<hi>that this is at one blow to raze the Foundation of the History of our
Nation, and that of most others: and to make them all to be Fools, who have
enquired into these Antiquities that concern our Nation, and others: such as</hi>
Fordon, Major, Beda, Usher <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereto, all, D. <hi>M.</hi> rejoins, is,
<hi>that many collateral proofs may be brought from the</hi> Roman <hi>Historians, that
the</hi> Scots <hi>inhabited that part of Britain, long before the imaginary period of his
Presbyterian Church.—And the manner of reckoning the Scotish Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies
at their Marriages, their Births, and other remarkable Solemnities,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94326:35"/>
was an infallible conveyance of true, constant and perpetual Traditions. Their
Bards whose Science it was to repeat those Genealogies upon solemn Occasions, &amp;
to celebrat their greatest Atchievements in verse, could not add one to the number
of their Kings, but upon the Death of his Predecessor.</hi> But in all his Discourse,
there is wrapt up a concession of all the <hi>Defender of the Vindication</hi> charg'd
on the <hi>Apologist;</hi> seeing he evidently intimats, that unless it be assertin'd
some other way, nothing in any of our Countries Historians merits any
credit. And to confirm this, <hi>I except,</hi> (saith he) <hi>against all the three, (viz.</hi>
Fordon, Major and Boethius) <hi>that none of 'em, could be a competent Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Affairs of that nature at so great a distance from their own time, unless
they had named the Authors and Records upon whose Testimony their Relation
was founded.</hi> As to his mentioning of <hi>collateral Proofs &amp;c.</hi> it is a meer
Sham; seeing, if once we yeeld with him, that no credit is due to any
of our Monuments now extant, except what is confirm'd by some exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Records, how sorry an account have we of any of our Antiquities
of whatsoever kind? which forraign Testimonies notwithstanding may,
if compar'd with our Writers, give light to our Histories.</p>
                  <p>I'm sure moreover, notwithstanding of whatsoever old Traditions,
or <hi>Bard</hi>'s verses are mention'd, all or surely most of these now being
lost, or, tho' extant, mostly unintelligible, our Royal Line could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be asserted without ascribing to our Writers, both the reach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of able and faithfull Historians. And yet D. <hi>M.</hi> is not afraid
to compare his <hi>Apologist negative Argument</hi> to another of <hi>Eusebius</hi> lib. 3.
<hi>Where</hi> (saith D. <hi>M.) by this very Argument, he overthrows the authority of
several Books that some would impose upon the Church, meerly because they
were not duely attested, and none ef the Ancients brought any Testimonies from
them.</hi> But <hi>Eusebius</hi> saw and perus'd these Ancients, who either direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or occasionally mention'd all the Canonical Books, and so justly their
silence overthrew the Authority of the Spurious, and baffl'd the credit
of their Imposers: but has D. <hi>M.</hi> or his <hi>Apologist,</hi> seen or perus'd all
the Monuments from which our Historians took their materials, and
which were lost long before either of them were born? Can they from
these Records, tho' they would fain do't, rub shame upon all the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of our Countrey, as a creu of lying Forgers? seeing then, that this
is impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ible to be done, and that, as the <hi>Advocat</hi> has solidly made out,
they were men of sufficient Candor and Reputation; seeing they us'd
many ancient Reeords now lost, and were of sufficient Discretion and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94326:36"/>
Knowledge to distinguish genuine from fictitious, seeing they relate
what we plead for with no less unanimity and concord than they do any
thing else, and either profess, or sufficiently enough intimat, that they
brought all their Composours from ancient Records, seeing that their
Judgement is confirm'd by unsuspected Forerunners both ancient and
modern, yea and suffrages of all mankind, who had ever any occasion
to speak of this matter, seeing what they relate is so far from being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous,
that our ancient Church-government they mention is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attested and acknowledg'd by the fiercest of our Adversaries to be
truly Apostolick, and seeing, lastly, as we have heard, Prelacy, for a
long time after <hi>Palladius,</hi> was of far less bulk and power in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than
in other Churches; the <hi>Apologists</hi> negative Argument has just as much
consanguinity with that of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as is between a down-right Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism,
and a solid Deduction: yea I averr moreover, that considering
Prelacy was then at its <hi>Ela</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and none of our Historians at least
before <hi>Buchanan</hi> were Presbyterian, nor could reap any Advantage by
disobliging the Prelats, any one of their Testimonies alone might give
sufficient ground to believe that what they said was well founded on
good and ancient Records.</p>
                  <p>§. 10. But after a long, and, as himself truly says, needless digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he comes to examine our Testimonies, and will have <hi>Boethius</hi> to
contradict the rest, alledging that his meaning is not, that <hi>Palladius</hi> was
the first Bishop, but only the first sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> but of <hi>Boethius</hi> already.</p>
                  <p>Here D. <hi>M.</hi> falls foul on <hi>Blondel</hi> as a corrupter of <hi>Boethius,</hi> because
he said as out of him <hi>that the Presbyters elected and ordain'd their Bishop.
There is nothing</hi> (saith D. <hi>M.) said by</hi> Boethius, <hi>but that the Bishops were
elected from among both the Priests and Monks.</hi> And true it is there is no
more said in the words D. <hi>M.</hi> cites, but 'tis as true that elsewhere<note n="f" place="bottom">

have said ought inadvertantly or obscurely, he is to be correct'd or
explain'd by the harmonious and most express Testimonies of <hi>Fordun,

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94326:36"/>
(saith D. <hi>M.) never thought that</hi> Palladius <hi>was sent by</hi> Pope Coelestine <hi>to

Where 'tis most evident that <hi>Baron</hi> distinguishes the <hi>Scots,</hi> to whom

to cut off all further debate of this matter, the Cardinal clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats

§. 12. He having thus abus'd <hi>Baron,</hi> prepares next for the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Prosper</hi> himself, telling us, <hi>that all that can be inferr'd is, that</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius
<hi>was the first Bishop of the</hi> Roman <hi>mission.</hi> But <hi>Prosper</hi>'s words are
clear and without any such limitation. <hi>Palladius</hi> (saith he) <hi>is ordain'd
by Pope</hi> Coelestine <hi>for the Scots that had already believed in Christ, and is sent
to them to be their first Bishop.</hi> Behold our very Assertion, and why we
should yeeld it, and in lieu thereof imbrace its contrary, I am yet to
learn. He adds, <hi>that as soon as the Pope aspired to his unlimited and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Supremacy, there were several Bishops sent to other Churches, already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
not to introduce Episcopacy, which was the Government of the universal
Church, but rather a subjection to, and uniformity with the Roman See.</hi> But
tho' all this were as true as some of it is false, it's nothing to the purpose,
except he find good Authors, wherein a Bishop sent to a People, who
not only were Christians, but also govern'd by Bishops before he came,
is called without restriction their first Bishop.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Boethius (continues D. <hi>M.) understood the History of</hi> Palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<hi>in this sense,</hi> Which tho' 'twere yeelded, stands him in little stead,
seeing all the Historians &amp; Antiquaries of our Countrey, and, as we have
heard from Card. <hi>Baron,</hi> with whom joins our learn'd Advocat, all men
every-where else understand <hi>Prosper</hi> in the sense we plead for; believing
that there was no Bishop in <hi>Scotland</hi> before <hi>Palladius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'twill not satisfie D. <hi>M.</hi> to wrest <hi>Prosper</hi>'s words, except he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
at once overthrow his whole Chronicle, telling us, <hi>that it is not thought
by the learned to be the genuine Work of</hi> Prosper. All he brings for this, is
a conjecture of <hi>Petrus Pithoeus,</hi> fancying that the Chronicle ascrib'd to
<hi>Prosper,</hi> &amp; appended to that of <hi>Eusebius</hi> &amp; <hi>Hierome,</hi> is of a different stile
from that of a confus'd fragment, which he took for a part of the true
<hi>Prosper</hi>'s Chronicle, &amp; wherein there is nothing concerning <hi>Palladius.</hi>
But why the meer conjecture of one man should be enough to discredit
that Chronicle so universally ascrib'd to <hi>Prosper,</hi> I leave to the Judgment
of the learned. <hi>Vossius</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">De historicis latinis. <hi>Page</hi> 229.</note> indeed mentions this fragment, but if it be
preferable to the vulgar Copy, determines not: neither, for ought I know,
did ever any save, D. <hi>M.</hi> embrace this faint Conjecture of <hi>Pithoeus,</hi> and
indeed there must be brought incomparably better Arguments before
that confus'd fragment either be preferr'd to, or vye with the universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd Copy, immemorially, under <hi>Prosper</hi>'s name, affixed to <hi>Hierome</hi>'s
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94326:37"/>
Chronicle. Moreover, seeing this Schred is most disordered, and the
words now under debate most universally believ'd to have been written
by <hi>Prosper,</hi> 'tis highly probable, on supposition that this fragment is a
part of the true consular Chronicle, that it once contain'd that passage,
tho', throw mutilation, and either negligent or malicious transcribing, it
hath now lost it: however the matter be, we are at no loss; for never was

supposititious, and that it belongs not to <hi>Prosper,</hi> or some else of equall
Antiquity, and Authority, are the last efforts of meer desperation,</p>
                  <p>And indeed had they not in defiance of the whole Christian World
and Truth it self, resolv'd <hi>per fas aut nefas</hi> to maintain that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Church without Diocesan Bishops before the time of <hi>Calvine</hi> and

how the most knowing and zealous for Prelacy while they sustain'd
the truth of our Countrey Histories, and yet labour'd to disprove what
we now plead for, gave only, in favours of their latter Assertion, triffles
so empty, and prevarications so apparent, that 'tis most presumable they
believ'd nothing of what they said, &amp; how the most learn'd of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal

that any credit is to be given to our Historians, with whom also joins

have at least attempted a refutation of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> than to have dar'd
his Adversaries to bring but one example of Churches without Diocesan
Bishops, seeing he knew there were store already giv'n even by Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,

prove that <hi>Hierome</hi> was for the Scriptural and Apostolick Identity of
of <hi>Bishop</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and whatsoever is said by them, for Presbytry is

transcribe the acurat and unanswerable Dissertations of several learned Men,
who have sufficiently exposed the Writings of</hi> Blondel <hi>and</hi> Salmasius <hi>on this
head, particularly the incomparable Bishop of</hi> Chester (<hi>vind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> St. <hi>Ignat.</hi>) But
no where did ever Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> ingage with these Authors on this subject,
nor does he any such thing, only he has some few excursions which touch
not the marrow of the Controversie, and therefore is nothing to D. <hi>M</hi>'s
purpose, whether the advantage be yeelded to <hi>Salmasius</hi> and <hi>Blondel</hi> or
to Dr. <hi>Pearson.</hi> He abuses also some passages of <hi>Hierome</hi> to prove him
self-repugnant, but all such depravations had been by <hi>Iunius</hi> and others
against the Papists, and by <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum</hi> clearly discover'd,
&amp; the places unanswerably vindicated, even before he wrote his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae,</hi>
which their vindications of <hi>Hierome,</hi> as also many other defences of
the same Author brought by <hi>Salmasius</hi> and <hi>Blondel,</hi> he scarce once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
to handle. But he has vindicated <hi>Ignatius,</hi> they will say, and
this is enough. But suppose that he had as really evinced these Epistles
to be the genuine Work of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as he's groundlesly pretended to
have don't, yet so far is their inference from being good, that as we
shall hear, the quite contrary follows, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the <hi>Ignatian</hi> age, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were all one with the Pastors of single Congregations. Hence it
appears that this was one of D. <hi>M</hi>'s pious Frauds to skarr his vulgar

and pride of her Governours, rais'd by certain stories, and
tending towards the Papacy, as its highest pinacle, whereof both name

I mean the false <hi>Areopagite,</hi> whose whole Book may really be term'd a

1581. when Prelacy had been unanimously by the whole Assembly, in
the preceeding year cast out of the Church. And for many succeeding
Assemblies, their Declaration of their dislike and hatred of Prelacy, and
approbation of this Confession, went hand in hand, with whom then in

which is registrat in the Books of the Assembly, with a Letter to be directed from

and with an offer to set forward the Policy untill 'twere establish'd by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
The King's Letter subscribed by his hand, to the Noble-men, and
Gentle-men, was read in open audience of the whole Assembly.</hi> This Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ordain'd also <hi>that the Confession of Faith be subscribed, as being true,
Christian, and faithfull.</hi> And in the Assembly 1595. amongst other things

give out, that our Church, in her first Reformation, had Bishops (as

this were true, all they shall gain hereby, would only be the fastening

the Judge before whom ye must make an account, and resist that <hi>Tyranny</hi> as ye
would avoid Hell-fire.</hi> To which our <hi>Author</hi> answers denying that <hi>Knox</hi>
by <hi>Tyranny</hi> here means Episcopacy, and saith, <hi>that 'tis impossible to make
more of the Letter, than that</hi> Knox <hi>deem'd it a pernicious and tyrannical thing,
for any Person whatsoever to thrust unworthy Men into the Ministry of the
Church.</hi> Which Answer evanishes, so soon as we shall understand the
occasion of <hi>Knox</hi>'s Letter. Some powerfull Courtiers had then sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiously
invaded a great part of the Churches Revenues; and were
greedily grasping the remainder, to the great grief of all good Men, and
detriment of the Church, which both in her Assemblies, and otherways,
vehemently urged that these Revenues should be imploy'd on sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Ministers, many of whom, being unprovided, were ready to
starve; and on maintaining of Schools, relieving the Poor, and other
such pious Uses. These Courtiers therefore, to free themselves of such
unacceptable Monitors, and secure them of what they had gotten, plot
the reduction of a kind of <hi>Diocesan Bishops, Abbots, Priors,</hi> and other
such Popish Orders, with whom they were to make a sacrilegious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
and to give these titular Church-men some small pittance of the
Revenues, the rest being possessed, in their name, by these Courtiers.
Now at the very time of the writing of <hi>Knox</hi>'s Letter, this was in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

And now judge what <hi>Knox</hi> mean'd by his Exhortation to keep
out unworthy Men, and resist <hi>Tyranny:</hi> And 'tis most presumable
that <hi>Spotswood</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">Hist. Page 257, 258.</note> sufficiently saw, that <hi>Knox</hi>'s Letter goares Prelacy,
otherwise he had not mangl'd the same, and wholly omitted all menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. And that this <hi>Knox</hi>'s Letter levell'd at the Bishops then about
to be introduc'd, is further evident from his <hi>refusal to inaugurat</hi> John
Douglas <hi>Bishop of St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>his denouncing an</hi> Anathema <hi>to the Giver
and Receiver of the Bishoprick, and his open professing his dislike of the whole
Order.</hi> At this our Author takes exception, saying, <hi>The certain Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
from which</hi> Calderwood <hi>says he had this relation, is uncertain.</hi> But he
should have look'd into <hi>Petrie,</hi> who<note n="f" place="bottom">Century 16. Page 371.</note> names the Author <hi>William Scot,
that eminent Minister at</hi> Couper.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>that 'tis like enough that</hi> Knox, <hi>who was then at St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>said
so, and express'd suitable resentments of the durty Bargain between</hi> Morton <hi>and</hi>
Douglas, <hi>who by a simoniacal Paction, got into the</hi> See, is by our Author
expresly acknowledg'd. And indeed, if we consider the indignity of
the Crime, and the Lyon-like boldness of Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> against such Vices,
'tis altogether incredible, but that he vented his resentments with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to the noticing of all thinking Men then present: yet all this is
skipp'd over by <hi>Spotswood,</hi> For he knew well enough, that this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should have shew'd how little kindness <hi>Knox</hi> bore to their Hierarchy.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, which is most noticeable in this matter, these who then
favour'd Prelacy, being generally such simoniacal Pedlers, were so far
from writing the several Actions and Church-transactions of these times,
that they made it their care to suppress and destroy the publick Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Church. Witness B. <hi>Adamsone</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cald.</hi> Hist. Page 261.</note>: one of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of whose Confession, to which, as is acknowledg'd by <hi>Spotswood</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="bottom">Hist. Page 385.</note>, he subscrib'd, was, <hi>that not without his special allowance, some leaves
of the Books of the Assemblies were rent out, and such things as made against
the Bishops their estate, were destroyed in</hi> Falkland, <hi>before the Books were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
to the King's Majesty.</hi> Which considerations, suffice to prove
the truth of that historical Relation.</p>
                  <p>He alledges next, <hi>that tho' we had reason to believe, that</hi> Knox <hi>said and
did so, yet it follows not that he was for the Divine Right of</hi> Parity. Add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94326:40"/>
                     <hi>That 'tis like enough</hi> Knox <hi>said so—for dreadfull Invasions were
made upon the Patrimony of the Church.</hi> But this Invasion was so linked
with the introduction of Prelacy, that they had both common Friends
and Enemies, so that <hi>Knox</hi> declaring against either, must be judg'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
averse from both. And indeed the introduction of Prelacy, was
consequentially this very destruction and consumption of the Churches
Goods, against which <hi>Knox</hi> inveigh'd. Or dare he say, that it had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
him, if they had been consum'd in sustaining the Luxury and
Grandour of <hi>Bishops, Abbots,</hi> and <hi>Priors,</hi> whom the Court was about
then to introduce, providing only these Church Revenues, had been
kept from the secular Nobility. Moreover, 'tis evident, to whosoever
reads <hi>Knox</hi>'s words, that the Invasion of the Church-patrimony, was
far from being the sole Ground of the dislike he shew'd to Episcopacy.
The Matter in short is, <hi>when</hi> John Douglas <hi>was made</hi> Tulchan Bishop <hi>of
St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>Mr.</hi> Knox <hi>refused to Ordain him, denouncing</hi> Anathemaes <hi>to
the Giver, and to the Receiver: and when</hi> John Rutherford <hi>Provest of the
old Colledge had said, that Mr.</hi> John Knox'<hi>s repining, had proceeded from male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment,
the next Lora's-day,</hi> John Knox <hi>said in Sermon, I have refus'd
greater Bishoprick than ever 'twas, and might have had it with the favour of
greater Men than he hath this, but I did, and do repine for discharge of my
Conscience, that the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>be not subject to <hi>that Order.</hi>
                     </hi> This
last Clause, viz. <hi>that the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>be not subject to <hi>that Order,</hi>
                     </hi> he
adventures not once to mention, which yet is a reason of <hi>Knox</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining,
and so gives the meaning of his whole Discourse. And seeing
'tis of equal credit with his foregoing words, being not only with the
rest taken by <hi>Petrie,</hi> out of that <hi>Historical Relation,</hi> but related also by
<hi>Calderwood</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Ms. Hist. Vol. 2, Page 340.</note> fully scatters all his fogg, and clearly determines the
present Question, somewhat else he hath here, but of small moment. As,
Knox, <hi>when</hi> Douglas, <hi>who was already Rector of the Vniversity, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of the old Colledge was made Bishop, regrated, that so many Offices were
laid on an old Man, which scarcely twenty of the best Gifts were able to bear.</hi>
Thence he Infers, <hi>that</hi> Knox'<hi>s resentment of</hi> Douglas <hi>his advance, was not
from any Perswasion, he had of the unlawfulness of Prelacy.</hi> As if <hi>Knox</hi>
might not assert the unlawfulness of Prelacy, and yet say so much for a
a <hi>Superpondium</hi> to his other Grievances. And to shew, even on Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they pretended, of the allowableness of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> how little
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94326:41"/>
sence of Duty or Conscience was in either Givers or Receivers.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. <q>There was at this time (saith M. <hi>D. Hume.</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="bottom">History of the Houses of <hi>Douglass</hi> and <hi>Angus.</hi> Page 320.</note>, no small
Contest and Debate, betwixt the Court and the Church, about Bishops
and Prelats, concerning their Office and Jurisdiction. The Ministers
laboured to have them quite abolished and taken away, and the Court
thought that form of Government to be agreeable, and compatible with
a Monarchical Estate, and more conform to the Rules of Policy, and
Civil Government of a Kingdom. Besides, the Courtiers had tasted
the sweetness of their Rents and Revenues, putting in titular Bishops,
who were only their Receivers, and had a certain Pension or Stipend,
for discharging and executing the Ecclesiastical part of their Office, but
the main profit was taken up by Courtiers for their own use. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they laboured to retain at least these shadows of Bishops, for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of leases, and such other things, which they thought were not
good in Law otherways. There was none more forward to keep them
up than the Earl of <hi>Morton;</hi> for he had gone Ambassadour to <hi>England</hi>
on his own privat Charges, and to recompence his great Expenses in
that Journey, the Bishoprick of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> being then vacant, was
conferr'd upon him. He put in Mr. <hi>John Douglass</hi> (who was Provost
of the New Colledge in St. <hi>Andrews</hi>) to bear the Name of Bishop,
and to gather the Rents (till such time as the Solemnity of Inaugurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could be obtain'd) for which he was countable to him. This he
did immediatly after he came home out of <hi>England.</hi> Now he will
have him to sit in Parliament, and to vote there as Arch-bishop. The
Superintendent of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> did inhibit him to sit there, or to Vote under
pain of Excommunication; <hi>Morton</hi> commanded him to do it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Treason and Rebellion. The Petition giv'n in to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
desiring a competent Provision for the maintaince of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in which they complained of the wrong done unto them by the
Courtiers, who intercepted their means, was cast over the Bare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and by the most common report, <hi>Morton</hi> was the first cause
thereof. Afterward <hi>Morton</hi> in a Meeting of some Delegats, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of the Church at <hi>Leith,</hi> by the Superintendent <hi>Dune</hi>'s
means, used the matter so, that he obtain'd their Consent to have his
Bishop admitted, and install'd. Wherefore, the third of <hi>February,</hi>
he caus'd affix a schedul on the Church door of St <hi>Andrews,</hi> wherein he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94326:41"/>
charged the Ministers to conveen, and admit him to the Place, which
they did accordingly, but not without great Opposition. For Mr.
<hi>Patrick Adamson</hi> (then a Preacher, but afterward Arch-bishop there
himself) in a Sermon which he preached against the Order and Office
of Bishops, said, there were three sorts of Bishops: 1. The Lords
Bishop (to wit Christ's) and such was every Pastor. 2. My Lord
Bishop, that is, such as Bishop as is a Lord, who sits, and Votes in
Parliament, and exercises Jurisdiction over his Brethren. 3. And the
third sort was, (my Lord's Bishop) that is, one whom some Lord or
Nobleman at Court did put into the place to be his Receiver, to gather
the Rents, and let Leases for his Lordship's behoofe, but had neither
the Means nor Power of a Bishop. This last sort he called a <hi>Tulchan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
because as the Tulchan (which is a Calves skin stuff'd with straw)
is set up to make the Cow give down her milk; so are such Bishops set
up, that their Lords by them may milk the Bishopricks. Likewise Mr.
<hi>Knox</hi> preached against it the tenth of <hi>February,</hi> and in both their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
(<hi>Morton</hi>'s, and his Arch-bishop) to their Faces pronunced, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thathema
danti, Anathema accipienti.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And<note n="l" place="bottom">Page 333.</note> 
                     <q>We shewed before, how in matters of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ever inclined (as the most politique Course) to the state of
Bishops. The Name was yet retained by Custom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, the Rents were
lifted also by them (as we have said) more for other Mens use and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
than their own. They had also place and vote in Parliament after
the old manner, and he would gladly have had them to have keeped
their Power and Jurisdiction over their Brethren. Master <hi>John Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass</hi>
being dead, he fill'd the place by putting in Mr. <hi>Patrick Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
his domestick Chaplain, who then followed that Course, tho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had preach'd against it. Many were displeas'd herewith, all the
Ministers (especially they of the greatest Authority) and all Men of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
that were best affected to Religion.</q> (And which he cites out of an
English Historian <hi>Francis Botevill</hi>)<note n="m" place="bottom">Page 354.</note> 
                     <q>As touching his (<hi>viz. Morton</hi>'s)
setting up and maintaining the estate of Bishops (whereof there had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
great debate and contention betwixt him and the Ministry) he
said, it did not proceed of an ill mind, of any malice, or contempt of
them, or their Callings, but meerly out of want of better knowledge,
thinking that Form of Government to be most conform to the Rules of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94326:42"/>
Policy, and to be fittest for the times. That if he had then known bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he would have done otherways.</q> And<note n="n" place="bottom">Page 358.</note> 
                     <hi>He</hi> (viz. Morton)
<hi>was also calm—this appeared in his carriage toward Mr.</hi> Knox, <hi>who
had used him roughly, and rebuk'd him sharply for divers things, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his labouring to set up and maintain the estate of Bishops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence 'tis most manifest how, not only <hi>Knox,</hi> but also the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of our Church disliked and hated the very first bud, and likeness of
Prelacy: and how by meer force and fraud of the voracious Court-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
upon the dishonesty of some, but the unwariness and faintness
of many moe of the Ministry. These monstrous <hi>Tulchans,</hi> for all men
even our present Prelatists are ashamed of them, got that minot's har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>§. 7. Our Author Answers, for he insists long on this matter,<note n="o" place="bottom">Page 192.</note>
                     <hi>That the Question is not now, how this was done, but if it was done? For if it
was done, it is an Argument that the Clergy then thought little on the iudispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Parity.</hi> Just as if what any man either by Fraud or Force is made
seemingly to yeeld to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were to be taken for his true and genuine Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
I thought this kind of reasoning had been peculiar to a <hi>Spanish
Inquisitor</hi> or <hi>French Converter. Or that they were bad Men</hi> (continues he)
a hard construction: For then <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> who was forc'd, and
so many of the choice Fathers of the Council of <hi>Arminum,</hi> who were
trick'd to admit, in appearance, something contrary to their true Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
shall all be bad men? That the Ministers at this Convention at
<hi>Leith</hi> dealt most unwarily, and some of 'em also with too little integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is beyond scruple: But <hi>that all of 'em, or most of 'em were poor covetous
Rogues &amp;c.</hi> neither <hi>Petrie</hi> nor any of his Perswasion ever affirmed.</p>
                  <p>He adds <hi>that the Courts Arguments for the</hi> Leith-establiment <hi>were mainly
Politick; for they turn'd not Theologues to perswade Episcopacy's Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
from Scripture &amp;c.</hi> Well then, there was little true Piety, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
of Conscience or the Word of God in the Matter: And if some of
the Ministry, as he says, were taken with these politick and state Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they in so far fell from their own Principle viz.<note n="p" place="bottom">1 Book of disc. head 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That in the
Books of the Old and New Testament, all things necessary for the instruction of
the Church, and to make the Man of God perfect, are contain'd and sufficiently
express'd. But the Clergy</hi> (saith he) <hi>had found that the new Scheme of the</hi>
first Book of Discipline <hi>had done much hurt to the Church.</hi> As if the old
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94326:42"/>
Popish Scheme, under which the Churches goods, by God's Law desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
for the promoval of piety and learning, and sustaining of the poor,
were consum'd and debauch'd, in upholding the grandour and luxury of
a spurious ecclesiastick Nobility, could have been really more profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Church than that of the Book of Discipline, on of the prime
designs whereof was the bestowing of the Church Revenues for these
their true uses, to which God's Law had appointed them. Or as if Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
Schools, and Poor can in no place be provided for, where the
Romish Church-policy is wanting. But,</p>
                  <p>The six Commissioners (<hi>saith he</hi>) that treated with the State at <hi>Leith</hi> were
sensible Men, and far from being <hi>Parity-men. Just so far from being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity-men,
that most of 'em, in an Assembly 1580. July</hi> 12. deliberately
found and declared Episcopacy unlawfull in it self.<note n="q" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Calderwood</hi>'s Ms. Hist. Vol. 2. Page 597.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He intimats, <hi>that the Courts motive for the</hi> Leith-establishment <hi>could not
be their desire to possess the Churches Patrimony.</hi> An untruth, as we have
now seen, too bare fac'd to need more refutation. His proof hereof is of
the same stamp, viz. <hi>Had the Clergy fall'n so suddenly from their constant claim
to the Churches Revenues? did that which moved them to be so earnest for this
meeting with the State miraculously slip out of their minds.</hi> Seeing not the
Church, but the Court-politicians, as is evident, with desire to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen
her, chiefly procur'd that meeting, and if these Delegates were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the only or first men, who by sinistrous Artifices fell into a bad
Compact, then let him exclaim with admiration of this matter: what
follows is yet odder, viz. <hi>Was it not as easy for the Court to have possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of a Bishoprick, an Abbacy, a Priory &amp;c. when there were no Bishops—as
when there were.</hi> For he's to be pitied if he be ignorant that the
Courtiers having no Law-title thereto, had no hope save under covert
of their own Creatours, these titular Bishops, of any peaceable and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
possession of the Churches Revenues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But an undoubted Assembly</hi> [saith he] <hi>own'd the</hi> Leith convention <hi>as
an Assembly, and its Authority as the Authority of an Assembly—and
for several years after that establishment at <hi>Leith,</hi> beside which there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fond for owning them for Bishops, Bishops were present, and as such were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to sit and vote in general Assemblies—and many Acts of subsequent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
put this matter beyond all probability of ever being controverted as the
Assembly in</hi> August 1574. <hi>which petitioneth the Regent, that Stipends be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94326:43"/>
to Superintendents in all time coming, in all Countries destitute thereof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be where there is no Bishop, or where there are Bishops, who cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Office as the Bishop of St.</hi> Andrews <hi>and</hi> Glasgow. <hi>And that
his Grace would provide qualified Persons for vacant Bishopricks.</hi> But this,
tho' it be his prime Argument, is soon removed, our Church knew that
divers Ministers and others had been allur'd, or aw'd to that agreement:
She knew that 'twas only made for the <hi>Interim</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">See <hi>Spotswood</hi> Hist. Page 260.</note> and for the <hi>Interim</hi>
only did she tolerate it, with a full resolution to have a more perfect Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<note n="s" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cald.</hi> Ms. Hist. Vol. 2. Page 354</note> And as for the words, <hi>In all time coming,</hi> there's not a syllabe
of them in the Act he cites<note n="t" place="bottom">See Page 457.</note> Nor indeed any where else of all the
Acts of these Assemblies. She knew also that during that <hi>Interim,</hi> 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to get, that which had been the Revenues of Popish Bishops &amp;
other Church Rents out of the Regent and other Courtiers their hands.
In the mean while the vast number of unplanted Churches, weakness of
the Ministry in divers parts, and unsettlement, even unto that time, of
the Churches Affairs, allow'd for a space the continuance of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Superintendents or Commissioners, who were to be in almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
motion and travels, and therefore needed much larger maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
then did fixed Pastors; which large maintainance the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus strip'd of her Patrimony, could not afford to the number that
was needfull. On these and such Grounds, the <hi>Church</hi> indulged to that
<hi>Convention</hi> the name of an <hi>Assembly,</hi> tolerated in these <hi>Tulchans</hi> the name
of <hi>Bishops:</hi> And, seeing they had got more Rent then was giv'n to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ministers, allowed them to exercise the Labour and Travel of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents
or Commissioners: And thus the Church made the best
she might of that their unlawfull Bargain. <hi>And tho',</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="bottom">See our Author Pages 207, 208.</note> which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
objects, <hi>some Assemblies allow Bishops to conveen and proceed against de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
command Ministers by their Letters to admonish concerning persons
to be excommunicated,</hi> it helps him nothing, seeing the very Acts he cites
give no less power to Superintendents, yea to Commissioners, whom
yet the Church used, even after she had declared Episcopacy unlawfull
in it self. So far is our Churches tolerating for a space these Tulchans
from being any Argument, that she believ'd not the <hi>Divine Right of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But how appears't</hi> (saith he) <hi>that our Church receiv'd the</hi> Leith <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
only for an</hi> Interim <hi>out of a dislike to Episcopacy:—And there
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94326:43"/>
were other things in the Articles which required amendment.</hi> But sure these
Articles were without any exception receiv'd and tolerated only for the
<hi>Interim,</hi> and how well these Court-bishops were liked, is already made
manifest, and our Churches subseqnent actings declare, which never
rested, but still wrestled against the storms of both Power and Policy,
untill they were sent packing. 'Tis true, as he says, the Church met
with <hi>Opposition;</hi> but that this was only from these titular Bishops, and
Rent-gatherers to the Courtiers, supported with all the might, Wit
and Artifice of an awfull gripping, politick Regent, and no few other
potentand subtile Courtiers driving their own ends, as has already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and is most evident from the best accounts now extant of these
Affairs, and this is the undoubted Cause, why the six Collocutors at the
Assembly in <hi>August 1575. think it not expedient <hi>presently</hi> to answer direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Question of the Function of Bishops.</hi> But he who stilleth the noise
of the Seas &amp; the noise of their waves, having restrain'd these impetuous
Tempests, how cordially did our Church proceed to the utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Prelacy? <hi>Forsamekle</hi> (they are the words of the Assembly hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at <hi>Dundee, Anno</hi> 1580. July 12. Sess. 4.<note n="x" place="bottom">

as it is now used and commonly taken within this Realme, hath no sure
warrant, authority, or good ground out of the Book, and Scriptures of God,
but brought in by the folly and corruption of mens invention, to the great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the true Kirk of God, the whole Assembly of the Kirk in one voice, after
liberty given to all Men to reason in the matter, none opponing themself in defence
of the said pretended Office, findeth and declareth the samine pretended Office,
used and termed as is above said, unlawfull in the self, as having neither fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament,
ground nor warrant in the word of God &amp;c.</hi> And in all this, our Church,
as she clearly here expresses, did nothing save what she was oblig'd
to do by her own Principle in the first Book of Discipline, which affirms
<hi>that all thing necessary for the instruction of the Church is contain'd in the Books
of the Old and New Testament.</hi> And <hi>that whatsoever is without express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God's Word, is to be repress'd as damnable to Salvation.</hi> Our
Reformers therefore, except our Adversaries say, (which even impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
it self dare not say), that they believ'd the Hierarchy to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the <hi>express command of God's Word,</hi> were bound by this their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
to oppose it as a manifest corruption, and according to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,

to this truly Protestant, yea truly Catholick and Christian Principle of
our Reformers, their Feasts turned into Mourning, their Songs into
Lamentation, their Tears for Meat, and their Harps hang'd on the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
And now suppose that our Reformers, in that unstable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Church, and very first rudiments of Protestancy had in some
of their Doings or Saying afforded some colour or appearance, either
for the scruples of the curious, or the quirks and cavils of the captious,
does not, pray, this most unanimous, most clear, and every way most
unexceptionable Act of our most full and free Generall Assembly, that
consisted for the far greater part of the very same Men, who were the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Promoters of our first Reformation, most fully open our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mormers
their minds, shew their ultimat tendency and scope, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,

                  <p>§. 8. He hath more to say of <hi>John Knox,</hi> I return therefore to attend
him. His next Plea<note n="y" place="bottom">Page 28. <hi>Et sequentibus.</hi>
                     </note> is with <hi>Calderwood</hi> about <hi>Beza</hi>'s Letter to
<hi>Knox,</hi> where he denies that <hi>Beza</hi> wrote being inform'd by <hi>Knox</hi> of the
Courts intention to bring in Bishops, and adds, <hi>that if any thing of</hi> Knox'<hi>s
Sentiments can be collected from</hi> Beza'<hi>s Letter, it seems rather he was for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
than for</hi> Presbytry: <hi>For</hi> Beza (saith he) <hi>seems clearly to import, that</hi>
Knox <hi>needed to be caution'd against Prelacy. Beza</hi>'s Words are.<note n="z" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Epist.</hi> 79. Sed &amp; istud mi <hi>Knoxe</hi>—sicut Episcopi Papatum pepereunt. ita psendespiscopos—(Papatus reliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as) Epicureismum terras invecturos &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>But
I would have you, my dear</hi> Knox, <hi>and the other Brethren, to Remember that
which is before your eyes: that as Bishops brought foorth the Papacy: so false
Bishops the relicts of Popery, shall bring in Epicurism to the World: They that
desire the Churches good and safety, let them take heed of this Pest, and seeing
<hi>ye</hi> have put <hi>that Plague</hi> to flight timously, I heartily pray you, that Ye never
admit <hi>it</hi> again, albeit it seem plausible, with the pretence or colour of keeping uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which pretence deceiv'd the ancient Fathers, yea even many of the best of 'em.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where <hi>Beza</hi> without giving any proof thereof, clearly supposes as a
thing believed by <hi>Knox</hi> no less than by himself, that the Bishops whom
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94326:44"/>
some were then labouring to introduce into <hi>Scotland</hi> were false Bishops,
the relicts of Popery, which had already been once driv'n out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and on this supposition, as any Orators use to do from Principles
common to themselves, and these to whom they are speaking, he
admonish'd him and the rest to beware of this Plague. Certain it is
then, if we believe <hi>Beza,</hi> that he knew, if by a Letter from <hi>Knox,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
concerns not the matter in hand, that <hi>Knox</hi> judg'd the Bishops
then to be introduc'd to be no others than were the Popish Bishops,
whom <hi>Knox</hi> and his fellow Reformers had lately expuls'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
both sorts of Bishops to be equally false and Anti-christian. And now
consider this Letter of <hi>Beza</hi> written near the same time with that of
<hi>Knox</hi> to the Assembly, and the disinterested shall soon perceive that the
former explains the latter, and sufficiently shews what <hi>Knox</hi> meant by
the <hi>Tyranny</hi> mention'd therein. Moreover, whosoever finds so much
against Episcopacy in <hi>Beza,</hi> even tho' it had been spoken by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any relation or respect to <hi>Knox,</hi> and remembers how universal and
firm Concord was between these excellent Persons,
<q>Qui duo corporibus mentibus unus erant,</q>
will easily conclude that <hi>Knox</hi> bore but small kindness to Prelacy.</p>
                  <p>§. 9. He comes next to prove, Knox <hi>was not for Parity. Had he
been</hi> (saith he) <hi>so perswaded, how seasonable had it been for him to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out so mnch, when he was brought before King</hi> Edward'<hi>s Council? The
Question was then put to him, whether he thought that no Christian might serve
in the Ecclesiastical Ministration, according to the Rites and Laws of the
Realm of</hi> England?—<hi>Yet he answer'd nothing, but that no Minister in</hi>
England <hi>had Authority to separate the Lepers from the whole, which was a chief
part of his Office. Plainly founding all the</hi> unlawfulness <hi>of being a</hi> Pastor <hi>of the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>not only the unlawfulness of the</hi> Hierarchy <hi>which he spoke
not one word about, but on the</hi> Kings retaining—<hi>the chief Power of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Discipline.</hi> As if <hi>Knox</hi> had judg'd nothing in the Church
of <hi>England</hi> unlawfull but the King's retaining the Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in his own hand; which all Men, even Episcopals no less than
Presbyterians, know to be an arch and palpable untruth. Does not
(as for example) our Assembly <hi>Anno 1566. in a Letter to the English Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Pastors, being moved thereto by</hi> John Knox, if <hi>Spotswood</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. Pages 198, 199.</note>
speak truth, expresly, among many other things to this purpose, say

                     <hi>If Surplice, Corner-cap, and Tippet have been the badges of Idolaters, in the
very act of their Idolatry, what have the Preachers of Christian Liberty, and
the Rebukers of Superstition, to do with the dregs of that Roman Beast? yea,
what is he that ought not to fear either to take in his hand or fore-head the Print &amp;
Mark of that odious Beast?</hi> &amp;c. See store to this purpose in <hi>Heylin's
History of the Presbyterians:</hi> whereby 'tis most evident, that this Author
endeavour'd nothing more earnestly than to perswade the World that
<hi>Knox</hi> was a self-repugnant Idiot.</p>
                  <p>It sufficed if before that celebrious Assembly he answer'd to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and gave some one reason that shewed he could not comply with
them, tho' he declar'd not all the grounds of his dislike of their Practice.</p>
                  <p>As to the matter of <hi>Francfort,</hi> which this Author mentions, drawing
from it the like Consequences, there was no Bishop there, nor any
mention of the necessity thereof, but only a bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bigots for their <hi>Popish Ceremonies or Fooleries,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> calls them,
and so there was no occasion of venting himself in this matter, and tho'
there had, he sufficiently declar'd his mind while publickly in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
he alledged<note n="b" place="bottom">

                     <hi>that nothing ought to be thrust upon any Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <hi>Knox</hi> and his Associats sufficiently discover'd themselves
to be of the <hi>Consistorian</hi> or Presbyterian Perswasion.</p>
                  <p>§ 10. He adds <hi>that</hi> Knox <hi>in his</hi> Appellation &amp;c. <hi>plainly supposes the
lawfulness of the Episcopal Office.</hi> I deny't. <hi>But all alongst throw it</hi> (saith
he) Knox <hi>appeals to a lawfull general Council, snch a Council as the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Laws and Canons approve, and who knows not that the most ancient Laws
and Canons made Bishops the chief, if not the only Members of such Councils.</hi>
Knox <hi>says, if the Popish Clergy his Adversaries are for it, he's content that
matters in Controversie between him and them be determin'd by the Testimony and
Authority of Doctors and Councils, three things being granted him, whereof
these are two. 1. That the most ancient Councils nearest to the primitive Church
in which the learned and godly Fathers examined all Matters by God's Word,
may be holden of most Authority. 2. That no Determinations of Councils or
Men be admitted against the plain verity of God's Word, nor against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of the four chief Councils. Would</hi> Knox <hi>if he had been Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
have agreed so frankly to have stood by the Determination of these four
chief Councils? Could he have expected they would have favoured the Divine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94326:45"/>
Right of Presbyterian Parity? Will any scotish Presbyterian now adays stand to
the Decision of these four chief Councils?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all our Author here infers is by <hi>Knox</hi> prevented and cut off, while,
in the first place, he requires, <hi>that no Determinations of Councils nor Men
be admitted against the plain Verity,</hi> i. e.<note n="d" place="bottom">First Book of Discipline head first.</note> 
                     <hi>without the expressed command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God's Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We chearfully appeal in the present Controversie, and provoke our
Adversaries to this Rule, which most of 'em I have hitherto met with,
expresly acknowledge to contain nothing in their favours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Actions of the first four Councils were of two sorts,
<hi>Creeds</hi> viz. and <hi>Canons.</hi> Now, as <hi>John Knox</hi> and all the Presbyterians
in cordial subscribing to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> The Symbols of these
Councils, are confessedly not behind any part of the Christian World:
so part of the latter sort, I mean the Canons, are rejected by Episcopals
no less than by Presbyterians. As for example, the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">Can. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Council appoints <hi>that reduced Hereticks and Schismaticks must be anointed on

                     <hi>And they were also to have

                        </gap>, &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, 'tis true indeed Presbyterians admit not of these Decrees. But
dare they say that <hi>Knox</hi> imbrac'd them? Or, do our present Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
themselves receive them? <hi>Knox</hi> therefore spoke of the Symbols:
Our Author introduces him, and gives out as if he had spoken of their
Canons, to the end he may deceive the <hi>vulgar</hi> Reader; for none that
look into the Councils can be obnoxious to this his Fraud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:94326:46"/>
The same conclusion, viz. <hi>That</hi> Knox <hi>supposes the innocency and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Episcopal Office,</hi> he would deduce from <hi>Knox</hi>'s following words.
<q>You may in a peaceable manner, without Sedition, withhold the fruits
and profits which your false Bishops and Clergy most unjustly receive
of you, untill such time as they shall faithfully do their Charge and
Duties, which is to preach unto you Christ Jesus truly; rightly to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacraments according to his Institution; and so to watch for
your Souls as is commanded by Christ &amp;c.</q> But might not <hi>Knox,</hi> had
he been there, giv'n the like admonition to the <hi>Romans</hi> concerning their
Bishop and Clergy? should he thereby have suppos'd the Lawfulness
and Innocency of the Papacy and Power the Romanists gave to the
Pope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Does not <hi>Knox</hi> admonish the People concerning the rest of
the Clergy wherein there was comprehended the <hi>Abbots, Priors,</hi> and
all the rest of the Romish rout, no less then concerning the Bishops?
Did therefore <hi>Knox</hi> suppose the Innocency and Lawfulness of all these
Offices?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Knox</hi> utterly baffles all our Author's Sophistry, and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preserves himself from his abuses and depravations, while he places
the Office of all true Bishops in <hi>truly preaching of Christ Jesus, rightly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
the Sacraments and watching for Souls:</hi> Which I hope is equally the
Office and Duty of all Christ's Ministers. So true is it, we observ'd
from <hi>Beza</hi>'s Letter, that <hi>Knox</hi> look'd on all Lordly Diocesan Prelats as
false Bishops. And all they pretend to, beside what is common to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pastor under whatsoever Name or Profession they go, as unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and unjust.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But (saith our Author) <hi>Knox</hi>'s great Work <hi>in his Admonition to the
Professors of England,</hi> was to enumerat at the Causes, which in God's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgement brought Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Persecution on them: But
he quite forgot to name the Sin of Prelacy as one; <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> And did
he enumerat and reckon up all things he judg'd to be Errors or Sins
wherefore God was pleading with the <hi>English,</hi> and had sent among
them that Persecution? The truth is the main design of that Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not to give an accurat enumeration of the Causes of the Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to give comfort to the Faithfull under it. But abstracting what
<hi>Knox</hi> thought to be the Causes of that Persecution, and what not, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
must sustain that <hi>Knox</hi> reckon'd up whatsoever he judg'd to be Sins
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94326:46"/>
and Abuses in that Church, otherwise he does nothing. But dare he say,
that <hi>Knox</hi> there did so? Spoke he ever a word of <hi>the Tippet, Corner-cap,
and Surplice, there being Badges of Idolaters, and Marks of the odious
Beast?</hi> Hath he one syllable of <hi>Christmas, Feasts</hi> and <hi>such holy Days,</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Spotsw.</hi> Hist. 153. 174.</note>
which he also judged superstitious and sinfull? Or of the Faults of their
Service-book about which, as all Men know, fell out the Controversie
at <hi>Francfort?</hi> or the depriving Ministers of <hi>Power to separate the Lepers
from the whole?</hi> at which our Author grants <hi>Knox</hi> to have been offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>But Knox <hi>calls</hi> Cranmer <hi>that reverend Father in God; Ergo. Bellè.</hi> As
if forsooth <hi>Knox</hi> might not use a Phrase of the common stile of the
times, but he must be presently concluded a propugner of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.
<note n="k" place="bottom">

<hi>John Knox</hi> was a Member, one of the Heads of <hi>Adam Bishop of</hi> Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay'<hi>s
Accusation,</hi> which by the Assembly he was desir'd to redress,
<q>that he stileth himself with Roman Titles, as <hi>Reverend Father in
God,</hi> which pertaineth to no Ministers of Christ Jesus, nor is giv'n
them in Scriptures?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Knox</hi> (continues our Author) <hi>said, the false Religion of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
is more ancient than Papistry, yea Mahomet had established his Alcoran
before any Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>was crown'd with a triple Crown &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>Can any
Man think (subjoins our Author) <hi>John Knox</hi> was so very unlearn'd
as to imagine Episcopacy was not much Older than Mahomet? Or
knowing it to be Older, that yet he could have been so ridiculous, as
to have thought it a relict of Popery, which he himself affirm'd to be
Younger than <hi>Mahometism?</hi>
                     </q> But, was <hi>Knox</hi> so very unlearn'd, as
not to know, that divers Popish Errors and Dotages had generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
and got good footing before the time of Mahomet? Do not these
who know any thing, know so much? Have we not heard how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
as unwarrantable and unlawfull, <hi>Christmas, Feasts, and such holy
Days?</hi> Will our Author acknowledge they obtain'd not before the rise
of Mahomet, or the Pope's triple Mitre? I think he will not. Have
we not seen how, good space before these times, other Innovations as
unction of <hi>Poenitents,</hi> and <hi>Caelibacy</hi> of Church-men were coming in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and countenanc'd by the most famous Councils. <hi>Knox</hi> had been
unlearn'd indeed, if he had not known so much; he spoke therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94326:47"/>
of the maturity and more open appearance of the Man of Sin, and as
he expresses, of his coming to his <hi>triple Crown;</hi> and meant not at all
that before Mahomet's time, no Popish Doctrines were generally
broach'd and imbrac'd: yet so our Author (otherwise he's quite beside
his purpose) makes him to speak; then which nothing more false and
injurious to Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> can be express'd.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, we have been intertain'd with Sophistry so silly, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogisms
so palpable, that 'twere unjustice done to this Gentle-man's
Intellectuals, not to believe that he sufficiently discern'd the Fallacies.
But he promiseth to make a mends for the future; as yet, he has only
brought up his <hi>Rorarios</hi> and <hi>Velites,</hi> but now the case is quite alter'd.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Ecce ferunt Troes ferrumque Ignesque Jovemque!</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>§ 11. He has <hi>yet more to say; yes, more with a Witness!</hi> Knox <hi>says, in
his Exhoatation to</hi> England, <q>Let no man be charg'd in preaching of Jesus
Christ above that a man may do; I mean that your Bishopricks be so
divided that of every one as they are now for the most part, may be ten,
and so in every City and great Town, there may be plac'd a godly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man, with so many join'd with him for Preaching and Instruction
as shall be thought sufficient for the bounds committed to their Charge.</q>
But the Reader, impartially weighing what we have adduced, must
yeeld, that 'tis impossible, either from this, or any other place, to make
<hi>Knox</hi> a <hi>Prelatist,</hi> except we involve him in manifest self-repugnancy,
which there is no necessity to do for any thing here said: For tho' <hi>Knox,</hi>
considering how the <hi>English</hi> were wedded to something of a hierarchick
Splendor, had indulged them in a good deal thereof: it had been only
a parallel Action to that of his Friend <hi>Calvin,</hi> who<note n="l" place="bottom">Vide Epist. 206. <hi>Coxo</hi> &amp; gregalibus suis.</note> tho' suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Anti-ceremonial, yeelds, notwithstanding, for a time, and for
Peace's sake, to that Nation, some of their Ceremonies which he calls
<hi>tolerable Fooleries, unprofitable Triffles</hi> &amp;c. Yet I have met with none,
who on this score has taxed <hi>Calvin</hi> of Self-contradiction. But this <hi>ex
abundanti;</hi> for they cannot from these <hi>Knox</hi>'s words conclude, that he
favoured so much as the least grain of the substance of Prelacy: of each
of their Bishopricks he makes ten, which I think will bring his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
comparatively consider'd, to a very narrow compass. But to shew
that he put a definit number for an indefinit, he gives not only to every
City, but to every great Town a Bishop: Now, of Cities and Mercat-towns
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94326:47"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> which, there, are not inconsiderable, there are odds of
600,<note n="m" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Cosmography. Page 305.</note> But that none may justly cavill, let's make a large abatement
of the number where they may be smaller; and yet, I'm sure, so many
remain as there should be ordinary Presbytries in <hi>England,</hi> providing it
were so divided.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the great End and Work of this Bishop <hi>Knox</hi> makes to
be the preaching of the Gospel, and instructing of the People; of his
Dominion and Power over the Clergy not a syllable; yea, he gives not
to him alone the Charge of the Flock, 'tis <hi>their Charge,</hi> the Charge
of the rest, no less than the Bishop; they are join'd <hi>with him,</hi> not his
Curats under him: And we have heard him already making the Office
of a Bishop nothing else but what is common to all Pastors: And, if his
Doctrine and Practice in <hi>Scotland</hi> may be allow'd as an Explication of his
<hi>Exhortation to England,</hi> this Bishop was subject to the Admonition
and Correction of the Presbytry, wherein he was Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Nothing therefore can necessarily be drawn from <hi>Knox</hi>'s words, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that this Bishop was to have (if Temporary or continued, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
not, for it touches not the present Question) a meer presidency of
Order or Moderator-ship; nothing of Dominion or Power to <hi>Knox</hi>'s
Bishop. Nothing therefore of imparity amongst Pastors can from the
words in hand with any good consequence be deduced.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, whatever 'twas, it appears clear from these words, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
this only for a time, during the rarity of Preachers.</p>
                  <p>§ 12. But hear somewhat more of the same <hi>Exhortation.</hi>

purge and expell all dregs of Papistry, Superstition and Idolatry, that
thou, O England, must judge and hold execrable and accursed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God hath not sanctifi'd to thee by his blessed Word, or by the
Action of our Master Jesus Christ. The glistering beauty of vain Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
the heaps of things pertaining nothing to Edification, by
whomsoever they were invented, justifi'd or maintain'd, ought at once
to be removed, and so troden under the obedience of God's Word,
that continually this sentence should be present in thy Heart, and ready
in thy Mouth, not that which appeareth in thine own Eye shalt thou
do &amp;c. Deut. 12.—Let not then the King and his proceedings,
whatsoever they be, not agreeable to the Lord's Holy Word, be a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94326:48"/>
snare to thy Conscience.—Let God's blessed Word alone be the Rule
and Line to measure his Majestie's Religion. What it commandeth, let
it be obeyed, &amp; what it commandeth not, let that be execrable, because
it hath not the sanctification of God's Word, under what Title or
Name soever it be published. Halt no longer on both parts. Let not
these Voices prevail in your Parliament, This to our Judgement is
good and godly, this the People cannot well bear, this repugneth not
to God's Word.</q> And, <q>But let his holy and blessed Ordinances by
Christ Jesus commanded to his Kirk, be within thy limits and bounds
so sure, and established, that if Prince, King, or Emperour would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
to change or disannull the same, that he be the reputed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of God.—Which horrible Crimes if ye will avoid in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then must ye (I mean the Princes, Rulers, and People of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alm)
by solemn Covenant renew the Oath betwixt God and you.—
That benefice upon benefice be heaped upon no Man, but that a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Charge with a competent Stipend be assigned to the Work-men;
for O how horrible was that confusion that one Man should be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have two, three, four, five, six, or seven Benefices, who scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the year did so often preach; yea, that a Man should have the
Charge of them, whose faces he never saw.—For the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
and Charge of your proud Prelats (impossible by one Man to
be discharged) are no part of Christ's true Ministry, but are the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
of the Tyranny first invented, and yet retain'd by the Roman
Antichrist. That diligent heed be taken, that such to whom the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of preaching is committed, discharge and do their Duties: for it
is not; nor will not be the chanting nor mummelling over of certain
Psalters, the reading of Chapters for matines &amp; evening Song, or of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
only (be they never so godly) that can feed the Souls of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Sheep.—What efficacy the living voice hath above the naked
letter which is read, the hungry and thirsty do feel to their comfort.
But the other maketh for Mr. <hi>Parson</hi>'s purpose, who, retaining in his
hand a number of Benefices, and appointed such in his place as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
destitute of the Gift of Preaching; but let all such Belly-gods
be whipp'd out of God's Holy Temple. Let none that be appointed
to labour in Christ's Vineyard be intangl'd with Civil Affairs—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be when the Civil Magistratand the Minister of the Word as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
together for Execution of Discipline, which is a thing easie to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94326:48"/>
be done without withdrawing any Person from his Charge, if that
which was before express'd be observed: For as touching their yearly
coming to Parliament for matters of Religion, it shall be superfluous
&amp; vian, if God's true Religion be once so established that after, it never
be called in controversie. And as touching Execution of Discipline
that must be done in every City and Shire, where the Magistrats and
Ministers are join'd together without any respect of Persons. So that
the Ministers, albeit they lake the glorious Title of Lords, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velish
Pomp which before appear'd in proud Prelats, yet must they be
so stout, and so bold in God's Cause, that if the King would usurp any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authority in God's Religion than becometh a Member in Christ's
Body, that first he be admonished according to God's Word &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Read pray, the rest of this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and you shall find that never
was light more opposite to darkness, than <hi>Knox</hi> is to their Ceremonies
and Hierarchy, and, in a word, their whole way whatsoever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for in opposition to the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now suppose, which
yet he is far from doing, that <hi>Knox</hi> allow'd them some umbrage of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity,
should they not, notwithstanding, providing they closed with
what he saith here and elsewhere, really relinquish what they call the
Church-of-<hi>England</hi>'s way, and come over unto us? Yea, were they
according to <hi>Knox</hi>'s <hi>Exhortation</hi> stript of the hope their exorbitant
Gain, Ease, and Grandour, &amp;c: they should soon also send packing
their Plea for Imparity, this being a meer shrowd, and pretext to cover
these Enormities from which <hi>Knox</hi> so warmly dehorts, and whieh with
less colour of modesty can be sustain'd.</p>
                  <p>Add hereto, that seeing <hi>Knox</hi> so zealously requires express and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Warrant in the Word of God for every thing in the Worship, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Discipline of the Church; and seeing hitherto none hath
darred to averr, that he was for the Divine Right of Prelacy, yea even
our Author himself adventures not plainly to assert so much, but only
labours to make <hi>Knox</hi> to account it Lawfull and Innocent, and to speak
nothing against it, it must undeniably follow, that he was for a Divine
Right of Parity.</p>
                  <p>§. 13. <hi>Did not</hi> Knox (continues our Author) <hi>write and bear the Letter
sent by the Superintendents, Ministers and Commissioners of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm of</hi> Scotland, <hi>to their Brethren the Bishops and Pastors in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Anno 1566? <hi>Did not he in that same Title of that same Letter acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94326:49"/>
that these Brethren, Bishops and Pastors of</hi> England <hi>had renounc'd the
Roman Antichrist, and professed the Lord Jesus in sincerity? And doth not
the Letter all alongst allow of the Episcopal Power and Authority of these Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Bishops?</hi> But, had never a Protestant to do with an <hi>Abbot, Prior,</hi>
or some other such Popish Officers, whose Offices he did not allow?
Might he not therefore speak or write to him in such Terms without
which he should either not have been understood, or his Letter, or his
Discourse been altogether uneffectual? Altho' then it could be prov'd,
they had given Bishops the distinguishing Titles they assume, by no
good Logick could it be inferr'd that they accounted the Office, as it is
distinguish'd from any other Pastor, Lawfull: which yet can never be
prov'd, nor any thing concluded from the Letter, save that they took
Bishop and Pastor for synonymous Terms.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, 'twill no more follow, that they count Episcopacy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
than that they esteem so of the <hi>Surplice, Corner-cap</hi> and <hi>Tippet,</hi>
which yet in the same Letter, they make the Marks of the odious Beast.
They there indeed acknowledge the <hi>English</hi> to have renounc'd the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Antichrist, but so as notwithstanding to have retain'd divers of his
Abominations, whereof they name none, but only the most notorious of
these which the then present English Controversies gave occasion to
mention.</p>
                  <p>The rest of his Discourse on this Head leans on this, that our Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents
were really <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishops, of whom more anon. And well
may I deny't, were there no more than the Doctrine and Practice of <hi>John
Knox,</hi> who, as our Author grants, compil'd the <hi>first Book of Discipline,</hi>
wherein the Appointment and Duties of Superintendents are set down.</p>
                  <p>§. 14. And indeed that <hi>Knox</hi> was truly Presbyterian, is so manifest,
that untill now, when Men have broke the bonds of all modesty, and
abandon'd themselves to averr every thing to be as they would have it,
was in neither hand call'd in question, but Enemies no less than Friends,
either more indirectly or more plainly acknowledg'd it. <hi>This was the
Policy</hi> (saith<note n="o" place="bottom">Hist. Page 174.</note> 
                     <hi>Spotswood) desired to be ratifi'd. It had been formed by</hi>
John Knox, <hi>partly in imitation of the Reformed Churches of</hi> Germany, <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that which he had seen in</hi> Geneva &amp;c. Nothing then from <hi>England,</hi>
which flatly contradicts our Author, who, throw no small part of his
Book, pretends to prove that all was taken especially from <hi>England.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:94326:49"/>
Now, what was the Government of the reformed Churches of <hi>Germany</hi>
and <hi>Geneva,</hi> I think few are ignorant. And elsewhere,<note n="p" place="bottom">Hist. Pag. 266.</note> 
                     <hi>Many
good Men</hi> (saith <hi>Spotswood) have disliked some of</hi> Knox'<hi>s Opinions, as
touching the Anthority of Princes, and the Form of Government which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to have established in the Church.</hi> The Prelat indeed here, as his
custom is, delivers the Truth as sparingly, as may be; yet not so, but
both Presbyterians can perceive, and Hierarchicks must confess what
is wrapt up in this forced Confession: And while he endeavours yet
more to obscure it, by impertinently adding, that <hi>Knox</hi> was alwayes
urging the Obedience of Ministers to their Superintendents, he only
hereby shews, that he was loath the World should know, that he had been
forc'd to Confess that <hi>Knox</hi> was really a Presbyterian. But their own
dearest Friends and Brethren gave Testimony against them. <hi>Knox</hi> (say
they<note n="q" place="bottom">See <hi>L'estrange</hi> holy Cheat. Page 31.</note>) <hi>was of the</hi> Consistorian <hi>stamp. These sc.</hi> Gilby, Goodman
<hi>and</hi> Whittingham <hi>led the dance in</hi> England, Knox <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and at this
day our Presbyterians do but write after their Copy, professing the same Principles,
pretending the same Scruples, and beyond doubt proposing the same end.</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">Pag. 133.</note> 
                     <hi>Let
me be understood likewise by Presbyterians to intend these of the</hi> Scotish Race, <hi>to
whom we are beholden for our Discipline. That Faction first advanc'd it self
by popular Tumult and Rebellion,</hi> Knox <hi>learned the Trick of it at</hi> Geneva,
<hi>and brought it into</hi> Scotland. I forbear to cite others: see in lieu of many
<hi>Heylin's History of the Presbyterians,</hi> who is most ample to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>I only Note how various Methods have been us'd to destroy our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion: The Papists, when the Divine Light of the Gospel
began to break throw their Babilonish Foggs, to other means for extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
thereof, added that of lying, reproaching and bespattering
most odiously our first Reformers, endeavouring to ridicul and expose,
together with their Doctrine, their Discipline also, and Government,
which they saw like to obtain amongst most of the reformed, and which
sometimes in scorn they named after <hi>Geneva;</hi> but they were open and
profess'd Enemies, and so the Net was laid in sight of the Bird: A new
Squadron must be added who, under the name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
manage the <hi>Romish</hi> Design,
<q>Tuta frequensque Via est per amici fallere nomen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These in the mean while with open mouth proclaim'd this Truth, that
<hi>Knox,</hi> and the rest of our first Reformers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were, no less than
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94326:50"/>
                     <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and such transmarine Propagators of the Gospel, truly
Presbyterian, and, as they scornfully spoke, <hi>fiery Zelots of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e new holy
Genevan Discipline:</hi> And on this very account threw upon them all the
Iniquity, Aspersion and Infamy their black Art could invent, or the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Lies and Malice suggest. Yet with all good Men and true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
they effected nothing, save to bring themselves into just suspicion
of being masked Romanists: some of 'em therefore of late, find it there
interest to alter their Method, &amp; to forbear somewhat to utter their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Calumnies, and Malice against the persons of our Reformers (for as
for speaking any good of 'em, we shall most rarely find them do it, or
if ever, 'tis done with so much coldness and lameness, and with such
mixtures of detraction, that they appear content that the Reader believe
them not, and resolved to pull back with the one hand, what they were
compell'd to give with the other) and in the mean while, averr with
an unparallel'd confidence, that these our Reformers were never for the
<hi>Genevan</hi> way, (as they call it) were never for Parity of Pastors or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Government; that so they may the more securely follow the
steps of the former, and vent their splene at both Government and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and yet be less obnoxious to suspicion of driving <hi>Rome</hi>'s inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
But 'tis to be hop'd they shall not speed well, seeing herein, they
only endeavour to darken the Sun, to contradict what's known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
all <hi>Europe</hi>-over: And loudly, finally, to give the lie to their own
dearest Friends.</p>
                  <p>§. 15. Now to their second Objection, which is from the <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
which, together with whatever else they advance from this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
we, having thus evinc'd that <hi>Knox,</hi> whose Judgement is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
of such moment in the present Case, was truly Anti-prelatick,
might without just blame have neglected, it melts quite away, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that this practice was only a temporary expedient, during the
unsettl'd condition of the Church. The Objection dwindles also to
nothing on this account, that tho' our Reformers had design'd the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
use of Superintendents, yet these <hi>toto coelo,</hi> as they say, differ'd
from Diocesan Prelats, so that, notwithstanding hereof, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was really Presbyterian, or without ought that can be call'd Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity.
The former of these our Answers is plainly set down in the
<hi>first Book of Discipline</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="bottom">Head 5.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Ministers</hi> (say our Reformers) <hi>whom
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94326:50"/>
God hath endowed with his singular Graces amongst us should be appointed to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places there to make their continual residence, that then the greatest part of
the Realm should be destitute of all Doctrine: which should not only be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of great murmur, but also be dangerous to the Salvation of many. And
therefore we have thought it a thing most expedient <hi>at this time,</hi> that from the
whole number of Godly and learned Men, now presently in this Realme, be
Selected ten or twelve (for in so many Provinces we have divided the whole) to
whom Charge and Commandment should be given to Plant and Erect Kirks, to
set, order, and appoint Ministers, as the former Order prescribes, to the
Countries that shall be appointed to their care where none are now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was but too plain, and therefore is much curtail'd by <hi>Spotswood;</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="bottom">Hist. Page 158.</note> as our Author, who dwells long on this Objection from Superin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tendents
<note n="u" place="bottom">Pages 143, <hi>&amp; sequentes.</hi>
                     </note>, cannot deny. He therefore takes a new Way, and thus
glosses the Passage. <hi>If I mistake not</hi> (saith he) <hi>the true gloss of this
Period will amount to no more than this,</hi> 
                     <q>that because there were then so
few Men qualifi'd for the Office of Superintendency, tho' ten or twelve
were, by far, too small a number for the whole Kingdom, yet, at <hi>that
time,</hi> they thought it expedient to establish no more: and tho',
when the Church should be sufficiently provided with Ministers, it
would be highly reasonable, that the Superintendents should have
Places appointed them, for their continual residence; yet, in that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
'twas necessary that they should be constantly travelling throw
their districts, to Preach, and Plant Churches &amp;c.</q> To establish his
gloss he says, <hi>the Compilers of the first Book of Discipline, viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>J.
Winrame, John Spotswood, J, Willock, J. Douglas, J. Row</hi> and <hi>J. Knox,</hi>
were still of prelatical <hi>Principles.</hi> But tho' this were as true as 'tis false,
the quite contrary would rather follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that they had resolv'd to
change afterward the Superintendents for Diocesan Bishops: To prove
they were Prelatists, he says, <hi>three of them were Superintendents,</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Question, as if Superintendent and Bishop were one and the
same. <hi>But</hi> Douglas <hi>died Arch-bishop of St.</hi> Andrews. But is't strange
that he, who, in favours of a Tulchan Bishoprick, had a stomach able to
deject Simoniacal Pactions and <hi>durty Bargains,</hi> made no bones of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his former Principles to his interest? <hi>But</hi> Spotswood <hi>was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Enemy to Parity, as appears from his Son's account of him.</hi> But his Son
says not so much: Moreover, which quite spoils our Author's Cause,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94326:51"/>
he makes<note n="x" place="bottom">Page 174.</note> without naming any other, <hi>John Knox</hi> the Author of that
Book of Policy, yea he averrs<note n="y" place="bottom">Page 344.</note> that in his Father's Judgement, the
<hi>Old Policy</hi> was undoubtedly the better than the New. John Row <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the lawfulness of Episcopacy at the Conference appointed by the General
Assembly</hi> 1575. But <hi>J. Row,</hi> no less then the other Collocutors, in their
Report to that Assembly, tho', for the iniquity of the time, not in so
many words, yet really condemn'd Prelacy,<note n="z" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cald.</hi> Ms. Hist. Vol. 2. Page 489.</note> and was also a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of that Assembly, which <hi>with one voice—found and declar'd the Office
unlawfull in it self.</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>Page</hi> 595. Et seq.</note> Judge then of his confidence, who yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
hence to conclude that he was a Prelatist.</p>
                  <p>He adds out of Knox, <hi>that Superintendents and Overseers were nominated,
that all things in the Church might be carried with Order and well, which reason
for establishing Superintendents</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>will continue to hold so
long as the Church continues.</hi> But let him once prove that <hi>Knox</hi> speaks of
the constant and ordinary Church regimen and guidance, and not of the
settling and ordering of a Church little more then <hi>in fieri,</hi> and as yet
not all sufficiently constitute, otherwise we have a meer Paralogism. <hi>At
the Admission of</hi> Spotswood (continues he) John Knox <hi>asserted the necessity
of Superintendents and Overseers, as well as Ministers the necessity I say, &amp; not
the bare expediency in the juncture.</hi> The words are<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Knox</hi> Hist. 289.</note> 
                     <hi>first was made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
in the which these Heads were handled: first the necessity of Ministers
and Superintendents or Overseers</hi> &amp;c. We have indeed here the necessity
of Superintendents mention'd, but that it arose above an expediency, we
do not hence learn: That <hi>Knox</hi> asserted the necessity of Superintendents
as well as Ministers, or an equal necessity of the one and the other, can
by no means be inferr'd: Yea, who can, with our Author, believe that
tho' any People had aboundance of sufficient and lawfully ordain'd Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
yet, in <hi>Knox</hi>'s Judgement, if Superintendents were wanting, such
a People could no more be counted a Church, than if they had no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
at all?</p>
                  <p>He brings also some Expressions out of <hi>the first Book of Discpiline,</hi> as,
<hi>After the Church shall be established, and three years are past, no Man shall be
called to the Office of a Superintendent, who hath not two years given a Proof of
his faithfull Labours in the Ministry of some Church.</hi> Such passages indeed
suppose some continuance of Superintendents tho' no perpetuity. For
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94326:51"/>
our Reformers could never think that within three years or thereabout,
the Church should be fully established, &amp; few or no Churches to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
unto which full settlement, the forecited passage of the Book of
Policy allows the use of Superintendents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Book of Discipline</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>supposeth that Superintendents
and Colledges were to be of equal continuance, for the Superintendent was still to
be at the choosing and installment of Principalls and Rectors &amp;c.</hi> But this his
Argument, he himself overthrows. <hi>The Assembly</hi> (saith he) <hi>May
27. 1561. addresseth to the Council, that special and certain Provision might be
made for the maintainance of the</hi> Superintendents, Ministers, Exhorters
<hi>and</hi> Readers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, who sees not, that this Address speaks after
the same manner concerning all these, so that, using our Author's way
of arguing, we should inferr, that our Reformers thought the <hi>Exhorter</hi>
(which confessedly was a kind of Function purely temporary) was no
less to be perpetual than the Superintendent, yea, or the Minister. And

                        <hi>Cald.</hi> Ms. Hist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vol. 2. Page 5.</note> 
                     <hi>appointed Mr.</hi> Knox
<hi>to pen a comfortable Letter in their Name to encourage</hi> Ministers, Exhorters
<hi>and</hi> Readers <hi>to continue in their Vocation</hi> &amp;c. From these and the like Acts
he may as well conclude the equal duration of <hi>Exhorters</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi>
as he inferrs from the Book of Policy, the equal duration of <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
and <hi>Colledges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He would next prove, from the account of the Election and Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Superintendents, prefix'd to the old Psalms, <hi>that, according to our
Reformers, this was an Office distinct from that of other Pastors, of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and so perpetual. The Order and Form</hi> (saith he) <hi>for admitting
a Superintendent and a Minister, was all one, and there was nothing in it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the one Office to be temporary, more than the other.</hi> But therefore,
there's nothing elsewhere importing so much, is a clear <hi>non sequitur.</hi> In
the mean while, from what he grants, 'tis plain that the Superintendent
wanted the very specific difference of a Diocesan Bishop, wherefore tho'
they us'd this Phrase, <hi>The Office to which God call'd him,</hi> and this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the People, <hi>Will ye not acknowledge this your Brother for the Minister
of Christ Jesus? your Overseer and Pastor? Will ye not maintain and comfort
him—against all such as wickedly would rebell against God and his Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</hi>
And that Petition, <hi>Send unto this our Brother, whom, in thy
name, we have charged with the chief care of thy Church within the bounds of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94326:52"/>
L. &amp;c.</hi> They can thereby mean no other Office, no other Ordinance
of God, and, for kind, no other Charge, than what's giv'n to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Pastor. For we find mention'd the <hi>chief</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Cor. 11. 5.</note> of the Apostles
in Labour <hi>viz</hi> and Care, who yet were all equal. Neither is it strange
that they thus set apart him who was, for the time, found needfull in
these dark times and places, to plant and erect Churches, preach perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
where there were none, and in a word, in several things compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to imitate the ancient Evangelist. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
with a solemnity of Fasting, Prayer and Imposition of Hands
<note n="e" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. compared with 14. 26.</note> And yet the Work or Office for which they were separated, was
neither new nor perpetual.</p>
                  <p>§. 17. Having overthrown the Reasons of his Gloss, it must yeeld
to the Text, expresly telling us, they were erected only for <hi>that time,</hi>
and that for the paucity of <hi>Ministers endowed with singular Graces. But this
reason</hi> (says he) <hi>is nought. For suppose we 20, 30, 40 Men in the Kingdom
qualifi'd for the Office of the Ministry; could not these have divided the Kingdom
into a proportionable number of large Parishes? And, still, as more Men
turn'd qualifi'd, could they not have lessen'd these greater Parishes?</hi> But he
with whom our Reformers<note n="f" place="bottom">See his Pages 242. <hi>&amp; sequentes.</hi>
                     </note> were all most contemptible <hi>Idiots,</hi> and
more especially in Church-policy, needs not wonder tho' they had fall'n
into a much greater Solecism. But he forgets, that many in these most
dark times were made Ministers, who yet needed the Assistance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the better qualifi'd for a while in Church-policy, and matters
of such importance, till they should be able to go hand in hand with
them, and that the main end of Superintendents was the perpetual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
Preaching and Instructing where there were no Pastors and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Churches. <hi>As well</hi> (continues he) <hi>as our Presbyterian Brethren
now unite Presbytries.</hi> A strange mistake, as if, where Presbytries are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
any Minister took for his proper Charge a multitude of Parishes.
He here insinuats, <hi>that in the Superintendents there was established a Prelacy:</hi>
But the present Question is only about the sentiments of our Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
and that they never thought the use of Superintendents croffed the
Doctrine of Parity, is most clear, were there no more, from their using
Superintendent-commissioners, even after they had declar'd Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
unlawfull in it self. But all this their jangle is the fruit of meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94326:52"/>
or worse, for none near these times look'd on Superintendency as
perpetual. Not the Court Party, seeing they endeavour'd to change
Superintendents for Tulchan Bishops: not the rest of the Church,
who, as the necessity of them decreased, suffer'd them to wear out. And
after that, in an unanimous Assembly, they had ordain'd that the whole
Church should be divided in a competent number of Presbytries, declar'd
that Superintendents were no longer expedient. And good ground
had they, even from that very Book of Policy so to do: for, if the whole
tenor of that Head of Superintendents, appointing them almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to Travel, to Preach thrice a week at least, and beside that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Life <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Ministers, the Orders of the Kirks, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the People, care how the Poor be provided, how the Youth be
instructed, admonish, where it's needfull, by good Counsel, compose
Differences, note and delate to the Kirk hainous Crimes, and all this,
because of the paucity of qualifi'd Ministers; evidently proclaims not,
that this Superintendent was a kind of Evangelist, expedient only at that
juncture of the re-entry of the Gospel into <hi>Scotland,</hi> I appeal to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Judgement of the impartial.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if 'twere otherwise, why should they not as punctually
have described his Duties after the time of his perpetual Travels, his
Preaching thrice a week, and other such vast Labours were ended (for
he grants these were to indure but for a time) after which he insinuats,
that the Superintendents were to remain quiet in their chief Towns, but
no word in all the account we have of them of such distinctions of times,
of such perpetual rest, not a word therefore of their perpetuity.</p>
                  <p>Lastly; which he wisely, <hi>i. e. sutably to his purpose,</hi> omitted, for, like
the Council ask'd at <hi>Abel, it ends the matter;</hi> see this Head of <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
Because</hi> (say they) <hi>we have appointed a larger Stipend to them that
shall be Superintendents, than to the rest of the Ministers, we have thought good to
signifie to your Honours such Reasons as moved us to make difference betwixt
Preachers</hi> at this time. Now, pray, may not he that runs, read here
that, had it not been for some forcing Circumstances and Exigencies of
the <hi>then present time,</hi> they had made no difference at all between one
Minister and another. And then after a few lines they laid down their
Reasons in the very words, the sense whereof is now under Debate; <hi>If
the Ministers</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>§. 18. In the mean while, we need not be much concern'd whether
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94326:53"/>
these <hi>Superintendents</hi> were to be temporary or perpetual, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein that made any real difference between the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was then, and that which is now. And indeed, these vast Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
and Pains in preaching thrice a week <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are sure enough Tokens
that the <hi>Superintendent</hi> could not be much distinguish'd from an ordinary
Pastor, save in these extraordinary Labours, and was far from the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Eminency, and Grandour, seeing he was so far from the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ease and idleness, without which the former but rarely obtains.</p>
                  <p>This, and other such Proofs of the vast difference between the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents
and their Diocesans, and of the likeness between the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under the Reformers and that which is now, our Author slides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with rallry saying, it may be as well told them, that <hi>Bishops wore black
Hats and silk, Superintendents blew Bonets and tartan;</hi> as if most constant
and hard labour in the Gospel, were no more valuable for distinguishing
one Minister from another, than highland Plydes and blew Bonnets. He
meets you with the like Drollery, if you mind him, that the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents
had no Metrapolitan and Episcopal Consecration or Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but it's <hi>risus sardonius.</hi> And his Questions, (<hi>What is this to Parity or
Imparity amongst the Governours of the Church? Do these differences distinguish
between Bishops and Superintendents as to preheminence of Power?</hi>) flow from
deep dissimulation of the mortal Wound giv'n to his Cause, seeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Episcopal Ordination, which was never requir'd to a Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(For <hi>Knox,</hi> as for example, who with our Author was only a
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> ordain'd or admitted, as they then spoke, <hi>Spotswood</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent)
there can be no Episcopal Power, no, not so much as the
very essentials of a Bishop. These Superintendents were also without
any Civil Places, power or emoluments that way, which make up the
far greater part of the Episcopal greatness, and still subject and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the General Assemblies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there was reason for it</hi> (saith our Author) <hi>supposing that General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
as then constituted, were sit to be supream Judicatories of the National
Church, For there was no reason that Superintendents should have been Popes.</hi>
Then surely either were our Prelats, Popes, or most vehemently covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a papal Power, seeing above all things they fear'd, abhorr'd and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di'd
the ruine of these our General Assemblies. And no wonder if they
did so, and that our Author intimats his dislike of these our Assemblies.
For if this one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the subjection of the Superintendents to these
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94326:53"/>
Assemblies, as they were then constituted, be duely weigh'd, it's fair to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et them on the very same levell with their Brethren. For, give him
never so great a Power in the Province where he superintended, and
let him use it as he pleased, yet neither can the Imparity be counted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
not the harm he could do very hurtfull, for within half a year
at most (for there was a General Assembly twice, at least, every year)
they had a prospect of a General Assembly to right their wrong, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every Pastor was to have no less Power than any Superintendent, and
no less capable to sit judge and censure the Superintendent, than the
Superintendent was on the other hand, to exerce the like Power over
him; yea, any Minister in the Assembly, &amp; such sometimes as were none,
was as fair to be chosen Moderator as any Superintendent. By the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
of these Assemblies, it came to pass, that few or no matters of
importance were determin'd in the inferiour Synods, but came thither
for their final Decision. Wherefore, if we narrowly look on these
times, we shall find that the Superintendents were rather appointed as
Observers and Delators of Matters to the Assembly, than any proper
Judges thereof, save when a special command was giv'n him to cognosce
on such and such particular Matters. He was frequently also charged
with execution of the Assemblies Determinations, all which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to him with other Commissioners to whom the Assembly gave the
like Charge, and sent them not rarely to these very Provinces where
there were Superintendents with equal Power and Authority to that of
the Superintendent. Sometimes they ordain'd Causes to be handled
by the Superintendent with the assistance of these Commissioners, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the Commissioner with the assistance of the Superintendents,
which Commissioners were sometimes Ministers of another Province,
and sometimes of that Province wherein was the Superintendent, with
whom they were join'd with equal Power &amp; Authority. From all which
'tis evident, how much they are taken with the humor of cavilling,
who dare to ascribe to the Superintendents any real Superiority or
Power over other Pastors, or any thing repugnant to a compleat Parity.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet more: even in his own Synod, he could do nothing
contrary to the Majority, for he was to act nothing without the Synods
Consent, neither could he impede ought done by the Majority, for he
had no negative vote.<note n="g" place="bottom">See 1. Book of Discipline. Head 5. Of the Election of <hi>Superintendents.</hi>
                     </note> Yea, he was made subject to the Tryal and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94326:54"/>
Censures of the Synod of the very province where he superintended.
And here our Author is compell'd to acknowledge that there was a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
difference between Superintendents and Bishops:</hi> and indeed 'twas
considerable with a witness, and so considerable that it really sets them
on even ground with each Pastor of the word. He adds, <hi>that this was
a great wrong, and error in the Constitution;</hi> and on this ocasion has a long
invective<note n="h" place="bottom">pag. 160, et sequentib.</note> against our Reformers, &amp; in speciall <hi>Knox,</hi> counting them
<hi>Children, Idiots,</hi> Ungovernable, and of bad Principles, and spares not to
flegg at all <hi>Scots</hi> men or <hi>Scotch mettal,</hi> as he speaks. But this is but a
kicking against the pricks. He knows all this helps him nothing, nor
is to the present Question, which is not <hi>de jure</hi> but <hi>de facto,</hi> what our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
freely and joyntly did? Not, on what grounds they did so?</p>
                  <p>He next retorts, <hi>that according to the book of Discipline, the Elders are
allow'd to admonish, correct, and, with the consent of the Church and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent,
depose their Minister.</hi> But, <hi>First,</hi> tho our Reformers had
spoken just alike of the Elders and Ministers as they did of the Synod
and Superintendent, their words will not bear the like inference: the
power they give to the Elders could certainly be a spurr to the Ministers,
and yet they might be sure the few Elders of one parish would never
make so bold with their Minister, as the whole Synod might with their
Superintendent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is no such allowance giv'n to the Elders concerning
their Minister as to the Synod over their Superintendent: the former
much act only with the consent of the Kirk and Superintendent, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this injoyn'd to the latter. Yea our Author himself will have
the power of Deposition to be a prerogative of the Superintendent, and
no doubt he or the Commissioner did, in the Churches name, execute
her sentence. <hi>To Depose</hi> therefore here, and that with allowance of
the whole context of that 8 head of Discipline, which he cites, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else than to delate to the Church, and Superintendent the crimes
of the Minister, and in their own sphere assist them in that action. He
adds, <hi>he hath no where found that</hi> de facto <hi>the Superintendent was judged by
his own Synod.</hi> And it may be so: for litle do we find of any thing was
then done by provincial synods, every thing of moment being left to
the General Assemblies, which were then most frequent. <hi>Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
(adds he) <hi>inferrs no such thing as Parity among Church-Offices
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94326:54"/>
Those who maintain that the King is inferior to his Subjects in their Collection,
are not yet so extravagant as to say, he is not Superior to every one of them in their
Distribution.</hi> But where Superiors or Equalls can be gotten, the Men
of this Principle will freely yeeld, that none, who are Inferiours in the
Distribution ought to judge the Actions of their Superiours, providing
other Judges can be had, who, in this Case cann't, there being
but one King only in a Kingdom: Hence they, believing that none
may live lawless, think the King's Actions are cognoscible by these who
are his Inferiours, but altering their capacity in the Collection. But
is it so in the Case of the Superintendent, whereof there were severals, &amp;
not one only, as there is one commonly King in a Kingdom? Seeing then
he was to be judged by the Synod, notwithstanding, that there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Superintendents in the Church; 'tis evident, they counted every
Brother in the Ministry his equal.</p>
                  <p>§. 19. <hi>But the Superintendents</hi> (saith our Author<note n="i" place="bottom">Page 120.</note>) <hi>had a stock of
prerogatives above other Pastors.</hi> But be it so: yet notwithstanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
if we suppose, which I trust at the narrowest search shall appear, the
truth of what we have now adduc'd, and the self consistency of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of our Reformers, whom he would fain set at variance with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whatsoever Prerogatives he has really brought, can never prove
that the Superintendent had any Dominion over other Pastors, or that
they acted not in a true and real Parity; so that, from what is now said,
these his pretended Disparities are prevented and remov'd. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
he tells us, <q>that Superintendents had a larger district, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the Council, elected by the Nobility and Gentry; 'twas
not so with the Paroch Ministers.</q> But the Commissioners had no less
districts, and were appointed by the General Assembly, which I'm sure
is of no less weight in the case than the Councils Nomination, even tho'
the Gentlemens Election be added thereto, and yet, who in his Wit will
take him for any other Officer than is every Parish-minister, or fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the rovery of our Author, who<note n="k" place="bottom">Page 37.</note> calls these Commissioners <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Bishops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paroch-ministers, by the first Book of Discipline head 8, were deposeable by
the Superintendent, and the Elders of their Parishes. The Superintendent was
to be Judged by the Ministers and Elders of the whole Province.</hi> But the
fraud is palpable, the words of the Book of Discipline are, <hi>that if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94326:55"/>
be worthy of Deposition, the Elders of his Parish may, with consent of the
<hi>Kirk</hi> and Superintendent, depose him.</hi> Where you see the <hi>Kirk</hi> or Minister
and Elders of the Province are no less interested in the Deposition of a
Minister than in the judging of a Superintendent. He suppress'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all mention of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> which even <hi>Spotswood,</hi> whom he cites,<note n="l" place="bottom">Pag. 168.</note>
expresses: to the end he might make his Reader believe no Minister,
save the Superintendent only, had any power in Deposition of Ministers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But privat Ministers</hi> (saith he) <hi>were to be admitted by their Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
but the Superintendents by the Superintendents next adjacent, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents
had the Power of Ordination. The first Book of Discipline
and several Acts of the Assemblies.</hi> But, had only the Superintendents
the Power of Ordination? yea, not only was there no plurality of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents
present at the Action, but also <hi>John Knox,</hi> who was no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent,
ordain'd or admitted <hi>Spotswood</hi> Superintendent of <hi>L.</hi> yea,
every particular Minister, when commissionated by the Assembly, had
no less Power of Ordination or any other thing whatsoever, than is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Book of Discipline or any where else giv'n to the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
Neither might any one particular Minister while he was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner,
more than the Superintendent, be translated from one district
to another without the Counsel of the whole Church or Assembly; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were there meaner Qualifications requisite in any Commissioner.
And I think <hi>Knox,</hi> who was never a Superintendent, was in these not
inferiour to any of 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he had a living five times so much as another Minister.</hi> But then
I'm sure, he had five times as much to do with it, being perpetually to
Travell, Preach and Exhort far and wide &amp;c: but, if this Rule had been
keep'd, our Bishops had got five times less than any other Minister, for
rarely did they any such Duty, either at home or abroad. In the mean
while, <hi>The Power of Riches, and the baseness of Poverty, maketh not a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
either higher or lower.</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">Hieronymus Euagrio.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Superintendents</hi> (saith he) <hi>were constant Members of General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
had Power to Visit, and to try the like &amp;c. of the Ministers of all the
Churches of the Diocess, and were to try those who stood Candidates for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
had Power of granting Collations on Presentations.</hi> But, whatsoever he had
of these, belong'd also to every particular Pastor when commissionated
by the General Assembly: but, tho' the Superintendent or Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94326:55"/>
is only nam'd in such Cases, as in trial of the Candidats, granting Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Deposition of Ministers &amp;c. He is to be understood as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator,
and mouth of the Synod where he Superintended, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Assembly in the case of transportation, chargeth the Ministers to
obey the Voice and Commandment of their Superintendent, and yet by
the very same Act,<note n="n" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cald.</hi> Ms. Hist. Vol. 1. Page. 789.</note> 
                     <hi>none can be translated without the Consent of the most
part of the Elders and Ministers of Kirks conveen'd in the Synodal Assembly;</hi>
and yet from this very Act, he adventnres to conclude the <hi>Canonical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
of Pastors to their Superintendents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, he had Power to nominal Ministers to be Members of the General
Assembly. For, Assembly 1562. 'twas ordain'd, that no Minister leave
his Flock for coming to the Assembly, except he have Complaints to make, or
be complain'd off, or at least, be warn'd thereto by the Superintendent.</hi> And
the <hi>L. Glamis</hi> in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> saith,<note n="o" place="bottom">Apud <hi>Saraviam</hi> exam. tract. de Episcopatuum triplici genere. Quest. 2. Pag. 91. <hi>Post reformatam Religionem, consuetudine receptum est, ut Episcopi, &amp; ex Ministris, Pastoribus, &amp; Senioribus, tot, quot iidem Episcopi jusserint, unum in lucum conveniant</hi> &amp;c.</note> that, <hi>after the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
it fell out by custom, that the Bishops and so many of the Ministers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Elders as the Bishops appointed—came to the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi>
But touching what he alledges as said by the <hi>L. Glamis,</hi> I can find
it no where, save in the Works of <hi>Saravia;</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>'s Answer to <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi>
his second Question, wherein these words are found, neither meets
with, nor presupposes any such Clause. But be it that <hi>L. Glamis</hi> said
so, what will they hence infer? he says indeed, that <hi>this came to pass af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Reformation,</hi> but how long 'twas after the Reformation, before
this was practis'd, he says not. '<hi>Twas</hi> (saith he) <hi>receiv'd by Custom:</hi> by
no Decree of the Church then, or Acts of the Assembly. And lastly, he
speaks of Bishops, not of Superintendents. And I never find that any
about these times gave <hi>Superintendents</hi> the name of <hi>Bishops;</hi> and so this
makes nothing for our Author's purpose. Wherefore, if ever <hi>L. Glamis</hi>
had any such Expression, whereof I much doubt, in my mind, he mean'd
it of the <hi>Tulchans,</hi> who, for some space after the <hi>Leith-convention</hi> made
some steps toward such a Superiority; otherwise, all the accounts we
have of these times, and, in special, the Acts of our Assemblies demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
that there was no such Power or Priviledge giv'n to any then in
<hi>Scotland:</hi> yea, so much our Author himself presently proves, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns

this his own Argument by citing another out of the Assembly <hi>July</hi>
1563, (1568, he should have said)<note n="p" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cald.</hi> Ms. Hist. Vol. 2. Pag. 87. <hi>Spots.</hi> Pag. 219.</note> viz. <hi>Anent the Order hereafter
to be used in General Assemblies—They all voted and concluded as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
viz. <hi>that if the Order already received, pleases not, by reason of the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Voices, it be reformed in this manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that none have place to Vote, except Superintendents, Commissioners
appointed for visiting the Kirks, and Ministers brought with them, presented
as Persons able to reason, and having knowledge to judge: with the aforenamed
shall be joined Commissioners of Burghs and Shires, together with Commissioners
of Vniversities. Secondly. Ministers and Commissioners shall be Chosen at
the Synodal-convention of the Diocess, by the Consent of the rest of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Gentlemen, that shall conveen at the said Synodal-convention &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>From this Act 'tis clear, that the former in 1562. has only been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
never concluded; or, at least, cass'd and repeal'd by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenient
Assembly, otherways, there had been no place or ground for
the Act of 1568. which presupposes, that ev'n these, that were not at
all thus Chosen at the Synod, were free to come and Vote at the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
So far was this liberty from being put in the Superintendent or
Commissioner's Power. And indeed from this Act, 'tis most evident,
and 'tis left on Record also, by the <hi>Vindicatour</hi> of <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of this Act, all Ministers who pleased, were free to Vote
at the Assemblies, &amp; yet, with our Author, <hi>Petrie</hi> must be a <hi>mixer of lies</hi> for
saying so much. <hi>But</hi> Calderwood (saith our Author) <hi>leaves out intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these words, brought with them, i. e. with the Superintendents and
Commissioners of Kirks, presented as Persons able to reason, and having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to judge, whereby the Power of Superintendents and Commissioners for
visiting of Kirks is quite stiffled, and the whole sense of the Act perverted. For
what sense is it I pray, to say, that the Ministers were Chosen by Consent of the
rest of the Ministers, when you tell not who was to choose, or who they were to
whose choice or nomination the rest of the Ministers were to give that Consent,</hi>
But to stiffle the Power he pleads for to Superintendents was a Work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
either to <hi>Calderwood,</hi> or any man else, the very Act it self most
irrefragbly shewing, they could have none, save such as is in any meer
Moderator of our Synods or Presbytries. For, be it, which yet the
Assembly expresses not, that the Superintendents were to nominate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
for the Assembly, yet they could do no more, but only as the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94326:56"/>
by their Votes assented or choosed the nominated Persons, whom
if the Synod or its major part rejected, these could not go to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
yet some behov'd to go, and consequently the Superintendent or
Commissioner was to make a new Lite, and name again; and if these did
not yet please, another Lite, and so on, untill the Synod was satisfi'd,
and choosed some Persons or other according to their pleasure, for the
Assembly. This much is undeniably contain'd in the Act, and I'm sure,
no Moderator of any Synod or Presbytry injoyes any less Power, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it deserve the name. Seeing then <hi>Brought with them,</hi> cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
mean any peculiar Power, I see not wherein <hi>Calderwood</hi> by ommit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them can be culpable. Neither, can he be accused of nonsense,
seing 'tis sufficiently intelligible and plain how these Ministers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
could be chosen by the consent of the rest of his Brethren,
the Ministers and Gentle-men, members of the Synod, who, by joynt
and mutual consent, chused them after the Superintendent or Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
nominating or liting, which, by a fraud too palpable, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
with <hi>Election.</hi> And here it's observable in how much torment
and perplexity this so clear an Act involves all of 'em. <hi>Spotswood,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
it in his latine Pamphlet, but is so soundly chastis'd by the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>
of <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> that our Author finds not a syllable to say in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
He pretends also to relate it in his History<note n="q" place="bottom">Page 219.</note>, but with an
essential Depravation, for he leaves out these words, <hi>Ministers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missirners
of Shires shall be chosen at the Synodal Convention of the Diocy, with
consent of the rest of the Ministers and Gentlemen that shall conveen at the said
Synodal Convention.</hi> For, he saw it quite spoil'd his Cause, and really
left the Superintendent no Power, but what was equally in any of the
rest, and foists into the Text these <hi>such Ministers as the Superintendents
should chuse in their Diocesan Synods.</hi> Neither can our Author be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in suppressing the following words. <hi>Commissioners of Burghs shall
be appointed by the Council and Kirk of their own Towns, none shall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without sufficient Commission in write. And least this should turn to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Election of a few and certain Persons, it is concluded, Ministers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commissioners be changed from Assembly to Assembly.</hi> Whereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the Churches great care, that neither Superintendent nor any other
might have ought like an Episcopal Power, and that all fit Persons
might have equal priviledge of Voting at the Assemblies. There yet
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94326:57"/>
remain many of his pretended Disparities, but, are no more significative
of eminency or superiour Office, no less communicable to the rest of the
Ministers when Commissioners than were the former, as will be evident to
any, who reads the Acts of the Assemblies, among which, he reckons the
Superintendent's modifying to Ministers their Stipends, as if, because
<hi>Judas</hi> had the Bagg, and bare what was put therein, he had been Bishop
over the rest of the Apostles. In the mean while, the Superintendents
could do nothing of this, but only as Moderator of the provincial Synod.</p>
                  <p>Another Deduction of no better metall is,<note n="r" place="bottom">Pages 138, 139.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Laird of</hi> Dun,
<hi>Superintendent of</hi> Angus, not as such, but by vertue of a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
giv'n by the Assembly to him and others join'd with him, depos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Regent of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> a place intirely <hi>without</hi> the bounds of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency;
therefore Superintendents as such, had a Power <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi>
and Episcopal. And was not such an arguer a man of sense? I
pass the rest of his thirty Disparities not without admiration, that such
a fertile brain could not invent one other, for one and thirty used to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Game.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this, that tho' some that had been Popish Bishops in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and imbrac'd the Gospel, as Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> a man of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Gifts, were by our Reformers allow'd, without any new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
to dispence the Word aud Sacraments; yet, they were never
allow'd to exercise what they counted their Episcopal Function, or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as Bishops of these Dioceses: yea Mr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> tho' he earnestly
sought for it, could never be admitted to Superintend in <hi>Galloway,</hi> which
is a clear Demonstration, that our Reformers looked on the Episcopal
preheminence as a meer Popish Corruption, otherways, why did not
Mr. <hi>Gordon, verbi causâ,</hi> remain in the Power and Character he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
while Romanist.</p>
                  <p>It's most clear also from all the accounts we have of the <hi>Tulchan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
that all men of all parties look'd on a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as a thing altogether
diverse from a <hi>Superintendent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 20. And now at length hear him yeelding the whole Plea,<note n="s" place="bottom">Pages 167, 168.</note>
                     <hi>There was</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Principle had, then, got too much footing among some
Protestant Divines,</hi> viz. <hi>That the best way to reform a Church, was, to recede
as far from the Papists as they could; to have nothing in common with them, but
the essentials; the necessary and indispensable Articles and Parts of Christian
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94326:57"/>
Religion; whatever was, in its Nature indifferent, and not positively and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded in the Scriptures, if it was in fashion in the Popish Churches, was
therefore to be laid aside, and avoided as a Corruption; as having been abused,
and made subservient to Superstition and Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Principle <hi>John Knox</hi> was fond of, and maintain'd zealously; and the
rest of our reforming Preachers were much acted by his influences. In pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of this Principle, therefore, when they compil'd the first Book of Discipline,
they would not Reform the old Polity, and purge it of such Corruptions as had
crept into it, keeping still by the main draughts and lineaments of it;—But
they laid it quite aside, and in stead thereof hammer'd out a new Scheme, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at as great a distance from the old one, as they could, and as the essentials of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
would allow them; establishing no such thing, however, as Parity, as I have
fully proven. And no wonder; for as Imparity has, obviously, more of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
beauty and usefulness in its aspect, so it had never so much as by dreaming,
entred their tboughts, that it was a limb of Antichrist, or a relict of Popery.</p>
                  <p>But was not Episcopacy in fashion in the Popish Churches? And,
dare he, yea or any mortal say, that ever our Reformers believed it <hi>to
be an indispensible part of the Christian Religion positively and expresly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Scriptures:</hi> Do not therefore his saying <hi>establishing however no
such thing as Parity &amp;c</hi> and the rest of his Discourse mutually give the
lie, and flee in the face of one another. And indeed, he here at once
overthrows whatsoever he said on this Subject: and now for ever to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
all reasonable men, and stop them from such desperat adventures
as this of our Authors, take the following Argument.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever our Reformers believed to be without the express and
positive Testimony of the Scriptures, that they believed to be a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Corruption in Religion, and as such to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>This the major is put beyond scruple, by what we have brought from
the first Book of Discipline, <hi>Knox,</hi> and the Confessions of our Author:
Now I subjoin.</p>
                  <p>But they believed, that Episcopacy was altogether without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
or positive Testimony, yea, or any Warrant or Ground from the
Word of God, the Books of the Old and New Testament; <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.
The minor is no less evident from what is already adduc'd: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
from the latter <hi>Helvetian</hi> Confession, which was all (save the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of the remembrance of some Holy Days, which they expresly
disprov'd) approv'd and subscribed by our whole General Assembly at

that, <hi>whatsoever is without the express Commandment of God's Word, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

                     <hi>There's giv'n to all Ministers in the
Church, one and the same Power or Function: And indeed, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
Bishops and Presbyters ruled the Church in common, none preferr'd
himself to another, or usurped any more honourable Power or Dominion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
over his fellow Bishops. But according to the words of the Lord, who will
be first among you, let him be your Servant, they persevered in Humility, and
helped one another by their mutual Duties, in Defending and Governing the
Church. In the meantime for preserving Order, some one of the Ministers, did
call the Assembly, and proposed these things that were to be consulted in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
He did also receive the Opinions of others; and finally, according to his
Power, he took care that no confusion should arise, so</hi> S. Peter <hi>is said to have done
in the Acts of the Apostles, who notwithstanding was never set over
the rest, nor indu'd with greater power and honour, but the beginning
took its rise from Vnity, that the Church might be declared to be one.</hi> And having
related <hi>Hierome</hi>'s Doctrine of the Idenity of <hi>Bishop</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyier</hi> thus they
conclude. <hi>Therefore none may lawfully hinder to return to the ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution

                  <p>BUT let's hear the Judgement of the rest of the Reformers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
transmarine Churches. <hi>Gerard,</hi> a famous <hi>Lutheran</hi> divine,
<note n="a" place="bottom">Loc. com. Tom. 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 260.</note> altho', for Orders sake, he admit of some kind of Episcopacy,
<hi>which</hi> really he makes as good as nothing above a Moderator-ship, yet
even for that umbrage allows nothing but <hi>humane Institution,</hi> and will
acknowledge <hi>no distinction by Divine Right between Bishop and Presbyter. The
Papists</hi> (saith he<note n="b" place="bottom">Col. 261. <hi>Atqui superiorem illam jurisdictionis pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem jure Divino Episcopis competentem Pontificii in eo vel maximè ponunt, quod Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus possit ordinare Ministros, Presbyteri vero minimè, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>especially place that superiour Power of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which they make to agree to Bishops in this, that the Bishops can Ordain
Ministers but the Presbyters cannot.</hi> And all along this Question he strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proves that, <hi>during the Apostolick age there was no such thing as a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between a Bishop and a preaching Presbyter:</hi> and enervats all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that both Romanists and other Prelatists commonly bring to the
contrary. But, we need not insist on the Testimonies of particular Men:
we have the joint suffrages of the body of <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines, <hi>Luther</hi>
himself being the mouth to the rest, in the Articles of <hi>Smalcald</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Apud <hi>Osiandrum.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitom. Hist. Eccles. parte. 1. Page 299. Art.

                     </note>. <hi>It's
clear</hi> (say they) <hi>even from the Confession of our Adversaries, that this
Power, to wit of preaching, dispensing the Sacraments, Excommunication and
Absolution, is common to all that are set over the Churches, whither they be
called Pastors, Presbyters or Bishops: Wherefore</hi> Hierome <hi>plainly affirms,
that there is no difference between Bishop and Presbyter, but that every Pastor
was a Bishop.—Here</hi> Hierome <hi>teaches, that the distinction of degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Bishop and a Presbyter or Pastor, was only appointed by humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94326:59"/>
And the matter it self</hi> (continues <hi>Luther</hi> and his Associats) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
no less, for, on both Bishop and Presbyter is laid the same Duty and the
same Injunction. And only Ordination in after times made the difference
between Bishop and Pastor.—And by Divine Right there is no difference
between Bishop and Pastor.</hi>

                  <p>§ 2. As for <hi>Calvin,</hi> his judgement in this matter was altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to his practice, which by the very Adversaries themselves is made

he founds on <hi>Titus</hi> 1. and 5. compared with the 7, as <hi>Hierome</hi> had
done long before him, and Presbyterians do now. And when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to after times succeeding these of the Apostles, he tells us,<note n="e" place="bottom">

pregnant is the Testimony of the <hi>French</hi> Consession: <hi>We believe</hi> (say

believe</hi> (say they<note n="i" place="bottom">Credimus veram hanc Ecclesiam debere regi &amp;c.</note>) <hi>that this true Church ought to be governed by that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

                  <p>§. 3. The harmonius and Catholick Testimony of all the reformed
Churches are to some like pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides,
and therefore, most various and hetrogeneous means are used to render
it unserviceable. And amongst other things, we are told, that many
forraign Divines and Churches have a great likeing for their Diocesan
Way, and <hi>Zanchius</hi> (say they<note n="k" place="bottom">

seeing, according to that Confession, Christ gave equal Power to all
Pastors, and according to what is alledg'd to be the Judgement of the
present Church of <hi>England,</hi> he did the quite contrary. Their Preface
can by no means prove, that they allow of the Sentiments and Practice
of the present <hi>English</hi> Church, except he would have the Preface to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Confession. But all this he says is only to darken an evident
Truth; the meaning of the Preface being, that between the <hi>Helvetians</hi>
and the <hi>English</hi> there was no such fundamental Difference as prohibited
mutual Charity one to another which many have given, and may give to

to these transmarine Superintendents or Bishops: and indeed,
shortly to give an account of this Author, besides, as we have now seen,
he is oblig'd to pull back with the one hand, what he had bestow'd on
the Hierarchicks with the other; his whole Discourse leans upon this
Supposition, that there is no certain Form of Church Government left
by Christ in his Word: on this depend his Glosses upon the passages
we produced of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Confessions. <hi>Vide inter alia part.
spec. a pag. 171 ad pag.</hi> 189, where he all along presupposes and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,
that, <hi>tho' according to the Authors of the Confessions, Christ gave equal
Power, &amp;c. to all Pastors, yet in their Judgement if the Church will, she may
alter this kind of Government, and change that Equality which Christ gave, for
an Inequality, and give some Pastors a Power over the rest.</hi> Which, if it be
not a Contradiction to these Confessions, in stead of an Explication, it
looks as like it is one Crow can be like another. For, who can believe,
but that if the Authors of these Confessions had believ'd an indifferency
of Equality or Inequality of Pastors, they had either intimated so much,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94326:61"/>
or been altogether silent thereof, neither of which they did, but gave
to the World solemnly as the Confession of their Belief, <hi>that Christ gave to
to all Pastors <hi>equal and the same power:</hi>
                     </hi> and yet, if we believe this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
this that Christ gave may, according to the Authors of that
Confession be relinquish'd when Men will, and Inequality, it's quite
contrary introduced in the place thereof. Is not this too like the dealing
of the Romanists, who, when they are compell'd to acknowledge that
the Apostles gave the Cup to the People, yet pretend that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of what Christ and his Apostles gave them? Divers indeed
have said, that Church Government was among the <hi>Adiaphora,</hi> and
things indifferent. But these were more wary then to say (as he would
have the Authors of these Confessions to say) that Christ gave equal,
and the same Power to all Pastors, yea, such used not to grant that Christ
gave either Equality or Inequality of Power, but left all to the Churches
management.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as he does us no dammage, so, I'm sure, he does the present
Hierarchicks as little service; for, if this Hypothesis, <hi>that no kind of
Church Government is juris divini,</hi> stand, then the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
is lost, and therefore I'm sure, they shall give him as little thanks
as we. 'Tis also observable, that when ever the Authors of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
or other Divines of their Perswasion said, that Communion
with Churches of a different Government was not to be broken, or any
thing of that kind; he presently inferrs that they judg'd any other form
no less agreeable to the word of God than their own.</p>
                  <p>And here I cann't but take nottice of what I have met with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in <hi>M. Claude's historical defence of the Reformation</hi> (for, at present,
I have not the book) <hi>viz.</hi> that Diocesan Episcopacy is no less condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
than Pilgrimages, Purgatories, or some such Romish dotages which
he there names, and how averse he was from Diocesan Episcopacy, is
observed by the Prefacer to the English Translation: and yet, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
some, he gave large Testimonies of his great affection to the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
cause.</p>
                  <p>And this brings to mind another Artifice; for when any Protestant
Divines, considering the great Power of Popish Bishops, and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desiring Peace for the free Preaching and Propagation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
strain'd their Judgement, and seem'd at any time to do or say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that appear'd to comply with Episcopacy, our Prelatists anone
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94326:61"/>
Infer, that such Divines were great Lovers of their Hierarchy. Thus,
for Example, they abuse the Words and Actions of <hi>Melancton;</hi> but they
should remember that sometimes, driving the same Design, some of
these Divines seem'd no less to comply with the Papacy it self, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
at the pressing of the <hi>Interim.</hi> The same end drove <hi>Melancton,</hi>
when, in a Conference at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> as <hi>Osiander</hi> relates<note n="x" place="bottom">Epitom. Hist. Eccles. Part. 1. Cent. 16. Lib. 2. Cap. 15. <hi>Videtur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> Melancton <hi>in causa fuisse, ut Episcopis aliquid Jurisdictionis concederetur: speravit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim, si &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>, <hi>he seem'd
to yeeld somewhat of Jurisdiction to Bishops; for be hop'd that, if Jurisdiction
were granted them, they would not so much oppose the Gospel. But</hi> Philip <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd

admit the Gospel, a superiority over other Bishops, founded only on humane right,
and yeelded for procuring of the Peace of Christendom.</hi> Thus <hi>Melancton,</hi>
through his extream desire of Peace, forc'd his own Judgement, for,
with <hi>Luther</hi> and the rest, he subscribes the <hi>Smalkaldick Articles,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as we have heard, the Scriptural Idenity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is
most clearly asserted.</p>
                  <p>But, what ever they say to perswade us, that these or other such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
favour them, we are little oblig'd to believe it, for they believe it
not themselves: and these of our Adversaries that speak out their mind
freely, tell us, <hi>that all the transmarine reformed Churches are really Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian:</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Some of the manifold inconveniences and noxious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Prelacy briefly mention'd.</head>
                  <p>I Might, in the next place, enlarge on its Concomitants and Qualities:
a few whereof I shall only name. One of these was a direfull Spirit
of Persecution, which still rag'd during the Prelatical Government, the
sad effects whereof, through no small part of this Kingdom, on both Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Consciences of the best part of Protestants therein, and that
for their refusal of the very things which many of the Urgers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to be altogether indifferent, are but too well known.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Another of its Qualities, little better than the former, is their
Schismatical Practice and Principles; as for instance, at the last return
of Prelats, the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whatsoever Differences might have
been therein, yet was but one, and not Altar against Altar: did they not
then become the Authors of a compleat National Schism, while they
broke the whole Church into Parties, to the end (only) they might
establish such things as many of themselves acknowledg'd to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?
Again, their re-entry into <hi>Scotland</hi> was so far from being Legal,
that it wanted the very colour of all Order &amp; Law: for no General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of whatsoever kind introduc'd them. Seeing then this Church has,
ever since her return from <hi>Rome,</hi> held General and National Assemblies
for her supream Judicatory, and Prelats were extruded by full Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Assemblies, they ought, for their re-entry without the like Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to be accounted, by all true Members of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
manifest Violators of all her Laws and Authority. And while they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94326:63"/>
us with the Crime of Separation, are exactly like these, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overturn'd all fundamental Laws of a Society, and ruin'd all both
Officers and Members cleaving thereto, should moreover reproach
them, upon this very account, that they would not subscribe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of their fundamental Laws and Constitution. But marvel not
tho' they made so wide a Breach here; for they give but too much
ground to judge, that they have separated themselves from the Body of
the reform'd Churches; as appears, amongst other things, in their
Doctrine and Practice of Re-ordaining all who come over unto them
from these Churches. Some indeed would perswade us, that they hold
this but as a small Ceremony; but yet it's such an one, as, for ought I
can learn, they will never quite with, notwithstanding of all the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
giv'n or taken thereby. And the most earnest Asserters of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
have their Episcopal Ordination in such esteem, that they account
none true Ministers without it; and so look on most of the Reform'd
Churches as being without all true Ministers, &amp; consequently without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true Preaching or true Sacraments. And is not this too like a <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistick</hi>
Schism? And is it strange then that our Church did still, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
care and vigor, tho' on this account only, oppose Prelacy and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latists,
they being generally leaven'd with such dangerous Principles?</p>
                  <p>And here observe that all the Heats and Debates that were in our
Church since her Reformation from Popery, owe their Original, either
more directly, to Prelacy, while she strove to keep or drive it out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
or more indirectly, while some (if on good ground or otherwise,
I determine not) greatly feared that some Persons or Practices would
prove introductive thereof; and therefore, against the mind of others,
sought to have them laid aside. And thus Prelacy, whither present or
absent, hath still been the bane of this Church. And there's little doubt,
but that they were so wise, in their Generation, as both to kindle and
blow at the fire of any Division that happen'd.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. And, as they give but too evident signs of their separating from
the Body of the reform'd Churches, so, in too many things they but
too nigh approach the Romanists. Their Government and Hierarchick
Scale is one and the same, save one roundle, with that of <hi>Rome.</hi> All their
Arguments they bring, either from Scripture or Antiquity, are learn'd
from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and such Romanists, and admit no less improvement
for the evincing a papal Authority, than the Episcopals have made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94326:64"/>
for the establishing of their prelatical Power. The Romanists af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the Apostles and Evangelists were Prelats of particular Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
and that a power properly Apostolick still remains in the Church.
In these and other such Positions too many of our Episcopal Men are
ready to follow them. But leaving the Apostolick times, descend to
the subsequent Ages call'd <hi>Antiquity,</hi> there, they're <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi>
mutual Supporters of one another, and have, in arguing from this
Fountain so great a resemblace, that you shall scarce know with whither
of the two ye are dealing. Neither, as we have already touch'd, in
the Topicks they pretend to draw from Reason, as that of Order and
the like, is there between them any less Consanguinity.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. The Practice also of our Prelats both former and latter bore no
small resemblance to that of the Romanists, while they affected so earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly
a secular Grandour, and the sullying the purity and simplicity of
the Gospel, with a mass of Superstition and Romish Ceremonies. The
affection of too many of that Party to <hi>Rome</hi> was also visible in their earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness
to get and keep a zealous Papist upon the Throne, and in their
melancholick and Pannick-fears at any appearance of our Relief from
Slavery and imminent danger of Popery. And lastly, in their exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Joy when any hope of our Delivery seem to have been crush'd and
blasted. All this was most legible in their Practice at the appearance
of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and the failing of
their Designs. They were no less gall'd and vex'd at the most noble
and happy Design of his present Majesty, praying, in the chief Churches
of this Kingdom, <hi>that he, might be sunk as a Stone in the mighty Waters.</hi> And
after his entry that, <hi>as his Army came in one way, it might be scatter'd seven
ways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. Add to all this, their either more indirect, or down-right ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating
and maligning of the reform'd Churches and first Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
placing them in the same Category with Papists. Take for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the frontispicial Lines of <hi>Nalson</hi>'s Collections,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Like</hi> Bifrons Janus <hi>next does court your eye</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Rome <hi>and</hi> Geneva <hi>in Epitome,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>They squint two ways in the main Point agree.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this is but their kindest dealing. Neither do they then
speak as they think; for their Love and Charity is by many degrees
greater toward the Romanists, than to the reform'd Churches. They
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94326:64"/>
will admit none of the latter to a pastoral Office if they refuse Re-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
but kindly receive a Romish Priest without it. Of the most
learn'd and godly Protestant Dissenters from them, they speak most
contemptuously<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Pearson.</hi> prooem. ad vind. St. Ignat.</note> terming them <hi>Arch-schismaticks.</hi> But the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Baron</hi> the Popish grand Legendarie, they with greatest
deference call <hi>most eminent Cardinals.</hi> Yea even in the chief Churches
of this Kingdom, they repeated their invectives against our first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
and Reformation, and in some Churches thereof, they were not
asham'd to say, that <hi>our Reformation was Deformation:</hi> Knox <hi>deserved
knocks.</hi> On the other hand, not a few of 'em all along shew'd no little
warmth of affection to Papists, intitulating them to the same God, and
Heaven with themselves, and asserting their neighbourhood and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>junction
to be infinitely more eligible than that of these whom they-call'd
<hi>Phanaticks,</hi> as appears, for instance, in a printed Sermon of Mr
<hi>Mcqueen.</hi> And <hi>Heylin</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Hist. of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. Page 0.</note> says, that <hi>the</hi> Genevan <hi>Discipline was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in Rebellion, born in Sedition, and nursed up by Faction.</hi> And indeed
this Author is an Enemy so open and implacable to all the reform'd
Churches, that <hi>Strada, Gretser, Becan, Campian,</hi> or the like most fiery
and venemous Loyolites could scarce, with all their impudent slanders
and infernal rage, out-do, yea or equal him. With such stuff most of
his Works, and especially his <hi>History of the Presbyterians,</hi> are wholly
cramm'd. Yea, he doubts not<note n="c" place="bottom">Hist. Quinquart. Pages 5, 6.</note> to call both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches,
i. e.</hi> such as hold two infinite Beings, or two Gods. Others of
the Faction, as <hi>Dodwell,</hi> are ready to pronounce all, who dislike Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
Episcopacy, guilty of <hi>the Sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> But the World
hath now seen, that the most fiery of such Zelots at length threw off the
Mask, and profess'd themselves Romanists: as for instance <hi>L' Estrange</hi>
or else, which their own Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Preface to the second Vol. of his Hist of the Reformation.</note> observes of Heylin, <hi>one would
think they had been secretly set on by these of the Church of Rome.</hi> And so, they
were, in their profession of Protestancy, hatefull Hypocrites, that they
might the more easily bespatter and gore the protestant Religion
through the sides of Presbytry. Others of 'em are yet more down-right
Atheists, who, if they hear the wrath of God, and Hells torments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
against impenitent Sinners, will tell you<note n="e" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Howel.</hi> Fam. Lett. Pages 471, 472.</note> that such a Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94326:65"/>
came from a <hi>Winter-Preacher, so that if a</hi> Schytian <hi>or</hi> Groenlander,
<hi>who are habituated to such extream cold, had heard him, they would have
thought he preach'd of</hi> Paradice. And some call the Doctrine of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God and Faith in Jesus Christ, fine Fables and Stories. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Men who make it their chief Work to adore the Hierarchy, and
inveigh against Presbytry: which brings to mind the saying of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="bottom">Apolog. Cap. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>that Christianity must needs be some excellent thing, seeing only</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
<hi>and such Monsters were its prime Persecuters.</hi> Some there are also (as
their own Edwards<note n="g" place="bottom">Of the stile of the Scriptures. Page 34. <hi>et seq.</hi>
                     </note> relates) even of their <hi>Reverend Divines, who
turn all the Mosaick History concerning</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve, <hi>the</hi> Serpent, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice,
eating the forbidden Fruit, <hi>and all the passages relating to them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
Parable, <hi>yea into</hi> Ridicule; <hi>saying that</hi> Moses <hi>only so talked in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the blockish, and thick skull'd Israelites, but not a syllable of truth is
in all that he saith. This is very strange language</hi> (subjoins <hi>Edwards) from
a Reverend Divine, who thereby destroyes the whole system of Theology, and of
Christianity it self.</hi> And yet, for such black and hainous Crimes we cann't
hear that they undergoe the least degree of Censure. <hi>In my Judgement,</hi>
(saith Edwards) <hi>if there be no publick Censure pass'd upon such a daring At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
as this, by a Member of our Church, Athiests will have just ground to
laugh at our Discipline.</hi> And here in <hi>Scotland,</hi> all along during their Reign,
how closely did they connive at such Irreligion, as also, at all the growth
and progress then made by the active Spirit of Popery: and in stead of
being providers against such Pests, some of our Prelats at Court prov'd
Mediators in their behalf, saying, <hi>that there was less to be fear'd from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
than from Phanaticks.</hi> And in answer to some imputing gross Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> said, that <hi>such things were only to be ascrib'd
to the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>not to the Church of</hi> Rome. Add hereto the great
love of not a few of 'em to the <hi>Pelagian, Jesuitick</hi> or <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines,
Hypotheses clean contrary to the belief of all the reform'd Churches;
and more especially to that of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> They pretend
notwithstanding, as if the establishing of Prelacy were the debarring of
Popery. <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (say<note n="h" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Confer. Page 323.</note> they) <hi>was so far from being judg'd a step
to it, that the ruine of the</hi> Episcopal <hi>Authority over Presbyters, and the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them exemptions from the jurisdiction of their Ordinary, was the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Roman Bishop ever made in his tyrannical Vsurpation over Churches.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94326:65"/>
I need not here tell so known a matter, as is that of the</hi> exemption of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars,
<hi>who being subject to their own Superiours and Generals, and by them to
the Pope, were sent through the World in swarms; and with great shows of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
Devotion, and Poverty, carried away all the esteem, and following from
the secular Clergy; who were indeed become too secular, and these were the Popes
Agents and Emissaries, who brought the World to receive</hi> the Mark of the
Beast, and wonder at her. <hi>For before that time, the Popes found more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to carry on their Pretensions, both from secular Princes and Bishops: but
these Regulars being warranted to Preach and Administer the Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Bishops licence, or being subject and accountable to him; as they brought
the Bishops under great contempt, so they were the Popes chief Confidents in all
their treasonable Plots against the Princes of</hi> Europe. <hi>And when at the</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Trent, <hi>the Bishops of</hi> Spain <hi>being weary of the insolencies of the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and of the Papal Yoke, design'd to get free from it. The great Mean
they proposed, was to get</hi> Episcopacy <hi>declared to be of</hi> Divine Right, <hi>which
would have struck out both the one and the other. But the Papal Party fore-saw
this well, and opposed it with all the Artifice imaginable: and</hi> Lainez <hi>the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
did at large discourse against it; and they carried it so, that it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be declared of</hi> Divine Right. <hi>And by this, judge if it be likely that
the Papacy owes its rise to Episcopacy.</hi> The emptiness of which discourse
is apparent. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The tendency and nature of Prelacy, and the Topicks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they Found it, aiming no less at one Head over all, then at one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
over a few Churches, make evident, that he touches not the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in hand, only giving out that some time by one accident or other,
the humbling, and depression of the Prelats prov'd the Popes exaltation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Strange, I'm sure, and most demonstrative must the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be that make null clear Matters of Fact, or perswade Men that such
things have never been; and 'tis undeniable that the Councils and other
Caballs, which from time to time rais'd the Pope gradually to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
hight, were all consisting of, or manag'd by Bishops; and if any
hapen'd to spurn at his rising, the Pope got still far more then a plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to crush them: and indeed 'twas impossible the Pope should have risen
by any other means, the whole sway of Church Affairs and guidance
thereof being then in the hands of Bishops: wherefore if the Pope was
rais'd to despotick Soveraignity, whereby he might absolutely dispense
of Church Affairs, and trample at pleasure on the fairest mitres, they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94326:66"/>
only are to be blamed, having themselves advanc'd him to this transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Preheminency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither are the Bishops less guilty of this the Popes exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon the account of their profound sloth and negligence: the
Author well observes, <hi>that they were become too secular,</hi> and indeed they
were so immers'd in Luxury and Ambition, that providing they might
wallow in their Lusts, and obtain from the Pope a Domination over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches, they little valued any thing else.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But 'tis yet more admirable how he can alledge, <hi>that the
Regulars brought the World to receive the Mark of the Beast:</hi> as if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
(for this he must intimat or he says nothing) had been innocent;
he's too learn'd not to know that gross Papal Darkness had over-spread
the World ere ever any such Exemptions were giv'n, or the <hi>Regulars</hi>
distinguished from <hi>Seculars.</hi> 'Tis true indeed that the swarms of Friers
were amongst the most pestiferous Locusts, the World hath been peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
withall, but, to lay all or the greatest share of this Guilt of exalting
the Pope, on their shoulders, is a shrewd evidence of partiality; nothing
being more notour, then that as the Bishops were the main Assistants and
Supporters in every Innovation he decreed, so they with the greatest
care, rigour and fury press'd them on both Clergy and People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the wicked fraternities in the several Orders of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>
were the Popes Agents in contriving, and sometimes effecting the
ruine of Kings and Princes, is but too well known and evident enough;
yet that the Prelats were no less guilty, and far more efficacious herein,
is no less deniable. Were there no Bishops supporting the Pope in his
War against the Emperour <hi>Barbarossa?</hi> Did not a crew of the same Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
join him in Dethroning <hi>Henry</hi> the IV? And at a word, where did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Pope make his impresses, but he was strengthn'd by their arm
and support.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> But tho' Episcopacy at the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> had been declar'd
of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> what great relief had this been, either from the Papal
Yoak, or insolencies of the <hi>Regulars;</hi> it might perhaps for the time have
procur'd some more Honour to the <hi>Bishops</hi> for the <hi>Pope's Italians</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Orders: but might not the Pope notwithstanding, by his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Authority and Supremacy he pretends over all <hi>Bishops,</hi> have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to gall and oppress their Order, and also send, especially where
the negligence of Prelats invited him, his Missionaries through the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94326:66"/>
World, yea thus the <hi>Pope</hi>'s power paramount had not once been touch'd
at that <hi>Council,</hi> or hurt by such a Declaration. Was his infallibility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there question'd by the Bishops? Did they at all endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of the unsupportable Burdens and Slavery the Church groan'd
under? And should it not have been a great benefite to the Church, or
diminishing the Pope's power, tho' his Holiness had pleased to declare
the Divine Right of their Office?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> But whatever it was the Bishops aim'd at in the <hi>Council of
Trent,</hi> I'm not much concern'd; only I would gladly know, how from
this their Action it follows that Bishops had never been the Men, or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi>
one of the means whereby the <hi>Papacy</hi> had been brought into
the World; which is the Author's Inference, and is just as one should
reason thus: some of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Macedonian Souldiers, vex'd with his
tyranny and insolence, and his preferring of Strangers, attempted his
down-throw: (the like may be said of some of the Souldiers of <hi>Julius
Caesar, Galba, Didius Julianus, Maximinus</hi> and others) therefore they
had not contributed to the raising and absolute Supremacy of these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And should not such an one be reckon'd an admirable Logician?
And yet this Inference should be far more pardonable than the former;
in so much as the thing the Bishops aim'd at against the <hi>Papacy,</hi> if it can
be call'd any thing, came infinitely short of what these Conspirators at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
upon the powers they deem'd unsupportable.</p>
                  <p>And by this, judge if the most earnest efforts of their chiefest Authors
make it in the least improbable, that the <hi>Papacy</hi> owes its rise to <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:</hi>
and if such pitifull paralogisms proclaim not, that they can real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find nothing wherewith to cover <hi>Prelacy</hi> from the heavy; but just
imputation of being the certain introductive of Popery.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. This odd reasoning of the Doctor minds me of another of his
of his Essayes, or Retorsions which is of Kin to this Argumentation.
<hi>May not one</hi> (saith he<note n="i" place="bottom">Page 321.</note>) <hi>that quarrells a standing Ministry, argue on
the same Grounds, a Ministers Authority over the People, gave the rise to
the Authority Bishops pretend over Ministers, and so the Minister will be
concluded the first step of the Beast's Throne?</hi> But this retorsion, being once
handl'd, shall hurt us no more, then what we have already removed;
for take a Gospel Ministry unconfounded with a <hi>papal Hierarchy,</hi> and
then there is not the least colour or pretext for any Man's ascribing to it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94326:67"/>
the first rise of Popery, the parity we plead for among Pastors of Flocks
secures a <hi>Gospel-Ministry</hi> from any force or appearance of reason in any
such assault: whereas (on which I'm not now to dwell) the Topicks
establishing <hi>Prelacy,</hi> tend no less to assert a <hi>Papacy.</hi> But again the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a <hi>Gospel-Ministry</hi> as a thing altogether necessary for the Being of
a Church, is so well and so universally rooted in the hearts of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that they, compar'd with the rest, have scarce amounted to a
handfull who had the holdness to deny it; and so there's little hazard
to be fear'd from these few contemptible Objectors: and tho' there
seem'd to be, and the Objection should appear never so pungent, yet it
could be really of no weight against so necessary and indispensible an
Ordinance. Whereas on the other hand, there's so little necessity of
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> that the far greatest and best part of its Abettors, and in these
the Author himself (as in due time shall appear) grants, that 'tis no
different Order from <hi>Presbytry,</hi> has no footing in the Word of God, and
in a word to the overthrow of his Principles, confounds a Prelat with a
parochial Pastor.</p>
                  <p>Another grand, but just prejudice against the Hierarchy, is the loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and prophanity most frequently cleaving thereto: how prophane
and scandalous they and theirs were, during former Prelacy, has already
appear'd: of the latter the matter is no less evident; for at such a height
&amp; growth during their Government, yea under their wings did propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
abusing of God's blessed Name, and such gross immoralities arrive,
that to abstain from such vices and follow piety, was a Crime well nigh
able to make a Man pass for a <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Phanatick,</hi> and what hazard did
enshew these Sir-names, none is ignorant. All this and much more was
not only evident to the body of this Kingdom, but was also notic'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
and, amongst others, by their Friend <hi>R. Coke.</hi> Yea his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
whom Divine Mercy sent for our Relief, well knew't, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
in his <hi>Declaration for Scotland,</hi> has, amongst many others, this most
memorable Sentence. <hi>Although</hi> (saith He) <hi>the Dissenters have just
cause of distrust when they call to mind how some hundreds of their Ministers
were driven out of their Churches without either Accusation or Citation: the
filling of many of whose Places with <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Scandalous</hi> Persons
hath been one great occasion of all those Miseries which that Country for a long
time hath groaned under.</hi> They may pretend <hi>that such Enormities were only
accidental to Prelacy, which may fall out under any Government:</hi> but none
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94326:67"/>
versant in Church Story is ignorant how much mischief and scandal this
Hierarchy hath cast upon Christianity. Let them read <hi>Socrates</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Records of these more ancient times, and they shall find that the
<hi>Prelats,</hi> tho' but beginning to appear, and by far, not so degenerat
from the simplicity of the Gospel as afterward by their swelling tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and aspiring to Domination, induc'd the People to commit the most
lewd and vile Pranks readily imaginable, to the doolfull scandalizing
of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and their utter abominating of Christianity it self:
as is clear from the miserable Havock, Destruction and Slaughter, the
contrary Factions of Bishops in the Plea for the Episcopal <hi>See</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Damasus</hi> and <hi>Vrsinus</hi> prompted the People to commit, from the
most scandalous Pranks of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
and barbarous concomitants and consequents of the Deposition
of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> with many other such open Impieties, all caus'd and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by the Prelatick pride and insolency, which publick and most
scandalous Enormities, had the Christian World retain'd the truly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and Apostolick Parity we plead for, could never have hapned:
for had the Superiority, Riches, and Grandour, the very aples of these
most unchristian Contentions, been wanting, and had every Pastor been
kept at the earnest labour of Teaching, Exhorting, and Catechising a
particular Flock or Congregation, with only such a competent Stipend
as suffic'd to secure him from the contempt of Poverty, not to feed Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
Grandour and such like Vices, there had been no occasion of such
lamentable Broyls. This was observ'd by <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who himself was
Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and therefore he earnestly wish'd<note n="k" place="bottom">Orat. 28.</note> that <hi>there
had been no primacy of Place, no Prelacy, no Prerogative, no Superiour or Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

whereby to palliat the unlawfullness of their Papacy, and a real
and clear contradiction of <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s plain words. And was not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Prelatical</hi> pride, and affectation of secular rule the
prime source of the unspeakable Evils that reign'd all along before the
Reformation, and yet continue in the Papacy? Is not that Kingdom
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94326:68"/>
where Prelacy is of most account fill'd with the most idle, naughty, and
profain Clergy-men that are to be found, at least, in the Protestant
World? And how can it be otherwise, seeing things or Offices retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
litle or nothing of what did primitively constitute them, produce
quite contrary effects to these design'd by the Authors thereof? But
nothing is more plain, than that the simplicity of the Gospel-Ministry
is alter'd into a secular Grandour, more by far, resembling the Princes
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than the Apostles of our <hi>Meek and Lowly Jesus, who came
not to be ministred to, but to Minister.</hi> Now the best of things once dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat
become most noxious; what can therefore be expected from such
but that they should suit their Government and Policy, change the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a Gospel-Ministry for that of Pomp and Secularity, grow intirely
Carnal, and so become the source of Prophanity in stead of Holiness?</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is evident and clear to the more thinking and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
part of the Christian World, how <hi>Rome</hi>'s
Advocats, while they Agent her Cause from the
truly Canonical Writings of the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
after some few struglings, sorry evasions
and feeble resistance, are compell'd to give back,
and, in reality, abandon their Posts: but were they
permitted to use Apocryphal Writings, which,
they say are Ancient enough, and written not long
after the Holy Scriptures; were not these also pull'd out of their hands
by demonstrating the spuriousness thereof; they should perhaps make
a greater appearance, and keep the fields somewhat longer.</p>
                  <p>The same also is the fate of other Hierarchicks pleading the Cause of
<hi>Episcopacy:</hi> for while they manage it from Scripture-grounds, you may
perceive them to make so wide and incoherent Deductions, so slender
and pitifull Defences, so wild and unbottom'd Distinctions, as loudly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94326:69"/>
proclaim that, except they procure Auxuliaries from some other where,
they must also defert their Cause, and leave the Field to their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
But let them descend somewhat lower to <hi>Ecclesiastick Antiquities,</hi>
we shall find their confidence stronger: for they then bring a multitude
of great Names, as so many arm'd Champions marshell'd in Rank and
Order. Among these there be some, wherewith, as with so many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants,
they threaten to make vast lanes among their Adversaries:
but there's no great cause of terror; for if they be but boldly confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
we shall then find them either, like these Elephants <hi>Ctesias</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
fable to have been us'd by their fictitious <hi>Semiramis,</hi> deceitfull Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and hobgoblings to strike a vain fear in their Enemies: or like the
<hi>African</hi> Elephants in <hi>Polybius,</hi> which, in stead of destroying the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Party, frequently turn'd back, dissipated and overthrew these who
brought them to the Battel. The greatest of these, and whom they with
most confidence produce, is their Epistolick <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who is to them as
one of the <hi>Hee-goats and Rams before the Flock,</hi> of whom they boast as if
nothing should stand before him. It shall not therefore be amiss if (as we
promis'd) we look more narrowly into this their bold Assertion, and
examine if their Grounds be equal to their Confidence.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. Eccles. Lib. 3. Cap. 36.</note> relates, was a Bishop or Pastor of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
and being brought to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
laid down his Life for the Cause of Christianity. He is said to
have written in his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> several Epistles, <hi>viz.</hi> To the <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi>
to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> to the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> to the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians,</hi>
to the <hi>Trallians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> all which are either mention'd
or cited by <hi>Eusebius.</hi> There are other Epistles also by Writers of a
much later date, ascribed to <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but in the first seven only do our
Adversaries place the weight of their Cause; and therefore with them
alone we shall be concerned.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Of these Epistles in the former Century, first in Latine and
then in Greek, appeared at the first but two or three only; afterward
they amounted to fifteen, all which they Father'd upon <hi>Ignatius:</hi> these
were greedily hugg'd by the Romanists; and reason they had so to do,
most of these Epistles being fraughted with stuff that savour'd of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Innovations, and proclaim'd them several Centuries posteriour to
<hi>Ignatius</hi> his Age, and accordingly these Editions were scarce born while
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94326:69"/>
they were condemn'd and stigmatiz'd by the most learn'd of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
viz. <hi>Calvin,</hi> the <hi>Magdeburgick Centuriators,</hi> and afterwards by
<hi>Whittaker, Perkins, Scultet, Rivet,</hi> and others, as the issue of a quite
other Parent than him of whom they boasted.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. Notwithstanding hereof the Advocats for Prelacy, such as
<hi>Whitgift, Bilson, Dounam, Heylyn, Taylor</hi> and the rest of the Party, lean'd
on these Epistles as firm propes of their Caufe, giving severals of 'em
the Epithets of <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> without the least exception. Thus,
for a long time, were these Epistles condemn'd by many, yet applauded
by a few.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. But at length the most learn'd and famous Dr. <hi>Vshher</hi> lighted
on two Latine Manuscripts, much differing from the former Editions,
and containing many passages cited by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that were wanting
in the former. And soon after <hi>Isaacus Vossius</hi> produc'd a Greek Coppy
out of the Duke of <hi>Tuscanie</hi>'s Library, in many things agreeing with
<hi>Vsher</hi>'s Manuscripts. These Coppies bred a wonderfull confidence in
the minds of the Episcopal Party: after which every one of them gave
his loud <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and therewith pleas'd themselves, as if the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<hi>concerning Prelacy</hi> had been already determin'd by a <hi>Divine Oracle.</hi>
But in the mean while, and by this very Action of imbracing and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
this new Edition, as the only genuine Coppy of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> They
publish'd to the World that they had all along (while in conjunction
with Romanists and in opposition to Protestants they so passionatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn'd
the former Editions) either been lamentably shallow in their
knowledge of <hi>Ecclesiastick Antiquity,</hi> notwithstanding their great boast
thereof, as if all Men beside were Dwerfs herein: or, which is little
better, exceedingly partial in favours of their Cause and Interest. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
maugre all such Impeachments, they alter their Judgements as
they see fit, reject what they had but the other day warmly hugg'd, and
applaud their new <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 6. Yet also they were their alone herein: for the most learn'd,
and these of the reform'd Churches who were most able to give Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning such Controversies, as <hi>Blondel, Salmasius</hi> and others
continu'd in their former Sentiment, believing that these new Copies
did as really ly under just suspicion as the Old. After divers Re-encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
amongst learn'd Men concerning these Epistles, <hi>Dallaeus</hi> a learn'd
<hi>French Minister</hi> wrote more largely and directly to evince them spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94326:70"/>
but was oppos'd by Dr. <hi>Beverige,</hi> and <hi>D. Pearson</hi> who wrote his
<hi>Vindiciae Ignatianae,</hi> a large and laborious Work, to prove that these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were the genuine product of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in which his Party triumphed
not a little, apprehending that this Matter was decided; so as there was
no more Dispute or Opposition to be feared. But 'twas not long till
<hi>Daill</hi>'s Defence was undertaken by <hi>Monsieur L'arroque</hi> another learn'd
Pastor of the <hi>French</hi> Church: and being again oppos'd by <hi>Pearson</hi> and
<hi>Beverge,</hi> wrote a second time concerning the same Subject.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. But such Arts were us'd as suppress'd and stiffl'd the Work of
this learn'd Author: of which Book <hi>L'arroque</hi>'s Son, in his Life, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd

Observations on</hi> Pearson's vindiciae Ignatianae, <hi>and</hi> Beverige'<hi>s Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which came to the light by this occasion:</hi> John Daille <hi>being departed this
Life, two great Englishmen who had procur'd to themselves a perpetual Fame,
of whom the one lately deceas'd, had the Name of the Bishop of</hi> Chester, <hi>the
other was adorn'd with the Title of</hi> Dr. <hi>but deserv'd a greater Dignity, explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what</hi> Daille <hi>had written concerning</hi> Ignatius <hi>his Epistles. But</hi> L'arroque
<hi>in favours of his deceas'd Friend, undertook the Patrociny of this</hi> Hero; <hi>and
except Fame be altogether false, has fortunatly defended his Judgement. These
Observations were again assaulted by the famous</hi> Beverige, <hi>to whom our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
preparing an Answer, which we have by us, almost perfected, <hi>thro' the
Importunity of some Friends</hi> was suddenly turn'd another way. This
he did the more willingly, both because he had done enough in favours of his dead
Friend, and also that he might make it appear, that seeing while he was yet fresh,
he sounded a retreat, he had unwillingly entred the Lists with the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</hi>
Thus he, and who these Friends were, we are inform'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Author, a Man of the Episcopal Perswasion, and therefore may the
better be believ'd in this Matter, <hi>viz. Jos. Walker</hi> Translator of <hi>L'arroque</hi>'s
History of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> who, describing the Life of <hi>L'arroque,</hi> which he
prefixes to his Translation, tells us, <hi>that at the request of some Persons <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Episcopacy,</hi> he did not finish this his second Piece.</hi> From these
Authors it's sufficiently evident, that the issue of this Debate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, was neither advantagious nor honourable to the
Favourers of Episcopacy; seeing by such doings they acknowledg'd
their Adversary so formidable that, except by powerfull Sollicitations

that no chaff hath been thrown into, and hudl'd amongst the grains of

they acquiesce in his Judgement, and herein join with their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

who still appeal to <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Bar. But I shall not rest in Denials,

whether of the Elder or Later Editions, are not throughly
genuine, nor so free of Forgeries, that no Chaff hath been thrown into
and hudl'd amongst the grains of Wheat that may remain therein. As
the Writings pretended to come nearest in time to the Scriptures of the

makes manifest. And herein Divine Providence is to be ador'd, and
extoll'd. For had such Writings as plead for the first place after these
of either Old or New Testament, not under-ly'n such impeachments,
the great proximity thereof to the Prophetick and Apostolick Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
had certainly allur'd many to take these for Canonical; whereas
now they serve, in some measure, for a rampier and hedge about the
Holy Scriptures: and by the manifest corruption of the Apocryphal
Writings, we are taught to distinguish betwixt divine and humane Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:

                  <p>But I'm weary, and did never translate more of any Author with less
delight, or pleasure; not because I'm in the least gravell'd by what is
here said concerning Bishops, altho' the whole strength, of what the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopals</hi>
deduce from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> be wrapt up in these Passages, yea I'm
perswaded, that from these very Places the Hierarchy's wounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the fifth Rib. But because the most part of what we have quoted,
as also no small part of what is behind, is altogether insulfe, putide, and
more tasteless than the white of an Egg: and the Reader may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by these Examples that the Spirit and genius of this Author is
quite different from what can be looked for in <hi>Ignatius</hi> a prime <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
of the primitive Church. In all these Epistles 'tis clear as the Noon-sun,
that a head-strong Passion, and a furious Zeal of enslaving all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
under an illimited and blind Obedience to all Church-men, as so
many <hi>Romish Holinesses</hi> did intirely possess, and reign in the Author of
these Epistles. The Apostle indeed sometimes admonishes the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Duties and Esteem, Christians should pay to Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
but withall uses but rarely to handle that Subject, and with the
brevity and modesty that became him, ascribing to them only the Titles
of <hi>Watch-men,</hi> and <hi>Labourers, Bishops</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> and the like, which best
became the simplicity of the Gospel; whereas on the other hand, the
pretended <hi>Ignatius</hi> so far swerves from this humble and Apostolick
strain, that none, tho' they search the Writings of the most corrupt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
shall be able to find any that in exaltation of the Clergy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
and subjecting of the Laity out did him. How secure should
<hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> two <hi>Spanish</hi> laps'd Bishops, have been, had their
Flocks believed this <hi>Ignatian</hi> Doctrine, who having consulted <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">Tom. 1. Ep. 68.</note> 
                     <hi>If they might not desert these and chuse new Bishops, were by him resolved
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94326:73"/>
in the affirmative, and admonish'd to chuse other Pastors:</hi> but had they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
this pretended <hi>Ignatius,</hi> it had been with them the blackest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
to have separated from their Bishop, or attempted so to do on
whatsoever account.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles frequently both to Pastors and Churches inculcat the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
perusal and understanding of the Holy Scriptures as a special Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that by them as a sure Rule all Mens Doctrines and Injunctions
(without any exception) may be tryed: but in liew hereof, this their
<hi>Ignatius</hi> has only Mens Persons in admiration, perpetually deafening
his Hearers, or at least wearying his Readers with Injunctions of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and blind Obedience, as if all and every one of his Bishops Dictats
were to be receiv'd without the least Examination, a Priviledge that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Christ and his Apostles (tho' they might have done it) never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to themselues; but still remitted their Hearers to the Scriptures
for the tryal thereof: this cann't but in the estimat of all the judicious,
be a Fault altogether unworthy of the True <hi>Ignatius.</hi> I hope that all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Men shall give more Charity to this choice Martyr, than to believe
that he's guilty of so gross Idolatry (for I can call it no better) and
fantastick and impious doting on the person of any Man whatsoever:
in which unworthy Work this Author (I will not say <hi>Ignatius</hi>) spends
no smal part of these Epistles. Therefore, altho' the asserting of all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be genuine, be so far from assisting our Adversaries, that their Cause
is, by the very Passages they alledge for its confirmation, mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
I can never perswade my self, but they have fall'n into the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hands of Forgers who, tainted with the common Vice of the Ages
subsequent to that of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> foisted in a great many Passages wherein
nothing but the illimited Power of all Church-men is depredicated, and
the blind Obedience of the Laity is enjoin'd and commended.</p>
                  <p>I'm confirmed in my sentiment by <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
who certainly had as truly a Bishop as the <hi>Smyrneans, Magnesians,</hi> or any
other saluted by <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but of the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> or of the Honour and
Obedience due to him in all this Epistle we find not a syllable. Certainly
had this servile Obedience to the Clergy been such a fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Christian Religion, as all along through these other six Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
he makes it, he had not failed to have inform'd the Romans there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
seeing nothing (I believe) can be alledg'd to exime the Romans,
more than other Churches, from paying such Honour to their Clergy.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94326:73"/>
'Tis vain to repone that he was then on his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was
shortly to see that Church, and might on this account forbear: seeing
they may after this manner of arguing prove the whole Epistle spurious,
or at least superfluous; this Duty of Obedience to Church-men, if we
believe these six Epistles being so necessary a part of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that 'tis never to be forgotten, but at all times with the greatest
zeal and fervency to be inculcated.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Yet in defence of all these most dangerous Injunctions of his
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> saith<note n="s" place="bottom">Vind. Ignat. Part. 2. Page 220.</note> 
                     <hi>That there could be no fitter remedy against
Heresies then that the Churches should adhere to the Pastors whom</hi> Ignatius
<hi>knew to be Orthodox.</hi> But such an adherence as these Epistles every where
command, is so far from being a Remedy against Heresies and Schisms,
that, as the sad instance of the Romanists witness, it has been the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Augmentation, and the most deadly humour in all the Disease. But
why did he not acquaint the <hi>Romans</hi> with this Remedy? Did he suspect
their Bishop as unsound? Or thought he that every <hi>Roman</hi> Christian
was above danger and infallible? And indeed the scarce paralellable
extolling of Church-men through all the former six Epistles, &amp; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
silence thereof in that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> loudly proclaim, that either
they were write by different Authors, or else, that they have undergone
no few Additions and Corruptions, which his Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> had
escaped, seeing, I think they will scarce adventure to say that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Romans</hi> sometime had in it such Injunctions of Obedience to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, which by some chance or other were afterward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. Again, what can we make of that proud boasting in his Epistle
to the <hi>Trallesians,</hi> as if he had been the only Muster-Master to the <hi>Angels.</hi>
But <hi>Pearson</hi> tells us<note n="t" place="bottom">Vind. Ignat. Part. 2 Pages 140, 141. <hi>Quasi vero Christiano Viro, &amp; quidem Episcopo, &amp; ab Apostolis edocto nulla su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to <hi>Paul,</hi> seeing it can never be made evident that he either taught
others, or ascribed to himself the knowledge of these <hi>Ignatian</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pseudo-Ignatian</hi>) Mysteries. Altho' therefore we know not the
meaning of these his words, we shall (I believe) incurr little hazard
thereby; and if he knew them himself I shall not debate. Certainly if we
judge of the Author by his Work, we shall have little ground to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that his Judgement was of the greatest reach, for, remove a very
few flowers, this so much celebrated Garden shall be nothing but a den of
weeds: neither can better be expected, <hi>where any intrude into the things
they have not seen,</hi> as the Author of this Passage appears to have done;
boasting of that wherein neither the Pen-men of the Holy Scriptures,
nor the primitive Christians profess'd themselves to be skillfull: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
the Ancients acknowledged that there were, or might be such Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
&amp; Distinctions among Angels, yet who before the Impostour
that borrowed the name of the Areopagite, adventured to profess their
acquaintance with the particulars thereof? But most of all I admire that
he for his purpose alledges <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as if the Mysteries of God were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a convertible term with the Politicks or Tacticks of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
With how much more reason may we understand the Mysteries
mention'd by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> to be these magnifi'd by the Apostle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.
which <hi>without Controversie</hi> are equaly <hi>great</hi> and proffitable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> as to <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> he cites no where, wherfore I cann't so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a judgement concerning him; otherwise 'tseems he may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of a greater measure of knowledge of the Mysteries frequently
spoken off by the Apostle. And withall I observe that Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> still
insinuates and intimates as if <hi>Ignatius</hi> and other primitive Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the Apostles other mysterious Doctrines not to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to writing, different from what is comprehended in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
wherein, notwithstanding the whole Counsel of God is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
which Opinion is much fitter for a Jewish Cabalist or Romish
Traditionary than a Protestant Doctor.</p>

this New Interpreter; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>I am not bound in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All Men in their Disputes and other Discourses about <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
have thus understood the Passage now under Debate. If the ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such knowledge to himself could agree to the genuine <hi>Ignatius</hi>
they disputed much; but that the now disputed Passage really ascribes,
and not denies to <hi>Ignatius</hi> the knowledge of these Heavenly Things, all
except this Interpreter unanimously acknowledge. And this certainly
was the mind of <hi>Isaacus Vossius</hi> who, otherways being a zealous Patron
of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Copy, had in his Notes doubtless taken notice of such a
common mistake, and observ'd the contrariety between the <hi>Cantabrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and <hi>Florentine</hi> Editions. And <hi>Spanhemius</hi> F.<note n="z" place="bottom">Introduct. ad Chron. et Hist. Sac. Pag. 127.</note> always supposes
the sense we plead for of these words of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and on this ground,
notwithstanding what Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> had said, shroudly suspects these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
as forg'd. And <hi>Daille,</hi> yea &amp; even Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> his most learn'd and
vigilant Adversary, always supposed as uncontrovertible, the sense we
now plead for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And reason they had so to do, seeing otherways both sense
and the self consistency of this Passage is lost; he had but just now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat
to himself such a knowledge of Heavenly Things, the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
whereof should be enough to overwhelm and strangle the
Church of the <hi>Trallesians,</hi> and then as a reason or declaration of his great
Knowledge, and to shew how far 'twas out of their reach, advances the
Passage now in hand, whereas this Clause concerning his Bands is only
introduc'd to shew the consistency between outward Troubles and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Furniture. Excellently therefore and most conform to the Greek,
is it rendred in the <hi>Cantabrigian</hi> Copy, <hi>non secundum quodcunque ligatus sum,</hi>
I am not bound in every respect. But were this New Version admitted,
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> while he ascribes so great a knowledge of Heavenly Things to
himself, and presently afterward denies that he knew Heavenly Things,
should, in esteem of all disinterested, compleat a Contradiction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
according to the <hi>Cantabrigian</hi> and our Version of the Passage, the sense
runs natively without the least appearance of any roughness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> I do not remember that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> any where is to be rendred <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho',</hi>
(which is the mind of this Interpreter) I shall not say that foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94326:76"/>
this Passage if truly translated would prove the dead Flee and make
the rest both ill savoured and justly suspected, he willfully perverted it:
I should rather charitably think that out of ignorance, a far more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
weakness, he fell into such an Error.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. And now to proceed, I impeach not these Epistles, of their
frequent mention of Bishops and their Superiority over Presbyters, as
if herein they savoured a <hi>Diocesan Prelacy;</hi> nay I'm so far from this, that
I'm perswaded from the self same places, that according to this Author
a Bishop and a parochial Pastor are reciprocated; and therefore the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Adversaries is overthrown by the very places from which
they labour to establish it. The Grounds on which I accuse these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
are, the Author (not to mention self Contradictions) his affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Humility, hatefull deifing of all Church-men, most unworthy and
parasitick flattering of whomsoever he salutes, and, which is the end
of all, his endeavouring to perswade Christians, that an Autocratorick
Power is to be ascrib'd, and blind Obedience to be pay'd to all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as to so many absolute and unerring Deities. And lastly his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
boasting of his Knowledge of these things wherewith, for ought
we can learn either from Scripture or any Author of Credit, no meer
Man hath been hitherto acquainted. And these Grounds, were there
no others, may suffice at least to evince the Interpolation of the Epistles.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. And how this came to pass is not hard to conceive if we reflect
upon the <hi>genius</hi> of subsequent Ages; the uncontrolled Power and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Veneration of Church-men, the special Fore-runner and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> together with other parts of Superstition, took
special rooting in the third and fourth Centuries. Now, as the Church
like a choice Garden nourish'd many prime and usefull Plants; she had
also most pestilentious and noisome Weeds, Monsters which you can
scarcely name, and not the transported with indignation. These, the
better to promote such Impieties, Father'd the brats of their own Brains
on some choice <hi>Dr,</hi> by whose warmth they might be cherish'd and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
Such Men not only forg'd or (at best) polluted these Epistles,
but also attributed more of the like stuff to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> some whereof are
mention'd by <hi>Daille</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> and others omitted by them, are
remembred by <hi>Socrates,</hi>

                     <hi>was reported to have come from</hi> Ignatius, <hi>which they said he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to him by Queers of Angels that use to descend and sing the Praises of the
holy Trinity.</hi> Add to all, which shakes the very foundation of their Plea,
the incredibleness of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> whether he is said,
after his Condemnation at <hi>Antioch,</hi> to have been sent by <hi>Trajan,</hi> that he
might be thrown to wild Beasts, on the truth of which these Epistles
leaned, still insinuating and presupposing it: But why should <hi>Trajan</hi> be
at pains to have sent him guarded thither? Certainly not <hi>for an intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the People</hi> as the pretended Acts of <hi>Ignatius</hi> affirm. They had
store of Christians of all sizes at <hi>Rome</hi> with the spectacle of whose Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
they might dayly be cloy'd, neither, as some answer, because
he was a famous Christian and Bishop, at whose death the Roman Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
might be terrifi'd, seeing the Emperour might conclude from <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>
his great resolution and boldness which himself had perceived
that he would much animat them. But the perpetual Practice of these
times frees us from further debate herein: I can never find that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
brought Christians from <hi>Asia</hi> or such remote places to be executed
at <hi>Rome,</hi> but still to the nearest seats of Justice, as is clear in <hi>Polycarp</hi> and
other most famous Bishops or Pastors. <hi>And truly</hi> (saith Dr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet

                     <hi>the story of</hi> Ignatius (<hi>as much as it's defended with his Epistles)
doth not seem to be any of the most probable. For wherefore should</hi> Ignatius <hi>of

many and such strange Excursions as he did by the Story, if the Souldiers that
were his Guard wers so cruel to him, as he complains they were? Now all these
uncertain and fabulous Narrations as to Persons then arising from want of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                  <head type="sub">The second Hypothesis, viz. that the Antiquity of the trne
Ignatius could not secure him from all Lapses or Escapes
in Doctrine or serve to Prove that there was no Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in his time.</head>
                  <p>MY second Assertion is, that the Antiquity even of the true <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was not able to secure him from all Lapses and Mistakes, and
that in his time some Churches not only might; but actually were itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after several Novelties. Which Assertion, if once demonstrated,
renders <hi>Ignatius</hi> of little or no use to our Antagonists: their Inference is,
that, if <hi>Ignatius</hi> spoke positively in favours of Episcopacy, and lived in
a closs vicinity to the Apostles, then there's no doubt but the Apostles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
such a Government: which consequence, like the Aples of
<hi>Sodom,</hi> resolves anon into smoake, our Assertion being prov'd; which
I now come to demonstrate. The Apostles of our Lord had not chang'd
their earthly Tabernacle, for that which is not made with hands; when,
to their inexpressible sorrow, they beheld not only particular Persons,
but even the greater part of some Churches, they themselves had either
planted or watered, in stead of Grapes, to bring forth will Grapes, and
in place of being the Repositories of the precious Truths of the Gospel,
become nests and cages of the most abominable Errors. Other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
there were that holding fast the Foundation of the Apostolick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but raising thereupon a structure of the stubble and hay of either
<hi>Judaism</hi> or <hi>Paganism</hi> (in one of which all of them had been educated)
had well nigh made up an Edifice of most Hetrogeneous Materials.
Hence it is that the Apostle is at such pains to Correct them in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
of the Sacrament, in their Superstition concerning Meat and
Drink, and their unwarrantable observation of Times, that wanted all
Divine Sanction.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. But these infallible Guides being at length possessed of their
Master's Joy, Affairs grew yet worse: for then the grand Enemy of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94326:77"/>
Church did in greater abundance; and with more security sow his tares.
Hence it was that not only those, who are justly branded for Arch-He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and Schismaticks; but even those who persisted Orthodox in
the main Principles of Christianity were drawn into, neither few nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Mistakes.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. I'm sure <hi>Papias</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> was a Man, both in respect
of his Antiquity and Authority, among the primitive Christians, little
inferiour to <hi>Ignatius:</hi> 'twas he notwithstanding who either greedily
imbrac'd, or first of all hatch'd the gross Fancy of the Saints their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Kingdom for a thousand years after the Resurrection. <hi>Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>

                     </note> speaking of <hi>Papias) the same Writer alledges
something as from unwritten Tradition,</hi> viz. <hi>some strange Parables and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of our Saviour, and some other fabulous things; and, amongst the rest,
he saith that after the Resurrection, there shall be a thousand years, wherein
Christ shall reign on Earth bodily. But to me he seems through misunderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Apostle's Discourse, to have taken what was spoken mysteriously, in
a quite other sense from its true meaning. For he was os a very weak Judgement;
as his Writings sufficiently declare. He was notwithstanding the Author of
this Opinion to the most part of the following Ecclesiastical Writers, for they
look'd only to his Antiquity as</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>and whosoever else favoured his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
We see here a Man of no little Antiquity and Repute drawing the
greatest Lights of the Church, and consequently the rest of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to a Doctrine destitute of all countenance from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. Another Conceit no less Ancient but more wild, was that of the
<hi>Angels their carnal Knowledge of Women.</hi> This was hugg'd by <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">Apolog. ad Senatum. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> who lived in the same Century with, yea, and not many
years after <hi>Ignatius. The Angels</hi> (saith he) <hi>transgressing their Order,
by carnal Copulation with Women, fell from their primitive State, aud begot
Children who are now called Devils.</hi> He was follow'd notwithstanding by
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> &amp; <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> the most famous Writers of their Age; as also the
stream of these that flourished in the succeeding Centuries, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> also
with a great many others held, that the beatifick Vision is not enjoy'd
untill the day of Judgement. Now beyond peradventure such Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94326:78"/>
as these, had the most part of the Churches at that time for their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
and Followers in these Opinions.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. And seeing both such Pillars, and the rest that lean'd on them
were ready to swerve in Matters of Speculation, or Opinion, they were
no less capable of straying in things belonging to Practice; for there's
no more security promised to the Church from the one than the other.
Neither did the closs Vicinity to the times of the Apostles, preserve the
Churches from evident Lapses of this nature. Was not the mixing of
the Sacramental Wine with water, a matter of Practice, and altogether
destitute of warrand from Scripture, in which we hear of nothing but
the Fruit of the Vine drunken by Communicants. And yet <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi>

the Controversies first arose between <hi>Polycarp</hi>

the Authority of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> for the quite contrary Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I have oftentimes much admir'd how either of these Parties, if we
consider either Sincerity, or Vicinity to the Apostles, were liable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mistake of this kind; I believe scarce any Man now living shall be
able to give any rational account of the Cause thereof; yet that one of
them was mistaken, and that the Apostles did not keep up a perpetual
observation of contrary Practices one to another, is to me, and to as
many as truly acknowledge the Scriptures, among the things of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
certainty; and if either of them strayed, if sufficiently serves our
turn, and is an ocular Demonstration that not only the clearest Lights,
and nearest to the Apostles might relinguish some part of the Apostolick
Purity, and fall into Rites and Customes never countenanced by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;
but also be accompanied by no small part of the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:94326:78"/>
§. 7. Yea I dare avouch and sustain, that both Parties equally swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Truth, seeing both of them had equal Means to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
themselves, and were alike nigh to the Apostles; so that many
were certainly alive of both Parties who had been conversant with them:
hence there's no reason to believe either of the Parties, that ever the
Apostle enjoined or allowed the observation of Anniversary, weekly or
monthly times either in the same time with, or so near to the Judaical,
(and then buried) Ceremonies; excepting the Sabbath only, the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
whereof had been expresly enjoin'd in a clear and Moral Precept.
Neither, in this Assertion, shall we remain alone, but be supported by the
suffrages, of the choicest of the Ancients. No less <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timats,

the keeping of</hi> Easter <hi>and such Holy Days were altogether Legal, the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof is not at all injoin'd in the Gospel: for</hi> (continues Socrates) <hi>they
did not consider that, after the Jewish Religion was changed into that of the Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the strick observation of</hi> Moses <hi>Law, and the shaddows of future things
were wholly abolished, which by a most sure proof may be thus evinced. For by
no Law of Christ is it granted to Christians to observe Jewish Customes; yea the
Apostle did expresly forbid it, not only rejecting Circumcision; but admonishing
moreover that about Feast Days there should be no Contention, wherefore in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the</hi> Galatians <hi>he thus speaks,</hi> tell me ye who desire to be under the
Law, do ye not hear the Law? <hi>And after he had discoursed a little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Matters, he shews the Jews to be under Bondage, but that those who
had followed Christ Jesus were called unto Liberty: he Exhorts furthermore that
Days, Months or Years, in no ways be observed. Moreover, writing to the</hi>
Collossians, <hi>he clearly asserts that such observations are but a meer Shaddow.</hi>
Wherefore, <hi>saith the Apostle,</hi> let no Man judge you in Meat or Drink, or
in respect of an Holy Day, of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath days,
which are a shaddow of things to come. <hi>But in the Epistle to the</hi> Hebrews,

                     <hi>confirming the same matter he thus speaks.</hi> For the Priesthood being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there is also a necessity of the change of the Law: <hi>surely the Apostles
and the Evangelists did never impose a Yoak upon these that became obedient to
the Doctrine of Faith, but</hi> Easter <hi>and other days were left to the choise and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of those who in such days had received the Benefits: wherefore, seeing
Men love Holy Days, because they bring them some respite of their Labours,
divers Men in divers places following their particular Inclinations, did, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to certain Custome, celebrate the memory of our Saviour's Passions: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Saviour, nor his Apostles did by any Law ordain that it should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
neither did the Gospels nor the Apostles threaten us with a Mulct, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
or Curse, as the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>was wont to do to the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This and much more are we taught by <hi>Socrates;</hi> from all which it's
most clear that in this Dispute concerning the Celebration of <hi>Easter,</hi>
both Parties were equally culpable, as building upon a false Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Christ and his Apostles had appointed some of these Days
anniversarily to be kept, which yet never came into their mind And
here 'tis most observable how, even in these ost early times they heap'd
Falshood upon Falshood and supported one Forgery with another: the
Fable of <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Rome</hi> and conjuring of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> there, was
even <hi>then</hi> beginning to obtain; whereof the <hi>Romans</hi> made their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and began to ascribe to him some Head-ship over the rest; and
then averred that he had appointed them, not only to celebrate <hi>Easter,</hi>
but also had determin'd the particular day of its Celebration, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd
them to keep it on the fifteenth and not on the fourteenth day of
the Moneth as did the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches: Now that they might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and meet with them after their own Fashion and
arts, the <hi>Asians</hi> invented the like Legends of the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> who,
as they alledged, died at <hi>Ephesus</hi> and enjoyn'd them to keep <hi>Easter,</hi> but
by no means on the fifteenth but on the fourteenth day of the Moneth,
and the better to set off the Fable, <hi>Polycrates</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in his Letter to
<hi>Victor,</hi> harangues in the Praises of <hi>John,</hi> that thereby he might prefer
him to <hi>Peter,</hi> and sticks not to assert <hi>that</hi> John <hi>was a Priest, and wore a
High-Priests Golden Crown or Breast-plate</hi>

who from the time of Christ even unto our Age is sirnamed</hi> Just, <hi>for there
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94326:80"/>
were many others of that Name beside, but as for him he was sanctifi'd from the
Womb, neither did he ever drink Wine or strong Drink, and did altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from the Flesh of any living Creature, neither ever came there a Razour on
his Head, nor did he ever use to anoint or wash, and he only of all Men had free
liberty to enter into the innermost Sanctuary of the Temple; for he was not wont to
wear a woollen but a linnen Garment: he used to enter alone into the Temple, and
with bended knees to pray for the People.</hi> And in the sequel of this discourse
he tells us, <hi>that in the Martyrdome of this</hi> James, <hi>he was both thrown from
the pinacle of the Temple, and also beaten to Death with a Fuller's Club: a certain

Relation of <hi>Hegesippus</hi> is not only contrare the Holy Scripture, where

                  <p>§. 9. But of this enough, and indeed with me it had been highly
Sacrilegious to have said so much, but buried in a perpetual silence the
Escapes of these whose memory is otherways to me more precious than
the ashes of <hi>Mausolus</hi> to his <hi>Artemisia;</hi> and in fragrancy far surpassing
the choicest of Oriental Spices; did not the injustice and importunity
of these who prefer the Escapes, yea and Extravagancies of Men, and
the blemishes of these great Lights, yet but terrene Lights, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
Beams of the Father of all Lights, compell me hereto. And
herein I'm a true Son of the primitive Church, whose Doctors have
taught me, that when the Dictats of God and these of Men, whosoever
they be, interfer, and thro' humane Corruption are set in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I ought to hold to the first; and in comparison herewith, despise
the latter.</p>
                  <p>§. 10. Add hereto, that seeing <hi>Antichristianism</hi> the Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94326:80"/>
was working even in the Apostles days, seeing this Defection was
mysteriously promoted, and seeing, as experience hath proved, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at its hight, and <hi>Antichrist</hi> was brought to his Throne by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
elevation of Clergy-men, it's much less to be wondred at, if
the most frequent Escapes and Lapses of the Primitive, and otherways
<hi>Orthodox, Fathers</hi> chanced to be of this nature, and tend to the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an unwarrantable Supremacy and Dignity, which only these, who
were of such Repute in the Church were capable to effect. And in all
this I have said nothing but what has been asserted by the most approved
Divines especially in their Writings against the Romanists. Yea the most
judicious &amp; learned Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>

<hi>whether the Ecclesiastical Government could be changed from Parity to Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(as is pretended) in those early Ages of the Church, especially since some

must needs be acknowledged Apostolical.</hi> I therefore turn my Assertion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Conclusion, and from what is said with confidence Inferr, that the
Antiquity even of the true <hi>Ignatius</hi> was not able to secure him from all
Lapses and Mistakes, and that in his time some Churches, not only
might, but actually were itching after several Novelties.</p>

                  <p>I Now come to the third Hypothesis, and assert that <hi>Ignatius</hi> is not so
clear and positive in the Matter of Episcopacy, as to denude Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians

For all he speaks of <hi>Presbyters</hi> as distinguished from <hi>Bishops</hi> may
well be mean'd of these who are call'd <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> and that there was
such an Office in the primitive Church is made evident by what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
brought from <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Optatus,</hi> the <hi>African Code,</hi> and
<hi>Augustine,</hi> frequently distinguishing them from preaching Presbyters.
And <hi>Purpurius</hi> expresly terms them <hi>Ecclesiasticos Viros, Ecclesiastick Men:</hi>
In vain therefore object <hi>Petavius</hi> and others that these were only Church-Wardens
not properly Ecclesiasticks. And indeed the Ancients not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell us there was such an Office, but also plainly assert that, through
pride and haughtiness of the Church Doctors, this Custom was abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or rather <hi>Hilary</hi> sufficiently witnesses. <hi>The Synagogue</hi>
(saith he<note n="a" place="bottom">Com. In. Ep. prior. ad Tim. Cap. 5. <hi>Vnde &amp; Synagoga &amp; postea Ecclesia seniores habuit quorum sine Consilio nihil agebatur in Ecclesia.

I know not, except perchance it were through the sloth, or rather the pride

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. Doctor <hi>Field</hi> tells us<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Field</hi> on the Church. Book 5. Cap. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>That these were not Lay-Elders.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as they themselves well know, do we so term them: but did as
the Ancients reckon them among the Ecclesiasticks.</p>
                  <p>And we assert, that these very <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> (as he calls them) are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94326:81"/>
by <hi>Hilary.</hi> For first, this Practice of the Christian Church is by
<hi>Hilary</hi> deduced from the Synagogue, wherein there were Elders distinct
from the <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Pastors. Secondly,</hi> He attributes to the <hi>Elders,</hi> as
their Office, only the Power of Consulting and Deciding, as being As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
to the Doctors in the management of Church-Affairs, without
intimating ought of their Power to dispense the Word and Sacraments.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> He expresly distinguishes them from all Doctors or Teachers of
the Church, and therefore excludes them from all Power of Preaching,
or Administration of the Sacraments. But Doctor <hi>Field</hi> saith that, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
by the name of Teachers, whose sloth and pride he condemneth in this place,
might fitly understand the Bishop, seeing none but Bishops have Power to preach
in their own Right, and others but only by Permission from them.</hi> But this
Answer supposes that the time was when <hi>Bishop, Teacher</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi>
were reciprocal Terms, and that whoever had the Charge of never so
small a Flock was the Bishop thereof: for who can believe, that ever
any receiv'd the Charge of a Flock, to whom he was only to preach,
and dispense the Sacraments as a Journey-man to another? <hi>Lastly,</hi> When
<hi>Hilary</hi> speaks in the preterit Tense that the Church had such, tells that
their Office consisted in being Assessors to the Teachers, and says that
the use of these was laid aside, he clearly intimats that the Elders he
speaks of, were well nigh abolished, and then scarce in Being Which by
no means can be said of the preaching Presbyters. For let Bishops be
not only as proud as Dr. <hi>Field</hi> would have them, but even as <hi>Lucifer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet most certain it is that long after <hi>Hilarie</hi>'s time, the Bishops in
all weighty Affairs used, at least, to consult the Presbyters, and that
both then and still afterward, preaching Presbyters were existent. But
herein I will not inlarge. See their Glosses of both Scriptures &amp; Fathers,
whereby we vouch this Matter removed, to name no others, by <hi>Dido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavius</hi>

                     </note>, to which I find nothing replyed. This clear Proof that
there were in the primitive Church other Elders, distinct from those
preaching Presbyters, who in the time of the Apostles, not much distant
from that of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> were dignifi'd with the name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us with an Answer sufficient alone to solve whatsoever they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from these Epistles. Their only Argument is that <hi>Ignatius</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
between <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> why then by Bishop may we not
understand a Pastor of one Congregation, and under the name of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Ruling Elder? They can only repone that <hi>Ignatius</hi> mentions but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94326:82"/>
one Bishop of any City he wrote to, which yet required more than one
Pastor. But one Man may be called the Bishop or Pastor of such a place,
altho' he be placed in a Colledge; where a Plurality equally participats
of the pastoral Charge and Honour: and that this Answer may please
them the better, I shall give them <hi>Ignatius</hi> for my Patron herein; who,

Add to all this, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> every where in these Epistles, speaks to,
and of the Bishop; as a correlative of, and with respect unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Flock, and not Presbyters or inferiour Pastors, as the proper
Object of his Episcopal Office. Seeing then all the Pastors of any
Church he writes to, might equally be term'd Bishop or Pastor of such a
place; seeing whatsoever he saith to or of Bishops, hath a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Flock or People; and seeing, finally, so many things
spoken by <hi>Ignatius</hi> of these Bishops, can agree only to Congregational
Pastors; I conclude, that by these <hi>Ignatian Bishops,</hi> not Diocesan Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats,
but Pastors of particular Flocks, not only may but of necessity must
be understood. And it's further observable that Preaching, Visiting of
particular Persons and the rest of the Pastoral Work is either injoin'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or clearly intimated to belong to the Bishop only, but nothing to
the Presbyters, save sitting in Council with him. Now if our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
insist on their contrary Argument from the largeness of the Cities,
and from this that <hi>Ignatius</hi> still speaks but of one Bishop therein, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94326:83"/>
hence conclude that he must be Diocesan; the result of all must be a
sharper Conflict between <hi>Ignatius</hi> and himself, and so a fuller proof of
the spuriousness of these Epistles, it being evident from what is adduc'd
that this Bishop was only a Pastor of a single Congregation, yea so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that it hath puzl'd the learn'dest of our Opposites.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. Of this mind is <hi>Joseph Mede.</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Proof for Churches in the second Century. Pages 28, 29.</note> For speaking of these Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian
Epistles, <hi>It should seem</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in these first times before</hi>
Dioceses <hi>were divided into those lesser and subordinate Churches, we now call</hi>
Parishes, <hi>and Presbyters assigned to them) they had not only</hi> one Altar <hi>in</hi> one
<hi>Church, or</hi> Dominicum, <hi>but</hi> one Altar <hi>to a Church, taking</hi> Church <hi>for the
Company or Corporation of the Faithfull, united under one Bishop or Pastor;
and that was in the City and Place where the Bishop had his See and Residence:
like as the</hi> Jews <hi>had but one Altar and one Temple for the whole Nation united
under one High-Priest. And yet, as the</hi> Jews <hi>had their Synagogues, so perhaps
might they have more Oratories than one, tho' their</hi> Altar <hi>were but one; there
namely where the Bishop was. On Sunday (saith</hi> Justin Martyr) <hi>all that
live in Towns or in the Country meet together in one Place; namely, as he there
tells us, to celebrate and participate the Holy</hi> Eucharist. <hi>Why was this, but
because they had not many places to celebrate in? And unless this were so,
whence came it else that a schismatical Bishop was said to set up another Altar;
and that a Bishop and an Altar are made Correlatives? See St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>Ep.</hi>
40. 72. 73. <hi>Et de unitate Ecclesiae. And thus perhaps is</hi> Ignatius <hi>also to be
understood in that forequoted Passage of his,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where 'tis
clear that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> well perceived the thing we now plead for in <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi>
viz. that this Bishop was only the Pastor of a single Flock. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
fear to offend his Friends, or something else, made him say so
little as he could, and something that he ought not to have said while he
would parallel this Altar with that of the <hi>Jews:</hi> yet he's express enough
that all subject to the Bishop met in one place for Participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and consequently for hearing of the Word; and moreover
really acknowledgeth that Dioceses then were only what Parishes are
now, and if so, tho' they had other Oratories 'tis nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of our Opposits, which yet his (<hi>perhaps</hi>) proves him afraid to assert.
For he knew well enough, that, seeing, as he grants, all under his
Charge took their Communion with the Bishop at his Church, which,
as every one knows, was then Celebrated (at least) every Lord's day,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94326:83"/>
any other Oratories for publick Worship had been altogether unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
with which superfluities the Church in these early and tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
days was not at all acquainted. In vain therefore Dr. <hi>Maurice,</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">Defence of Diocesan Episcopacy. Pag. 37. and 38.</note> that he may at once abuse both <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> tells us <hi>that</hi>
Altar <hi>in the primitive sense signified not only the Communion Table but the whole
Place where the Chair of the Bishop and the Seats of the Presbyters were placed:
and in this sense there was but one Altar in one Diocess, as there is now but one
Consistory, as is clear from</hi> Ignatius <hi>and</hi> Usher. <hi>And to be in one Altar,
which is</hi> Ignatius <hi>his Phrase is only to be in Communion with the Bishop.</hi> And
this Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> would have to be <hi>Mede</hi>'s meaning thereof. But
the falshood of this is not only evident from <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who all along (as
we have seen) reciprocats his <hi>Bishop</hi> with the Pastor of a particular
Flock, but also from <hi>Mede</hi>'s express words, as we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from them. I pass as scarce good sense Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>that</hi> Altar <hi>not only signified the Communion Table, but the whole place of the
Bishop's Chair &amp;c.</hi> The Dispute not being what place or thing in a
Church, <hi>Altar</hi> signifi'd, but if thereby in <hi>Ignatius</hi> one or more places
for publick Worship be meaned: yea this my sense of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Doctor
<hi>Wake</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="bottom">Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Epistles of the Apostolick Fathers. Pages 183, 184.</note> seems to grant, while he says, speaking of these <hi>Ignatian</hi>
times, <hi>that none officiated but either the Bishop himself or he who was appointed
or allow'd by him, and that they had in every such Place of their Assembling, one
Table, or Altar at which they performed this Service.</hi> We have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<hi>Mede</hi> rightly observing out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that <hi>the Altar or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table was</hi> (only) <hi>at the Bishop's Residence, and where he offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</hi>
And we see from Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> that in every place of solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they had an Altar or Communion Table. The Conclusion then is,
which we also already heard <hi>Mede</hi> acknowledging, that there were then
no fewer Bishops than Places of publick Worship, which is the Truth,
and what we conclude from <hi>Ignatius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to these add the words of one who is neither unskillfull in these
Matters, nor yet Partial in favours of Presbytry. <hi>In the beginning</hi> (saith
he<note n="o" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> on the 1. and 2. of the Apost. can. Page 51.</note>) <hi>the Bishops whole Charge was called</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and by the strain of</hi>
Ignatius <hi>his Epistles, especially that to</hi> Smyrna, <hi>it would appear, that there was
but one Church, at least but one Place, where there was one Altar and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in each of these Parishes, for he saith, there was one Bishop, one Church and one
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94326:84"/>
Altar.</hi> And now judge of the symphony of this Assertion, with the
Principles of the Author, or how he could averr<note n="p" place="bottom">Confer. Page 314.</note> 
                     <hi>that if these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
be Genuine the Cause of Presbytry will be undone.</hi> But of all things most
strange and unaccountable is Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi>'s Conduct in the Dispute, who
with indefatigable pains and vast learning wrote his Defence of <hi>Ignatius</hi>
to the end (as he pretends) he might well nigh infallibly establish a
Diocesan Bishop; and yet has proved so far from hitting the white at
which he ultimately levell'd, that on supposition of the sufficiency of his
<hi>Vindiciae,</hi> he most sufficiently demonstrats the Identity of Bishop and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Pastor during the time of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and thus inavoidably ruines
what he most earnestly intended to repair. And now behold the vast
Fabrick and Engine wherewith they threaten the utter Ruine of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
turning upon and shattering to pieces their Dio cesan Hierarchy.

                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Pages 106. 107.</note> adventures to conclude
<hi>Timothy his being made Bishop of</hi> Ephesus <hi>from Acts</hi> 20. 3, 4, 5. (which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
few, I think, beside the Author can gather) <hi>compared with</hi> 1
<hi>Tim. 1. 3. I besought thee to abide still at</hi> Ephesus—<hi>that thou mightest
charge some that they teach no other Doctrine.</hi> From which even tho' it be
compared with the other Scripture, any Man in his Wit would much
rather, with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> inferr the very contrary, and conclude that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>'s
stay at <hi>Ephesus</hi> was only temporary, to expede the Business there
mention'd but not to fix therein. <hi>But,</hi> saith he<note n="b" place="bottom">Page 108.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 15.
<hi>These things I write unto thee &amp;c. plainly insinuat his particular Relation to
the Church of</hi> Ephesus. But the many Scriptures informing us of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s
almost perpetual absence from <hi>Ephesus;</hi> perswade that there was no
such Relation, neither does this place in the least insinuat it, but only
that <hi>Timothy</hi> if not sent for was to stay till <hi>Paul</hi>'s return, wherefore he
begs the Question while<note n="c" place="bottom">Page 107.</note> he tells us <hi>that after he was in a particular
manner established Bishop of the Church of</hi> Ephesus <hi>he might wait upon</hi> Paul.
Moreover this was an odd Attendance that scarce ever suffer'd <hi>Timothy</hi>
to stay with his Flock, and this shift, too like that of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
who, in Answer to the Argument from Scripture-silence against
<hi>Peter</hi>'s being Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> tell us that he was frequently abroad.
But here we have not only Scripture-silence but Scripture Testimony,
shewing <hi>Timothy</hi>'s almost perpetual absence from <hi>Ephesus.</hi> He essays
also<note n="d" place="bottom">Page 108.</note> to bring <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Episcopal Power and particular Relation
to <hi>Ephesus</hi> from 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 9. 1 Tim. 2. 1. and 1 Tim. 5. 21. And that
this was not temporary or transient, but successive and perpetual,</hi> he would
prove<note n="e" place="bottom">Pages 109.</note> from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. 20. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. and adds that <hi>his
Adversaries grant that the Power he pleads for to Bishops was exercised by</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.
But as for the <hi>particular Relation</hi> he speaks of, he should have
proved it, seeing he knows it will not be granted, except he bring more
than the bare recitall of the places from which his fancy collects it, and
without such a particular Relation the Power <hi>Timothy</hi> exercised, be what
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94326:85"/>
it will, makes nothing for his purpose: seeing it might be lodged in him
alone as an Evangelist, and thus most of his <hi>postulata</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="bottom">Pages 109, 110.</note> prove useless.
Yet I will handle them particularly, of which the first two are, <hi>that the
Power which</hi> Timothy <hi>exercised was in it self lawfull, and that he practised it
in</hi> Ephesus. And 'tis true none denies it, but what then, untill he first
prove <hi>Timothy</hi>'s particular Relation to the Church of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The
third and fourth are, <hi>that it was committed to him alone, and not to a Colledge
of Presbyters acting among themselves in Parity. And that there's no mention
of any spiritual Power lodged in a Colledge of Presbyters to which</hi> Timothy
<hi>was accountable.</hi> But <hi>Willet,</hi> an approved Divine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
shall answer for us; <hi>Neither</hi> (saith he<note n="g" place="bottom">Syn. pap. contr. 5. Quest. 3.</note>) <hi>can it be gathered by
these words of the Apostle,</hi> lay Hands suddenly upon no Man &amp;c. <hi>That</hi>
Timothy <hi>had this sole Power in himself, for the Apostle would not give that to
him which he did not take to himself, who associated unto him the rest of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry
in Ordaining of</hi> Timothy. I add that there's no less mention of <hi>a
spiritual Power in a Colledge of Presbyters &amp;c.</hi> than of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bishop of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Hence his 5. <hi>postulatum</hi> (viz. <hi>That the great and most
eminent Branches of the Episcopal Power were lodged in</hi> Timothy'<hi>s Person, the
ordination of such as were admitted unto the sacred Function, the care of Widows,
the Censuring of Elders, and his autoritative preventing of Heresies</hi>) becomes
unserviceable. His VI is, <hi>that this Authority was not in it self of temporary
duration, transient, or extraordinary, but such as the constant Necessities of the
Church do make necessary in all Ages; for he was commanded to commit it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
faithfull Men, such as should be able to teach others, and if there be nothing
in it extraordinary, why do they say that in the discharging of an ordinary trust,
there was need of an extraordinary Officer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>First</hi> he corrupts the Apostles words 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. substituting (<hi>it</hi>)
in stead of (<hi>them</hi>) that thereby he may force the Text to speak of a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
equal to that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> which was to be derived unto succeeding
Teachers, when yet it plainly speaks of the Transmission of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or things <hi>Timothy</hi> had heard, and others were to teach; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of an equality of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Power <hi>to be derived in solidum</hi> to every
subsequent Bishop or Teacher. Now except this be proved, D.
<hi>M.</hi> saith nothing. Yea <hi>Hammond</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="bottom">
                        <hi>In locum.</hi>
                     </note> expresly contradicts him,
<hi>Appoint them</hi> (saith he) <hi>as Bishops under thee.</hi> Moreover, Christ
committed the things <hi>Paul here speaks of</hi> to his Apostles; yet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94326:85"/>
will <hi>D. M.</hi> say their Power was equall to Christ's?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this his last <hi>postulatum</hi> there appears a strange kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
viz. the Things or Actions wherein <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
are perpetual and ordinary; therefore they were not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Officers: just as if one would Reason: It's ordinary for a skillfull
Physitian to relieve a Febricitant; therefore our Saviour relieving <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Wife's Mother, was no extraordinary Physitian. For their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Way of performing these Actions was extraordinary and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
they having no special Power over, or Relation to, any one
particular Congregation; but such a Power and Relation as equally
were extended over all the places whither they were sent. Moreover
others of their Actions, and these which were properly Evangelistick,
were extraordinary: such as that of Planting the first Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> I appeal to all Protestants, if his ascribing to every Bishop
a <hi>Power of authorative preventing of Heresies (i. e.</hi> a Power of making Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
that lean only on the Bishop's own Will, and which he's not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to prove from Scripture, otherwise every Minister of Christ hath
a Power and Authority, by publick preaching and reasoning from the
Word of God, to prevent and overthrow Heresies: and so D. <hi>M.</hi>
speaks not to the purpose) hath not a rank savour of what is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the grossest of Popery. The Romanists give such an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Power to <hi>one Pope,</hi> but from a perswasion of his Infallibility:
this Author will have it unto every single Bishop, tho', as yet, he has not
adventured to ascribe to each of 'em such a Priviledge, and to explain,
if need were, what he means by this <hi>authoritative preventing of Heresies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. Look but on page 95 <hi>et seq.</hi> and you shall see him make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bishop an Apostle in the strickest sense, and priviledg'd with no less
Power over the Church-Officers and People in his Diocess than an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
ever had or could exercise: viz. <hi>a Power to Govern the Churches, to
give Rules and Directions, to inflict Censures, to communicat his Authority to
others, to hear Complaints, to decide Controversies—to Confer the Holy
Ghost—viz. the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, that must needs attend the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
Ministry of holy Things; and therefore that the Office of an Apostle
is altogether ordinary and permanent. The Apostolical Office</hi> (saith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
essentially no other than this, the ordinary Necessities of the Church require
that it should continue till the second coming of our Saviour. But the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94326:86"/>
Gifts of the Holy Ghost, the Power of Miracles, of Languages—were
only extriasick Advantages,—and not peculiar to the Apostles.</hi> And
to affirm otherwayes; and say that the proper Apostolick Office is now
ceased, he makes proper to <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Socinians.</hi> But so far is
he from speaking Truth here, that the ceasing of the proper Apostolick
Office and Power is asserted by the Body of Protestants, even Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
no less than Presbyterian, in opposition to the Jesuites his Masters,
who, as he doth to his Diocesan Bishop, arrogate an Apostolick
Office and Power to their Pope. <hi>Spanhem</hi> F.<note n="i" place="bottom">Dissert. 3. Numb. 25. Etseq.</note> a fervent Apologist

therein, the Gift of Tongues, and of working Miracles: all which things,

Lot, which was as the immediate Hand of Christ imposed on him that was to be

Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> whose Works are publish'd by Bishop <hi>Tillotson,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

did the Apostles pretend to communicat it. They did indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
standing Pastors and Teachers in each Church; they did assume fellow La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
or Assistents in the Work of Preaching and Governance; but they did
not constitute Apostles, equal to themselves in Authority, Priviledges or Gifts,
for who knoweth not (saith St.</hi> Austine) <hi>that Principate of Apostle-ship to be
preferr'd before any Episcopacy? And the Bishops (saith</hi> Bellarmine) <hi>have
no part of the true Apostolical Authority.</hi> And now judge of the Spirit of
these Men, who are glad most falsly to brand these famous Bishops, and
others the most eminent Doctors of that Perswasion as being guilty of
the most abominable Crime of Socinianism, providing they can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

bespatter and make odious the Presbyterians. Judge also of D.
<hi>M</hi>'s Query<note n="b" place="bottom">Page 158.</note> 
                     <hi>whether the Apostolical Power, as to it's permanent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,

and by them transmitted</hi> in solidum, <hi>as they receiv'd it from our blessed Saviour
to single Successors in particular Sees, and not to a Colledge of Presbytsrs in the
modern Notion?</hi> As to the last part of his Query and his <hi>Presbyters in the
modern Notion,</hi> I know none such if 't be not these of the Hierarchicks
their half Ministers, for which there is no ground in Scripture. And
accordingly it's certain that the Apostles left the managing of the
Church to neither Bishops nor Presbyters in his sense, both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chimera's</hi> but to Colledges of Bishops who are also Presbyters, both
being one in Scripture &amp; during the Apostolick age. But tho' we should
grant them all the Query seeks, supposing, which all the Ancients af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
the equality of all Bishops who, at the beginning, were reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Congregations, he's yet but where he was, and has really done
nothing for the establishing of his Hierarchy. Judge lastly, of that
doughty Argument of the Papists<note n="c" place="bottom">

disingenuous tergiversation and sliding from the Office of the opponent
or probant to that of the defendent, seeing this was one of his special
Scripture-Arguments whereby to establish his Hierarchy; and it's sure
that if <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> might do what they did under another Notion
and Capacity than that of a Diocesan Prelate, his Argument goes to
wrack. As does also his perversion of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 5. for he insinuats that from
<hi>Timothy</hi>'s being injoined to do the Work of an Evangelist, it will no
more follow that he deserved the Name than <hi>Daniel</hi>'s saying <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. 27.
that he did the King's Work, will prove him a King. But had he ever
considered the rest of the Epistle, the context of the place, and the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
and Notation of the Word <hi>Evangelist,</hi> he had clearly seen
that the Apostle so adapts this Work of an Evangelist to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that
the Name and Character properly belongs unto him. He adds<note n="h" place="bottom">Page 112.</note>
                     <hi>That any who now convert</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Pagans <hi>are as properly Evangelists as any

and placed in the very next degree to the Apostles themselves,

                     <note n="k" place="bottom">Page 111.</note> castrat this full and
plain discourse, while he only says <hi>that an Evangelist, in the Notion of</hi> Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
<hi>was a Person that preached the Gospel to those that had not heard of it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
it;</hi> and thus dissembles the whole matter in question which <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
clearly determines.</p>
                  <p>And according to this Relation of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> 2 Timothy 4. 5. he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
to do the Work of an Evangelist, and never made a long stay at
one place for even after the time of his pretended Ordination to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
we find him not rarely with the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> as his Attendant
or Fellow Labourer: which not only his joint Superscriptions to the
second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and these to the <hi>Philippians, Colossians,</hi>
both his Epistles to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon:</hi> but also the long
Journeys and Peregrinations wherein we find <hi>Timothy</hi> still imployed, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably
make manifest: for after he is supposed to have been Bishop
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he was accompanying <hi>Paul</hi> in his Voyages <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 4. and
was with him Prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi> as is probable from <hi>Philippians</hi> 1. and 1.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 23. as also frequently imployed in long Voyages to several
Churches, and that in Businesses which could not be expeded in a day

2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 21. So that if he was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> he will prove a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Patern for non-residence. Most of which things may be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Titus,</hi> whose frequent long Journeys are mentioned by the same
Apostle. Yea they have just as good ground in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. to fix
<hi>Titus</hi> his Episcopal Chair in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which was the Fancy of <hi>Aquinas</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">In locum. Titus <hi>etiam missus ab eo abiit in</hi> Dalmatiam, <hi>ubi finaliter fuisse Episcopus dicitur.</hi>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94326:89"/>
the <hi>Cretians.</hi> And indeed the very Phrase from which they gather the

ground to conclude the contrary: <hi>For this Cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>I left thee

them nothing, but, <hi>e contra,</hi> cut the sinews of their Argument. With

Moderator, which <hi>Beza</hi> holds as defensible, <hi>ridiculous,</hi> which is said
without proof, and tho' it were so, touches not the marrow of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
But they shall find their Foundation yet weaker for such a stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
so soon as they shall with attention read over the contexts of the
place now in Controversie. The seven Stars which are the seven Angels
are said to be held in God's right hand; whereby, without peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is signified the great care our Lord had of the Pastors of these
Flocks, in order to the promoting of the great Gospel-Design, the
gaining of Souls to himself. But Bishops, I mean Diocesans, as such,
and distinct from other Pastors, are not at all Dispensers of the Word
and Sacraments, by whom mostly this Gospel-design is effected.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, how few should they be, to whom this care was extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94326:90"/>
and how small comfort should the bulk of the Labourers in the
Word and Doctrine be able to reap from the Scripture; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
is one of the most refreshing Cordials to the weary and fainting
Labourers of Christ's Vineyard. And if we consult the Epistles to these
Churches, how many things shall we find therein that argue, beyond
scruple, that the Spirit is speaking to the collective Bodies of Church-Officers
and not to one Man only. Shall we believe that for the sin of
one Diocesan Bishop, who, as such, was scarce so much as a Preacher
of the Gospel, all the Candlesticks of the Gospel were to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the whole Church, and the Light thereof extinguished: a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Punishment, and too universal, providing the Diocesan only
were to be charged with Defection. Yea have we not much better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to judge that this declining, and deserting of their first Love, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the <hi>Ephesian Angel,</hi> had crept into, at least, the far greater
part of the Church-Officers; and so the sin charged upon them, and
the punishment threatned shall have a far greater correspondency. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the trial of false Teachers, for which the same <hi>Ephesian Angel</hi> is
commended, is not the Work of any one Church-Officer, but of the
Ecclesiastical Senat, which therefore must be the Angel, who upon this
account is here commended. D. <hi>M.</hi> yeelds <hi>that the Heavenly Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
first address'd to these Angels were also communicated to the Churches but
by the interposal of their Angels.</hi> But, were this as certain as, from what
is now said, it appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> precarious, yea and uncredible; yet this Angel
or Bishop might be only a <hi>Praeses</hi> or Moderator, so his Argument is not
at all relieved. <hi>Who</hi> (continues he) <hi>cann't be call'd a Colledge of Angels
but one single Angel &amp;c.</hi> Which is a most flat begging of the Question.
<hi>And tho</hi>' (saith he) <hi>there be Instructions in these Epistles, in which, besides
others, the</hi> Angels <hi>are particularly admonished, yet they are no less adress'd to
single Angels than the Epistle to the</hi> Philippians <hi>is to that Church, Tho' St.</hi>
Paul <hi>uses particular Compellations Ch. 4. verse</hi> 2. 3. Where he perverts
the state of the Question which is not, <hi>If in any Epistle there may be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that concern some beside these to whom they are chiefly directed?</hi> But <hi>if
what is here said to the Angel can agree to any one Man?</hi> And beside what
is instanced, to what one Man in the World can that agree which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the <hi>Philadelphian Angel?</hi> viz. <hi>That the Hereticks were to come and

§. 9 From all which 'tis evident that by the Name of Angels, not
particular Men, but at least the Ecclesiastick Senats are design'd which
is not unfrequent in Scripture, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. where 'tis said <hi>that the
Priests lips should keep knowledge,</hi> from whose mouth the Law was to be
sought, the reason of which is subjoin'd, that he was the <hi>Messenger</hi> or
<hi>Angel</hi> &amp;c. as the <hi>Seventy</hi> have it. I know from the Passage Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
on the Revelation, attempts to conclude the quite contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that in this place the <hi>High-Priest</hi> only is to be understood, but
without any ground of his alledgiance: this his Assertion further sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
that the <hi>High-Priest</hi> alone was the Cabine of Knowledge, and the

to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 8, 9. where we learn that amongst the rest of the
Teachers sent through the Kingdom by <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> were <hi>Elishamma</hi> and
<hi>Jehoram</hi> Priests. Moreover the 4, 5, and 6. verses of the same second
of <hi>Malachy,</hi> where under the name of <hi>Levi</hi> in the singular Number all
the Levites are undeniably to be understood, and what's said of <hi>Levi</hi> as
of one Man is certainly mean'd of a Multitude; evince that under the
name of <hi>Priest</hi> in the following verse, we must understand a Plurality.</p>
                  <p>§. 10. But the 24. verse of the second Chapter, <hi>Vnto you I say

                     <hi>tells us that</hi> these words in the 24 v. <hi>But unto

Which, (<hi>saith he</hi>) because they are mentioned in the Speech directed to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

                  <p>But except we force the place nothing of this kind can be thence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
there being nothing in this Epistle spoken to or of the other
Churches except the meer mentioning thereof, the more to hold forth
the greatness and conspicuousness of the Punishment denunced against
the Strayers in <hi>Thyatira.</hi> Yea the latter part of the 24 verse, <hi>And to
the rest in Thyatira</hi> proclaims that the former part of the verse is to be
understood of the same People of <hi>Thyatira</hi> likewise. In a word his gloss

According to</hi> Salmasius <hi>his Iterpretation</hi> (inferrs D. <hi>M.) the

Phrases were not frequent enough in Authors, and yet not justly lyable
to any such Inference; or as if the more holy <hi>and</hi> spiritual part of the
Church were the whole visible Church: for except D. <hi>M.</hi> so affirm,
the Author of this Gloss cann't be accus'd of nonsense; who yet is not
<hi>Salmasius,</hi> for he only learn'd it from <hi>Aretas,</hi> or <hi>Andraeas,</hi> and other

                     <hi>As for the Notion</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the distinct Offices of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi>
Presbyter, <hi>I confess, it is not so clear to me: and therefore since I look upon
the Sacramental Actions, as the highest of sacred Performances; I cannot but
acknowledge these who are empower'd for them, must be of the highest Office in
the Church. So I do not alledge a</hi> Bishop <hi>to be a distinct Office from a</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter;
<hi>but a different degree in the same Office, to whom for Order and Vnities
sake, the chief inspection and care of Ecclesiastical Matters ought to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and who shall have Authority to curb the Insolencies of some factious and
turbulent Spirits. His Work should be to feed the Flock by the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
as well as other Presbyters; and especially to try and ordain Entrants,
and to Oversee, Direct, and Admonish such as bear Office. And I more
willingly incline to believe Bishops and Presbyters, to be the several degrees of
the same Office, since the names of</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter, <hi>are used for the
same thing in Scripture; and are also used promiscuously by the Writers of the
two first Centuries.</hi> Where he plainly contradicts Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> who, in
favour of his <hi>Ignatius,</hi> largely pleads for the accurat distinction of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
and <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the second Century, denies <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> to
be distinct Orders; and finally acknowledges, that in the chiefest
parts of the Ministerial Function they are equal: and so really denudes
the Bishop of all the degree he left him. But more clearly elsewhere, <q>I
acknowledged (<hi>saith he</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">Confer. Page 331.</note>) <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to be one and
the same Office; and so I plead for no New Office-Bearers in the
Church. Next, in our second Conference, the Power giv'n to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
was proved to be double. The first Branch of it, is their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to publish the Gospel, to manage the Worship, and to dispence
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94326:92"/>
the Sacraments. And this is all that is of Divine-Right in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
in which Bishops and Presbyters are equal sharers, both being
vested with this Power. But beside this, the Church claims a Power
of Jurisdiction, of making Rules for Discipline, and of appointing and
executing the same; all which is indeed suitable to the common Laws
of Societies, and to the general Rules of Scripture, but hath no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Warrant from any Scripture-Precept. And all these Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Churches into Synods and the Canons of Discipline, taking
their rise from the Divisions of the World into the several Provinces,
and beginning in the end of the second, and beginning of the third
Century, do clearly shew they can be derived from no Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and so were, as to their particular Form, but of humane Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
therefore as to the management of this Jurisdiction, it is in the
Churches Power to cast it in what mould she will.</q>

against Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and says, <hi>that then, properly speaking, there might not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94326:93"/>
be a Bishop amongst them all, for they are Presbyters belonging not to several
Congregations; but to one Church and might have a Bishop.</hi> But not only
the promiscuous attributing to them the Names <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
their being, and that without any insinuation of their Subjection to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Bishop, enjoin'd by the Apostle to Oversee and feed the Flock;
and finally the very Repetition of this Fiction of their Hierarchy in the
Apostolick Age sufficiently refute it. <hi>Who</hi> (continues he) <hi>the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
thought was Timothy.</hi> And thus all resolves into the fictitious Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
of <hi>Timothy,</hi> already overthrown. Now 'tis observable how they
contradict one another, and by halfs acknowledge to be false all they
plead for: for some, as Dr. <hi>Maurice,</hi> perceiving that the Ancients af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and the Scriptures proclaim all these Elders to belong to the Church
or City of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> acknowledge <hi>these could be no Diocesan Bishops.</hi> Others
as Dr. <hi>Hammond (in locum &amp; alibi</hi>) and <hi>Petavius</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Apud Wal.</hi> Mess. Page 96.</note> seeing <hi>that these
are not only dignifi'd with the name of Bishop but intrusted with the care of the
Flock, and that without</hi> Paul'<hi>s mentioning of any superiour Bishop; when, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
there was ground to have mention'd him;</hi> yeeld that, <hi>of necessity, these
Elders must be Bishops or more than simple Presbyters.</hi> Whence is all this
Contradiction and Confusion of Tongues? but from the force of Truth
before which Men must either bow or break, and be compell'd, tho' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
never so much interpolation and disguise, to express what they would
fainest conceal. The matter is, their Diocesan Bishop, their simple
Presbyter, their distinction between Bishop and Presbyter are meer An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiscriptural
Figments, in the sustaining of which against this and the
like Scriptures, they are obliged to confront one another, and in the
throng of their blunderings intirely yeeld the Controversie.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. The same line of confusion runs along their Answer to Philip.
1. 1. <hi>with the Bishops and Deacons</hi> &amp;c. whence 'tis clear that there were
in one City many Bishops who were no other thing than Presbyters, and
that these were no distinct Orders, the Deacons being immediatly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd,
these were the Bishops of the several Cities of <hi>Macedonia</hi> under
<hi>Philippi</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> (saith Dr. <hi>Hammond in locum</hi>) 'tis denied by Dr.
<hi>Maurice</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Page 27.</note> 
                     <hi>I could never find reason</hi> (saith he) <hi>to believe them any other
thing than Presbyters.</hi> Philippi <hi>was a Metropolis because a Colonie;</hi> saith
Dr. <hi>Hammond:</hi> but that this will not follow is acknowledged by Dr.
<hi>Maurice.</hi> Thus they are still by the ears. But saith Dr. <hi>Hammond, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94326:93"/>
Apostle might retain the Episcopal Power in his own hands, and tho' absent
might exercise it by Letters:</hi> but they can give no ground why the like may
not be said of the Apostle in reference to the rest of the Churches, and
so <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> shall be dethron'd and our Adversaries, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Answer one of our Arguments, loss two of their own, yea all of
them: for it being no less presumable that <hi>John</hi> would keep the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Power over the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> in his own hand then that <hi>Paul</hi>
kept that of <hi>Philippi,</hi> there shall be no ground nor colour to Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phose
the Apocalyptick Angels into Diocesan Bishops? <hi>Or it's possible</hi>
(continues Dr. <hi>H.) that then the Bishop's Chair was vacant.</hi> But if so and
a Diocesan so necessary as they pretend, without peradventure the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
had not only mention'd it. but also spent some part of his Epistle
in directing and giving them Rules in order to their choice of a fit Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour.
<hi>Or the Bishop</hi> (saith he) <hi>might be absent, and</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>by
the Ancients judged Bishop of</hi> Philippi <hi>appears to have been then with Paul.</hi>
But this Dream of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his being Bishop of <hi>Philippi,</hi> the Doctor
in that very place<note n="e" place="bottom">Page 636.</note> condemns and overthrows, and so frees us of
further trouble about it.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Yea in none of these Answers does Dr. <hi>H.</hi> rest, but, as is said,
in this pretext that <hi>Philippi</hi> was a Metropolis over many subject Bishops,
leaning mainly on <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 12. whose Arguments were examined by

than was <hi>Neapolis,</hi> and therefore is rather to be reckon'd a part
of that Country than <hi>Neapolis</hi> could be: wherefore on both, at least,
certainly on one of these accounts, appears the nullity of Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi>
his Answer, while he says <hi>that not</hi> Philippi <hi>but</hi> Neapolis <hi>was the first in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</hi>
Of the same kidney is his saying <hi>that</hi> Philippi <hi>might be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in</hi> Luke'<hi>s time than in the time of P. Aemilius:</hi> seeing this is a
mean begging of the Question: for he brings nothing from any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
which a Matter of this kind requires, to make in the least proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the growth of <hi>Philippi</hi> between the time of <hi>Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Luke:</hi> and

mention'd as Metropolitan in</hi> Liberatus, <hi>the Council of</hi> Ephesus, Sedulius, <hi>and
in an old</hi> Notitia. To which I Answer with Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Iren. Page 361.</note> in the like
Case: <hi>But what validity there is in such Subscriptions,</hi> or Allegations in the
latter end of the fourth, or <hi>the time of the fifth Century to prove a</hi> Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:
<hi>in the first, let any-one judge that doth but consider how common a thing it
was to alter</hi> Metropoles, <hi>especially after the new Disposition of the Roman Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
by Constantine.</hi> Yea <hi>Carolus à sancto Paulo</hi> who was most versant in
these Matters, and with him Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> believe <hi>that for the first six
Centuries</hi> Philippi <hi>was no Metropolis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. But I will not enlarge in overthrowing a Fancy so wild and
gross. <hi>But in the end of the second Century,</hi> (saith Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="bottom">Conferences. Pages 307, 308.</note>)
<hi>the Churches were framed in another mould from the Division of the Empire:
and the Bishops of the Cities did, according to the several Divisions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
associat in Synods with the chief Bishop of that Division or Province, who
was call'd the</hi> Metropolitan, <hi>from the Dignity of the City, where he was
Bishop. And hence sprang</hi> Provincial Synods, <hi>and the</hi> Superiorities, <hi>and</hi>
Precedencies <hi>of</hi> Bishopricks. You see how the chiefest of Prelatists
disown and disclaim this <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Fiction: but none more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> who has nervously baffl'd all their Pretences,
prevented whatsoever Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> advanced (for I speak not of Mr.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94326:94"/>
                     <hi>Clerkson</hi> who has also sufficiently done it) and finally, more particularly,
ruined all their Pretexts for <hi>Philippi</hi>'s Metropolitan-ship, either in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or Ecclesiastick sense, during the first Century or Apostolick age.
Judge therefore of Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> his Candor, which minds me of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
piece of his <hi>Legerdemain</hi> to evite the force of Philippians 1. 1.
<hi>For if</hi> (saith he<note n="l" place="bottom">Page 27.</note>) <hi>in Mr.</hi> Clerkson'<hi>s Opinion, the Bishops mention'd</hi>
Philip. 1. 1. <hi>be no other than Presbyters, then this place is impertinently alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
since many Presbyters are by all sides acknowledg'd to have belong'd to one
Church, but if he speak of Bishops in the common Ecclesiastical sense, and then
conclude from this Passage that there were many in the Church of</hi> Philippi, <hi>his
Opinion is as singular as that of Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>which he endeavours to refute,
for my part I must profess I am not concern'd in this Dispute; and I could never
find reason to believe them any other thing, than Presbyters</hi>—<note n="m" place="bottom">Page 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Or
were these Bishops only Presbyters ruling the Church of</hi> Philippi, <hi>with common
and equal Authority? Then our Author must give up the Question, and in
stead of making many Bishops, must own that there was none at all there, but
Presbyters only, if he thus contend he will abuse his Reader with the ambiguity of
a word, which he takes in one sense, and the Church in another. That many
Presbyters might belong to one Congregation, none ever deni'd; that many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in the allowed and Ecclesiastical sense of the word, had the oversight of one
City, sounds strange and incredible to the ancient Christians.</hi> Where he sleely
supposes as granted that <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1. must either be understood
of their simple Presbyters or of Diocesan Bishops, and then equipps his
horn'd Argument no other ways than if he had professedly declined all
Dispute, till once his Adversary had, out of kindness, yeelded the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
which is only about the Scriptural and Apostolick sense of the word
and notion of the Office of a Bishop, if that, and the Office of a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Presbyter be not in Scripture one and the same, and consequently
if these at <hi>Philippi</hi> were not Scriptural Bishops no less than they were
Presbyters? Now that he concern'd not himself in this Dispute, nor
was in earnest in it. I deny not: his slippery dealings make it but too, too
apparent: his simple intimation that these were only their simple Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
I pass, having already blown off all their noticeable Depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1. I have yet mett with; and observe that he, following
the Romanists, insinuats that we cann't understand the Scripture's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
untill we have their Churches Commentary. His ambiguous and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94326:95"/>
unhandsome conduct is no less apparent in these his Phrases (<hi>common
Ecclesiastical sense—which he takes in one sense, and the Church in another</hi>) For
either he may mean that the Church, when she speaks of Bishops who
were in after times, understands, by this Name, only Diocesans; and so
touches not in the least (contrary to what he insinuats) the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
sense of this Text, nor what Notion she had of Scriptural-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
Or his sense may be that, when she speaks of Apostolick and
Scriptural Bishops, she then still means Diocesans and Rulers over their
simple Presbyters, and this he must mean if he speak to the Purpose.
And then I inquire what Church was of this mind? Surely neither Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
nor reformed Churches, I except not that of <hi>England,</hi> whose great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Lights we have already heard disclaiming all Divine Right of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
Episcopacy, and identifying <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter.</hi> Yea many, even
of the Romanists, are forc'd to confess so much; <hi>There are Catholicks</hi> (saith
the Jesuite <hi>Justinianus</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="bottom">In Philip. 1. 1. <hi>Haeserunt in eodem Luto nonnulli Catholici.</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>who have stuck in the mud of Aërianism.</hi>
The Church then he means must be only a few factious Novelists, who,
in despite of both Divine and Humane Records, and the common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of Christians, dare to obtrude on the World, as a Fundamental
of Religion, their privat and wild Fancies. Neither is it strange that so
few imbrace this conceit of denying the Scripture-Identity of Bishop
and Presbyter.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. For beside these Scriptures now adduc'd let them but look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. where they shall find a transition from Bishop to Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
without any mention of intermediant Presbyters, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Identity of these Offices. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

seeing they make a Distinction of these Offices so necessary, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
they had been handl'd in particular, and not hudl'd up in a general,
seeing no where in Scripture there's any more particular Distinction of
Bishop and preaching Presbyter assigned: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s main Answer
to this and all such Scriptures is, <hi>that the Names</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter
<hi>were then common to both Orders:</hi> which Answer all the Hierarchicks and
more particularly D. <hi>M.</hi> borrow from the Jesuite. But I answer and
argue with <hi>Junius</hi> against <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="bottom">Tom. 2. Col. 1211.</note> 
                     <hi>that seeing the Names were then
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94326:95"/>
common, and a real community of Names imports a community of things which
by these names are signifi'd; it necessarily then follows that, as the Names
were then common, so were the Offices design'd by these Names.</hi> But to
see the Reform'd conquering, and the Jesuites foil'd some are much
pain'd: and in special D. <hi>M.</hi> who spends about 17 pages<note n="q" place="bottom">Page 22. <hi>Et seq.</hi>
                     </note> for the
support of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Answer: the substance whereof, and of his first
three <hi>Queries</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">Pages 157, 158.</note> is, that <hi>Still in the Pentateuch the High Priest is nam'd
by the same Appellative (without any distinction of Order or Jurisdiction) that
the other Priests were nam'd by: and the title of a Priest was promiscuously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
without any distinction or marks of Eminence to the High Priest as well as
to the Subordinat.</hi> And, <hi>The Apostles retain'd the Phraseology of the Jews
who spoke of Priests and Levites as two distinct Orders, without mentioning the
High Priest.</hi> And, <hi>When the Ancients</hi> Dichotomiz'd <hi>the Clergy, they in
other places plainly reckon up three distinct Orders of Bishop, Presbyter, and
Deacon.</hi> But is there never in all the Scriptures any Title, Distinction,
or Marks of Eminence giv'n to one Priest, which were not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to all of 'em? Got ever all of 'em promiscuously the Title of <hi>High
Priest,</hi> or such distinctive Appellations? Did the Apostles so retian the
Phraseology of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as that they sometimes make a Bipartite and
sometimes a Tripartite Division of ordinary Church-Officers, and give
to any one ordinary Pastor, sometimes at least, a distinguishing Title
and Marks of Eminence which are at no time communicable to all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Pastors promiscuously? As to the Ancients their sometimes <hi>Dicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizing,</hi>
sometimes <hi>Trichotomizing</hi> the Clergy; it's most certain that in
their <hi>Dichotomies</hi> they ey'd the prime primitive Church, and in their <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotomies</hi>
their own times. <hi>But Christ</hi> saith D. <hi>M.</hi>) <hi>is call'd an Apostle &amp; a
Bishop, the Apostles, Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> But was Christ so call'd an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
that he had no other peculiar titles or marks of Eminence, or that
on the other hand the name <hi>Christ</hi> was giv'n promiscuously to all Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
or ever giv'n to any of 'em? Lastly, was the Apellation of <hi>Apostle</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
communicable to all Presbyters or ordinary Pastors, as to the
twelve and some few else extraordinary Officers? All which he must swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
else he gives no relief to his Friend <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> We Argue, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to no ordinary Pastor is giv'n any peculiar Appellation, Character,
or Description, but what is equally common to all, there must be an
Equality and Parity amongst all of 'em; and this they can never get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94326:96"/>
Moreover among the Evangelists, yea and among the Apostles,
Officers superior to ordinary Pastors, the reformed Churches being
Judges, there was a compleat Parity as was also among the Deacons
their Inferiours: notwithstanding of all which the Hierarchicks must
plead for certain Stories of Preheminence among the ordinary Pastors;
in favours; whereof <hi>ne gry quidem</hi> they can bring from the Word of God
the only Rule of Faith and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. Add hereto <hi>Tit. chap.</hi> 1. where we not only find the Apostle
using indifferently and promiscuously the two words <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Elder,</hi>
but also he alledgeth the necessity of fit Qualifications in the one, to
prove that the same are required in the other; <hi>the Presbyters that were to
be Ordain'd must be blameless &amp;c.</hi> because a Bishop must be so: wherein
either we have an ocular Demonstration of the Identity of these two Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
or else (which I abhorr to think) the Apostles reasoning is
more pitifull than the most equivocant Paralogism; their being not so
much as a nominal Connexion betwixt the Antecedent and Consequent;
and no less ridiculous than if one should reason that every Captain of a
single Company must be able to guide and manage a whole Army, because
such Qualifications are required in a General. Now, seeing these
Scriptures already vindicated, to name no others, evidently declare
that there was no such thing as a Diocesan Bishop, that there's a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Identity of Bishop and preaching Presbyter, and consequently a
Parity of all ordinary Pastors, they of necessity condemn the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chick
and Diocesan Imparity: for I'm perswaded these who alledge that
they find in Scripture a Distinction between these Offices, will judge
that they may with reason enough conclude the Divine Right of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.
Hence judge of D. <hi>M</hi>'s fifth Query<note n="s" place="bottom">pag. 158.</note> 
                     <hi>where and in what
places of Scripture the superiority and jurisdiction of one Priest above another is
forbidden? And if it be not plainly forbidden, then the Fancy of a</hi> Jus Divinum
<hi>in favours of Presbytry (such as is exclusive of all other Forms of Ecclesiastical
Government) is groundless and Chimerical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which I conclude that if the Ignatian Bishop and Presbyter
most be understood in the Notion of our Adversaries, he then quite cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Apostles, &amp; so his Doctrine is stark nought, or (which is a far more
charitable Sentiment) his Epistles have suffer'd no small interpolation.</p>

                     <note n="a" place="bottom">On <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1.</note>) <hi>What means that? What? was there a Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Bishops in one City? Not at all: for at that time the Name was yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
so that a Bishop was also nam'd a Deacon, that is a Servant.</hi> And adds,
<hi>that both</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were Bishops.</hi> Of the same mind (say they)
were <hi>Hilary, Epiphanius, Theodoret, OEcumenius</hi> and others: which
harmonius Consent of Ancients cann't but be the true meaning of the
places in Controversie. But as these, and such Fathers confess, and
their Works proclaim, they were, like others, subject to humane Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Corruption, fell into compliance with the growing Errors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
immoderat heat, prevarication and self-repugnancy, and negligence
to search for the Scriptures their meaning. How loudly sounded the
debate concerning rebaptizing between <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

almost the whole body of Christians into a pair of Factions? With what
heat was it prosecuted? And, which is most lamentable, how pitifully
was the truth on both hands deserted? For altho' it be commonly
believ'd that <hi>Stephen</hi> only held the truth, and <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his fail'd, yet
<hi>Stephen</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> did no less betray it: On the other extream,
while they asserted the sufficiency of <hi>Baptism,</hi> altho' administred by the
grossest Hereticks and capital Enemies of the Fundamentals of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
How great, both before and after that time, were the Contests
about <hi>Easter?</hi> How scandalous were the Contests between <hi>Chrysostome,
Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Theophilus:</hi> and between <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Ruffine.</hi> Not to

when we clearly perceive that one and the self same Author, either out
of negligence or some other weakness, hath given us quite contrary
Doctrines. <hi>Justine Martyr,</hi> which <hi>Sculte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>§. 3. Of the same kind are their polemick Discourses, wherein their
study was much more directed to bespatte their Antagonists, and alure
the vulgar Auditor, than solidly to support the Truth. I shall never
believe that <hi>Optatus</hi>

                     <hi>which also

the deceit of which could not be unknown to him who natively

which he hath no confidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. To these we may add both their Homilies and Expositions
wherein it's not easily determined when they spoke their own minds, or
when they gave us only Transcripts of others, to believe and defend
which they held themselves but little obliged. Yea <hi>Hierome</hi> oftner
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94326:97"/>
than once tells us that <hi>it was the common Practice of the Writers of these times
to give the Expositions of others, and yet conceal the names of the Authors, and
so involve the Reader, and make him take for their judgement the things they
never believ'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. If we search into the causes of so strange dealing, we have heard
out of <hi>Hierome</hi> that one of 'em was meer sloath and neglect. See much
more to this purpose in <hi>Dallaeus de usu Patrum.</hi> Another Cause, why
they both spoke, wrote and practised otherways than they knew could
be warranted by Scripture, was their unjustifiable Compliance with
both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans;</hi> good perhaps intentionally being out of design
the better to Proselyte them, but eventually proved as unhappy as its
Practice was unwarrantable, and destitute of Scripture ground. Hence
their <hi>Deacons</hi> were named <hi>Levites,</hi> their <hi>Bishops Priests</hi> and <hi>High-Priests,</hi>
the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Table</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and at length
<hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> and <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> were instituted in imitation of the
<note n="f" place="bottom">Lombard. Lib. 4. Distinctione 24. M.</note> 
                     <hi>Pagan Flamines</hi> and <hi>Protoflamines.</hi> Another Cause thereof, which
especially takes place in their Homiles and Expositions, was the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Alterations and Corruptions well grown before any of these Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and Commentaries we now enjoy were extant, these were too
deeply rooted to be opposed; and therefore they believed themselves
under a kind of necessity to accommodat their Comments and Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereto, at least, so to temper and compose them that they should
not thwart therewith. Of this sort of Conduct, we have a clear instance in
<hi>Augustine,</hi> who sometimes commends and praises several unscriptural
Ceremonies: But<note n="g" place="bottom">Epist. 118.</note> elsewhere speaking his Mind more freely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves
them as both unwrantable and burdensome. He indeed there
intimats <hi>that some things commonly observ'd throw the World tho' they were not
written yet might be kept as having come from the Apostles or general Councils;
such as was the Observation of the Lord's Passion, Resurrection and Ascension.</hi>
But even this, as is most probable, he yeelded out of humane Weakness
and Fear to oppose the then prevailing Innovations: for, the needlesness
of such preterscriptural Observations he evidently declares elsewhere
<note n="h" place="bottom">
                        <hi>De Doctrina Christiana.</hi> Lib. 2. Cap. 9.</note> saying that <hi>all things which belong either to Faith and Manners are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contain'd in Scripture.</hi> From all which is clear, that we cannot at all
be sure if the Fathers, Commenting on the places in hand, either knew
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94326:98"/>
their true meaning, or if they did, sincerely gave us what themselves
believed.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. And that in their Explications of these Texts, we have not
their genuine Sentiments, is to me evident. First, because they gave
such Reasons of their Exposition as the greatest Prelatists count stark
nought. Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">
                        <hi>De Clericis.</hi> C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p. 15.</note> rejects and overturns the Grounds of
every one of these Expositors in particular, except these of <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
only, who yet hath nothing of any moment above the rest: for <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
exponing <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1. alledges only in defence of his Exposition
that the sole Title and Name of Bishop was common to both Orders:
but this is refused by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others, and, as we shall hear,
by <hi>Chrysostome</hi> himself. But the Jesuite intending to retain that Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thought himself obliged to embrace some of their Defences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in truth they themselves never believ'd them to be solide, but only the
growing Corruptions being too strong to be opposed, and some of 'em
having got an Episcopacy which was then creeping in, and which they,
depending on the Churches Authority, thought they might retain, they
believ'd that for the fashion they might so gloss the Scriptures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Episcopacy is wounded that the People should not perceive the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantableness
thereof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The main ground common to all these
Expositions why they expone any of these Texts as if they condemn'd
not a Diocesan Bishop, is a sufficient evidence that they were far from
being in earnest in their Glosses, for they still alledge that there behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a Bishop above these Bishops in <hi>Philippi</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> salutes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there might not be Plurality of Bishops in one City. This Practice
indeed was for the most part current in this time, tho' not universal, as
we learn from<note n="k" place="bottom">De heresi Miletiana.</note> 
                     <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> informing us <hi>that even in these times there
used to be a Plurality of Bishops in one City.</hi> Yet quite contrary to this Text
which they either carelesly or timourously shuffl'd. <hi>They judged</hi> (saith
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Iren. Page 317.</note>) <hi>the Practice of the Apostles by that of their own times;
as is evident by</hi> Theodoret <hi>and the rest of the Greek Commentators, assigning
that as the reason why the Presbyters spoken of in the Epistles to</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi>
Titus, <hi>were not Bishops in the sense of their Age, because their could be but one
Bishop in a City.</hi> And <hi>Petavius</hi>

                     <hi>altho' the Episcopal Order be of Divine Right,

there not be more Bishops than one in a proper sense in one Diocess?</hi> Where
'tis not unpleasant to hear so great a Prelatist by one Interrogation over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the whole Episcopal Cause, and propugning the main Plea of
the Presbyterians viz. that in <hi>Philippi</hi> alone there were many who had
not only the power of dispensing the Word and Sacraments, but also of
Ordination and Jurisdiction, and were every way Bishops in a proper
sense. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some of these Expositors proclaim what we alledge for
<note n="p" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>OEcumenius</hi> who, like the rest intimats, as if in <hi>Philippi</hi> there had
been a Bishop superior to the plurality of Bishops saluted by the Apostle.
Yet on <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and 17. gives this Paraphrase. <q>Because many are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Manner especially of the New Testament, whereby Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are call'd Presbyters and Presbyters Bishops. This much may
be observed both from this place and from the Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> and to
the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and 1. to <hi>Timothy.</hi> From this place therefore of the
<hi>Acts</hi> we may arrive at the certainty of this Matter. For thus it is
written, from <hi>Miletus</hi> he sent and called the Elders of the Church, it
is not said the Bishops. And afterwards he subjoins, over which the
Holy Ghost hath made you Bishops to Feed or Rule the Church: and
from the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> that thou mightest appoint Elders in every
City, as I ordain'd thee: and from the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to
all that are at <hi>Philippi</hi> with Bishops and Deacons: and, as I believe,
the same may be gather'd from the frist to <hi>Timothy: If any Man</hi> (saith
he) <hi>desires the Office of a Bishop, he desires a good Work;</hi> a Bishop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should be blameless. And shortly after, let not a Widow be taken
into the number under threescore years</q> (which the Transcriber of
<hi>OEcumenius</hi> hath out of negligence inserted from the 5. Chap. and 9. ver.
in stead of the 8. verse of the 3. Likewise let the Deacons be grave &amp;c.)
<hi>For this is the Church Canon directing what manner of Man such an one viz.
the Deacon ought to be.</hi> Thus far <hi>OEcumenius,</hi> and not a word more to
this purpose, where, having really proposed the now much tossed Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
mustres up four of the chief Places from which the Identity of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94326:99"/>
Bishop and Presbyter is commonly inferr'd, and directs us to learn the
Solution of this Doubt therefrom. Hence 'tis certain that <hi>OEcumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
no less than <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Aërius</hi> of old, and Presbyterians now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
the Scriptural Identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> seeing, he having
brought up these Scriptures, which, even in the Judgement of our
Adversaries, creat to the Hierarchicks a vexatious Scruple, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Objection, is so far from glossing them, as thereby to leave any
room for a Diocesan Bishop, that he plainly informs us, that these
Scriptures only suffice to dissolve all our Scruples and period the
Dispute. 'Tis evident then that <hi>OEcumenius,</hi> commenting on <hi>Philip.</hi>
1. 1. or wherever he seems to say nothing against a superiority of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesans,
spoke only out of compliance with the Custom of his time, or
some such weakness. Neither is the matter less clear of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who,
altho' he ascribes an Episcopal Dispensation over the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus,</hi>
yet even then he looks on him as no ordinary or fixed Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
which is really yeelded by <hi>Petavius</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="bottom">Apud <hi>Wal.</hi> Mess. Pag. 80.</note> and is plain from <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
himself<note n="r" place="bottom">In priorem Ep. ad Tim. Cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Apostle</hi> (saith he) <hi>calls a Presbyter a Bishop, as
we shewed when we expon'd the Epistle to the</hi> Philippians. <hi>Which may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
learn'd from this Place. For after the Precepts proper to Bishops, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the things that agree to Deacons, omitting the Presbyters. But, as I
said, of old they call'd the same Men both Bishops and Presbyters, but these
who are now call'd Bishops they then call'd Apostles: But afterward the name
of Apostle was left to the real Apostles: And the name Bishop giv'n to these
that were of old call'd Apostles. Thus</hi> Epaphroditus <hi>was the Apostle of the</hi>
Philippians—<hi>Thus was</hi> Titus <hi>the Apostle of the</hi> Cretians, Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>of the</hi> Asians, <hi>Thus the Apostles and Presbyters at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<hi>write to the</hi>
                     </hi> Antiochians. And on 1 Cor. 12. 28.—<hi>first Apostles—The
Apostle saith not God hath sent onlie Twelve Apostles but also the
Seventy. And these who also received the like Grace. For</hi> Paul <hi>himself after
his Calling was of the same Order, and</hi> Barnabas <hi>and many others.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
he calls <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> the Apostle of the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Where 'tis
clear as the Sun, that <hi>Theodoret,</hi> by these his <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Apostles,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
only the real Apostles themselves together with <hi>Timothy</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> and other such Evangelists and extraordinary Officers, who never
had any fixed Station. And this was well perceiv'd by the Jesuite <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi>
who therefore really yeelds <hi>Theodoret</hi> with <hi>Hierome, Aërius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94326:99"/>
&amp;c.</hi> to the Presbyterians, and warmly recented by <hi>Petavius,</hi>
who, besides many other places, spends at once near a<note n="s" place="bottom">

to prove <hi>Theodoret</hi> a self repugnant blunderer. Hence it's clear that
they cann't rent <hi>Theodoret</hi> from us, untill (<hi>Tullus-like</hi>) they first rent
him from himself. Wherever therefore these Ancients so spoke as that
they seemed not to oppose the Divine Right of Episcopacy; 'tis clear
they did so out of carelesness, or unwarrantable Compliance, but most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as may be gather'd from the handling <hi>Aërius</hi> mett with, out of fear
least they had derived on their Heads the hate of much of the then dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating

<hi>because he opens the hidden sense of the Scriptures, is said to. Prophecy,

the Ancients still retain'd of a Bishop, and yet it's nothing but the real
Notion of every true Pastor or Dispenser of the Word and Sacraments.
<hi>Which Order may now be that of the Presbyters. For in the Bishop are all Orders;
for he is the first Priest that is the Prince of Priests, and Prophet, and Evangelist.
And whatsoever else is for fullfilling the Office of the Church and Service of the
Faithfull.</hi> And, <hi>The Apostle calls</hi> Timothy <hi>a Presbyter whom he had insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
a Bishop, for the first Presbyters were called Bishops; so that one Dying the
next succeeded. And lastly, in</hi> Aegypt <hi>the Presbyters ordain in the Bishop's
absence;</hi> where we see what he means by the Prince of Priests, and that
with him a Bishop was nothing but the first either in Age or in respect
of Ordination amongst the Colledge of Presbyters without any other
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94326:100"/>
Preheminence or Power over the rest but what these respects gave them.
Which, I'm sure, exceeds not the Dignity of a Moderator of a Synod
or Presbyter. <q>But because the following Presbyters were not found
worthy of the first place this way was changed by a Council that none
by his being first in order, but by his desert might be made a Bishop,
and that by the Votes of many Priests, least an unworthy Man should
rashly usurp the Office to the offence of many. There were born
Priests under the Law of the Race of <hi>Aaron</hi> the Levite, but now all
are Priests according to the Apostle <hi>Peter;</hi> and therefore Priests may
be chosen out of the People.</q> And on 1 to <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. <q>But after the
Bishop he straight way subjoins the Ordination of a Deacon, and why?
But because of Bishop and Presbyter there's but one Ordination for
both of them are Priests, but the Bishop is first, so that every Bishop
is a Presbyter not every Presbyter a Bishop, for he's the Bishop who
is first among the Presbyters. Finally the Apostle shews that <hi>Timothy</hi>
was ordain'd a Presbyter, but because he had no other Presbyter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him he was a Bishop. And from thence he shews how <hi>Timothy</hi>
can Ordain a Bishop for 'twas not lawfull for the Inferiour to Ordain
a Superiour.</q>

the Cardinal also objects, and shews that thereby we're to understand
only such a Dignity as either meer priority of Ordination or Seniority

because Sin entred by the Woman she ought to have this

Here we see that, according to <hi>Hilary,</hi> there was a Bishop over every
Congregation, and in every place of publick Worship frequented by
Men and Women, and that the Apocalyptick Angels were only such
Congregational Pastors. From which we may well gather that when
any in these early times had the name <hi>Bishop</hi> more peculiarly giv'n them,
yet the Primacy could be but only of Order, and nominal which is fitly
illustrated by the <hi>Athenian Archons.</hi>

more Quibbles to darken and deprave this Author; and chiefly strives
to make <hi>Hilary</hi> speak nothing for the Right of Seniority, and against
the Election of a Successor to any deceasing Bishop. He says therefore
<hi>that when</hi> Hilary <hi>tells us, that one dying, the next or following succeeded, we
must not understand it in respect of Years or Ordination, but any of 'em indefinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, who was notwithstanding afterward to be elected by the Clergy, but all
the Presbyters in time becoming unworthie of the Episcopal Honour the Method
was altered, and another not out of the Colledge of Presbyters, but out of some
other Order according to their desert was admitted unto that Office.</hi> To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
which Gloss, he brings <hi>Hierome</hi>'s saying <hi>that the Presbyters of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria
<hi>named one elected from among themselves, Bishop,</hi> as if <hi>Hierome</hi> were
not speaking of <hi>Alexandria</hi> alone, and to instance therein, that Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
came not soon to any growth; or as if <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> could not
agree in its being of humane Original, and yet differ in the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of its rise. The rest of his prolix Discourse on this Theme is only a
train of meer Cavills and Clouds too thin and airy to feed a very <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeleon,</hi>
all which are quite dissolv'd and disappear if we but look into
one small parcell of <hi>Hilary</hi>'s words, where he tells us that <hi>after the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
was altered then the Bishop whose desert raised him was constitute by the
Judgement or Votes of many Priests or Presbyters:</hi> For this Clause being of
design inserted by <hi>Hilarie</hi> to shew the Opposition between the latter and
the former Method of coming to the Primacy, proclaims that as after
the Change, Suffrages and Election were used, so before this Change,
there had been no such Custome. With this the Jesuite darrs not ingage
nor with <hi>Hilary</hi>'s making the Ordination of both <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
the same, his making <hi>Timothy</hi> only a Presbyter, his placing all the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
or Constitutive of a Bishop in being the first Presbyter of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
his giving a Bishop to every Congregation, &amp;c. These I say,
he never adventures once in the least to handle; wherefore surely he was
conscious to himself that he spent both Pains and Brains for the sole
production of a bulkish nothing.</p>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>the Apostle had discoursed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94326:101"/>
concerning the Bishops, and described them, declaring what they ought to have,
and from what they ought to abstain; omitting the order of Presbyters he descends
to the Deacons; and why so? But because between Bishop and Presbyter in a
manner there is no difference, seeing that also to the Presbyters the Care or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Church is committed, and whatsoever he said of Bishops agrees also to
the Presbyters, in Ordination alone they are Superiour, and they seem to have
this onlie more than the others.</hi> Where he clearly overthrows all their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter;</hi> notwithstanding that to some he
may seem to give the Power of Ordination to <hi>Bishops</hi> above <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
For <hi>First,</hi> The words are most capable of another Translation. Thus
only in the Matter of Ordination they have got up or set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> Of the Power of Ordination, it's being proper
to <hi>Bishops,</hi> he speaks most doubtfully <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>they seem</hi> &amp;c. (saith he).
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Had he believ'd that the Power of Ordination by Divine Right
belong'd to <hi>Bishops</hi> above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> he had never said that there's not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
in a manner nothing between them: surely <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
thought the Power of Ordination made a most large and notable Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Once again I shall with our Adversaries suppose that <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
allows that Power of Ordination by Divine Appointment was appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to Bishops they cann't with reason deny, but that, in all other things
to a hair, he asserts the Equality, yea the Identity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> with <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi>
Now will they stand to <hi>Chrysostome</hi> herein? Surely they will
not; for thus they should be oblig'd to let go all the Prerogatives and
Priviledges <hi>Bishops</hi> both claim and exerce over their Pastors, all their
Power <hi>Paramount</hi> of Governing the Church and her Pastors, all their
exorbitant Wealth, Grandeur, Pomp, and Splendor, and, in a word,
whatsoever renders to them the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> amiable or desireable, and so
should be really reduc'd to the condition of an ordinary Parish-pastor.
And were things so, little, I'm sure, would they care or stickel for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of any Distinction between these Officers: hence let them blush
any more to pretend to <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s Patrociny: seeing all they can,
with the least colour plead for, being giv'n, not granted, he really sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
their Cause, and levells their Diocesan Prelat with a parochial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</p>

                     <note n="m" place="bottom">De Clericis. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. 10.</note> Answers <hi>that</hi> Chrysostome <hi>and others, while
they say that onlie in Ordination a Bishop is above a</hi> Presbyter, <hi>speak onlie of such
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94326:102"/>
things which no way agree to Presbyters for Iurisdiction and Confirmation may be
performed by Presbyters by vertue of Commission from the Bishop.</hi> But thus
he really makes <hi>Chrysostome</hi> contradict himself: <hi>Chrysostome</hi> said they
differ'd nothing save in Ordination; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> compells him to say
that they have another Difference no less conspicuous than is between
the King and his Commissioner, who can do many regall Acts, being
warranted by him thereto. Does such a Power lodg'd in the <hi>Bishop,</hi>
which agrees to none of the Presbyters, make no Distinction between
him and them? Or rather, does it not make up the far greater and
more conspicuous part of the prelatical Eminency above the rest of the
Clergy? Add hereto <hi>Chrysostome</hi>'s Books of the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> wherein,
altho' he expresly professes he was to treat of the Office of a Bishop, yet
in these Books there's nothing but what concerns a congregational Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
nothing but what concerns publick prayer, dispensing of the
Word and Sacraments, and such Duties that terminat on the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but not a word of the Duties of the <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Prelat</hi> over inferiour
congregational Pastors as their Object which is a sure Demonstration
that, with <hi>Chrysostome, Bishop, Priest,</hi> and <hi>Pastor</hi> were Synonymous
Terms.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. To these add <hi>Pelagius</hi> a grand Heretick indeed, but never
branded as such for ought he said of Church-Government, who<note n="n" place="bottom">In <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note>
restricts all Church-Officers to <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Deacon.</hi> And<note n="o" place="bottom">In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> asserts
that <hi>Priest</hi> without any Discrimination or Restriction are <hi>the Successors of

                     <hi>Here</hi> (saith he) <hi>by Bishops we understand Presbyters
for there could not have been more Bishops in one Citie: but we have this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
also in the Acts of the Apostles</hi> Where it's clear that <hi>Pelagius,</hi> altho',
in conformity to the introduc'd Custome of distinguishing Bishops from
preaching Presbyters, he endeavour'd accordingly to expone this place
with as little dammage thereto as is possible, deduceth nothwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ground of the Difference between <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> from the
Churches latter Custome of having but one Bishop in one City, and not
from any Scripture-Warrant, and indeed when he brings to clear his
Comment the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> 17. and 28. he plainly intimats that even
when he and others of that Age seem most clearly to hold forth a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Bishop and preaching Presbyter, they then believ'd no
such thing to flow from Divine Institution.</p>

And<note n="q" place="bottom">In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a Question</hi> (saith he) <hi>why the Apostle made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Presbyters but comprehended them under the Name of</hi> Bishops, <hi>because,</hi>
(answers he) <hi>this is the second, yea, in a manner, the very same Degree with
that of</hi> Bishops, <hi>as the Apostle writes in the Epistle to the</hi> Philippians; <hi>To the
Bishops and Deacons: when yet one City cann't have more Bishops than one:
and, in the Acts of the Apostles,</hi> Paul <hi>being to go to</hi> Hierusalem <hi>and having
gathered the Elders of the Church, saith, among other things, take heed to the
Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Bishops.</hi> Hence it's most
evident that he believed both Offices to be, by Scripture-Warrant, one
and the same, and not a meer Communication of Names only. But the
thing most observable here, is, that to prove the Identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> he brings <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. and hereby shews us, that some of the
Ancients, from whose accustom'd Phrases he departed not while he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
it, when they seem to inferr from that place, only a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Names, did really believe no such thing, but were perswaded
that <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1. quite overthrows all Distinction betwixt Bishop and
preaching Presbyter. And <hi>Sedulius</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">In <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.</note> asserts and proves the Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and concludes from the Example of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesian
Elders</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> that <hi>there were many Bishops in one City,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Practice of his Age; and that, among the Ancients, <hi>Bishop</hi>
and <hi>Presbyter</hi> was one and the same. And <hi>Primasius</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="bottom">In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> proposeth the
Question, why the Apostle comes to the Deacons without any mention
of the Presbyters? And Answers in the very words of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Thus
it's clear, even these whom the Hierarchicks take for the prime Pillars
of Prelacy being Judges, that there's no Divine Warrant for Diocesan
Episcopacy, and that a Bishop and Presbyter in Scripture in Apostolick
times are one and the same.</p>

of the Apostle saying that thou should'st Ordain Elders in every City

I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> the Church was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd

any had baptized were by them counted their own, not Christs,
it was Decreed thro' the whole World that one, Chosen out of the
Presbyters, should be set over the rest to whom all care of the Church
should belong, and the Seeds of Division be removed. But you may

                     <note n="e" place="bottom">Col. 1212.</note> answers to both
the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and their <hi>Genuine Issue, that</hi> Hierome, <hi>when he said, what doth
the Bishop except Ordination which a</hi> Presbyter <hi>does not? understood it only

doth D. <hi>M.) that he more easily may deceive the Simple.</hi> We have heard
already that many of the greatest Lights of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yea,

shall we count D. <hi>M.</hi> and his Brethren who only scrape together these
most dishonest and a thousand times baffl'd depravations and perversions
of the Jesuites, and being plum'd with the feathers of so unlucky Birds,
can appear without any more shame and blushing than as if they were the
innocent penns of a Dove? <hi>But</hi> Hierome (subjoins <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who is
transcrib'd by D. <hi>M.</hi>) acknowledges <hi>that the Difference between</hi> Bishop
<hi>and</hi> Presbyter, <hi>as also the Princely Prerogatives of Bishops, was introduc'd
by the very Apostles, when 'twas said,</hi> I am of <hi>Paul</hi> &amp;c. But it's answer'd
by <hi>Junius</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="bottom">Tom. 2. Col. 1213.</note> that <q>the former of these can never be prov'd from
<hi>Hierome,</hi> and the latter <hi>Hierome</hi> denies, while he saith, when these
whom any baptiz'd were counted their own &amp;c. Where [saith <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius]
Hierome</hi> shews that 'twas not when this Evil was at <hi>Corinth</hi> only,
but when 'twas spread thro' the whole Churches: And the latter of
these [continues <hi>Junius] Paul</hi> denies while he reproves this Evil in
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and yet neither in the first nor in the second Epistle
makes ever the least mention of setting up a Bishop over them.</q> 
                     <hi>They

                     <hi>Whether the Opinion of St.</hi> Hierome <hi>be not disingenuously repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Presbyterians, since he never acknowledg'd nor affirm'd any intervall
after the Death of the Apostles, in which Ecclesiastical Affairs were govern'd</hi>
communi Presbyterorum consilio? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects also (as doth his
Epe D. <hi>M.) that</hi> Hierome <hi>says</hi> James <hi>was made Bishop of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after the Death of our Saviour.</hi> But both are repell'd by <hi>Iunius</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="bottom">Col. 1213.</note>
who shews that <hi>the common reading of that place of</hi> Hierome'<hi>s Catalogue is
corrupted.</hi> And Answers that <hi>James was only left while the Apostles went
thro' the World for the Commodity of that Church, and was never absolutely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
a Bishop by the Apostles, for</hi> James <hi>himself was an Apostle.</hi> Of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94326:104"/>
same Mind is <hi>Salmasius,</hi> that James <hi>resided not at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>as one of their
Hierarchick Bishops, but as an Apostle</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Vide inter alia <hi>Wal. Mess. Page</hi> 45. Et seq. &amp; <hi>Page</hi> 193. Et seq.</note> And yet D. <hi>M.</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="bottom">Page 138.</note> is
not asham'd to tell his Reader, as <hi>the Concession of</hi> Salmasius, <hi>that we have
a Diocesan Bishop establish'd in the person of</hi> St. James <hi>the</hi> Just, <hi>in the City of</hi>
Jerusalem. Now that <hi>Hierome</hi> understood <hi>James</hi>'s Episcopacy in the
sense giv'n by <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> against the Jesuites, is most apparent
especially if we consider how the Ancients us'd to speak of the Apostles
and Apostolick extraordinary Church-Officers in the Stile of their own
times, and how positive <hi>Hierome</hi> was for the Identity of Bishop and
Presbyter during the Apostolick age and first primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>Add hereto that <hi>Hierome</hi> (as he shews in his Preamble to <hi>Dexter</hi>) was
altogether uncertain of much of what he wrote in his <hi>Catalogue of Writers,</hi>
which is yet more clear from his account of <hi>Paul,</hi> for the writes that <hi>he
was a Native of</hi> Gischalis, <hi>and during the Wars between the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>sted with his Parents to</hi> Tarsus <hi>when</hi> Gischalis was taken. Which,
I'm sure, <hi>Hierome,</hi> a Man so well acquaint with the Affairs of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
who had no Wars with the <hi>Romans</hi> for many years after the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Fabler, whom <hi>Hierome</hi> transcribes, suppos'd these Wars to have
been commens'd, and <hi>Gischalis</hi> taken, could never believe; but only,
because he could light on no better, transcrib'd things as he found 'em.
Which removes, tho' no more could be said, D. <hi>M</hi>'s Objection from
<hi>Hierome</hi>'s mentioning of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, whereon D. <hi>M.</hi> with no
small Ostentation insists. He follows also <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objecting that <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome
makes Bishops the Apostles Successors.</hi> But <hi>Junius</hi> Replies that <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome
denies not this to be also the priviledge of Presbyters.</hi> It's also objected
by Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="bottom">Vind. St. <hi>Ignat.</hi> Part 1. Pages 191, 192.</note> 
                     <hi>that</hi> Hierome, <hi>in his Epistle to</hi> Heliodorus, <hi>speaks of the
Deacons as the third Order.</hi> And seeing this, of all the passages of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
produc'd by the Papists to involve him in self-repugnancy, is most
plausible, take it at full length. <hi>If a Man</hi> (saith <hi>Hierome</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="bottom">Epist. ad <hi>Heliodorum.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
the Office of a Bishop, he desires a good Work: These things we know;
but add what follows,</hi> A Bishop then must be blameless <hi>&amp;c. and having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
the rest of the things which there follow concerning a Bishop, the Apostle
uses no less diligence in setting forth the Duties of the third Degree, saying,</hi>
Likewise let the Deacons be grave <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But passing that he was scarce
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94326:105"/>
more than a Child when he wrote that Epistle, and wrote clearly for the
Identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> in his riper years, it's certain he pretends
no Divine Warrant for this Tripartition. Yea from the very words
they would now detort, it's most evident that tho' <hi>Hierome,</hi> following
the Custome of his Age, mentions a third Degree, he notwithstanding
takes both <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> for one and the same thing. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
in this same Epistle <hi>Hierome</hi> makes <hi>all who had the Power of Dispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sacraments, Successor, to the Apostles</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="bottom">Absit ut de his quicquam sinistrum loquar: qui Apostolico gradui succedentes, Christi corpus sacro ore conficiunt: per quos &amp; nos Christiani sumus &amp;c.</note>. which the Jesuites and
their Supporters appropriat to Bishops: hence they are baffl'd with the
very places of <hi>Hierome</hi> they endeavour to abuse.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. But I return to <hi>Hierome, Philippi,</hi> continues he, <hi>is a single Town
of</hi> Macedonia, <hi>and truly in one City there could not be (called are they as</hi>)
moe Bishops. But because at that time they called the same Men
both Bishops and Presbyters, therefore he spoke indifferently concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
both Bishops and Presbyters. <q>From these words (saith <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="bottom">Appendice ad Hierarchiam <hi>Lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 5.</note> It can be evidently demonstrated that <hi>Hierome</hi> believed that
Bishops and Presbyters were not one and the same Order, yea even
in the Age of the Apostles: For had he so believ'd he had never said
that there could not be a plurality of Bishops in one City, when surely
there was a plurality of Presbyters.</q> As if <hi>Jerome</hi>'s whole discourse,
scope, and conclusion, were not directly opposite to what the Jesuite
impudently fathers on him, who in the words <hi>Petavius</hi> abuses, only
meets with some <hi>Wranglers</hi> as he elsewere terms them, who, to elude
the proof <hi>Jerome</hi> brought for the Identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> from
<hi>Philippians 1. &amp;</hi> 1. absurdly contended that in the City of <hi>Philippi</hi>
alone there were a multitude of Bishops distinguish,d from, and
superior to other Pastors. <q>But yet this may seem doubtfull (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous
<hi>Jerome</hi>) to some except it be confirmed by another Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
It is written in the Acts of the Apostles that when the Apostle
was come to <hi>Miletum</hi> he sent to <hi>Ephesus</hi> and called for the Elders of
that Church, to whom, amongst other things, he said, take heed to
your selves and to the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made
you Bishops to feed the Church of Christ.—And observe this
diligently how the Apostle calling the Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was
but one City afterwards names them Bishops, if any receive the Epistle
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94326:105"/>
which under <hi>Paul</hi>'s Name is written to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there also the
care of the Church is equally divided amongst a plurality. For he
writes to the People, <hi>Obey your Governours and be subject to them,
for they watch</hi>—And <hi>Peter,</hi> who received his Name from the
strength of his Faith, saith in his Epistle, <hi>The Elders which are among
you I exhort who am also an Elder</hi>—We have enlarged on
these things that we might shew that among the Ancients Bishops were
all one with Presbyters.</q> 
                     <hi>Hierome</hi> then never, as <hi>Petavius</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
impudently pretend, thought that there had hapned no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or that Bishops bore greater bulk in his time than they had done
in the Age of the Apostles) <q>but by little and little to the end the seeds
of Schism might be remov'd, the whole care was devolv'd upon one;
wherefore as the Presbyters know that by the Custome of the Church
they are subject to their prefect, so let Bishops know that rather by
Custome than by the Truth of Christ's Institution they are greater than
Presbyters, and ought to Rule the Church in common with them, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitating
<hi>Moses</hi> who, when he alone had Power to Rule the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
chused other Seventy with whom he might judge the People.</q> Here
(say they) is a proof of Superiority of Bishops by Divine Right, but
they should remember that <hi>Hierome</hi> here undertook to prove the quite
contrary. And it's most injust to fish and search for self-contradictions
in any Author when with ease he may be understood otherways as the
Matter is here. <hi>Hierome</hi> is arguing <hi>a majori ad minus,</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> his
Practice who, tho' he had sole Authority by Divine Right, yet shar'd it
with others, to that which ought to have been done by the Bishops of
his time whom only Church Custome not Christ's Appointment had
raised over other Pastors. And indeed they might on equal grounds
inferr from <hi>John 13. 14. If I then your Lord and Master have washed
your Feet, ye onght also to Wash one anothers Feet,</hi> that every Apostle
yea and every Believer is Lord and Master of the rest.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. And writing to <hi>Euagrius I hear</hi> (saith <hi>Hierome</hi>) <q>there is one
so mad as to preferr the Deacons to the Presbyters that is to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
For seeing the Apostle clearly teaches that Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
are one and the same, how can a Server of Tables and Widows,
proudly preferr himself to these at whose Prayers the Sacrament of
Christ's Body and Blood is consecrated: you will require a Proof, hear
a Testimony, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy to all the Saints in</hi> Philippi <hi>with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94326:106"/>
and Deacons;</hi> would you have another Example in the <hi>Acts</hi> of
of the Apostles, <hi>Paul</hi> thus speaks to the Presbyters of one Church,
<hi>Take heed to your Selves and the whole Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath
made you Bishops to Rule the Church,</hi> &amp;c. And that none may conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
plead that in one City there were many Bishops, here also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Testimony wherein it's most evidently proved that both <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>
and <hi>Bishop</hi> were one and the same, and then produces the 1 to
<hi>Titus,</hi> and 1 to <hi>Timothy 4. 8. 14. neglect not—with the laying
on of the Hands of the Presbytry.</hi>
                     </q> And 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4 and 1. 2 <hi>John</hi> 1.
3 <hi>John</hi> 1. And all these to prove that he had undertaken viz <hi>that both
Bishop and Presbyter were one and the same.</hi> Now it's most observable that
that he inferrs this Conclusion not only from Scriptures written long
after the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where it's said, <hi>I am of Paul</hi> &amp;c.
but even from the last Epistle of <hi>John</hi> the longest Liver of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
And therefore no less notticeable is D. <hi>M</hi>'s extream stubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and aversion from Truth, who would force <hi>Hierome</hi> to introduce Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
presently after that Schism mention'd 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. And accordingly,
as his bad Cause oblig'd him to do with this and the rest of <hi>Hierome</hi>'s
Testimonies, wholly smuther'd it. And indeed all hitherto who have
adventur'd to graple therewith have been conquer'd thereby, yea even
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself is compell'd to give up the Cause. <hi>Hierome indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
(saith the Jesuite<note n="r" place="bottom">De Clericis. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note>) <hi>to conclude the equality of Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
from the Epistle to</hi> Titus, <hi>to the</hi> Philippians, <hi>and from the Epistles of</hi>
Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>which were written after the first Epistle to the Corinthians.</hi>
Neither can the Jesuite find another way to be even with <hi>Hierome,</hi> but
by arraigning him as fraughted with self-repugnancy, levity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability
in this Matter; and all the Arguments he brings to prove <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
a Favourer of Episcopacy are only so many fruitless Attempts to
make that appear.</p>
                  <p>But let us go on with <hi>Hierome. But</hi> (saith he) <hi>the reason why after
this</hi> (viz. the writing of both the Epistles of John) <hi>one was chosen and set
over the rest, was that there might be a remedy of Schism, least every one, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church of Christ to himself, should divide it. For in</hi> Alexandria <hi>from</hi>
Mark <hi>the Evangelist even to</hi> Heraclas <hi>and</hi> Dionysius <hi>the Presbyters still gave
to one elected from amongst themselves, and placed in a higher seat, the Name of
Bishop, as if an Army should creat a General, or the Deacons should chuse one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94326:106"/>
of themselves whom they know to be industrious and name him Arch-Deacon.</hi>
On these words D. <hi>M.</hi> triumphs, <hi>The Custome was</hi> (saith he) <hi>even
from the days of St.</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangelist that a Presbyter was chosen who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
the whole Society: this in the Opinion of St.</hi> Hierome <hi>cuts off that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Interval, wherein the Chruch is said to have been Governed by a Parity of
Presbyters.</hi> Where he forgeth a Gloss no way contain'd in the words of
<hi>Hierome,</hi> whose Example of an Army and Deacons are only adduc'd to
shew the manner of that Presbyter or nominat'd Bishop's entrance, and
not at all the measure of his Power over his Collegues. And that no
Power over the rest can be collected from this place is beyond Scruple
clear from <hi>Hierome</hi>'s present Scope, who introduces this Ancient <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian</hi>
Practice to clear and prove the Identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi>
which, according to him, remain'd in the Church for a while after the
Writings of <hi>John,</hi> the longest Liver of all the Apostles. Had D.
<hi>M.</hi> perused Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="bottom">Irenicum. Pages 273, and 274.</note> he had taught him <hi>that both Election and
Ordination of this</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Bishop was only performed by his Fellow Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
&amp; that the Original of</hi> Hierome'<hi>s</hi> exsors potestas, <hi>any Power he mentions
in Bishops over Presbyters, is by</hi> Hierome <hi>attributed not to any Episcopal Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
but to the free choice of the Presbyters themselves: for what doth a Bishop</hi>
(continues Hierome) <hi>except Ordination, which a Presbyter may not do.</hi> Here
the Jesuites and their Follower D. <hi>M.</hi> dream they find a fine Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made by <hi>Hierome</hi> between <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter:</hi> but first they must
make an unseasonable <hi>Antiptosis,</hi> and compell <hi>Hierome</hi> to speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the express words of this place which are in the present Tense,
contrary to the scope and design of this Epistle, which is professedly to
shew the great Dignity of Presbyters, yea even their Identity with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and thereby to reach a sharper reproof to the petulant Deacon.
And contrary, <hi>finally,</hi> to <hi>Hierome</hi>'s most clear and most frequently repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctrine of the Scriptural Identity of both Offices. Were it not mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
then to dream, with the Jesuits, that, in these words, <hi>Hierome</hi> makes
any Distinction between the Scripture-<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who is here
only asserting that in all places (<hi>Rome</hi> excepted, where the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were more depressed and the Deacons more raised than in other
Churches) even then in his time, a Presbyter was allow'd by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Constitutions of the Churches to do ought that a Bishop might
do, save Ordination alone. This his Design of holding forth the most
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94326:107"/>
great dignity of Presbyters, yea even their equality with Bishops, which
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges that he may the better compesce the Insolency
of the Deacons, <hi>Hierome</hi> all along this Epistle prosecutes: and having
again cited the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to prove that a Presbyter is
contain'd in, <hi>i. e.</hi> is one and the same with a Bishop, otherwayes a
Deacon is also in a Bishop; and so <hi>Hierome</hi> had crossed his own Design
by the very Argument wherewith he minded to compass it, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added some other Topicks to the same purpose, thus concludes his
Epistle. And that we may know that the Apostolick Traditions are
brought from the Old Testament, that which <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and
the Levites were in the Temple, the Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons
claim in the Church,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Nunc animis opus Aenaeae, nunc pectore firmo.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>All the Jesuites and their Complices will presently be about our Ears,
But</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Solamen nobis Soeios habuisse malorum.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Their Attaques are no less on <hi>Hierome</hi> than us, wherefore this is one
of the chief places brought by <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="bottom">De Clericis. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> to involve <hi>Hierome</hi> in a
maze of self-contradiction, and make him propugn Prelacy, who is
followed by others of the Hierarchicks but chiefly the Jesuites: And
lastly in the rear comes D. <hi>M.</hi> concluding <q>that the Hierarchy of the
Christian Church is founded upon Apostolick Tradition, and that the
Apostles had the Modell of the Temple in their view when they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Plat-form.</q> But <hi>Junius</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="bottom">Col. 1213.</note> Answers <q>that their Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a <hi>non sequitur.</hi>
                     </q> For (saith he) <q>this comparison is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
between each of these particular Officers under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and these under the New, but in common shewing, that as they
are all obliged to serve the Church of the Jews, so all the Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
under the New Testament ought to serve the Christian Church.</q>
                     <hi>Moreover,</hi> (continues <hi>Junius</hi>) <q>tho' we should give that the Comparison
were particular, yet their Conclusion would not follow, seeing <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
speaks only of the Church Polity of his own time, and the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
now is about <hi>Hierome</hi>'s Sentiments of the Church Government

overthrows this their Jesuitical Doctrine, and Demonstrats <hi>that by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Tradition in</hi> Hierome <hi>only Ecclesiastick Custome of some Antiquity is
mean'd,</hi> &amp; asserts that <q>it's not imaginable that <hi>Jerome</hi> who had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all along the Superiority of a Presbyter above a Deacon, because
of his Identity with a Bishop in the Apostles times should at the same
time say that a Bishop was above a Presbyter by the Apostles Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so directly overthrow all he had been saying before.</q> 
                     <hi>The
plain meaning</hi> (continues Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet) then of</hi> Jerome <hi>is no more but
this, that as</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons in the Order of Priesthood were above the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
under the Law: So the Bishops and Presbyters in the Order of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Priesthood are above the Deacons under the Gospel.</hi> 
                     <q>For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
runs not between <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons under the Law, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Presbyters under the Gospel; but between <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
Sons, as one part of the Comparison under the Law, and the Levites
under them as the other; so under the Gospel, Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
make one part of the Comparison, answering to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
Sons in that wherein they all agree; viz. <hi>the Order of Priesthood;</hi> and
the other part under the Gospel is that of Deacons, answering to the
Levites under the Law. The Opposition is not then in the Power
of Jurisdiction between Bishops and Priests, but between the same
Power of Order, which is alike both in Bishops and Presbyters (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the acknowledgement of all) to the Office of Deacons
which stood in Competition with them—Hereby we see how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happyly
those Arguments succeed, which are brought from the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
between the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priesthood, to endeavour the setting up
of a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of a paralell Superiority under the Gospel. All
which Arguments are taken off by this one thing we're now upon, viz,
that the Orders and Degrees under the Gospel, were not taken up
from Analogy to the Temple.</q>—Other passages of <hi>Jerome</hi> they

I would fain know whether a Man's Judgement must be taken

Discourses; which is as much as to ask, whether the lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation

to such Dreams, as even most of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yea and of
the Romanists either acted by the love of the Truth or compell'd by its

the Bishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> renounce and explode so

<hi>that</hi> Hierome <hi>is all one with</hi> Aërius <hi>in this, that Bishops by Divine

of one and the same Mind, we have heard also granted by the

some whereof acknowledge, that none could be of another Opinion
concerning them. And <hi>Benedictus Justinianus</hi> and other Romanists are of

most partial and disingenuous Dealers, we have now to do with? O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this pass, I'm sure they should make but small account of the sory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<hi>Petavius</hi> makes <hi>Hierome</hi> leave them, as being altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
for support of the Pomp and Splendor of their Hierarchy. To
these add the Jesuite <hi>Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

serpentine windings to elude and deprave these clear Testimonies of
<hi>Hierome,</hi> at length, seeing all would not do, rejects them all as the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
of unlucky <hi>Aërian</hi> hands never written by <hi>Hierome.</hi> For which
<hi>Cellotius</hi> is chastised even by <hi>Petavius</hi> and others of the Loyolites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Into such Discord, Confusion and Torment do Men usually
throw themselves, so soon as they obstinatly resolve to wage War with
so clear and irradiant Verities. And here it's observable that in all times,
and in all Churches, the Authority of <hi>Hierome</hi> has been exceeding great,
and above most of the primitive Writers which came not to pass without
a special Divine Providence that he, and in him the whole primitive
Church whose Judgement in these Matters he most clearly delivers,
might remain as an unsuspected and an uncontroverted witness against
some of latter Ages pretendedly Catholick but really Sectarian Nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.
Among the great Services he did to the Church, two Pieces are
more especially notticeable viz. his most clear asserting and acurat distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
the Canonical Books from the Apocryphal above all who han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
or wrote of that great and most necessary Article: and, which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94326:109"/>
is the Matter in hand, his Antiprelatick Doctrine of the Identity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and Presbyter: these not only <hi>Hieronymian,</hi> but also truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Doctrines are with equall fierceness impugn'd by the Romanists:
and I appeal to the impartial Reader if their Exceptions against this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be a whit more solide than these which are advanced against the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
viz. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s Judgement of the Canonical Scriptures which are to
be found collected and learn'dly refuted by Dr. <hi>Cosin</hi>

these Sophisters, endeavouring to subvert these Catholick Doctrines of
<hi>Hierome,</hi> dash only on an Adamantine Rock: for as never any Articles
were better founded, so, notwithstanding of whatsoever practical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrations

all the difficulty is, how a</hi> Jus Divinum <hi>should be prov'd, when Men leave
the Scriptures.</hi> But in the recounting and transcribing of such Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
or Testimonies, I will not inlarge. And now having rescued the
principal Scriptures, our Antagonists detort in favours of their Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between Bishop and Presbyters, and vindicated some places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
adduc'd for the Identity thereof, as also evinced that the most

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94326:109"/>
may with confidence conclude that <hi>Ignatius</hi> had none before him of the

                  <p>HAving viewed the Apostolick Writings and dived into their most
ancient Commentators and primitive Doctors, and having found
that in the time of the Apostles the immediat Ancestors of <hi>Ignatius</hi>
there was in the Church no such thing as a Diocesan Prelate. Let us
next look unto what remains of his Contemporaries or these who lived
near <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s time, and we shall have ground to deduce the same Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
And first it's observable that these Writers, such as <hi>Clemens
Romanus</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (for the rest that bear his Name
are undoubtedly spurious) <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippians, Hermas</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
Justine Martyr,</hi> tho' they, as occasion offers, frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Pastors, Doctors, Bishops, Presbyters, indifferently taking all
of 'em for on and the same Office, yet of a Diocesan Prelat, or one set
over other Pastors, or over these that had Power of Dispensing the
Word and Sacraments, in all their Writings have not a syllable. Which
Argument against a Diocesan Prelat, tho' negative, is not to be slighted
if we consider these Authors their closs Vicinity to the Apostles the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
they had to have mention'd him had he been then existent, their
more than a Pythagorick silence concerning him. Yea the same kind
of negative Argumentation <hi>Eusebius</hi> uses, while he disproves and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes
some Writings forg'd in the Name of <hi>John, Andrew, and other
Apostles</hi>

                     <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>no ancient Ecclesiastick Writers mention
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94326:110"/>
these Books.</hi> We shall find moreover that they positively disclaim Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan

commends their former carriage in these words, <q>Ye walked
in the commands of God, and being obedient to these that had the

                     <q>Wherefore the Apostles, preaching the
Word thro' the severall regions, and proving by the Spirit the first
fruits thereof, ordain'd Bishops and Deacons for these who should
believe: neither was this a new Ordinance, for many ages before, it
was written concerning Bishops; for so in a certain place saith the
Scripture, <hi>I will appoint their Bishops in Righteousness and their Deacons in

                     <q>Our Apostles by Jesus Christ our Lord knew that
there would arise Contention concerning the Name of a Bishop, and
therefore, being endew'd with a perfect Fore-knowledge, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
the fore-said Officers, and left unto us describ'd the particular
services of both Ministers and Offices, to the end that approv'd Men
might succeed in the place of the defunct, and execute their Office.
These therefore who are ordain'd by them or by other famous men
with the Consent of the whole Church, who blamelesly serv'd the
Sheepfold of Christ with humility and quietness, &amp; without baseness,
and who for a long time had a good Testimony from all: These, I say,

who were the Authors of this Division subject your selves to your
<hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                     </q> Hence Observe <hi>First,</hi> that he never names, or so much as
insinuats that in <hi>Corinth</hi> there was any Bishop Superintendent over
the rest of the Pastors. But as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, honours equally all their Pastors with the Title of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>these that bear Rule over them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That, in imitation of the same Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> he names only
Bishops and Deacons as the only Orders of Divine Institution, by whom
the whole Gospel-Service was to be perform'd. Therefore afterward
when he names Presbyters in distinction from the Flock and as Rulers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, he cann't be understood (as <hi>Petavius</hi> and <hi>Pearson</hi> would force
him) to speak of Presbyters with Relation and Respect only of their
Age, but to give them this Demonstration as a peculiar Designation of a
Church-Office; and so the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> most of necessity with <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
coincide in its meaning with the word Bishop, and both of 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Synonymous Terms to hold forth but one and the same thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Apostles did not, as we find afterward Decreed by
the Synod of <hi>Sardica,</hi> and admonish'd by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> chuse out only the
greater Cities, and neglect and forbear to place Bishops in lesser Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<hi>that the name of</hi> Bishop <hi>hereby might not fall into Contempt,</hi> but
indifferently and without distinction of places every where settled them
according as there was a probability they might serve the great end of
their calling therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That to found the Distinction and number of these Orders,
if we believe <hi>Clement,</hi> the Apostles had no eye unto the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church-Polity,
so as to make it a Pattern for that of the Christian, but only to
what was prophecied and foretold by the Prophets concerning a new
frame of the New Testament Church, and thus <hi>Clement</hi> really contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
all the Patrons of the Hierarchy, who would still found their triple
Orders on that of the High-Priest, Priests and Levites of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That in <hi>Corinth</hi> it was attempted to throw out a plurality of
real Bishops and cast them from their Charge, and that the Sedition was
not moved against one only but divers Bishops in that Church. Many
other things might be observed; but these serve sufficiently to prove
that there was a plurality of true Bishops of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who were in nothing
distinguished from Pastors of particular Flocks, or preaching Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

from the words of <hi>Clement.</hi> Wherefore he scrapes together se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things whereby to ward off the force of these Passages: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that <hi>Clemens his silence of the Bishop of</hi> Corinth <hi>makes nothing for us.
For Pope Siricius</hi> (saith he) <hi>in his Epistle to the Church of</hi> Millain <hi>maketh
no mention of their Bishop, altho' in that mean time</hi> Ambrose <hi>occupied the Chair.</hi>
But the vast Difference between the Cases and the Circumstances of the
Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Millain</hi> quite nullifies the Jesuites Instance.
The People of <hi>Millain</hi> jointly both Clergy and Laity had thrust out <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian,</hi>
few or none of them (for ought we hear) being prosylited to
his Doctrine: wherefore <hi>Siricius</hi> had nothing to do but shew them in
General that he had excommunicated <hi>Jovinian</hi> with two or three others
who had fled to <hi>Rome</hi> for Sanctuary. So there was no special Ground or
Cause why particular mention should be made of <hi>Ambrose</hi> the Bishop,
or any other, whether of the Clergy or Laity, the whole Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for ought now known, being without any Schism earnest enough for
the expulsion of <hi>Jovinian,</hi> and only expecting what the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
which they acknowledged as the first See, and whether <hi>Jovinian</hi> had
fled, would do in this Matter. Whereas, one the other hand, <hi>Clemens</hi>
writes to a Church cut in pieces with a Schism in their own Bowels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Sedition of no small part of the People against their Pastors,
broken with (as appears plain) a division of the very Pastors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and this grown to such a hight, that some of the Pastors were
thrust from their places, and driv'n out: now in this Case the Bishop
had either the best of it; and so the seditious part merited a severe, and
special reprimand on the account of their Opposition to, and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from their Bishop, and thus he should certainly have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned:
or else he was the Cause of the Division; or, at least, joined
with the injurious, and therefore should have been particularly reproved
or admonished. <hi>Clement,</hi> it's true, names none: but the influence which
the good or evil Carriage the Bishop had, and could not but have
in such a Matter, had certainly obliged <hi>Clement</hi> either to mention
his name of give some signification of him, if there had been any Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
Bishop existent in <hi>Corinth. Clemens</hi> speaks of several Pastors of
Flocks, which I think none will deny, intimats the diversity of their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in that Business, and gives Directions accordingly. How can it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94326:111"/>
be apprehended that he should pass over the chief Pastor, and go to the
rest without so much as the least Direction unto him, the least mention
of him, yea or the least insinuation that there was, in <hi>Corinth,</hi> any such
thing. <hi>Petavius</hi>'s next Attempt is on these words of <hi>Clement,</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">Page 98.</note> where
he tells that <hi>the Apostles instituted Bishops and Deacons.</hi> And the Jesuite
contends, that <hi>two distinct Orders are not here mean'd, but that the word</hi> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
<hi>is only explicative of the former word</hi> Bishop, and cites several places
where <hi>the word</hi> Deacon <hi>is taken in a signification of Honour, and applied to
the Apostles and Civil</hi> Magistrates: And afterward terms <hi>Salmasius ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi>
for saying that Clemens <hi>nam'd only</hi> Bishops <hi>and</hi> Deacons <hi>without
mention of</hi> Presbyters. <hi>For</hi> (saith the Jesuite) Presbyters <hi>are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mention'd by</hi> Clement <hi>than either Bishops or Deacons.</hi> But certainly
these Orders are again and again mention'd by <hi>Clement</hi> without adding
any thereto ordetracting therefrom; when he appears to reckon up all
the Church-Officers that are of Divine Institution. And altho' the word
Deacon be sometimes taken for the Designation of a higher Office.
Yet, as <hi>Petavius</hi> himself<note n="k" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Appendice ad Hierar. Eccles. Lib. 2. Cap.</hi> 5. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem Diaconus aliàs, idque passim, non propriè, sed appellativè sumitur: &amp; tunc ferè aliud nomen in gignendi casu huic adjungitur &amp;c.</note> else where observes, <hi>It is with the addition
of such a word or phrase as guides our Judgement, and gives us to learn that
by it is not understood this lower Order of Church-Officers as</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>the
Magistrate is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Minister of God.</hi> But there is
no such explicative word or particle in <hi>Clement</hi> to alter the common Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
thereof, on which account we're not lightly to resile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
But that which utterly overthrows the Jesuite's Cause, is <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s
closs Conformity to the Apostle in his account of Church-Orders,
who 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. beyond all Scruple of any Party, takes these words in
the sense we plead for to <hi>Clement,</hi> and makes not at all the word Deacon
exegetick and explicative of the word Bishop: but by it designs a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Order of Church-Officers from what is signifi'd by the other. For
doubtless <hi>Clement Paul</hi>'s Fellow-Labourer took the words in the same
signification and meaning, wherein the Apostle had understood them.
And accordingly <hi>Clement,</hi> for Confirmation hereof, adduces the words
of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 60. 17. which place, as he then certainly found it in the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,
contains the words <hi>Bishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons</hi> exactly as <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth &amp;
distinguisheth Church-Officers: and on this Ground <hi>Clement</hi> goes when
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94326:112"/>
he intimats that the Apostles in their Institution of Church-Officers had
an eye to these words of the Prophet. In vain therefore labours <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to disprove the Copy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> used by <hi>Clement,</hi> and brings the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<hi>Hierome</hi> and others taking the word <hi>in a different signification:</hi> for
thus he hath not <hi>Salmasius</hi> or any other modern Defender of Presbytry
but <hi>Clement</hi> himself, whom he pretends to vindicate, for his Adversary:
seeing we Dispute not concerning the Greek Copy <hi>Clement</hi> used, but of
the thing he inferr'd from these words of <hi>Isaiah</hi> according to the Copy
he then cited. Neither is it more to the Jesuite's advantage that the
word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is several times found in <hi>Clement.</hi> For seeing, as is plain,
yea and the Jesuite himself not only grants but proves, that it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there denotes, not a degree of Age but a Church-Officer, it must of
necessity be a Term altogether Synonymous with the word Bishop. For
they themselves plead not for the Equipolency thereof with the word
Deacon, wherein <hi>Petavius</hi> himself shall afford us no small assistance, who
having, but to no purpose (seeing never Man denied it) shewed that
with <hi>Clement</hi> the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is sometimes taken appellatively, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
old Age but no Church-Officer, subjoins these remarkable words;
<hi>At other times Clement so uses the word</hi> Presbyter <hi>as thereby to signifie a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Function and publick Office in the Ministry, and a certain Dignity in the
Church, which he calls an Episcopacy or the Office of a Bishop.</hi> From this
plain Testimony of a Man in learning, and love to Prelacy, second to
none that ever undertook its Defence, it's clear, as the Light it self, that
with <hi>Clement</hi> the word <hi>Bishop</hi> and the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> when he takes it
for a Church-Function, are Terms altogether Synonymous. For if
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Episcopacy</hi> or the Office of a <hi>Bishop</hi> be competent to <hi>Clement</hi>'s
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> and things as they ought, receive Denominations from Forms
wherewith they're cloathed, then this <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the Judgement of
<hi>Clement</hi> is really a Bishop, and indeed this is superlatively clear to any,
who, but with an open and unprepossess'd Mind reads the places of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
we have already produced. Howbeit the Testimony of such an
Adversary gives no small additional Confirmation to the Truth thereof.
Yea the same Adversary in the same place acknowledges, that <hi>even then
the Title of Bishop was also common, and in after times only appropriated to one.</hi>
And again, <hi>It's clear</hi> (saith Petavius) <hi>from this place, that there was a
Council or Ecclesiastick Senate ordain'd by the Apostles at</hi> Corinth; <hi>whose
Dignity and Office</hi> Clemens <hi>calls Episcopacy, and the chiefest of the Clergy he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94326:112"/>
names Presbyters, as also from this which</hi> Clement <hi>afterward writes. It's base
Beloved, yea most base &amp;c.</hi> And he names <hi>the same Presbyters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Church-Governours of the Christian Sheepsold.</hi> And now judge
how the Jesuite after these Concessions could yet say, that it follows not
from hence that in <hi>Corinth</hi> or at other Cities there was no peculiar Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. And here again we find D. <hi>M.</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Page 44. <hi>Et seq.</hi>
                     </note> at his old filching Trade
transcribing <hi>Petavius</hi> his Perversions of <hi>Clement,</hi> or bringing what is no
more serviceable to either Cause or Credit: as <hi>that</hi> Clement <hi>comprehends
all the Jewish Clergy under the name of Priests and Levites: Therefore</hi> (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs
D. <hi>M.) It follows not from</hi> Clement <hi>his naming only Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
that Bishops and Presbyters are not in</hi> Clement <hi>distinct Offices.</hi> But D.
<hi>M.</hi> should remember that <hi>Clement</hi> not only <hi>Dichotomizes</hi> but <hi>Trichoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes</hi>
the Jewish Clergy into three Parts. But does he any where so
divide the Christian Clergy? He not only names the two Kinds of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
but so names them as to identifie and take for one and the same
<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter:</hi> which <hi>Petavius</hi> and D. <hi>M.</hi> and their Brethren by
all means labour to make him <hi>distinguish. But</hi> St. <hi>Clement</hi> (saith D. <hi>M.)
exhorting the</hi> Corinthians <hi>to order sets before them the subordination under the
Temple-Service, how the High-Priest, Priests, and Levites were distinguish'd
by their proper Service, and immediatly recommends to them, that every one of
them should continue in his proper Order. Now</hi> (continues D. <hi>M.)
when we consider the primitive Method of reasoning from Jewish precedents, St.</hi>
Clement <hi>had never talked at this rate, if the Jurisdiction of one over many
Priests had been abolished under the New Testament.</hi> But, why does he mutter,
for it if he can bring ought for his purpose he must also Inferr from this
passage of <hi>Clement</hi>

to Harmony. Whether then D. <hi>M.</hi> be a Romanist or a Jew
may be a Question; for unquestionably his way of reasoning symbolizes
with both of them. The Truth is, nothing can be inferr'd from this

place of <hi>Clement,</hi> but that as under the Old Testament every one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

raising Schism or Confusion, so it ought to be under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<hi>as the principal City, and from thence transmitted to its dependencies &amp;c.</hi> By
which words, if he speaks sense, he intimats that there were in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
age Metropolitan Cities in an Ecclesiastick sense, whose Bishops
according to the Civil Dignity of these Cities were Metropolitan, and
had their numbers of inferiour and dependent Bishops. A most nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous
and hatefull Hypothesis of some giddy Papaturiants which, as we

                  <p>
                     <hi>I shall shut up all concerning</hi> Clement <hi>with the Suffrages of two illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Names, neither whereof, I'm sure, did ever favour Presbytry:
I mean</hi> Grotius <hi>and</hi> Stillingfleet. Had Episcopacy (<hi>saith the Doctor</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="bottom">Iren. page 279.</note>)
been instituted on the occasion of the Schism at <hi>Corinth,</hi> certainly of all places,
we should the soonest have heard of a Bishop at <hi>Corinth</hi> for the remedying of
it; and yet almost of all places, these Heralds that derive the Succession of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, are the most plunged whom to six on at <hi>Corinth.</hi>
And they that can find any one single Bishop at <hi>Corinth</hi> at the time when <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
writ his Epistle to them (about another Schism as great as the former,
which certainly had not been according to their Opinion, if a Bishop had been
there before) must have better Eyes and Judgement, than the deservedly admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Grotius,</hi> who brings this in his Epistle to <hi>Bignonius</hi> as an Argument of the
undoubted Antiquity of that Epistle, <hi>quod nusquam meminit exsortis &amp;c.</hi>
that <hi>Clement</hi> no where mentions, that singular Authority of Bishops which by
Church custome after the Death of <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and by its Example
in other places began to be introduced, but <hi>Clemens</hi> clearly shews as did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul,</hi> that then by the common Council of the Presbyters who both by <hi>Paul,</hi>
and <hi>Clement</hi> are called Bishops, the Churches were governed.</p>
                  <p>§. 4. I proceed next to the Vindication of Polycarp. <hi>Subject your
selves</hi> (saith he<note n="o" place="bottom">Epist. ad <hi>Philipp.</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>to the</hi> Presbyters <hi>and</hi> Deacons <hi>as to God and Christ,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94326:113"/>
and, as Virgins, walk with a pure Conscience, let the Presbyters be simple or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
mercifull in all things, turning all Men from their Errors, visiting all
who are weak, not neglecting Widows, Orphans, and those that are Poor, but
alwayes providing such things as are good in the sight of God and Men.</hi> Here
we learn that the highest Office then in the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> was that
of a Presbyter, and that there was a Plurality to whom the <hi>Philippians</hi>
were to be subjected without the least mention of a particular Bishop
governing those Presbyters. And, which deserves no overly Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
we here see that as, when <hi>Clement</hi> gives an account of Church
Orders, he named two only, so we have the same number expressed by
<hi>Polycarp,</hi> but they altered their Denomination of the former Order, and
they whom <hi>Clement</hi> calls sometimes <hi>Bishops,</hi> sometimes Presbyters, <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>
calls still Presbyters. It's most observable also, how both <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Polycarp</hi> subject the Church of one single City <hi>Philippi</hi> to a Plurality
or Multitude of Pastors, whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls Bishops, and <hi>Polycarp</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
From all which the Identity of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> most inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
results.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. And indeed this Passage of <hi>Polycarp</hi> so much gravells the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchicks,
that Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> is driven to his last Leggs, and compelled to
present us with a shift unworthy of its Author. <hi>Who can prove</hi> (saith
he<note n="p" place="bottom">Vind. Ignat. Part. 2. Page 168. <hi>Sed quis dabit Episcopum</hi> Philippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium <hi>tunc in vivis fuisse? Quis praestabit</hi> Philippenses <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>that the Bishop of</hi> Philippi <hi>was then alive, who can shew us, that
the</hi> Philippians <hi>asked not Counsel at</hi> Polycarp, <hi>for this cause, that they then
enjoyed not a Bishop, for thus</hi> Polycarp <hi>bespeaks them. These things Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I write not of my self to you concerning righteousness, but you have moved
me thereunto.</hi> Thus <hi>Pearson,</hi> and indeed it's enough here to return the
Question inverted, who is able to prove, if there had been a Bishop in
<hi>Philippi,</hi> that he was not alive? For seeing he affirms it, he or his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats
are obliged to instruct what they say. That which he pretends to
from these words of the Epistle <hi>wherein Polycarp</hi> saith <hi>he was moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the</hi> Philippians <hi>themselves,</hi> affords him not the least support; there
not being therein one syllable concerning the vacancy of the Bishops
Seat or the Church Government during this Defect; or how to fill the
Chair. Of all or any of these <hi>nec vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nec vestigium,</hi> but only (as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
from <hi>Polycarp</hi>) they seem to have desir'd of him some Direction
concerning the blameless walk of any Christian. And indeed, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94326:114"/>
within a very few lines fairly yeelds the Cause, really acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had said nothing to the purpose. <hi>But seeing</hi> (saith he) <hi>these
things are uncertain, we have no certainty from the Discourse of</hi> Polycarp.
Well then, it must follow, for ought he knew, that <hi>Polycarp</hi> knew no
Diocesan Bishop in <hi>Philippi,</hi> that he had never heard of his Death, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing hereof can be gathered from him. And that he had never
heard of his Life or Being, we may well conclude from this, that he
devolves the whole Church-Affairs upon a Plurality of Presbyters. But
once again; Is it at all credible, but that if <hi>Polycarp</hi> had written to the
<hi>Philippians</hi> after the death of their Bishop and during the vacancy of the
Chair, he had comforted them after this so considerable a Loss, and
giv'n them Directions for chusing of a worthy Successor, especially if
[as <hi>Pearson</hi> would have] they had ask'd his counsell concerning this
very Matter? Had ever a Pastor like <hi>Polycarp</hi> neglected so seasonable
an Office? His profound silence therefore of the Death of any such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
in <hi>Philippi</hi> sufficiently demonstrats that this Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi>'s Invention
was only the product of a desperate Cause, and that there was left here
no doore of Escape.</p>
                  <p>And here let me observe that <hi>Philippi</hi> is no less fatal to the Episcopals,
than its neighbouring plains were to the <hi>Pompeians:</hi> for they are stung
and confounded with the very first words of <hi>Paul</hi> to that Church, and,
as we have heard, amongst their other wild shifts, they answer <hi>that the
Bishop was often absent.</hi> But there was a good number of years between
the writing of <hi>Paul</hi> and that of <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and yet we
see the Bishop is never come home; <hi>Why taryeth the wheel of his Lordship's
Chariot?</hi> Hath he not <hi>sped</hi> at Court? And having supplanted some of
the Nobility, made a <hi>prey</hi> of the Office of <hi>Chancellour</hi> or <hi>Treasourer,</hi> that
after so long absence there is no news of his return? Nor are we ever like
to hear any more of him, <hi>for now</hi> [say they] <hi>he's dead:</hi> I had perhaps
believ'd them, were't not impossible for one to die who was never alive.
But enough of this; for such Answers would really tempt one to think
that their Authors studi'd nothing more than to ridicule their oun Cause
and afford Game to their Reader.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. And here I cann't but nottice the ill-grounded vapouring of
D. <hi>M.</hi> who<note n="q" place="bottom">pag. 49. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>
                     </note> from the inscription of the Epistle (<hi>Polycarp and the
Presbyters that are with him</hi>) concludes that <hi>he was vested with Episcopal
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94326:114"/>
jurisdiction and eminency amongst these Presbyters.</hi> And so much he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to bring out of <hi>Blondel</hi> as as his <hi>forc</hi>'d Confession, which is so far
from being true, that it's brought in by <hi>Blondel</hi> as an Objection and
silly Conjecture of the Episcopals, which he<note n="r" place="bottom">Apolog. prosent. <hi>Hieron.</hi> pag. 14. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi>
                     </note> diverse ways over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws.
And indeed never was there a more wretch'd deduction fram'd,
seeing, as <hi>Blondel</hi> at large shews, the phrase natively yealds only this
sense viz. <hi>Polycarp and the rest of the Presbyters of that Colleage.</hi> And thus
D. <hi>M.</hi> may as well inferr <hi>Peter's</hi> Superiority and Power over the rest of
the Apostles from <hi>Acts 2. 37. To</hi> Peter <hi>and to the rest of the Apostles.</hi>
Moreover <hi>Blondel</hi> demonstrats how, on diverse accounts, <hi>Polycarp</hi>
without any Eminency and Power over the rest may be particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
rather than others; as, because he was first in Order and Years.
But I insist not herein, but referr to <hi>Blondel</hi> who hath nervously baffl'd
this their pitifull Coujecture. D. <hi>M.</hi> adventures to ingage with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what he saith, and yet is not asham'd to bring to the Field so
blunted a weapon. I pass also D. <hi>M.</hi>'s two Arguments for <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s
Diocesan Episcopacy, drawn from the pretended Succession of Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Bishops in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> mention'd by <hi>Polycarp,</hi>
having overthrown both of 'em already, and proceed to the Testimony
of <hi>Hermas</hi> who<note n="s" place="bottom">Lib. 1. Vis. 2.</note> thus speaks: <hi>Thou shalt write two Books, thou shalt

Cities; for to him this is permitted: and</hi> Graptes <hi>shall admonish the Widows

City who govern the Church.</hi> Where we see that not any one Bishop, but
a Colledge of Presbyters (call'd, doubtless, afterward by the same
Author, Bishops) govern'd the Church of one City. Yet D. <hi>M.</hi>
pretends to find here a palpable Evidence of Episcopacy; <hi>For</hi> (saith
he<note n="t" place="bottom">pag. 53. <hi>&amp;</hi> seq.</note>) <hi>the sending of the Encyclical Epistle to foraign Cities is insinuated to
be the peculiar Priviledge of</hi> Clement <hi>then Bishop of Rome.</hi> But if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from this place of <hi>Hermas</hi> that <hi>Clement</hi> had any Power over these
to whom he was to send that Book or Epistle (as for <hi>Clement's</hi> being
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> it's so far from being insinuated here, that the quite
contary is from this very place most evident) he may as well inferr
from <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 16. that they had Power over the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> whither
they were to send, and cause to be read the Apostle's Letter.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> D. <hi>M.</hi> ascribing to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> Power over <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi>
Cities, erects a Pope rather than a Bishop. But I'll assure him
he came not in so early: for seeing there was undoubtedly one Bishop
(at least) in every particular City so soon as there were any in the
World, this place of <hi>Hermas</hi> (if it bear D. <hi>M</hi>'s Inference and give
a Power to <hi>Clement</hi> over foraign Cities) insinuats nothing of a Bishop's
Dignity above Presbyters, but of the power of one Bishop over another
or rather of a Pope over other Churches. A falshood most unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exploded by <hi>Cyprian, Jerome, Augustine,</hi> and the rest of the Ancients
D. <hi>M.</hi> seeks also for his Prelacy in these words of <hi>Hermas viz.</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="bottom">Lib. 2. Mand. 12.</note>
The Earthly Spirit exalts it self and seeks the first seat.<note n="x" place="bottom">Lib. 3. Simil. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Some contend
for Principality and Dignity.</hi> But what if <hi>Hermas</hi> had said that some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to get an Empire and Popedome over the whole Church; would
D. <hi>M.</hi> hence conclude that it was lawfull or then practised in the
Church, or when the Apostles contended who should be the greatest?
Had Christ before that time assured them of the lawfulness of such an
Office, and told them, that they were to have one to be a Prince over
the rest? By no Logick therefore can it be inferred for <hi>Hermas</hi>
his words that a chief Seat or Principality (for both are one and the
same with <hi>Hermas</hi>) was then either exercised or held lawfull. Again,
tho' both had been then in Custome, no Power of one over the rest can
be hence concluded; seeing the chief Seats are given to the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Synods and other Presidents of Assemblies, who have no prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Power but only of Order. And again<note n="y" place="bottom">Lib. 1. Vis. 3.</note>, <hi>The polished and white

that of the Bishops who governed the Churches, and that of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
who had the charge of the Services, for it's acknowledged by
all that the Doctors are all one with the Bishops, when they are said
to have performed the Office of a Bishop, and that the Apostles as
they are opposed to Bishops, were placed above the whole Clergy.
This (repons D. <hi>M.</hi>) is Tergiversation with a Witness, and a frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94326:115"/>
Trick in <hi>Blondel,</hi> since Presbyters in the primitive Church are
frequently distinguished by the Name of <hi>Doctors:</hi> and <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
is a manifest violence offered to the Text, for Doctors are
not said to have performed the Office of a Bishop but to have taught:
and this is very agreeable to their Character, being so much imploy'd
by their respective Bishops in teaching the <hi>Catechumeni;</hi> and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
position of these words will allow of no other meaning.</q> Which
Answer D. <hi>M.</hi> hath learned from the Practice of our late Bishops,
during whose <hi>Epocha</hi> the Buffund might have hid himself well nigh the
whole year from the Bishop's fury in the Bishop's pulpit, seeing he
scarce ever came thither to play the Doctor or ought else. As for the
Ancient and true primitive Bishops, <hi>they perpetually preach'd or taught</hi>
(saith <hi>Le Moyn</hi>

was ever the <hi>Presbyter</hi> either in <hi>Cyprian</hi> or any other Ancient, called
<hi>Doctor</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Bishop</hi> but to other Ecclesiastick Presbyters,
who taught not, of whose existence, as was before touched, we have
most sufficient assurance. But D. <hi>M.</hi> in contradiction to the Apostle
would have a Bishop who is no Teacher or Preacher, like the Droll
who said, he mett with Priests who were no Clerks. And seeing with
<hi>Hermas</hi> there are but two Orders of Church-men, and Bishops, and
<hi>praesides Ecclesiarum</hi> Church Governours are reciprocal Terms taken for
one and the same: and seeing that his Presbyters are expresly term'd
Church-Governours; it's most evident that he takes <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
for one and the same, and that the word <hi>Doctor</hi> is purely exegetick
or explicative of the word <hi>Bishop,</hi> and that both of them, which I'm
sure is not unfrequent in all sorts of Authors, evidently signifie one and
the same thing.</p>

that mett for receiving the word and Sacraments, the Controversy
between us and the Hierarchicks, which is not about Names but Things,
is fully ended if they stand to <hi>Justine</hi>'s Decision.</p>
                  <p>§. 9. Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> would have <hi>Justine</hi> to be understood as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only of the Diocesan Bishops Church. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>to carry the
Bread and Wine to all absents in their severall Duellings, was not convenient nor
easy in numerous Congregations, and they knew not well who were absent.</hi>
But this Perversion is too wretch'd &amp; palpable to wheedle any in in his
right wit out of <hi>Justine</hi>'s plain Meaning. Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> knew well enough
that in these times of such Fervor and Love among Christians, and
such Veneration for the Lord's Supper, they doubtless most exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Ordinances, and absented not without speciall and weighty
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94326:116"/>
Causes. And seeing the Custome of receiving the Elements at home,
when they could not come to Church was then in vigour, and believed
to be their Duty (if these Elements were given to Absents as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Communion, or were only the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the Love Feasts,</hi> I now dispute not) they took spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
care to signifie their Absence and Causes thereof, by their Relations
or Christian Brethren to their Deacons, and such as were concerned to
know it. Neither, if we consider the Church-Discipline of these
times, is it to be doubted that the Deacons had an exact List of all to
whom they were each Lords Day to give the Sacrament, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by no means could be ignorant who were either absent or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Wherefore, tho' the Deacons had been fewer than they were,
they could easily, tho' the whole Congregation had been never so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
carry the Elements to these very few whom sickness or other
lawfull and weighty Reasons had confined to their Habitations: all
which Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> well enough perceived; and therefore he's here
no less feeble in his Actings than a man breathing his last, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
only such triffles as may make his Friends ashamed and confirm his
Adversaries. Neither do I wonder hereat, seeing he undertook the
Defence of a palpable untruth: for not only speaks <hi>Justine</hi> of the
Christian Assemblies in common without the least exception, but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tells us that he speaks of the meatings of all the Christians for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word and Sacraments, not only in Cities, but in the Country
a place too base for the Cathedral and Diocesan Bishops Chair, and
of all such Congregations, as in the first day of the Week, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks, made Collections or had Deacons for that end, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to every Congregation where the Word and Sacraments are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed.
Neither is this ought but what we have discover'd to be the
Mind of their <hi>Ignatius</hi> himself, and seconded with the Suffrages of the
greatest Friends to Prelacy.</p>

Seeing <hi>Justine</hi> giving a Governour or Bishop to every Congregation,

Reason, viz. <hi>That</hi> Justine <hi>intended only to give a true account of what was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly
performed in the Christian Meetings in opposition to the abominable Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
propagated against them by their Enemies, so that he had no occasion to
reckon up the several Gradations of the Hterarchy,</hi> is equally favourable to
Prelatists and Papists, who may as well use it for a Sanctuary to their
Pope as they to their Prelats. And indeed had there then either been a
Pope over all or a Prelate with <hi>Princely Power</hi> as D. <hi>M.</hi> pleads for over
a multitude of Churches, the Christians seeing they were frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with an intended Rebellion, had found themselves obliged in
a special manner to apologize for their Princes and absolute Lords, who
would have been looked on as little less than the Emperour's Rivalls and
Arch-Promoters and Heads of the supposed Insurrection. Moreover,
which we have already noted, and fully shews the nullity of D. <hi>M</hi>'s
Reason, not only <hi>Justine</hi> but all the genuine Writings of them that went
before him, mention only, like <hi>Justine,</hi> these two Orders of Church-men.</p>
                  <p>D. <hi>M</hi>'s second Reason, viz. <hi>That the Christians were most shy to publish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing relating either to the Mysteries of their Religion or the Constitution of the
Church, more than was absolutely necessary in their own Defence &amp;c.</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lurking place for Romanists when urg'd to shew the Antiquity of
their Innovations: and indeed if it do any thing, it tends to prove that
no Party can make any Advantage of ought spoken or written by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and if so, have att the Foundation of Diocesan Prelacy, its prime
Advocats acknowledging that no Argument for it can be draun from
Scripture, but only from the writings of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>His third Reason is, <hi>that as the Offices, so the names of Bishop and Presbyter
were not only known to be distinguished in his days among the Christians</hi> (but
he brings no genuine Writer of that Age to prove this, and that it is most
false is already evinced) <hi>but even the Heathens knew so much:</hi> and cites <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>'s
Epistle to <hi>Servianus:</hi> but it's highly probable that the Emperour
if we allow him any knowledge of these Affairs, understands under the
name of <hi>Presbyters</hi> the very same Officers, the very same Men, that he
means by the name <hi>Bishops,</hi> rather than <hi>e contra:</hi> see Pray the Letter it

name Presbyter</hi> (saith <hi>Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet<note n="h" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Iren.</hi> Pages 285, and 286.</note>), <hi>as the Hebrew</hi> ZAKEN
<hi>tho' it originally import Age, yet by way of connotation it hath been looked on as a
Name both of Dignity and Power among the Jews, in the times of the Apostles,
it is most evident that the Name <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> imported not only Dignity but Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
the Presbyters among the Jews having Power both of Judging and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given them by their</hi> Semicha <hi>or Ordination. Now under the Gospel the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
retaining the Name, and the manner of Ordination, but not conferring
that judiciary Power by it, which was in use among the Jews, to shew the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Law and the Gospel, it was requisite some other Name should
be given to the Governours of the Church, which should qualifie the importance
of the word Presbyters to a sense proper to a Gospel state; which was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of giving the Name <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to the Governours of the Church under the
Gospel; a Name importing Duty more than Honour, and not a title above</hi>
Presbyter, <hi>but rather used by way of</hi> Diminution <hi>and Qualification of the
Power imply'd in the name of</hi> Presbyter <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Hierarchicks therefore
should act much more rationally if they turn'd the Tables, and gave the
name of <hi>Presbyter</hi> to their Diocesan, and that of the Bishop to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Curats, who usually do most of the Pastoral Work. In the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94326:119"/>
mean while it's sure from what we just now learned out of these Authors
that during sounder Antiquity, before men equally abused Names and
Things, a Bishop could never be either ane Order or Degree or any
thing else above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Prsbyter.</p>
                  <p>But from Names if we pass to things, and look into Scripture and
sounder Antiquity, we shall find the ancient Bishop so different from
the present Diocesan, that the very <hi>Idea's</hi> and notions of the two are
diametrically opposite one to another. The Apostles themselves <hi>Acts</hi>
6. 2, 4. following the Commandment of their Master, found it their
Duty so assiduously to labour in Preaching and Prayer that they thought
it unreasonable to be diverted even by the Distribution of the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Care of the Poor, which otherwayes was a Work both lawfull
and pious. And to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who, if we believe the Hierarchicks,
was ane Arch-Bishop of a vast Diocess, it's injoyn'd as his proper Task
to Preach the Word, to be instant in season and out of season, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
to rebuke, exhort with all Long-suffering and Doctrine. I
need not here multiply Texts; read and read over again the whole New
Testament, and you shall find that the Exercise of Prayer, Dispensing
the Word and Sacraments was the main Duty and perpetual Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of every Pastor or Minister of Christ. Look, on the other hand,
to the bulk of the Hierarchick Lord-Bishops, they haue a quite diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent
Work and Exercice, and if any of 'em happen to spend some time
in the Ministerial Duties how are they commonly gaz'd on and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
as Men of extraordinary Condescension, superlatively stuping
to a piece of Service far below the Episcopal Grandeur and unusual to
the Order? Are they not then quite another thing than the Apostolick
and Scripturall Bishops?</p>
                  <p>This Apostolick Example the Conscientious Primitive Bishops or
Pastors clossly follow'd; not so much as once dreaming that any who
was ordain'd a Minister of the Gospell, and intrusted with a Flock,
might on whatsoever pretext neglect to exercise himself perpetually in
Prayer and Dispensing the Word and Sacraments. This they judg'd
his constant Imployment, and this was the Practice of all the sincere Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
even after the Distinction of Degrees was introduc'd, as appears
in the weekly and sometimes the dayly Homilies and Lectures of <hi>Chrys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ostome</hi>
and <hi>Augustine</hi> which are yet extant. And it's already observed
how <hi>Hilary</hi> makes the Bishop a sedulous Dispenser of the Words of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94326:120"/>
Life. And indeed all the Hierarchick Grandeur and Domination
whereby a Bishop was intirely Metamorphosed into a quite other thing
than what he had once been, could never notwithstanding obliterate
and blot out of thinking Mens Minds the true Scriptural Notion and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
thereof. <hi>The Episcopal Dignity consists in Teaching</hi> (saith Balsamon
<note n="i" place="bottom">In Can. Apost. 58. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>). And the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> decrees <hi>that a Bishop shall
not be imployed in caring for his houshold Affairs, but shall wholly occupy
himself in Reading and Praying, aud Preaching the Word</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="bottom">Caranza summa Con. folio 118. Can. 20.</note>.</p>
                  <p>§. 12. 'Twere endless to alledge all that may be produc'd to this
purpose; neither could any Man who ever seriously read the Bible have
any other Notion of a true Bishop than what is common to every Pastor
of a Congregation; seeing the Apostle's Description of a Bishop 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. agrees equally to all of them. And here it's observable,
that still where Bishops are spoken of in Scripture, not only is the Work
and Office which is injoin'd them, that of Teaching and Feeding, but
also the Name is correlative to the Flock, and not to a Company of
Clergy-men, as Acts 20. 28. <hi>Take heed to your selves, and to all the Flock
over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers or</hi> Bishops <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; and
accordingly, as we have oftner than once demonstrated, over every
particular Congregation there was a Bishop.</p>
                  <p>This Assertion may be strongly confirmed from the undoubted Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church in the fourth Century, even when she was fall'n
into no small Declension from the Primitive Purity. For the Council
of <hi>Sardica</hi> Decrees<note n="l" place="bottom">Can. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

Canon is justified by the Arrians their great multiplication of Bishops to
strengthen their Party.</hi> But the Council it self assigns a quite different
Ground that moved them to make this Decree, viz. <hi>that the Name and
Authority of a Bishop fall not into Contempt.</hi> Where we see the Design
of abolishing the Primitive and Apostolick Custome of giving a Bishop
indifferently to every Congregation, whether in City or in Countrey,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94326:120"/>
was the Introduction of a secular Pomp and Grandeur into the Church,
which finally resolv'd into a Papal Slavery. However, this <hi>Sardican</hi>
Canon had not so good effect, but that, about twenty years after, a new
Sanction thereto was found needfull: for the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi>

He pretends in the mean while <q>that anciently Bishops were ordained
in Cities only, many whereof had according to the model of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
such ample Territories that 'twas impossible for the Bishop of
the City his alone to visit and sufficiently to guide them, and so it
seem'd needfull for such Bishops to have, according to the amplitude
of their Bishopricks, one or two Coajutors in some Region without
the City, who might disburden them of some parts of the Episcopal
Function, which could not be done but by some consecrated Bishops.
Hence 'twas that some of these great Bishops Ordain'd, in some
part of their large Provinces, these Bishops, but with this provision,
that these without their leave should do nothing of moment, seeing
these Regions also belonged to the Care of the City Bishop, which
we learn, (continues he) from the tenth Canon of the Council of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> where it's expresly Decreed, that no Country Bishop Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain

he and his Region is subject.</q> But indeed there's no such thing, to

                     <hi>that the</hi> Chorepiscopus
<hi>and his Region was subject to the City</hi> (as they really were in a Civil Sense)
not to the Bishop of the City: and tho they had said so it's no proof of
his Conclusion, seeing they usually pretended Antiquity for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Innovations. How far either in, or nigh to the Time of the Apostles
the Church was from giving to the Bishop such a Princely Dignity as he
pretends, or from allowing him to do the Work proper to himself by
substitute Vassals, none acquainted with what remains of these Ancient
times can be ignorant, and is already oftner then once evinc'd. And now
I'm sorry to find a Protestant of sence and Learning lean on that shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Instituted as Dignities, Preheminencies, Rewards, or Honours,
as now they are, and have been, many hundred years, but with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
and Charges, otherwise called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Works, and those
that exercise them, are called by Christ our Lord in the Gospel, Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and therefore no Man could then enter into cogitation to absent
himself from the Execution thereof in his own Person: and if any one
(which seldom happend) retired from the Work, 'twas not thought
reasonable, he should have either Title or Profit. And tho' the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries
were of two sorts, some Anciently called, as now they are,
with care of Souls: others of temporal things, for the sustenance
and service of the Poor and Sick, as were the Deaconries, and other
inferiour Works, all held themselves equally bound to that Service,
in Person; neither did any think of a substitute, but for a short time,
and for great Impediments, much less to take another Charge, which
might hinder that.</q>

                  <p>§. 13. Bnd now to go on, these Countrey Bishops or Pastors could
not yet by all these Councils be Un-bishoped. And therefore Pope
<hi>Damasus</hi> must next fall on them, and authoratively <hi>define</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="bottom">Caranza <hi>Fol. 100. &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>that they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94326:121"/>
were stark nought in the Church, their Institution wicked and contrary to the holy
Canons.</hi> And thus he acted suitably to his purpose, seeing the enslaving
the lesser and Country Churches to the Domination of these of the
greater Cities made fair way for subjecting all to <hi>Rome,</hi> which on many
Accounts was greater than any of the rest. He also hereby gratified
and much obliged the Bishops of these great Cities who were desirous
of nothing, more than of Domination, and accordingly they even at
these times were giving him their mutual help for raising of the Papal
Throne, yea before the time of <hi>Damasus</hi> this same Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi>
which thought it too vile and base for a Bishop to Dwell out of a great
City, Decreed also<note n="y" place="bottom">Can. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>That if any Bishop thought he was injured in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cause by his Comprovincials and ordinary Judges, it should in this Case be
lawfull for him to appeal to the Bishop of</hi> Rome. <hi>Let us honour</hi> (say they)
<hi>the Memory of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>that either these who examined the Matter or other
neighbouring Bishops write to</hi> Julius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and if he think it fit
then let the Matter be tried and judged again, and let him appoint Judges for the
Purpose, but if he approve of what's already done, and think not fit to call it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Question, then the things already done shall be accounted firm and stable.</hi>
Thus these Fathers, many whereof otherwise were excellent Men, the
first, I think, that ever gave such Deference and Authority to the Pope,
'twas not therefore incongruous that both of these Decrees should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from one and the same Council.</p>
                  <p>Hence it's to be noted, that the Tympany of these times had not
only exerted it self in separating the things God had conjoin'd,
and in an holygarchick Confinement of the Power God had given e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
to all Pastors, unto a few whom they named <hi>Bishops,</hi> a Name al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
equally belonging to all Christ's Ministers; but also in subjecting of
the Presbyters, yea and even the Bishops of the Countrey to the very
Presbyters of the City<note n="z" place="bottom">Neocesar. Can. 13. &amp; <hi>Ancyrum.</hi> Can. 13.</note> but much more the Bishops or Pastors of
the Countrey to the Bishops of the Cities, and these again to the Bishops
of the greater Metropolitan Cities, and so on till at length (not to
name the rest of the higher and lower roundles of this Hierarchick Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
all centred in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet in these very times it was notwithstanding firmly rooted in Mens
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94326:122"/>
Minds that whosoever dispensed the Word and Sacraments, and had a
Flock or Congregation was a true Bishop, as I have made out to be the
mind of <hi>Hilary,</hi> and many others of the fourth and fifth Centuries.
Moreover <hi>Optatus</hi> asserts<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 3.</note>

in the very Countrey Villages which were near to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and near
to one another, and that even where the far greater part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were not of their Flocks, yea were not at all Christians, could be
by any in their Wit judged to be any thing else save Parish Bishops or
Pastors. But let us hear one of the learn'dest of our Adversaries deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the Controversie.<note n="d" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Observations on the first and second Canons commoaly ascribed to the Apostles, pag. 47, 48, <hi>&amp;</hi> 49.</note> 
                     <q>That (saith he) which next occurrs
to be considered is, in what places Bishopricks were founded, and
Bishops settled. We find in all Cities where the Gospel was planted,
and Churches constituted, that Bishops were also Ordain'd. Among
the Jews, wherever there were an hundred and twenty of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there did they erect a Synagogue, and a lesser <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> the
Court of twenty three Judges. Compare to this Acts 1. 15. where
the number of those that constituted the first Christian Church, is the
same. So it is like wherever there was a competent number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
together, that a Church was there settled. Yet in some Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
there were Churches and Bishops; so there was a Bishop in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany:</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells of the Church of <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> which was the
Port of <hi>Corinth.</hi> It is true, some think that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
mett there.</q> Which Opinion he irrefragably Refutes, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
saying, <q>Therefore it's probable that the Church of <hi>Cenchrea</hi>
was distinct from <hi>Corinth:</hi> and since they had <hi>Phebe</hi> for their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conness,
it's not to be doubted but they had Both Bishops and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94326:122"/>
From the several Cities the Gospel was dilated and propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the places round about. But in some Countries we find the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
very thick sett. They were pretty throng in <hi>Asrick,</hi> for at
a Conference which <hi>Augustine</hi> and the Bishops of that Province had
with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> there were of Bishops two hundred eighty six pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and one hundred and twenty absent, and sixty <hi>Sees</hi> were then
Vacant, which make in all four hundred sixty and six: there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
two hundred and seventy nine of the Donatists Bishops.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he. And now, not to multiply Testimonies in so confessed and
plain a Matter, it's most certain that, at least, for upwards of the three
first Centuries, you shall not meet with the meanest <hi>Dorp,</hi> or countrey
place where there was a Church or Congregation to hear the Word, and
receive the Sacraments, but it had also its proper Bishop, I averr no
Example to the contrary either has yet, no not by Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
been, or can be brought from the gennine Monuments of these
times. Yea even from the spurious Writings of Impostures the greatest
Adorers of the Hierarchy, good proofs of this Truth may be adduced;
For the thirty eight of the Canons ascribed to the Apostles, gives the
care of the Ecclesiastick Goods to the Bishop, as <hi>Justine Martyr</hi> gives

to</hi> James <hi>and the Elders.</hi> From which place it's most evident,
that all Pastors or Priests (as the Author speaks) are true Bishops, that on
the account of such things as are common to all Pastors, they receive
the prime Episcopal Honour and Deference, that there was a Colledge
of true Bishops in the single City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp; accordingly that the rest
of the Elders with <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were really true Bishops no less than
he. I don't say that Bishops and Congregations were reciprocal every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in the fourth or fifth Century when these Impostors wrote, only
being to personat Apostolick Men, they saw themselves obliged to mix
into their Legends some shreds of true Antiquity. The stuff they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
themselves was of a far different and contrary Mettal, and far
from being so conform and like to the Apostolick and prime Primitive
Church.</p>
                  <p>§. 14 And here it's to be added, that as every Bishop had once, which
continued in very many places for a good space, one Congregation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so all Bishops whatsoever are of the same Dignity, and Equal with
one another. For <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="bottom">(<hi>Mihi</hi>) Lib. 2. Epist. 1.</note> calls all Bishops <hi>Collegues,</hi> adding, <hi>we

                     <hi>for none of us is a Bishop of Bishops,

                     <note n="l" place="bottom">Epist. 85.</note> saith, <hi>wheresoever Bishops be, at</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Eugubium, Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,
Rhegium, Alexandria <hi>or</hi> Tanis, <hi>they are all of the same Dignity
and Priest-hood, Riches and Poverty make not a Bishop either higher or lower,
they are all the Successors of the Apostles.</hi> Which is also <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Mind,
and must be granted by all who acknowledge the Equality of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and that Bishops were their Successors.</p>

                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:94326:123"/>
Now the Truth of these two Things, viz. the allowableness of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to every Congregation, yea the primitive Reciprocalness of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and a Congregation, and the Equality of Bishops among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being supposed, which indeed is undoubtable to all the Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
their whole Hierarchy turns to nothing.</p>
                  <p>And now I hope that which some pretend to be a mighty Prejudice,
viz. that Episcopacy still <hi>de facto</hi> has been, and from the earliest times
of Christianity we hear of Bishops, is many ways removed, and that by
this time it has clearly appeared, that either profound Ignorance, Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitancy,
or the masly beam of Interest in Mens Eyes has been the true
Source of this Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, suppose that it could not be easily told when this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which is like the Tares sown during the sleeping of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man,
crept into the Church: Can they tell when all other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
made their first Entry? As for Example, can they give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
account when the use of Oyl in Baptism, whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I trust also that by the foregoing Discourses, the Weapon
the Papists and other Hierarchicks use against the Reformed Churches
to prove that they have no Ministers, because of the want of a Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Bishops, is sufficiently blunted.</p>
                  <p>And this minds me of an Objection I was assaulted with from a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of that Perswasion, 'twas that these Episcopal Men who ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Pastors, gave them the Power of Ordination neither in express
Terms, nor yet intentionally; <hi>Ergo</hi> not at all. I Repon'd, that tho'
they did not give it them <hi>intentione Operantis,</hi> yet notwithstanding <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
Operis:</hi> in so much as they ordain'd the Ministers of the Gospel, all
whom we sustain to be true Bishops. I add, this is to a hair like <hi>Becan</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94326:124"/>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> (saith he) <hi>had no lawfull Calling to the Ministry he exercised after his
Defection, for then he began to oppugn the Catholick Church, abolish Feasts,
Monastick Vows, and Prayers for the Dead, these things he could not do by
the Power which he had received in the Catholick Church, for the Bishop who
ordained him, gave him no Power for the Destruction of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 15. But there yet remains a great Prejudice, and no wonder, for
it comes from a great City, <hi>Rome</hi> (say they) and other such vast Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which certainly contain'd many Congregations, have been always
ruled by their particular Bishops as the Catalogues yet extant evinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
But tho' 'twere so, seeing it's at least, no less certain, that in other places
Bishops and Congregations were Reciprocal, we are even with them,
and their Argument quite evanishes, and Antiquity allows us to give a
Bishop to every Congregation, no less than it warrands their giving a
multitude of Parishes to any one Bishop. And Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="bottom">page 449.</note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<hi>he never yet heard of any Man who made it essential to a Bishop to
have many Congregations under him.</hi> And he's so far in the right herein
that, during prime Antiquity, 'twas never so much as dream'd, that
'twas either essential or any way requisite for a Bishop to have a plurality
of Congregations. <hi>It's not</hi> (saith he<note n="q" place="bottom">page 451.</note>) <hi>the being Pastor of one or
many Congregations that makes one a Bishop; but the Order. There are</hi> (saith

                     <hi>and have been Bishopricks so small that their Bishops had only one
or two Presbyters; for we measure not a Bishoprick by the number of the Clergy
or by the amplitude of the City or Diocess, the magnitude of Riches, but by the
Authority of the Episcopal Degree, altho' the Bishoprick be included in one
small Parish alone.</hi> And some of the most Episcopal amongst them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that any of our Ministers tho' they have but one Parish, want
nothing to make them Bishops but only the Episcopal Consecration,
whereby they at once yeeld the whole Plea, destroy their Hierarchy,
and withall discover their preterscriptural, and therefore antiscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Superstition.</p>
                  <p>And now seeing there is all the warrant and allowance that either can
be desir'd or thought on that a Bishop and a Pastor of one single Flock
or Congregation is one and the same, and that every Congregation may
have its own proper Bishop, their Plea for the Distinction between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and preaching Presbyter, tho' its Ground were no less solide than
it's naught and slippery, becomes really of no subserviency at all to their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94326:124"/>
Hierarchick Cause, and so on this account is truly exhausted (for
providing the Pastor of any Parish or Congregation be constantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in Preaching and Edifying the People, we shall not envy him
others, so far as is requisite, to assist him, the People may be instructed
the better) Don't therefore Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi>

the World, and indeed the Head and Fountain from whence all the
Hierarchicks draw their best support, no Man of Reason, whoever
look'd into the divers, yea and contrary Accounts given by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
of the first pretended Successors of <hi>Peter;</hi> can ever inferr that the
Romans had, in these early times of Christianity, one peculiar Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
Bishop over the rest of the Pastors: yea indeed <hi>Cletus, Clemens, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
all whom, if you compare the best Accounts they have, you shall
find to have been at one and the same time Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of <hi>Peter,</hi> are a good evidence that he had no singular Successor at
all. This was so made out by the Protestant Writers, that for ought I
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94326:125"/>
know the Romanists were despairing of any plausible Answer, altho' I
doubt not, but they take Heart, since some among the Protestants<note n="x" place="bottom">

have used prodigious Endeavours to gratifie them, and reconcile real
Contradictions, and fix the singular Successors of <hi>Peter.</hi> I can scarce
light on any of the Books they cite, and yet I'm at no great loss. For,
4<hi>ly,</hi> It's certain that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> which at once dispatches
the grand Plea of all the Hierarchicks. The whole stream of Writers

belive <hi>Origenes</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="bottom">Contra <hi>Celsum</hi> Lib. 1.</note>) was never there. <hi>Simon</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Smaritan and

with his delusions. But now throw all the World you shall scarce find thirty
who follow him, and I perhaps have called them more than they are. Indeed
there are some few in</hi> Palestine, <hi>but in the rest of the Regions of the World
his very Name is not heard off, altho' he mainly desired that his Fame might
be spread abroad, and if perhaps there be any report of him at all, it's only to
be learned from the Acts of the Apostles.</hi> And Time, which often has

and Baffle him a second time. And this is the prime Source of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
imaginary Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and his fictitious Roman Episcopacy,

                     <hi>Rome</hi> is mention'd by none before <hi>Justine,</hi> and by him only on this false
Ground, so <hi>Peter</hi>'s Journey thither is before that time mention'd by
none, save <hi>Papias,</hi> if he may be said to mention it, for if at all, he does
it very obscurely<note n="b" place="bottom">

(tho' elsewhere<note n="c" place="bottom">lib. 3. cap. 36.</note> he forgets himself) he was of so little Wit, so
fabulous and given to believe everything he heard, that his Testimony
merites little or no Credit. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> indeed says that <hi>Papias</hi> was a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Apostles, and himself also intimats so much, but again clearly
denyes it while he says<note n="d" place="bottom">

been acquainted with the Elders, to enquire what</hi> Andrew, Peter, Philip,
Thomas, James, John, Matthew <hi>and the rest of Christ's Disciples had
been wont to say.</hi> And this he intimats had been his Practice only, when
he was a young Man, and so gives us clearly to understand that when he
wrote, there was not one of the Hearers of the Apostles alive. So far
was <hi>Papias</hi> from being their Disciple. 'Twas he also who gives out that
<hi>Mark</hi> wrote not his Gospel by Divine Inspiration, but only by the
help of his Memory. 'Twas he also who was the Father of the carnal
and gross Chiliasts, and the first who abused the Scriptures, turning
them all to Allegories, and had not so much as the knowledge to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle from <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist. The same <hi>Papias</hi>
is the first Author of the report of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Rome</hi> (providing
it may be said that he reportes it at all) which mistake, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
<note n="e" place="bottom">Hist. Eccles. lib. 2. cap. 15.</note>, flow'd from his misunderstanding of 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 13. The
Church that is at</hi> Babylon &amp;c. And seeing that by <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps
<hi>Room</hi> is mean'd, he and many of these times, thro' their want of
skill to distinguish between the Prophetick Mystick, and Epistolick
plain Phrase and Stile, concluded that in <hi>Peter</hi> also <hi>Room</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
But this Gloss is so forraign and absurd that even the most learn'd
of the Romanists, as <hi>Petrus de Marca</hi> Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi>

the former because the old <hi>Chaldean Babylon</hi> was then desolate, the letter
for this that after <hi>Anilaeus</hi> a chief man among the <hi>Jews</hi> in these parts had
injured the Inhabitans, many of them were cut off and the rest driven
from <hi>Babylon,</hi> who fled to <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> the most part whereof notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in a combination made against them by the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi>
were either cut off or expell'd. Therefore he concludes that tho'
<hi>Peter</hi> was the Apostle of the Circumcision, yet he could expect no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of the <hi>Jews</hi> in these parts. Now, as to the ground <hi>Spanhemius</hi> goes
on, it seems sufficient to prove that it could not be the old <hi>Chaldean

it appears that <hi>Seleucia</hi> was the chief City of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Impire, and

not properly succeed the Priests and Levites under the Law, whose Office was
Ceremonial, and who were not admitted by any solemn Ordination into their
Function.—It is then a common Mistake to think that the Ministers
of the Gospell succeeded by way of Correspondence and Analogy to the Priests
under the Law; which Mistake hath been the Foundation and Originall of
many Errors. For when in the primitive Church, the name of Priests came
to be attributed to Gospell-Ministers from a fair Complyance (as was thought
then) of the Christians only to the name used both among Jews and Gentiles:
in process of time, corruptions increasing in the Church, those names that were
used by the Christians by way of Analogy and Accommodation, brought in the
things themselves primarily intended by these names: so by the metaphoricall
names of Priests and Altars, at last came up the Sacrifice of the Mass; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

God transplanted the worship and publick adoration of God
used in the synagogues, which was moral, into the Christian Church:

and the vanity of preterscripturall and superstitious Ceremonies? if she
then enjoy'd not Bishops or Pastors, Ruling Elders and Deacons? if
then, whosoever had power to dispense the Word and Sacraments
with the Charge of any particular Flock or Congregation, was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
one and the same with a Bishop, and finally, if the primitive

Church-Officer, alwayes signifying a Labourer in the Word and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
and Dispenser of the Srcraments, Pastor of a Flock or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94326:129"/>
We find also the Word <hi>Presbyter</hi> taken as its equivalent denoting
this very thing: elsewhere (as is now made evident) the word <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
signifies no Pastor of a Flock, but only one who was to assist him in
Ruling and Guidance thereof; some also of this latter kind of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
designing the Ministry, there beeing then few or no Theological
Schools, were trained up for the Office under the Inspection of Bishops
or Parochial Pastors, and accordingly whiles assisted them therein.
But this was only accidental to the Office of a ruling Presbyter.
Afterward there was a new kind of Church Office invented whose chief
work was not to feed any Flock or Congregation and yet was reputed
the Pastor of many Flocks which was a compleat Contradiction. His
Province was mainly to rule and domineer over a multitude of both Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
and Flocks, him they called the Bishop. Another Office epually
new and unknown to Scripture and prime Antiquity was a kind of semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pastor
or half Minister who was to do all the Ministeriall Work, and
yet was so far from having any Pastorall Power that on the contrary he
was only the subject and substitute of another, and him they called the
<hi>Presbyter:</hi> As for the other sort of Presbyters they came in time to be
well nigh intirely abolished and forgotten. The like <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">On the 6 of the <hi>Acts</hi> hom. 14.</note>
observes of the Deacons, saying <hi>that in his time such Deacons as the
Apostles ordained were not in the Church.</hi> Hence it's not strange if the
Ancients, while sometimes they violent the Scriptures to make them
favour what in their oun times was obtaining, and at other times while,
either out of design and freedome, or casually they light on the true
Meaning of the Scriptures, speak most perplexedly of Bishops and
Presbyters, and afford no small ground of Wrangling and Disputation
to all that are exercised in this Controversy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while such Immutation was not made in a day, 'twas
sloe and apparently plausible like the weed which at lenth you may
see that it is groun up, yet its act of growing ye shall never perceive.
This Alteration, as even <hi>Spanhemius</hi> F.<note n="m" place="bottom">Introduct. ad Hist. Nov. Test. Pag. 166.</note> no enemy to the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,

occasions or rather pretexts for it, which we already noted,
there was this colour more peculiar to great Cities; in <hi>Rome,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
tho there were Christians sufficient to make up severall ordinary
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94326:130"/>
Congregations, yet at some special times all or most of these used to
meet at one place, and accordingly were accounted but one Church.
This might occasion the making of a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This Fermentation, which had small beginnings and still grew untill

selves with Words as with Swords, Pastors against Pastors, and People against

and Guile had grown to the highest pitch of wickedness—When being
void of all sense we did not so much as once think how to please God; yea rather

Apostolick Authority and Tradition for every one of their Innovations.
For this their Pride and Superstition and such Vices God sent a long
and most grievous Persecution, after which it might have been reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
thought they would have returned to the Humility and Simplicity
of the Gospell, and Apostolick Age. But so far were they from this

and having got a Christian Emperor to indulge and enrich them
they quickened their Pace, and in the gadiness of Pride and giddiness
of Superstition, extravaging without bounds in this Declension
they piece and piece laid aside the Scripture, and in the model
of their Government and Worship eyed and followed three patterns,
the Jewish Policy, Ceremonies, and Temple, where there was one
High-Priest, the magnificent and splendid Government of the Roman
Empire, over which there was one Head, one Emperor. And lastly,
the way of the Roman Pagan Priests in which there was also at <hi>Rome</hi> a
<hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> or High-Priest over all the many Degrees of Priests
in the Empire, and so in process of time it came to pass that he who by
his first Institution was design'd to be a Pastor of a Flock or Congregation,
and to imitate the Apostolick Simplicity and Humility, turned to be the
great Antichrist, the son of Perdition. and grand Emissary and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennant
of the red Dragon, and these who were ordain'd to be his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Pastors
and Ministers of the Gospel became his Underlings and
Slaves in that Apostacy, and being martial'd into a thousand Ranks and
Orders proved so many Squadrons of hellish Locusts, so that scarce in
any part of the Creation of God was there ever a more sad and direfull
Depravation, if it were not when our first Parents fell into the Cloutches
of the old Serpent, or when the Sons of God became his greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and those morning Stars, the beautifull Angels turned into infernal
Firebrands, black and abominable Devils.</p>
                  <p>Most observable notwithstanding, yea and adorable is Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in this, that even in the growth and increase of this black Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
the Church in Opinion and Doctrine, at least, still held fast the

the Identity of Bishop and preaching Presbyter, or Pastor
of a Congregation, they must, among'st the rest of their novell Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereis,
raise one Bishop, or High-Priest (as they spoke) over a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of other Pastors, and Churches, whose Ordination and Consecration
must be accompani'd with a dale of Alloy suitable to this their humane
and unwarrantable Institution: He must have a Cudgell put in his hand,
to signifie his Rule and Authority over the People, and a Ring to signifie
his Pontifical Honour, and the hidden Mysiereis wherewithall he is

for Antiquity also not a white lower than their Diocesan, they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94326:131"/>
made another fixed Church-Officer whom they called an Exorcist. His

an ordinary Church-Officer was never appointed by God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
'tis most likely that some of those Exorcists needed some to have
casten the Devils out of themselves, or at least, to have giv'n them a

Patients. But seeing they made such a Church-Officer, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing
of Devils was among'st the greatest and most miraculous
Works that ever was practis'd even by the greatest Apostles. It may
be thought that this Exorcist was one of their highest Church-Officers,
a Metropolitan certainly, Arch-Bishop or Patriarch, but he was none
of these, yea he was no Bishop, no Presbyter, no Deacon, no Sub-Deacon,
yea not so much as an Acolyth, that is a <hi>Candle-carier,</hi> for
they us'd in fair-day-light and Sun-shine to light Candles in the Church
to obey and fulfill (as they said) that Scripture, John 1. 9. <hi>That
was the true Light, which lighteneth every Man that cometh into the World</hi>

This Exorcist was yet a degree lower than their <hi>Candle-Carier,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was plac'd in the very rear and tail of all their Clergy. So danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yea and unaccountable were many of their Actings, but especially
in the matter of Church-Office-bearing.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I appeal to all the judicious and conscientious if out of a
conscientious desire of conforming to the primitive Church, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versareis
make such a horride noise, bussle and Schism for their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.
For, suppose it to be as true as I hope by this time to all the
unbyassed it's manifested to be false, that in all points they could vouch
their Hierarchy to be warranted by the true primitive Church and the
Government of the one intirely like that of the other, yet do they
not desert her in many other things? Did the primitive Church use
Organs in Divine Worship? Were they not first introduced in the
seventh Century by Pope <hi>Vitalian</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="bottom">Platina in Vitaliano &amp; Volater. apud Onuphrium in Chronographia.</note> And yet it is doubtfull if they

Leasure left any Pastor to be either Consul, General, or ought else of
this nature: and consequently if all the shifts they use on this head be not
sufficiently overthrown by these Scriptures only. But I had almost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to notice how they torment themselves that they may torment
and detort <hi>Cyprian,</hi> For <hi>Saravia</hi> says, that the Canon <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks off
<hi>was but particular and provincial only for the Church of</hi> Carthage. But <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
refutes <hi>Saravia</hi> his comment and says <hi>Cyprian spoke so, because the
Church was then almost destitute and unprovided of Presbyters.</hi> As if
<hi>Cyprian</hi> had not spoken of Chruch-men absolutely and without the
least intimation of any such restriction, and grounded his saying on a
Scripture which, whatsoever it speaks of Church-men, confessedly says
it of the mall, be they many or few or in whatsoever time and place they
live. Moreover it's most certain that in <hi>Matthew</hi> 20. 25, 26, 27, 28.
<hi>The Princes of the Gentiles</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 42, 43, 44, 45. And
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27. All Pastors of Flocks are prohibited to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Dominion, secular and state Dignity, and a parity of the Apostles
amongst themselves, and in them a parity of all ordinary Pastors or
Ministers of the Gospell among themselves is enjoyned. D. <hi>M.</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 16 &amp; seq.</note>
pretends to engage with the latter part of this Inference, but first he
mis-states the question as if from these Texts we pleaded for a perfect
equality of all the Officers of Christs house without distinction between
extraordinary and ordinary Ministers, or between Pastors and other
Officers, and so his saying <hi>that the Apostles exercised Jurisdiction over other
Ecclesiasticks,</hi> whether true or false, is nothing to the purpose. But saith
D. <hi>M. Our blessed Saviour supposeth degrees of Subordination amongst his
own Disciples as well as other societies, and therefore he directs the Ecclesiasticks
who would climb up to the highest places in the Church, to take other methods then
these that are most usual amongst the</hi> Grandees <hi>of the World: He that deserved
preferment in the Church was to be the servant of all.</hi> Which answer he steals
from the Jesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">De Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice Lib. 5. Cap. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>who</hi> answers <hi>that Christ only directs ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Princes, &amp; teaches that as such they ought to rule their subjects, not as do Kings
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94326:133"/>
and Lords, but as Fathers and Pastors,</hi> To whom <hi>Junius</hi> replyes<note n="c" place="bottom">Tom. 2. Col. 875, 876.</note> 
                     <hi>that
all this is quite contrarie to both Christs words and scope, The sons of</hi> Zebedie
(saith he) <hi>desired a Dominion, this Christ rejects and refuses to give them;
again the falshood of this answer is demonstrated positively by Christs following
words, who in stead of this Dominion which they desired, enjoyns them a humble
Ministry and Service. Wherefore there is a clear opposition between Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Ministry, the former belonging the World, the latter to the Church.
Bishops are not</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine) here forbidden to exercise a dominion like
that of godly Kings, but only like that of Tyrranical Kings who know not God.
We deny</hi> (replyes <hi>Junius) that there is any such restriction, neither can it be
proved.</hi> And accordingly <hi>Junius</hi> refutes and bafles all the Sophistrie
that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and, after him, our Prelatists ordinarly bring to prove
that only tyrrany and not all sort of principality or superiority is by our
Saviour in these Texts, prohibited. And with <hi>Junius</hi> joyns the whole
stream of Protestant Writers. <hi>But our Saviour</hi> (saith D. <hi>M.) did that
himself among them, which he now commanded them to do to one another, and
therefore the doing of this towards one another in obedience to the command now
under consideration, could not inferr a Parity, unless that they blasphemously infer
that Christ and his Apostles were equal: For our Saviour recomends what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
from his own constant and visible practice among them, viz, that he himself
who was their Lord and Master, was their sevant, and therefore, it becomes
the greatest among them, in imitation of him, to be modest, calm, and humble,
towards all their subordinate Brethren.</hi> A sturdy argument forsooth, as if
our most blessed Master to quell his Disciples their ambition of aspiring
to a preheminence over one another, and to render them more content
with a humble and brotherly parity, could not adduce and urge his own
most holy and meek example of his most wonderful condescending to
take upon him the form of a Servant, and do the works of a Servant
among his Apostles, and that so humblie, as if he had been only their
Companion and nothing above them: but he must anone be concluded
to degrade and throw down himself into a meer equality with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
Can any in the exercise of his wit make such a Collection? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can better befall him: for, as is his constant practice this wretched
Paralogism he also borrows from another Jebusite <hi>Cornelius a Lapide,</hi> who
at the same rate depraves this Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> to save from a mortal
blow <hi>Peter's fictitious Primacy.</hi> But in the next place, which is little better,
D. <hi>M.</hi> turns Jew on our hand: <hi>Let it be further considered</hi> (saith he) <hi>that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94326:133"/>
the</hi> Hierarchy <hi>and Subordination of Priests was established by Divine
Authority in the Jewish Church, and if our Saviour had pulled down that
ancient Polity, and commanded an equality among the Presbyters of the
New Testament, he would not have stated the Opposition between his
own Disciples and the Lords of the Gentiles, but rather between the
Priests of the Mosaic Oeconomy and the Disciples of the New Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament.</hi>
And agian, fearing least his J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>daism and also his self-repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
should not have otherways been apparent enough, <hi>We do not</hi> (saith
he<note n="d" place="bottom">page 27.</note>) <hi>now plead, as some ignorant People may pretend, that there
ought to be a Bishop above Presbyters, because that there was a High-Priest
among the Jews, but rather thus, that the Hierarchy that obtained in
the Patriarchal and Jewish Oeconomy was never abrogated in the new.</hi>
Well then, is there on Earth a visible High-Priest over the whole Church
the Levitical Orders, Rites, &amp; Temple-service, the very things wherein
the Jewish Hierarchy consisted, and shadows of Christ to come, now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable.
But to come to his cavill, and quiet this child of Ignorance,
D. <hi>M.</hi> should know that beside the Disciples ambition to get up over
one another, according to the carnal apprehension they then entertained
of Christ kingdome (wherein our Hierarchick Lord Bishops are the
Apostles successors indeed, and all Hierarchicks, men of Apostolick
principles) they looked also for a great, worldly, and civil power and
dominion, which was not at all comprehended in the Jewish Priesthood,
nor was then possessed by any of the Priests; and so our Lord's stateing
the opposition between his Disciples and the Lords of the Gentiles, is by
far more apt for his purpose than if he had stated it between them and
the Priests of the old Oeconomy, which had been altogether lame, and
doon scarce the half of his bussiness. In a word, the Romishness and
Falshood of all these his Cavills is manifest, were there no more, from
this only, that if they do any thing, they make for the defence of that
new Romish Doctrine of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, which both the Fathers,
and all sound Protestants, not only Presbyterians, but also Episcopals,
yea some that otherwise deserve not the name of Protestants, as Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>

amongst the Apostles: And they deduce their Conclusion especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from this text of <hi>Matthew's</hi> Gospel and its parallels. And indeed
if there be, as doubtless there are, any places of Scripture fit to prove it,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94326:134"/>
these texts deservedly hold the first place. The Author of the <hi>Opus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectum,</hi>
thought by some to be <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> saith, on this place of
<hi>Matthew, Quicunque autem desiderat primatum in terrâ, inveniet confusio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
in coelo, Whosoever desires a primacy on Earth, shall find Confusion in
Heaven.</hi> Now suppose the truth of these words, and compare them
with the words of the Apostle 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 1. If a man desires the Office of a
Bishop, he desires a good work.</hi> And it's clear the Office of a Bishop is
quite another thing than a Primacy; for to desire the former is lawfull
and laudable, but to desire the latter is dangerous and damnable: and
so much by the way, for I love not to transcribe the labours of others
<note n="f" place="bottom">See if you please for example <hi>Rectius Instruendum.</hi>
                     </note>. And so angry is D. <hi>M.</hi> at <hi>New Opinions,</hi> and for their sake at
every thing that's New, that he scarce ever advances any Argument, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
or Defence, but what is so frequently and soundly baffl'd, so
bare and worn, as to vy even with the old ancient Garments of the
<hi>Gibeonites.</hi> These Texts, as I said, prohibite also all Pastors of Flocks
to exercise Dominion, Secular or State Dignities, which is irrefragably

the Bishop af <hi>Aiace,</hi> for he was a Member of the Council of <hi>Trent: John

that residencie was</hi> de jure Divino, <hi>yet thought it not fit to speak of that question,
delivered a singular speech, saying that, not aiming to establish one Opinion
more then another, but only so to inforce residency, as that it may be really executed,
he thought it vain to declare from whence the obligation came, or whatsoever else
and that it was sufficient only to remove the cause of Absence; which is, that
Bishops do busie themselves in the courts of Princes, and in the affairs of the
World, being Judges, Chanchellours Secretaries, Counsellours, Treasurers,
and there are but few Offices of state into which some Bishop hath not insinuate
himself. This is forbidden by</hi> St. Paul, <hi>who thought it necessary that a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
of the Church should abstain from secular Employments. Let God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
be executed, and them forbidden to take any Charge, Office, or Degree,
ordinary or extraordinary, in the affairs of the World; and then their being no
cause for them to remain at Court, they will go to their residencie, of their own
accord, without Command or Penalty, and will not have any occasion to depart
from thence. In conclusion he desired that the Council could constitute, that it
should not be lawfull for Bishops or others, who have care of souls, to exercise
any secular Office or Charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this was in vain, for that Synagogue of Sathan was deaf like
the Adder, &amp; the Bishop of Five Churches who harang'd to the contrary
&amp; eluded or neglected all his reasons telling the Council withall, that if
<hi>Aiace</hi> were follow'd their Church would anon become base &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
was heard with applause of the the whole Conventicle (tho' not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94326:135"/>
without a self-contradiction as the Historian observes) so that this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and Christian Discourse was slighted and contemned. Neither
can I find much ground to expect any fairer treatment from men of a
<hi>Tridentine</hi> Spirit, whose strenth lyes mostly in mean sophistry, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
snatching at colours and shaddous, disimulation of the unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Cause, banter and Hectoring, noise and ill founded claims
to Antiquity. From these I may look for unkind handling indeed; but
withall have some assurance to meet with better dealling from all the
Admirers and Students of most true and only unspotted Antiquity, the
sacred Scripturers, whom God hath quicken'd by his Precepts, who
know that serious and assiduous Meditation in God's Law and keeping
his Precepts will make them understand more than even the Ancients, and
therefore rejoyce in the Way of his Testimonies as much as in all Riches,
and esteem the Words of his Mouth more than their necessary food, to
whom these are the Joy and Rejoyceing of their heart. These, I am
somewhat confident, will not be much displeased with what I have said.
My Antagonist, if any happen, or I'm exceedingly mistaken, will be
of quite different Qualities, I can sincerely affirm that I have not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
or wittingly injured the Truth, or any man's person, and that the
Love of sacred Verity moved me to publish these papers. Others,
doubtless, of suitable Abilities may soon advance things of far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
worth than what can come from we whose mite is so mean and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
and who, beside the other disadvantages that environ me,
according to the good Pleasure of him that doth all things well, from
the very womb have laboured under the want of that noble Sence of
