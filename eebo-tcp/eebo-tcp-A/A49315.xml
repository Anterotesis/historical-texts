            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM An Engliſh Reformed Quaker, To his Friend in <hi>Scotland</hi> of the ſame Perſwaſion: With the Anſwer and Reply thereto.</head>
            <p>MY Friends, I once ſhewed my ſelf bent and couragious for your Principles; yea not only ſo, but counted you the only Apoſtles of our Land: But being now by the grace of God convinced of your evil Practices, Diabolical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and Erronious Ways, I cannot but in Conſcience tell you the reaſons why I now leave and depart from your Society, and am convinced, that no well grounded perſon in the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and even thoſe of your own Faction will diſcommend me therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a ſerious and impartial tryal of theſe few following Reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But multiplicity of words being vanity, I proceed to the thing intended; And it is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether or not do ye owne the Scriptures to be the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ye ſay, ye do owne them to be ſuch; yet notwithſtanding whereof ye deny part of them. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye are worſe than the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> For we cannot charge them with ſuch a defection from the Scripture, as we can charge you with; for ye owne part of your Tranſlation, and other Part thereof ye deny, notwithſtanding of the curſe that is pronounced againſt Adders to the Scriptures, or Parers therefrom, which ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that addeth or taketh from the Scriptures, for his name ſhall be taken out of the Book of Life.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30588:2"/>
But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> they owne their whole Tranſlation, and addeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereto, nor pareth nothing therefrom; yet that part of the Scriptures which ye owne, ye altogether miſconſtruct, and take it in as literal a ſenſe, as if the Scriptures were not at all myſte<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ous; But if we take them in ſo literal a ſenſe, they ſhall ſeem contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory the one part thereof to the other. As for example, <hi>when our Saviour was accuſed and mocked by the high Priests and Elders, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing; and when he was beat in the high Prieſts Hall, he checked his ſmiters, ſaying, If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil; but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> Which places conform to the Literal ſenſe thereof, ſeem contradictory as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall treat upon <hi>brotherly love,</hi> as the firſt part of your miſconſtructions, inſtituted by our Saviour himſelf, in that 5 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> directed to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Verſe 2. Which ſaith, <hi>Walk in love, even as I have loved you.</hi> But I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what ſort of love this can be of yours, that ſuppoſe a man ſhould beat you, ſcandalize your honeſt name and reputation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud you of your goods, and ſeek to invade your perſons, yet ye will not at all reprove him; whereas God himſelf expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary, ſaying, <hi>Leviticus 19. 17. Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him,</hi> and Chriſts own Warrand for reproof in the above-cited place: But the right Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>brotherly love</hi> is, before ye avenge your ſelf of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, rather ſuffer a double injury, remitting your Cauſe to God, who, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 12. 19. Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Quaeritur,</hi> Whether or not ye deny the two Sacraments? I know by my own Experience that ye do ſo. I ſhall begin with the Firſt, <hi>viz. Baptiſm,</hi> which ſerves 10. <hi>For waſhing and purifying us from our ſins,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. 20. <hi>A Sign and Seal for ingrafting us into Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 27. And Chriſts own Warrand for it, ſaying, <hi>Go ye</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30588:2"/>
               <hi>thorow all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>thly,</hi> Ye deny alſo the <hi>Lords Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> therefore I ſhall ſpeak a little to that Point likewiſe, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> We have Chriſts own Warrand for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26. which ſaith, <hi>That the ſame night wherein he was betrayed he took bread, and after he had given thanks, brake it, and ſaid, Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo he took the Cup when he had ſupped, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, which is ſhed for the ſins of many; this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What ſay ye anent not giving Thanks for your daily Food; Chriſt was not of your mind, for he gave Thanks when he brake Bread, as is expreſly ſet down in the above-cited place. I would only ask you, whether you merit any ſuch thing at Gods hands, or not? If ye do not, then conſequently ye are the moſt ungrateful people in the World, who will not ſo much as give God thanks for your ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sitxhly.</hi> What ſay ye anent Womens Preaching, I find one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word to the contrary, 1 <hi>Timothy 2. 11. 12. Suffer not a Woman to Teach, but to be in ſilence, and learn with all ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. As likewiſe, ye ſuffer all Perſons to Preach, although never ſo Illiterat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas the contrair is expreſt, in <hi>Deut. 17. chap.</hi> 9. 11, 12, and 13. <hi>verſes.</hi> As alſo the Word of GOD is to be preached by thoſe that are ſufficiently Gifted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Ye deny giving Honour to any Perſon; But <hi>Jacob</hi> was not of your Opinion, when he met with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaluted him, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him, <hi>Gen. 33. chap.</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:30588:3"/>
               <hi>Now my Friends,</hi>
               <lb/>
Ye ſee how I have numbered up ſome few Errors out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but I content my ſelf with thoſe few, which may be <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (if God will) to reclaim you from your Errors, recall you from your Apoſtaſie; and as if it were to give Divorce to that evil Spirit, which hath too long poſſeſſed you; for if ye continue in that Diabolical opinion of yours, I can liken you to no other thing than Wolves in Lambs Skins, Monſters that deſtroys all that is Sacred both in Heaven and Earth, and tears all in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Therfore ye ſhould try the Spirit, whether it be of God or of Belial. I would we were all of one mind, and that God would break in upon your hard and ſtony hearts, and ſow the good ſeed of the Word therein, that ye may turn unto him: But if ye will not turn while the voice is calling, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?</hi> But continue in your perverſe ways, <hi>God that made you will not ſave you,</hi> but caſt you out of his ſight for ever. Therefore, my Friends, prevent that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>YE talk, that ye once was a Man bent upon our Principles and counted us (as ye ſay your ſelves) the only <hi>Apostles</hi> of our Land; and ye ſay, that ye cannot but depart from our Society, upon the account of ſome few alledged Errors, of our Profeſſion, which thou haſt Summed up in a Sheet of Paper, and in the Concluſion of it, thou tells us: That if we abide in this Diabolical Opinion of ours, thou can liken us to no other thing than Wolfs in Lambs Skins; and a Monſter, that deſtroys all that is Sacred, both in Heaven and Earth, and Tears all to Pieces, in Order to Salvation; By which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Expreſſion of your Folly, thou haſt committed an high Sin againſt God, and haſt put a ſhame upon that Opinion which thou doſt profeſs; as if we could aſcend up unto Heaven, and take it by force, (if we may ſo ſpeak) and thou likewiſe ſayeſt, that we are this day an Angel of Light, and to Morrow a <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> which Expreſſion, ought rather to be ſpoken againſt your ſelves, than againſt us, for ye are always Various in your mind, and can never content your ſelves with one and the ſame Principle, but alters many things in the ſame; whereas we are the ſame Church to day that we were a thouſand years ſince; As alſo ye ſay, that ſuppoſe a Man ſhould beat us, ſcandalize our honeſt Name and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and defraud us of our Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We will not at all reprove him; Whereas we have Chriſt our Saviour his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the ſame, as is evident, and clearly appears in that 27. <hi>chap.</hi> of his Goſpel, written by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 12, 13, and 14 <hi>verſes</hi>

            <p>As to the firſt Paragraph, Which is the Doctrine of Non Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, Ye ſay, That ye have our Saviour Chriſt his own Example and Warrand therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if holden as a part of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it will make the Scriptures contradictory the one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the other; as for Example, <hi>When our Saviour was accuſed, abuſed, and mocked by the High-Prieſts and Elders, he anſwered them nothing;</hi> and when he ſayeth, <hi>whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> notwithſtanding when he was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the High-Prieſts-Hall, he checked and reproved his Smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſaying, <hi>If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil; but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me;</hi> which places ſeems contradictory to the other, conform to the Literal Senſe thereof; but <hi>ſtrictè conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derando</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:30588:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>&amp; figurative loquendo eadem ſignificant,</hi> as is above rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, ye ſay, That ye can deſtroy nothing that is Sacred, neither in Heaven or Earth, Whereas by your evil ways, ye draw others from the Faith, and Deludes your ſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by heaps up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath to fall upon your ſelves, and adds Fewel to Hells Fire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Ye ſay that ye were the ſame Church 1000 years ſince that ye are yet, whereas the Errors, which have riſen up in the Church, which ye do thereby defile, we find were not come in at the ſix Century, neither was the Church ever governed by <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ye ſay we Confute our ſelves in this Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That ye are worſe than the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> becauſe ye do owne part of our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and denyes another part thereof. To which I Reply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That ſeing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have a Tranſlation, although ſomewhat different from ours, yet ownes the whole therein contained, in that reſpect they are better; but ye owning part of your Tranſlation, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part thereof denying, ye are much worſe than them in that reſpect. But ſeing every Perſon, though never ſo Illiterate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth Confute your Errors, I with the Eaſtern Churches do leave you (ſeing I can prevail nothing) to wallow in your Filthineſs; and I Proteſt, and take God to be my Witnes, I would by the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God have reclaimed you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did endeavour as far as in me lay to heal your Back-ſlidings, but ye hated Inſtruction and refuſed to be Informed; and ſo I fear, that that Word is fulfilled on you, which ſayeth, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi>
