            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS you desire
to know what my
judgment and practice
is concerning the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or forbearing the
establish'd Liturgy (either in whole,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102011:3"/>
or in part) in the publick Service of
God, and Office of the Church: If
it be any satisfaction to your Friend,
I shall fully acquaint you what
my practice is (whereunto if my
own Judgment be not conform, I
am, without all excuse, my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner)
and upon what considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I have, according to the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the times, varied from my
self therein.</p>
            <p>So long as my Congregation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
unmixt with Souldiers, as well
after as before the Promulgation of
the Ordinance of the two Houses
for the abolishing of the Common
Prayer, I continued the use of it, as
I had ever formerly done in the most
peaceable and orderly times, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
those very Prayers, the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
whereof I could not but
know to have been chiefly aim'd at
in the Ordinance <hi>(viz.)</hi> three for
the King and Queen and Bishops; and
so I did also though some Souldiers
were casually present, till such time
as a whole Troop coming to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102011:3"/>
in the Town (with a purpose
to continue a kind of Garison or
Head-quarter among us) were so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
at my reading of it the first
Sunday after they came, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after Morning Service
ended, they seiz'd upon the Book,
and tore it all in pieces. Thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
during their continuance
there for full six months and upwards
<hi>(viz.)</hi> from the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
till they were call'd away to
<hi>Naseby</hi> Fight in <hi>May</hi> following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that for want of a Book of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
I must, I saw that it also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoov'd
me, for the preventing of
farther Outrages, to wave the use
of the Book for the time, at least in
the Ordinary Service; only I read
the Confession, the Lord's Prayer,
all the Versicles, and the Psalms for
the day. Then after the first Lesson
in the Forenoon <hi>Benedictus</hi> or <hi>Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi>
and in the Afternoons <hi>Cantate.</hi>
After the second Lesson also, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Creed, sometimes the Ten
Commandements, and sometimes


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102011:4"/>
neither, but only sang a Psalm, and
so to Sermon. But in all that while,
in the Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Solemnization of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
Burial of Dead, and
Churching of Women, I constantly
used the ancient Forms and Rites
to every of them respectively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Book; only I was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in all the rest to make choice of
such times and opportunities as I
might do them with most secresie,
and without disturbance of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.
But at the Celebration of the
Eucharist I was the more secure to
do it publickly, because I was assur'd
none of the Souldiers would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>After their departure I took the
liberty to use either the whole Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
or but some part of it, omitting
sometimes more, sometimes less up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion, as I judg'd it most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
in reference to the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
especially if any Souldiers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unknown persons hapned to be


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102011:4"/>
present. But all this while the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of what I omitted I contriv'd
into my Prayer before Sermon, the
phrase and order only varied, which
yet I endeavour'd to temper in such
sort, that any person of ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
might easily perceivve what
my meaning was, and yet the words
left as little liable to exception or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
as might be.</p>
            <p>About two years ago I was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
(but in a friendly manner) by a
Parliament man of note in these parts,
that at a publick Meeting at <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi>
great complaint was made by
some Ministers of the Presbyterian
Gang, as I afterwards found, of my
refractoriness to obey the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Order in that behalf. The
Gentleman told me withal, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they knew what my judgment
and practice was, yet they were not
forward to take notice of it before
complaint made, which being now
done in so publick a manner, if they
should not take notice of it, the blame
would lie upon them.</hi> He therefore


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102011:5"/>
advised me to consider well what I
had to do, for I must resolve either
to adventure the loss of my Living,
or to lay aside Common Prayer;
which if I should continue after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
and admonition, it would not
be in his power, nor in the power of
any Friend I had to preserve me. The
effect of my then Answer was, <hi>That
if the case were so, the deliberation
was not hard: I having long ago
considered of the case, and resolved
what I might do with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and what was fittest for me in
prudence to do, if I should ever be
put to it</hi> (viz.) <hi>to forbear the use
of the Common Prayer Book so far
as might satisfie the letter of the
Ordinance, rather than forsake my
Station.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next business then was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
my self of such a course to be
thenceforth held in the publick work
in my own Parish, as might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
neither to bring danger to my
self by the use, nor to give scandal
to my Brethren by the disuse of the


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102011:5"/>
establish'd Liturgy. And the course
was this, to which I have held me
ever since.</p>
            <p>I begin the Service with a Preface,
and an Exhortation infer'd to make
Confession of Sins; which Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have fram'd out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
and Absolution in the
Book, contracted and put together,
and exprest for the most part in the
same words and phrases, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
here and there transplac'd,
that it might appear not to be, and
yet to be the very same.</p>
            <p>Then follows the Confession it
self in the same Order; it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd
only with the addition of
some words, whereby it is rather
explain'd than alter'd. The whole
frame whereof, both for the fuller
satisfaction in that particular, and
that you may conjecture what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of addition and change I have
made proportionably hereunto (yet
none so large) in other parts of the
holy Office, I have here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written.</p>

do with shame and sorrow confess,
that we have all our life long gone
astray out of thy ways like lost sheep;
and that by following too much the
vain devices and desires of our own
hearts, we have grievously offended
against thy holy laws both in
thought, word, and deed. We have
many times left undone those good

have avoided them, which we
ought not to have done. We confess,
O Lord, that there is no health at

mercy, whose justice we have by our
sins so far provoked. Have mercy

            <p>After the Confession the Lord's
Prayer with the Versicles, and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
Patri,</hi> and then Psalms for the
Day, and the first Lesson: After
which in the Forenoon, sometimes
<hi>Te Deum,</hi> (but then only when I
think the Auditory will bear it) and
sometimes an Hymn of mine own,
gathered out of the Psalms and
Church Collects, as a general Form
of Thanksgiving (which I did the
rather, because I have noted the
want of such a Form as the only
thing wherein the Liturgy seem'd
to be defective). And in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
after the first Lesson the
<hi>98th.</hi> Psalm, or the <hi>67th.</hi> then the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102011:7"/>
second Lesson, with <hi>Benedictus</hi> or
<hi>Iubilate;</hi> after it in the Forenoon
and Afternoon a singing Psalm. Then
followeth the Creed, with <hi>Dominus
Vobiscum;</hi> and sometimes the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles
in the end of our Letany <hi>[From
our Enemies defend us]</hi> if I lik'd my
Auditory, otherwise I omit the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles.
After the Creed, and instead
of the Letany and the other Prayers
appointed in the Book, I have taken
the substance of the Prayer I was
wont to make before Sermon, and
dispos'd it into several Collects or
Prayers, some longer and some
shorter, but new modell'd into the
language of the Common Prayer
Book much more than it was before.
And in the Pulpit, before Sermon I
use only a short Prayer in reference
to the hearing of the Word, and no
more. So that upon the matter, in
these Prayers I do but the same
thing I did before, save only that
what before I spake without Book,
and in a continued Form in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
I now read out of a written Book


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102011:7"/>
broken into parcels, and in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Desk or Pue. Between which
Prayers and the singing Psalms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sermon, I do also daily use
one other Collect, of which sort I
have for the purpose compos'd sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
made up also (as the former)
for the most part out of the Church
Collects, with some little enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or variation; as namely, the
Collects Adventual, Quadragesimal,
Paschal, or Pentecostal, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
seasons; and at other times Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
of a more general nature, as
for Pardon, Repentance, Grace, &amp;c.
And after one or more of them in
the Forenoon, I usually repeat the
Ten Commandements, with a short
Collect after them for Grace to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us to keep them.</p>
            <p>This hath been my practice, and
is like still to be, unless some happy
Change of Affairs restore us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of using the old way again, or

propose to the most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Objector) is that
which is grounded upon the Laws,
and their Obligation: For it may be
Objected,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>That every humane Law


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102011:8"/>
rightly establish'd, so long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
a Law, obligeth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
(and that for Conscience sake)
to the observation thereof in such
manner and form as in the same
Law is prescribed, and according
to the true meaning and intention of
the Law-giver therein. That a
Law is then understood to be rightly
establish'd, when it containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is honest and lawful,
and is enacted by such person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as have full and sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to make Laws. That a Law
so establish'd continues a Law, and
is so in force, till it be either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by as good and lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as that by which it was
made, or else antiquated by a long
continued uninforc'd disuse with the
tacit or presumed consent of the
Law-giver. That the Act printed
before the Common Prayer Book, and
entituled <hi>(An Act for the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity)</hi>
was such a Law, being it was
established in a full and free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in peaceable times, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102011:9"/>
by the Royal Assent, That it
still continues in force, and being
not yet Repealed, but by such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as (at least in the Opinion of
those that maintain the Dispute)
for want of the Royal Assent, have
not a sufficient right or authority to
do such an Act, nor disused but of
late times, and that by enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as is presum'd, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the mind of the Law-giver.
That therefore it still retains the
power of obliging in part of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
that power being so essential
and intrinsecal to every Law, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi>
a Law, that it can in no wise
be sever'd from it.</p>
                     <p>And that therefore no Minister
publickly officiating in the Church,
can with a good Conscience either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any part of that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the aforesaid Law, or
use any other Form than what is
contained in the foresaid Book, but
must either use the Form prescribed
in the Book, or else forbear to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102011:9"/>
The Answer to this Objection
(granting all in the Premisses
besides) dependeth upon the
right understanding of that which
is affirmed concering the Obligation
of the Laws according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law-giver;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> which if it
should be understood precisely of
that particular, actual, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
intention which the Law-giver
had declared by the words of the
Law (in which sense only the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
proceedeth) will not hold
true in all cases. But there is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
besides that, in Law-giver, a
more general, habitual, &amp; ultimate
intention of a more excellent and
transcendent nature than the former,
which is to have an influence into,
and over-ruling power over all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Laws <hi>(viz.)</hi> an intention by
the Laws to procure and promote
the publick good. The former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
binds, when it is subservient
to the latter, or consistent with it,
and consequently bindeth in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cases, and in orderly times, or else


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102011:10"/>
the Law is not a wholesome Law.
But when the observation of the
Law, by reason of the conjuncture
of circumstances, or the iniquity of
the times (contingencies which no
Lawgiver could either certainly
foresee, or if foreseen, sufficiently
provide against) would rather be
prejudicial than advantageous to the
Publick; or is manifestly attended
with such inconveniencies and sad
consequents to the Observers, as all
the imaginable good that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the Publick thereby, cannot
in any reasonable measure counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail:
In such case the Law obligeth
not, but according to the latter and
more general intention only; even
as in the operations of nature, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Agents do ordinarily move
according to their proper and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
inclinations; yet upon some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and to serve the ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of universal nature (for the
avoiding of some things which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
abhors) they are sometimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with motions quite contrary to


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102011:10"/>
their particular natures; as the Air
to descend, and the Water to ascend
for the avoiding of vacuity, &amp;c. The
common received Maxim (which
hath been sufficiently misapplied,
and that sometimes to very ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
since the beginning of these
unhappy divisions) in the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it looketh this way, <hi>Salus
populi suprema Lex:</hi> the equity of
which Maxim, as it leaveth in the
Law-giver a power of dispensing
with the Law (which is a suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Obligation thereof for the
time in respect of the proper and
particular intention) so he shall see
it expedient in order to the publick
good; so it leaveth in the Subject a
liberty upon just occasions (as in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of great exigency, and for the
preventing of such hazards and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
as might prove of noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
consequence to the Publick) to
do otherwise than the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
And neither is the exercise of
that power in the Lawgiver to be
thought an unreasonable Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102011:11"/>
nor the use of this liberty in
the Subject an unreasonable presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
inasmuch as the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing
with particular Laws is
such a Prerogative, as without which
no Commonwealth can be well
govern'd, but Justice would be turn'd
into Gall and Wormwood: Nor can
the Supream Governour, without
forfeiture of that faithfulness which
he oweth to the Publick Weal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
himself thereof.</p>
               <p>And he that presumeth of the
Law-givers consent to dispense with
him for the Observation of the Law
in such needful cases (where he hath
not the opportunity to consult his
pleasure therein) presumeth no more
than he hath reason to do. For it
may well be presum'd that the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
who is bound in all his Laws
to intend the safety of the Publick,
and of every member thereof in his
due proportion, hath no intention
by the strict observation of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Law, to oblige any person,
who is a Member of the Publick, to


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102011:11"/>
his destruction or ruin, when the
common good is not answerably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
thereby: Upon which ground
it is generally resolv'd by Casuists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That no Constitution (meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane)
can lay such Obligation upon
the Conscience of the Subject, but
that we may (according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency
of circumstances) do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than the Constitution requireth,
provided it be done <hi>extra casum
scandali &amp; contemptûs, i. e.</hi> without
either bewraying in himself any
contempt of the Authority of the
Law-giver by his carriage, or giving
any just occasion of scandal to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by his example in so doing.</p>
               <p>I have been somewhat the longer
in explaining this point, not only for
the better clearing of the present
doubt, but also in respect of the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of this consideration for the
preventing and removing of many
scruples that may happen to consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
men in such times as these,
wherein so many things are (and are
like to be) commanded and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102011:12"/>
contrary to the establish'd Laws,
and those (as they are perswaded)
yet standing in force. The best rule
that I know to guide men in their
deliberations and actions in such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent
cases (according to what
hath been already delivered) is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
and impartially to weigh the
benefit &amp; inconveniencies, as well on
the one side, as on the other, as they
stand in relation unto the Publick
Good: and if after such examination
and comparison made, it shall then
evidently (or but in the judgment
of probability) appear, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Law, according to
the proper intention of the Law-giver
therein, though with hazard
of Estate, Liberty, or even life it
self, hath a greater tendency to the
Publick Good, and the preservation
of Church or Commonwealth in
safety, peace, and order, than the
preventing of the foresaid hazards,
or other evil consequents, by doing
otherwise than the Law requireth,
can have; or (which cometh to


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102011:12"/>
one) if the violating of the Law
shall then appear to be more prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the Publick Good, than the
preservation of the Subject's Estate,
Liberty, or Life can be beneficial
hereunto: In such case the Subject is
bound to hazard all he hath, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
whatsoever inconveniencies
and calamities can ensue thereupon,
rather than violate the Law with
contempt of that Authority to which
he oweth subjection.</p>
               <p>But if it shall (after such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
made) evidently (or but more
probably than the contrary) appear,
That that preservation of such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Life, Liberty, Estate, would
more benefit the Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
than the punctual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Law at that time,
and with those circumstances, would
do; it were an unseasonable, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and pernicious scrupulosity
for such a person to think himself in
such a case obliged for the observing
of the Law (perhaps but once or
twice) with little or no benefit to the


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102011:13"/>
Publick, to ruin himself, whereby
to render himself unuseful and unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Publick for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>To bring this Discourse home, and
to apply it to the business now under
dispute. Suppose we ten, twenty,
or One hundred godly Ministers,
well affected to the establish'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and actually possess'd of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,
with the Charge of Souls
thereto belonging, should, thinking
themselves in Conscience obliged to
the use of the whole Form of the
Book, as is by the Act appointed,
without any addition, omission, or
alteration whatsoever (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the present conjuncture of
Affairs) resolve to use the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
it would be well consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what the effects and consequents
thereof would be.</p>
               <p>Besides other evils, these three are
visible, which must all unavoidably
follow one upon another, if any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shall be found (as doubtless with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
short time there will be found one


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102011:13"/>
or other) to inform and prosecute
against them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The utter undoing of so many
worthy persons, fit to do God and
his Church good service, together
with all those persons that depend
upon them for their livelyhood, by
putting the fruits of their Benefices,
wherewith they should buy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bread, under Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The depriving of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the opportunity of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duties that belong unto them
in their Ministerial Calling, in not
permitting them, after such Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
to teach or instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
belonging to their Charge, or to
exercise any thing of their Function
publickly in the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The delivering over the Sheep
of Christ, that lately were under
the hands of the faithful Shepherds,
into the Custody of ravenous
Wolves, when such Guides shall be
set over the several Congregations,
as will be sure to mis-teach them one

way or other <hi>(viz.)</hi> either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling
into them Puritanical and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Principles, that they may
the more securely exercise their
Presbyterian Tyranny over their
Judgments, Consciences, Persons,
and Estates, or else by setting up new
Lights before them, to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a maze of Anabaptistical confusion
and frenzy.</p>
               <p>These consequents are so heavy
to the Sufferers, so certain to ensue
upon the use of Common Prayer,
and so much without the power of
the Law-givers (in this state of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs)
either to prevent or remedy,
that it is beyond the wit of man
what benefit to the Publick can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
by the strict observation of the
Act, that may in any proportion
countervail these mischiefs. In which
case, that man must needs suppose
a strange austerity in the Law-giver,
that dares not presume of his consent
to disoblige him (for the time) from
observing the same. It would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
well considered, Whether he that


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102011:14"/>
by his own over-nice scrupulosity
runs all these hazards, be not (in
some measure) guilty of his own
undoing, of deserting his station,
and of betraying his flock, and do
not thereby lose much of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
which a Christian Confessor
may take in his sufferings, when they
are laid upon him by the Hand of
God, and not pull'd upon himself by
his own hands. And more I shall
not need to say as to that first Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The next thing objected is,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>The danger of the Scandal
that others might be ready to take
at the Example, who seeing the Law
so little regarded by such men (men
that have Cure of Souls, and perhaps
also of some eminency and esteem in
the Church, and whose Example
will be much look'd upon) will be
easily encourag'd by this Example to
set light by all Authority, and to
take the liberty to obey and disobey
the Laws of their Soveraign at
their pleasure.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102011:15"/>
But this Objection, after we are
once satisfied concerning the former,
need not much trouble us. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It seemeth an unreasonable
thing in cases of great Exigence
(such as we now suppose) that the
fear of scandalizing our weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
(which is but <hi>Debitum charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
only) should lay upon us a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
necessity of observing the Law
punctually, whatsoever inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
and mischiefs may ensue
thereupon: when the duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to our known Governours
(which is <hi>Debitum justitiae</hi> also,
and therefore more Obligatory than
the other) doth not impose that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon us; as hath been already
shewn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides, Arguments drawn
from Scandal in things neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
nor (setting the reason of
Scandal aside) inexpedient, as they
are subject to sundry frailties other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
so they are manifestly of no
weight at all, when they are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpois'd
with the apparent danger


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102011:15"/>
of evil consequents on the other
side. For in such cases there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
equal danger (if not rather
something more) of Scandal to be
taken from the Example the quite
contrary way. We may see it in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
the point now in hand: It is
alledged on the one side, That by
laying aside the use of the Common
Prayer, men that are over scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
will be encourag'd to take a
greater liberty in dispensing with the
Laws (to the despising both of Laws
and Governours) than they ought.
And why may it not, by the same
reason, be as well alledg'd on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, That by holding up a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of using the Common Prayer,
men that have tender Consciences
may be induc'd to entertain scruples
(to their utter undoing, and to the
destruction of their people) when
they need not?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that in the third place,
which cometh up home to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and taketh off the Objection
clearly, is this, That in judging Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102011:16"/>
of Scandal, we are not so much
to look to the event, what it is, or
may be, as to the cause, whence it
cometh. For sometimes there is
given just cause of Scandal; and yet
no Scandal followeth, because it is
not taken: Sometimes scandal is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and yet no just cause given:
and sometimes there is both cause of
Scandal given, and Scandal taken
thereat. But no man is concern'd
at any Scandal that happeneth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
by occasion of any thing
done by him, neither is chargeable
with it farther than he is guilty of
having given it. If then we give
Scandal to others, and they take it
not, the whole guilt is ours, and they
are faultless. If we give it, and
they take it, we are to bear a share
in the blame as they, and that a deep
share; <hi>(Vae homini, Wo to the man
by whome the offence cometh, Matth.
18. 7.)</hi> But if they take offence when
we give none, it is a thing we cannot
help, and therefore the whole blame
must lie upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102011:16"/>
Wherefore, if at any time any
doubt shall arise in that Case of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
How far forth the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may oblige us to the doing or not
doing of any thing propos'd; The
Resolution will come on much the
easier, if we shall but rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what it is to give Scandal, or
how many ways a man may become
guilty of scandalizing another by his
Example.</p>
               <p>The ways (as I conceive) are but
these four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a man doth something
before another, which is in it self e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
unlawful, and sinful. In which
case, neither the intention of him
that doth it, nor the event as to him
that seeth it done, is of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
For it matters not whether
the doer hath an intention to draw
the other into sin, or not; the very
matter and substance of the action
being evil, and done before others,
is sufficient to render the doer guilty
of having given Scandal, though
neither he had intention himself so


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102011:17"/>
to do, nor was any other person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
scandaliz'd thereby: because
whatsoever is in its own nature evil,
is of it self, and in its own nature
scandalous, and of ill Example.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 17. 22.</note> give Scandal
by their wretched prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and greediness about the
Sacrifices of the Lord, and their
shameless abusing the Women. And
so did <hi>David</hi> also give great Scandal
in the matter of <hi>Vriah, 2 Sam. 12.
14.</hi> Here the Rule is,
<q>Do nothing that is evil, for fear
of giving Scandal.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second way is, when a
man doth something before another
with a direct intention and formal
purpose of drawing him thereby to
commit sin. In which case neither
the matter of the action, nor the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
is of any consideration: For it
makes no difference as to the sin of
giving Scandal, whether any man be
effectually entic'd to commit sin or
not thereby; neither doth it make


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102011:17"/>
any difference, whether the thing
done were in it self unlawful, or not,
so as it had an appearance of evil,
and from thence an aptitude to draw
another by the doing of that (by i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation)
which should be really and
intrinsecally evil. The wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
alone (whatsoever the effect
should be, or what means soever
should be us'd to promote it) sufficeth
to induce the guilt of giving Scandal
upon the doer. This was <hi>Ierohoam</hi>'s
sin, in setting up the Calves, with a
formal purpose and intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(for his own secular and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ends) to corrupt the purity of
Religion, and to draw the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Idolatrous Worship. For which
cause he is so often stigmatiz'd with
it, as a note of Infamy, to stick by
him whilst the World lasteth, being
scarce ever mention'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but with this addition, Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
<hi>the son of</hi> Nebat, <hi>which made</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<hi>to sin.</hi> Here the Rule is,
<q>Do nothing, good or evil, with an
intention to give Scandal.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:102011:18"/>
3. The third way is when a man
doth something before another,
which in it self is not evil, but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and so according to the Rule
of Christian Liberty, lawful for him
to do, or not to do, as he shall see
cause (yea, and perhaps otherwise
commodious and convenient for him
to do) yet whereas he probably fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth
that others will take Scandal,
and be occasioned thereby to do evil.
In such a case, if the thing to be done
be not in some degree prudentially
necessary for him to do, but that he
might, without very great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
or prejudice to himself or any
third person, leave it undone: He is
bound in Charity to his Brother's
Soul (for whom Christ died) and for
the avoiding of Scandal, to abridge
himself in the exercise of his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty for that time, so far as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suffer some inconvenience
himself by the not doing of it, than
by the doing of it to cause his Brother
to offend. The very Case which is
so often, so largely, and so earnestly


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102011:18"/>
insisted upon by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> See <hi>Rom.
14. 13, 21. Rom. 15. 1, 3. 1 Cor. 8. 7, 13.
1 Cor. 9. 12, 15, 19, 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 23. 33.
Here the Rule is,
<q>Do nothing that may be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
forborn, whereat Scandal
will be taken.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The last way is, when a man
doth somthing before another, which
is not only lawful, but (according to
the exigencies of present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances)
<hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofful,
and even prudentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for him to do, but foreseeth
that the other will be like to make
an ill use of it, and take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereby to commit sin, if he be
not withal careful, as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in him lieth, to prevent the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
that may be taken thereat: For,
<hi>Qui non prohibet peccare, cum potest,
jubet.</hi> In such case the bare neglect
of his Brother, and not using his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
endeavour to prevent the evil
that might ensue, maketh him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Upon which consideration stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Equity of the Judicial Law


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102011:19"/>
given to the Jews, which
ordered,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 33, 34.</note> That in case a
man dig a Pit for the use of
his Family, and looking no farther
than his own convenience, put no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
upon it, and leave it open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it hapneth his Neighbours Beast
to fall thereinto and perish, the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Pit is to make it good, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he was the occasioner of that
loss to his Neighbour, which he
might and ought to have prevented.
Here the Rule is
<q>Order the doing of that, which
may not be well left undone, in
such sort that no Scandal (so far
as you can help it) may be taken
thereat.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To apply this. The thing under
debate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Action propos'd to
present enquiry is, The laying aside
the Common Prayer, being enjoyn'd
by Law, and using instead thereof
some other Form of Church Service
of our own devising. And the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
concerning it is, Whether it
may be done with a good Conscience


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102011:19"/>
in regard of the Scandal that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or at least may be taken thereat,
Yea or No?</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch as in this Enquiry
we take it for granted, That the
thing to be done is not in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
simply evil, but rather in this
state of affairs prudentially necessary;
and that they who make scruple at it
upon the point of Scandal, have not
the least intention of drawing other
of the Laws into contempt, or their
Brethren into sin by their Example.
It is manifest that three of the now
mention'd Cases, with the Rules to
each of them appending, are not
pertinent to the present Enquiry.
But since the last of the four only
proveth to be our Case, we have
therefore no more to do for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of our Judgments, and quieting
of our Consciences, and the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our Practice in this Affair,
than to consider well what the Rule
in this Case given obligeth us unto;
which is not to leave the Action un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for the danger of Scandal,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102011:20"/>
which (besides the Inconveniencies
formerly mention'd) would but start
new Questions, and those beget more
to the multiplying unnecessary Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>in infinitum:</hi> But to order the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it so, that (if it were possible)
no Scandal at all might ensue thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or at least wise not by our default,
through our careless or undiscreet
managery thereof. Even as the Jew
that stood in need to sink a Pit for the
service of his House or Ground, was
not (for fear his Neighbours Beast
should fall into it, and be drown'd)
bound by the Law to forbear the
making of it, but only to provide a
sufficient cover for it, where he had
made it. The thing then in this Case
is not to be left undone, when it so
much behoveth us to do it; but the
Action to be carried on (for the
manner of doing, and in all respects
and circumstances thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
with so much chariness and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
moderation and wisdom (to
our best understanding) that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of our so doing, with the true


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102011:20"/>
cause thereof, may appear to the
World, to the satisfaction of those
that are willing to take notice of it;
and that such persons as would be
willing to make use of our Ensample
to do the same thing, where there is
not the same necessity, may do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own score, and not be able
to vouch our practice for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;
which how it may be best done
for particular directions, every cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and conscientious man must
ask his own discretion. Some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
helps thereunto I shall lay down
in answering the next Objection,
where they would fall in again not
improperly, and so stop two Gaps
with one Bush.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="response">
               <head>Object. 3. Schism.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The last Objection is that
of Shism. The Objectors
hold all such persons as have oppos'd
either Liturgy or Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they were by Law estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
within this Realm, for no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Schismaticks; and truly I
shall not much gain-say it. But then
they argue,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <p>That for them to do the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102011:21"/>
same thing in the publick worship of
God that Schismaticks do (and for
doing whereof especially it is that
they avow them Schismaticks) would
(as they conceive) involve them in
the Schism also, as partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in some degree with the other: And
their Consciences also would, from
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22. condemn them either of
hypocrisie, in allowing that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in their own practice,
which they condemn in others; or of
uncharitableness, in judging others
as Schismaticks for doing but the
same thing which they can allow
themselves to practise. For all that
such persons, as they call Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
do in this matter of the Church
Service, is but to leave out the
Churches Prayers, and to put in their
own. Or say, this should not make
them really guilty of the Schism
they so much detest, yet would such
their symbolizing with them seem
at least a kind of unworthy compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with them, more than could
well become the simplicity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102011:21"/>
much less of a Minister of the
Gospel, whose duty it is to
shun even the least <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of evil.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.</note> Besides, that by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they should but confirm such men
in their Schismatical Principles
and Practice.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection hath 3 Branches.
To the first whereof I oppose the old
saying, <hi>Duo cum faciunt idem, non
est idem;</hi> which, although spoken
quite to another purpose, yet is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
capable of such a sense which will
very well fit our present purpose al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
               <p>I Answer therefore in short. To
do the same thing that Schismaticks
do (especially in times of Confusion,
and till things can be reduc'd unto
better Order, and when men are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
thereunto to prevent
greater mischiefs) doth not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
infer a partaking with them in
Schism, no, nor so much as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
unless it may appear upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
presumption otherwise, that
it is done out of the same Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102011:22"/>
Spirit, and upon such Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles as theirs are.</p>
               <p>The other two Branches <hi>(viz.</hi>
That of seeming compliance with
Schismaticks, and That of the ill use
they make of it to confirm them in
their Schism) do upon the matter
fall in upon the aforesaid point of
Scandal, and are in effect but the
same Objection, only put into a
new dress, and so have receiv'd their
Answer already. And the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against both these Fears (as
well that of Scandal, as this of
Schism) is the same which was there
prescrib'd, Even to give assurance to
all men, by our carriage and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
therein, that we do not lay aside
Common Prayer of our own accord,
or out of any dislike thereof, neither
in contempt of our rightful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
or of the Laws, nor out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
base compliance with the Times,
or unworthy Secular own ends, nor
out of any Schismatical principles,
seditious designs, or innovating hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
but meerly enforc'd thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102011:22"/>
by such a necessity, as we cannot
otherwise avoid in order to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and the Publick Good,
for the preservation of our Families,
our Flocks, and our Functions: And
that with the good leave and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
(as we have great reason
to believe) of such as have power
to dispense with us and the Laws in
that behalf.</p>
               <p>This if we shall do <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> and
with our utmost endeavours, in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleness
of heart, and with godly
discretion, perhaps it will not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prevail with either the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of inconsiderate and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
persons, or the ill use that may
be made of our Example, through
the ignorance or negligence of some
<hi>(scandalum pusillorum)</hi> or through
the perversness and malice of
others <hi>(scandalum pharisaeorum)</hi>
as the Schools term them: But
assuredly it will be sufficient in the
sight of God, and the witness of our
own hearts, and to the Consciences
of charitable and considering men,


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102011:23"/>
to acquit us clear of all guilt, either
of Scandal or Schism in the least d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Which we may probably do
by observing these ensuing, or such
other like general Directions (The
liberty of using such meet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
as the circumstances in
particular Cases shall require, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
allowed and reserved). <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If we shall decline the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and society of known Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,

familiarly with them, or more than
the necessary affairs of life, and the
rules of Neighbourhood and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
civility will require; especially
not to give countenance unto their
Church Assemblies, by our presence
among them, if we can avoid it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we shall retain, as well in
common discourse, as in our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and holy Offices of the Church,
the old Theological and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
terms and forms of Speech,
which have been generally received
and used in the Churches of Christ,
which the people are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102011:23"/>
with, and are wholsome and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
and not follow our new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in that uncouth affected garb of
Speech, or Canting Language rather
(if I may so call it) which they have
of late taken up, as the signal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
and characteristical note of
that, which in that their new Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
they call The Godly Party, or
Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If in officiating we repeat not
only the Lord's Prayer, the Creed,
the ten Commandements, and such
other passages in the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Book, as (being the very words
of Scripture) no man can except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst;
but so much of the old Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
besides, in the very words and
syllables of the Book, as we think
the Ministers of State in those parts
wherein we live will suffer, and the
Auditory, before whom we officiate,
will bear; sith the Officers in all
parts of the Land are not alike strict,
nor the people in all Parishes alike
disaffected in this respect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If, where we must of necessity


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102011:24"/>
vary from the words, we yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Order of the Book in the
main parts of the holy Offices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the substance of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and embellishing those of our
own making, which we substitute
into the place of those we leave out,
with phrases and passages taken out
of the Book in other places.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If, where we cannot safely
mention the Particulars mentioned
in the Book (as namely in praying
for the King, the Queen, the Royal
Progeny, and the Bishops) we shall
yet use in our Prayers some such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
terms, and other intimations
devised for that purpose, as may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
convey to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the people what our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are therein, and yet not be
sufficient to fetch us within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of the Ordinance.</p>

occasion now and then, where it may
