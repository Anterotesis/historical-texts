         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NATVRE desiring, that Man

full of wonders, has made

that he may live the longer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
all his functions with the less

number both of external and internal
causes, the Divine Providence know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that nothing can be more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

a Man, Tis therefore very
wise advice, to draw out of the bosom
of the Earth many sorts of Medicines,
as well for the conservations of those
Persons that are in perfect health, as
for the ease and cure of those that are
infirm and crazy. In the mean time,
as Climates are very different th' one
from th' other, and as several Countries
produce different species, so Nature
has distributed certain Plants and
Drugs to some Countries, which she
has denied to others; to the end that
hereby she might the better favour
the mutual commerce of all People,
and for the better cementing humane
Society, at which she alwaies seems
particularly to aim, since she has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
the love and desire thereof
in the minds of all, except such as
are ill natur'd and Men-haters, who
seem to be abhortives and monsters
in Nature. They therefore do seem
to clash with Reason, who in contempt
of the sacred Rules of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb facs="tcp:56959:4"/>
do hold, that every Country
ought to be content with the sole use
of its own Drugs, without seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those things wherewith Strangers
and Foreigners may furnish us.</p>
            <p>For is it not the meer effect of a
capricious and peevish humour, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
without any reason to deprive
Mankind of the use of those healthful
productions wherewith Nature from
all parts presents him, and to hinder
him from all advantages, which he
may thence expect? Now amongst all
the Drugs whereof Heaven has shewed
it self liberal to Men, there be three
chiefly which in our time have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so great a vogue or credit, and so
particular an esteem through all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
by the signal effects which they
are daily found to produce in an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of People, who make use
thereof with good success that I have
thought it a thing of great importance
to communicate to the publique some
Discourses and Treatises made on
<pb facs="tcp:56959:5"/>
this Subject, compiled and gathered
together in one Body, that our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
alwayes curious and greedy of no
velty, may understand the very depth
and bottom of these abovesaid Drugs,
as well as others; the use whereof has
been but lately known amongst us, yet
they become more famousevery day
than other, by the frequent and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
use we make of them, and with a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
which is no less wonderful than
profitable; those three Drugs which I
mean, and whereof I intend to treat
here, are COFFEE, TEA, and
CHOCOLATE: The two first
are simple Drugs, the latter is a
mixt composition of several Drugs.</p>
            <p>COFFEE grows in <hi>Arabia,</hi> but
the other two come from the <hi>Indies,
viz.</hi> the <hi>Tea</hi> from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
and the <hi>Chocolate</hi> (or <hi>Cacao nut,</hi>
whereof it is chiefly made) from the
<hi>West-Indies.</hi> The first peice I present
you with in this Book is a curious
Discourse of COFFEE, done into
<pb facs="tcp:56959:5"/>
French out of an Original Copy in
Latine, not long since composed by a
very learned Physitian of <hi>Germany,</hi>
who would be nameless, to the which
I have added some draughts gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the works of some learned
Travellers on this same subject. The
Second Treatise consists of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Remarks extracted from the
Dutch <hi>East-India</hi> Companies Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
to the Emperour of <hi>China.</hi> From a
relation of the Voyage of the Bishop
of <hi>Beryte</hi> to <hi>Cochinchina.</hi> From
the Voyage of Father <hi>Alexander</hi> of
<hi>Rhodes:</hi> And from the Medicinal
Observations of <hi>Nicholas Tulpius</hi> a
a Physician of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last peice is a Discourse of
<hi>Chocolate,</hi> made by a Spanish Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
named <hi>Antonio Colme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi>
of <hi>Ledesma.</hi> I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that this little Collection
will be well accepted by all good men,
who shall thereby be enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what excellent Vertues the
<pb facs="tcp:56959:6"/>
Creator has distributed to these three
foreign Drugs: Which shall so much
the more oblige them to admire and
bless the Sovereign Author of all
these Creatures, and shall render
them the more desirous to make good
use thereof, with continual Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
in all the Distempers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they shall find themselves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
threatned, or really afflicted.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the use and the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Beans, were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forbidden by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
because that their Flowers being
spotted with a black Colour, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
a melancholly shape, and the
Souls of the dead that did dwell
therein: And though there be others
that reject them, affirming that the
use of them dulls the senses, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
troublesome Dreams: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they serve us in the Nature of
Victuals and Physick, I shall not
think my time and labour mis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
if I communicate to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
something on this Subject of
Beans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56959:7"/>
Nevertheless I don't mean to speak
of our <hi>European</hi> Beans; neither of the
wilde, nor those they sow, whether
they be Lupine, or Kidney Beans, or
whatsoever sort; of all which we were
ever wont to make use, either in the
Kitchin or in the Drugsters Trade, since
that the most famous Physicians and
Chyrurgions have employed them in
the Cure of Maladies internal as well
as external; <hi>viz.</hi> In the Dropsie, the
Stone, the Stoppage of the Urine, the
bloudy Flux, Loosness, Bruises, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diseases. Neither will I mention
the Bean of <hi>Egypt;</hi> which <hi>Dioscorides</hi>
speaks of, which the Crocodiles avoid
as being destructive to their Eyes, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Pliny.</hi> Neither of the Kidney Beans
of <hi>Paludan Garet,</hi> like the <hi>Cacao</hi> Nut
(whereof they make <hi>Chocolate</hi>) named
otherwise <hi>Coles</hi> by <hi>Clusius:</hi> Nor will I
treat of the purging Beans of <hi>Carthage;</hi>
or those of <hi>Ferdinand de Lopez</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagneda;</hi>
which come from the Isle of
St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> I will speak for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of a certain Bean of <hi>Arabia</hi> called
<hi>Bon,</hi> whereof they make a Drink term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Coffee,</hi> which was heretofore in use
amongst Arabians, and Egyptians;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56959:7"/>
and which is now a dayes in very great
request amongst the English, French,
and Germanes.</p>
                  <p>The first that makes mention of the
Property of this Bean, under the name
of <hi>Bunchum</hi> in the <hi>9th.</hi> Century after the
Birth of our Saviour, was <hi>Zachary Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Rases,</hi> commonly called <hi>Rhasio,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
famous Arabian Physician, who has
composed a great many excellent Books,
to wit, Ten dedicated to King <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
and Fifteen other learned Works.
He was the first, that did explain what
was the meaning of <hi>Bunchum,</hi> assuring
us that it is hot and dry, very good
for the Stomach, it hinders the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
smell of Sweat, and of depila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Oyntments.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Rases</hi> divers other Physicians,
and particularly <hi>Avicenne,</hi> explains <hi>Bon</hi>
under the name of <hi>Bunchum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the choice thereof, he says
that of a Lemmon colour, light, and
of a good smell is the best; that the
white and the heavy is naught, that it
is hot and dry in the first degree, and
according to others cold in the first
degree. As to its operations and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
it fortifies the members, it cleans
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56959:8"/>
the skin, and dries up the humidities
that are under it, and it gives an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
smell to all the Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prosper Alpinus</hi> in his Book of the
Medicines and Plants of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
throughly describes the Bean <hi>Bon,</hi> and
the Drink they make thereof. For he
sayes the Grain <hi>Bon</hi> is in great use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Egyptians, of which they
prepare a decoction, whereof they
drink in their Country just the same as
we do the wine in our Taverns: And
tho they drink it all day long, yet their
manner is alwayes to take a large
quantity thereof in the morning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
as hot as they can well indure it,
it being the general opinion amongst
them, that it warms and corroborates
the Stomach, and that it is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
remedy to cure all the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Bowels.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Remedy against
the stoppage of Womens Courses, and
they make often use thereof, when
they don't flow so fast as they desire,
they sip a great deal of it, as hot as
they can drink it; alwayes taking
care to drink it by little and little:
for it is the Custome of every one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56959:8"/>
to drink it after that manner. He
proceeds further in it, saying, that the
drink called <hi>Coffee</hi> is much esteem'd
of in those Countries, the which they
prepare with certain black Grains,
which come very near to Beans. This
decoction they make two ways: the
one with the skin or the outside of the
aforesaid Grain, and the other with the
very substance of the Bean. That
which is made of the skin is of more
force, then the other that's made with
the Bean it self: I have seen the Tree
whereon it grows in the Orchard of a
Turkish Commander, who had caused
it to be transplanted out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> it
very much resembles the Plant, called
<hi>Priests Bonnet.</hi> The quality of this
Drink is cold and dry, or rather tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in respect of cold, by reason of
some heat, which is found mingled
therewith: For this grain is composed
of two different substances; to wit,
the one gross and terren, whereby it
strengthens and corroborates, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is thought to be made up of warm
parts, by which it heats, cleanses, and
opens. This decoction has a taste not
much different from that of <hi>Succory,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56959:9"/>
tho it has a greater power to remove
all obstructions. Having then took
notice; that the Women in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their courses, to help evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
drink of it by little and little, a
great quantity very hot, and in that
time make great use of this Drink.
Assisted and with this experience
I begun to employ it for all women
whatsoever, who by some cause or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have their purgations ceas'd or
diminished, the which I have seen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
by very many with good
success; and thence I have learned,
that this sort of Medicine was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for the stopping of Womens cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which proceeds from the obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the veins in the Matrice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
before hand provided for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the body. This Drink took
in the morning fasting, mightily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
the Courses, and it is a quick
and certain remedy for those Women,
who not having their courses are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with violent pains.</p>
                  <p>They prepare this decoction taking
a pound and a half of the Kernels of
this Grain, peeling off the skin they
roast it before the fire, and having
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56959:9"/>
roasted or parched it, they boyl it in
twenty pintes of water. Others take
the Grain roasted or parched, and
beat to powder, and let it lie steept
in water a whole day: and without any
other infusion they boyl it half a way,
and having strain'd it, they keep it
in earthen pots stopt close, to make
use thereof when they shall want it.</p>
                  <p>They prepare this drink after the
same fashion, with the Bark of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Grain: which nevertheless
they take in a less quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> some
only six ounces, others nine, with
twenty pintes of Fountain water,
which they boyl half away. This
Drink the Arabians call <hi>Caova:</hi> the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
(as I said before) grow on a Tree
much like our <hi>Priests Bonnet,</hi> tho the
leaves are thicker, harder, and greener,
and besides they are green all the year
round.</p>
                  <p>They use this decoction to fortifie
the stomach, when it is too cold, and
to help digestion, as also to remove
the obstructions of the entrails: they
make use of it several days with good
success, in the cold swellings of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and the Spleen. <hi>Avieenne</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56959:10"/>
these Grains, and attributes the
same use to them; esteeming them to
be hot in the third degree, and dry
in the second; which does not seem
likely; since it has a sweet with a
kind of bitterness, without any sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or acrimony.</p>
                  <p>We must now particularize the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of this Drink made with <hi>Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee;</hi>
tis true, I have spoken something
hereof before, but in general now I
will proceed to the particulars.</p>
                  <p>The Grain <hi>Bon</hi> whose figure (with

skinn'd and pill'd, is put into an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron

with the coverlid, through this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
they thrust a Spit, by the
means whereof they turn it before
the Fire, till it shall be well rosted;
after which having beaten it into
very fine Powder, you may make use
thereof, in an equal proportion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the number of the people that
will drink it: <hi>Viz.</hi> the third part of
a spoonful for each person, and put

having let it boyl a small time,
you must pour it into little dishes of
porcelain or any other sort, and so
let it be drunk by little and little,
as hot as it can possibly be indur'd,
but especially fasting.</p>
                  <p>I have here explained in general
the Virtues of that wholesome drink
called <hi>Coffee;</hi> tho it will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unnecessary, to relate what
an eminent <hi>Arabian</hi> Physician speaks
thereof, who more particularly declares
these things that follow.</p>
                  <p>The fruit <hi>Bon</hi> (says he) is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Month <hi>Ab,</hi> which being
took out of its shell is divided into
two parts, its Flowers are whitish,
this Bean is hot in the first degree,
and dry in the second, that is to say
its Skin, as to the kirnel, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
temperate, nevertheless it
dries, but moderately and plesantly:
Its drink is good against <hi>Catharrs</hi> and
<hi>Rheums,</hi> which trouble the Breast: In
the stoppage of Womens courses, and
Urine, against the boyling of the
blood, and the decaying of the
strength 'tis very necessary. This
drink has got the same esteem in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56959:11"/>
and <hi>Sweden:</hi> In which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

frequently. And especially at <hi>Paris</hi>

                     <p>'Tis related that the Turks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

one which they greatly esteem, and

which is excellent, especially in the

Porcelain Porringers, their manner
is seting themselves down on the

oftentimes to their mouth, but they
drink but a very little at a time, by
reason of its extream heat. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients

this Liquor, are certain fruits which
are call'd <hi>Buncho,</hi> by the Inhabitants

I shall think it to be the same thing
till the Learned shall better inform

them, for which cause there
be very many of them that sell it
in publick Shops, and a great many

Physician does altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the use of <hi>Coffee,</hi> in a Treatise
concerning the abuse of <hi>Tobacco</hi> and
<hi>Tea,</hi> for as much as it effeminates
both the body and understanding,
which yet it does not by cooling it
too much, but because it insensibly
dries by reason of its natural Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure
wherewith it abounds as well
as <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and the <hi>Agnus Castus,</hi> or
<hi>Park-leaves,</hi> but we ought to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
what this Learned man says of the
abuse, and not of the right usage of
<hi>Coffee,</hi> otherwise one may as well
forbid the use of <hi>Rhubard, China,
Sassafras,</hi> and other Drugs which
grow out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For my part I do no less blame
the abuse of <hi>Coffee,</hi> than that of
Wine: But I defend the lawful use
thereof, since it is evident that many
find this drink to be very profitable,
taken in the Morning fasting, with a
little Sugar, in a moderate quantity,
and to very good purpose, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56959:13"/>
experience shews that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to cure the indispositions of the
Stomach, stop Fluxes, and fortifies the
whole body. If all those that make
use of <hi>Coffee,</hi> did it through a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of daintiness and nicety, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
discourse would be sufficient
to satisfie their curiosities, but the
most part of those that use it are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
thereto by necessity, and take
it rather as a Medicine and not as a
dainty dish: I thought I should do
them a pleasure to add hereto these
following remarks on the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which I have gathered from the
reading of some particular Voyages,
by which one may see that all the
Authors, who have treated of the
properties of this sort of Bean, are
agreed in the same opinion, that it is
most excellent in the curing of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
indispositions, and most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for those which trouble the head
or Stomach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fietro Del Lavallè</hi> an Italian Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Sirnamed the illustrious Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
speaks in two several places of his
Book concerning <hi>Coffee,</hi> but as that
which he says of it in the first place
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56959:14"/>
is not very considerable, I'le pass it
over, and only insist upon his second
remark of <hi>Coffee,</hi> wherein speaking
of the Turkish Liquors, he utters
his mind in these Terms. The
Turks have a Drink of a black Colour,
which during the Summer is very
cooling, whereas in the Winter it
mightily heats and warms the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet without changing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and always continuing the
same drink, that they swallow hot
as it comes from the Fire, and they
drink it at long draughts, not
at dinner time, but as a kind of
dainty, and as it were to please their
palate, and to entertain themselves
at their case in the Company of
their friends, and one cannot find
any meetings amongst them where
they drink it not. For which end
they keep a great fire on purpose,
near which they keep always ready
little Porringers of Porcelain filled
with this mixture; and when that
is hot enough, there be Servants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
for this end, who do nothing
els<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but carry these Porringers to
each man in the Company, as hot
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56959:14"/>
as they can, giving them also some
<hi>Melon</hi> seed to chew, for the better
passing away the time; and with this
Seed and this Drink, which they call
<hi>Cahue,</hi> they divert themselves in their
Conversations, in publick Feasts or
particular Recreations, sometimes the
space of seven or eight hours. I
drank of it last Summer, as a refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with <hi>Melon</hi> Seed, and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
enough; I remember I have
read somewhere that the Antients
did likewise use such sorts of Liqours,
and if that be true, there is a great
deal of likely-hood that it is was the
same thing: Because that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other fashions, as well of
this Country as abroad amongst
Forreigners, I find every day some
foot-steps and remainders of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
This Drink, as I remember,
is made with the grain or Fruit of
a certain Tree, which grows in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi>
towards <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the fruit
it produces is called <hi>Cahue,</hi> whence
this Drink derives its Name, 'tis of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n oval shape, of the same bigness
as a middle-sized <hi>Olive,</hi> and to make
this composition they take sometimes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56959:15"/>
no more than the skin, which is
tender, sometimes only the Kernel
which is like to beans; and they
are of an opinion, that of these two
juices, the one heats the to'ther cools,
but I cannot well call to mind whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the refreshing is that of the
skin or the other.</p>
                     <p>The way to make the Drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is thus: They burn the skin or
Kernel of this fruit as it best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
their fancy or palate, and they
beat it to a powder very fine,
of a blackish Colour, which is not
very pleasant to the eye-sight; this
Powder will keep a long time, and
is always to be found in the Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Shops. When they would drink
thereof they boyl it in Water in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pots made on purpose, having a
long and slender pipe to pour it
readily into the little Porringers,
and when the Water has boiled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
they put therein such a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of this powder, according to the
number of people that are to drink
of it: they let this powder boyl with
the Water sometime until it sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
have lost its bitter taste, which it wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56959:15"/>
always keep without a perfect boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Afterwards they pour out this
Liqour to be drunk as hot as the
Moath and Throat can endure it, not
suffering themselves to swallow it but
by little and little, and at several times,
because of its actual heat: and after
it has taken the taste and colour of
this powder, whereof the thick sinks
down and remains at the bottom
of the Pot, to make use of it more
deliciously, they mingle with this
powder of <hi>Cahue,</hi> much Sugar, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon,
and Cloves well beaten,
which gives it an exquisite taste,
and makes it much more nourishing.
But yet without these dainties this
drink it agreeable enough to the taste
with the powder of <hi>Cahue</hi> alone;
and if you will believe them it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
notably to the health, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
digestion, fortifying the Stomach,
stopping Rheums and Catharrs: These
are very good qualities if they be
effectual. They also say that after
Supper it hinders drowsiness, and for
that reason those that would study
by Night do then drink thereof.
There is sold here by retail so great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56959:16"/>
a quantity of it, that they say the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
impost upon <hi>Cahue,</hi> amounts to a
considerable sum to the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
profit: When I return I will
bring some of it with me, and I will
impart the Knowledge of this simple
to the Italians, which perhaps at
present is altogether unknown to
them. If they should drink it with
Wine as they do with Water, I
durst say it would be the <hi>Nepenthe</hi>
that <hi>Homer</hi> mentions, which <hi>Helen</hi>
drunk there, it being for certain
that <hi>Cahue</hi> is brought hither from
that Country: And as this <hi>Nepenthe</hi>
was a charm against cares and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the same <hi>Cahue</hi> to this day
is used amongst the Turks as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
and past-time, making
the hours to slip away merrily in
conversation, intermingling with their
drink several pleasant and recreative
discourses, which unawares brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their mind this forgetfulness of
sorrows which the Poet attributes to
his <hi>Nepenthe.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thevenot</hi> in a Relation which he
has published of a Voyage into the
<hi>Levant</hi> set a particular Chapter apart
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56959:16"/>
which he imployes in describing the
Victuals, Drink, and Lodging of
the Turks, and after having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
their other Liqours, speaks
thus;</p>
                     <p>The Turks have another drink
very common amongst them which
they call <hi>Cahue;</hi> whereof they make
use every hour in the day. This
drink is made of a grain whereof we
will speak by and by. They roast it
in a pan, or any other utensil upon
the fire, afterward they peel it, and
beat it into powder very fine, and
when they would drink thereof, they
take a brazen pot made purposely
which they call <hi>Ibrik,</hi> and having
fill'd it with water, thy boyl it, and
when it boyls they put of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therein, for about two cups
of water one spoonfull, and when
that is boyled they take it quickly
from the fire, or remove it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would boyl over, for it rises
quickly, when it has thus had ten
or twelve boylings, they pour it into
little dishes of Porcelain, set in rank
on a Trencher of painted wood, they
bring it you boyling hot, and it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56959:17"/>
must be so drunk, but at several
times, otherwise it is not good.</p>
                     <p>This Liqour is black and bitter;
and smells a little of the burnt too,
every one drinks it by little and
little, for fear of scalding their
mouths, so that being in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehane</hi>
(for so they name the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where 'tis sold ready made) one
may receive a kind of musick and
divertisement by hearing the noise
that every one makes in sipping.
This drink is good to hinder the
fumes which rise from the stomach
into the head, and by consequence
to cure the indisposition thereof, and
for the same reason 'tis good
against sleeping. When our French
Merchants have a great many Letters
to write, and intend to labour all
night, they take in the evening a
dish or two of this <hi>Cahue,</hi> it is
good also to comfort the stomach
and help disgestion; in a word if you
will beleive the Turks 'tis good against
all indispositions whatever, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
it has at the least as much
virtue in it, as is appropriated to
<hi>Tea.</hi> For the taste, in drinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56959:17"/>
once or twice, one may easily
accustom ones self to it, and it will
no longer seem unpleasant; there
be some that mix therewith Cloves
and a few grains of Cardamome,
called in Latin <hi>Cardamomum minus,</hi>
which they name <hi>Cacoule;</hi> others put
thereto Sugar, but this mixture which
makes it more pleasant renders it
less wholesom and profitable: they
drink a vast quantity thereof in the
Turkish Country; there is neither
rich nor poor that drinks less than
two or three cups a day, and 'tis one of
the things wherewith the husband
is obliged to furnish his Wife. There
be many publick Taverns of <hi>Cahue</hi>
where they boyl it in great Kettles; in
these places all sort of people may
come, without distinction of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or quality, and 'tis no shame
to frequent these places, since many
go only to recreate themselves; there
be also without the house, Walls with
Mats on them, where those that will
may sit and see all that pass by,
and take the air, and there are some
that play on the Violin, Flute and
other Musick, who are hired by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56959:18"/>
Master of the <hi>Cavehane</hi> to play and sing
the best part of the day, to bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

gives of the Voyage of the Bishop of
<hi>Beryte</hi> to <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> reckoning up
the incommodities they underwent,
in the march of the Caravan through
the Desert, sets down, as one of the most
insupportable, the want of water,
which they were put to much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find, and oftentimes they were
forc'd to use corrupted water. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he sayes,</p>
                     <p>As the water which they meet with
is commonly naught, putryfied, to
correct the indisposition which it
causes in the stomach, the Turks take
a drink, called <hi>Coffee,</hi> which begins
to be used by the <hi>Europeans.</hi> This
drink is made of a little Bean which
grows in <hi>Arabia</hi> near <hi>Mecca</hi> in such
abundance, that it is transported into
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56959:18"/>
all <hi>Asia,</hi> and almost all the places
where there be <hi>Mahometans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> who make
use of this drink instead of Wine,
whereas it sufficiently imitates the
effects, having the property to fortifie
the stomach, and to make easie the
digestion, and to purifie the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of the Head. They roast this
Bean in a pan afterward they pound
it in a Mortas, after having separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the bran by a fine Sieve, they
boyl this black and burnt powder in
water a little while, then they drink
it as hot as they can, though this Liqour
has not an agreable taste, but rather
bitter, yet it is much esteem'd of by
these people for the good effects they
find therein; which manifests the
care God has to furnish all Countryes
with the necessary things for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of men, and there is no
doubt but that there be other plants
in other Countries which have the
like virtues.</p>

TEA.</head>
                  <p>AS I never yet met with any
particular Discourse of <hi>Tea,</hi>
I am not able to afford to
the Curious any other than
these following remarks, which though
they are very concise, yet are large
enough to discover the miraculous
qualities, which the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has imparted to this leaf, in
the cure of several indispositions,
which become but too often the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our griefs.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>the Embassy of the Vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
to the Emperour of</hi> China, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Leyden</hi> in the year 1655. in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56959:21"/>
the Description which he makes of
the Empire, Speaks thus of <hi>Tea;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The most excellent leaves of <hi>Cha</hi>
or <hi>Tea,</hi> are found in the Provinces of
<hi>Kiangnon,</hi> and specially near the City
<hi>Hoeicheu;</hi> this leaf is little, and the
Tree thereof is very like the shrub
call'd by <hi>Pliny, Rhus Coriarius,</hi> or <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
Sumack:</hi> I do almost beleive
that this is a kind of the same, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is not a wild shrub, but a
garden Plant; and further 'tis no
tree but a shrub, which spreads it
self into divers little branches and
pleasant boughs: Its flowers come
very near to that of Sumack, only
this of <hi>Cha</hi> inclines more to a yellow,
it puts forth its first flower in
Summer, which does not give much
scent, and its green berry becomes
blackish, its branches are cover'd
with white and yellow flowers
jagg'd and pick'd from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                  <p>To make this drink of <hi>Cha</hi> so much
esteem'd by the Indians, they only
look for the first leaf which comes
forth in Spring, which also is the
most soft and delicate, they gather it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56959:21"/>
with great care the one after to'ther,
and separately, afterwards they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
heat it a little while, and softly,
on a gentle fire, and wrap it in a
very fine, thin, and smooth piece of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico,</hi>
often stirring and rubbing it with
the hands, then they set it on the fire
again, being also wrapt up, and
turn'd, and rub it the second time till
it curls up together and becomes quite
dry, after which they pour it into tin
boxes, sealing and stopping it very
close, for fear the Spirits and the
too subtil quallity, should evaporate,
for after you have kept it a long
while, if you put it into boyling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it will retake its former verdure
extending and spreading forth it
self; if it be good it leaves behind
it in the Water a smell and taste
very agreeable to the palate, and
withal a greenish colour. The
<hi>Chinese</hi> praise it wonderfully, and
set a great value on the vertues
and qualities of this drink, for they
use it Night and day, and present
it as a great rarity to those they
would regal. Now there be so many
several sorts, and 'tis so different
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56959:22"/>
both of price and goodness, that
there is some, a pound whereof is
worth an hundred Franks and more,
another sort you may have for ten
or a dozen Crowns, others for two,
nay some so cheap, that will cost but
two farthings a pound. It has at the
least this good quality to hinder the
Gout, and the Gravel in the kidneys, if
you drink of it after meals it takes
away all indigestions and crudities
of the Stomach, above all it helps and
facilitates digestion, more especially
it disintoxicates those that are fuddl'd,
giving them new forces, and enabling
them to go to it again; because it
eases the burden of those inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which this brutal excess
brings along with it, by reason that
it dries and cleanses all the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
and peccant humours, and that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> disperses the vapours which cause
sleep and overcome a man when he
desires to be waking.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chineses</hi> have given it divers
names, according to the diversity of
the places where it grew, and from
its innate virtues, as that of <hi>Hoeicheu</hi>
is the best, so they have named it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56959:22"/>
SLUNGOCHA, and sell it some
times for 150 Franks the pound. It
has a blackish seed, which falling to
the ground takes root, and at the end
of three years produces pritty little
shrubs about the height of our goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry
bushes or Rose-trees, whereof they
gather every year a very considerable
crop, the snow and the hail not being
able though never so rigorous to do
them any hurt, so that I am perswaded
one might easily improve this plant in
the Soil of <hi>Europe,</hi> if its grain were
sowed in some shady and fertill place.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iapeneses</hi> prepare this drink
quite after an other sort than the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi>
do, for of its leaves they make a
powder which they drink with hot
water, but the <hi>Chineses</hi> drink the boyling
water in the which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se leaves have

contributed all their goodness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsieur de Bourges,</hi> in the Relation
(which I have allready instanced,)
of the Voyage of the Bishop of <hi>Beryte</hi>
to <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> speaks thus.</p>
                  <p>During our abode at <hi>Siam,</hi> after our
dinner, which was usually of fish, we
drank some <hi>Tea,</hi> which they take
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56959:23"/>
very hot with a little sugar, we found
it very wholsom; and comparing the
effects of this <hi>Tea</hi> with those of wine,
especially as they use it in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where the Stomach is weakned
by the extream heat, and its force
is oppressed by the quality of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
it is doubtfull which of
these two may obtain the pre-eminence,
if not this leaf; the use whereof is
grown so common in those Countries,
it having many excellent properties,
the chief of which is to make one
that is drunk become sober. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
'tis very different from all other
liqours whereof men make use,
which being drunk with excess, either
weaken or quite deprive them of
their understanding, whereas <hi>Tea</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies,
and frees them from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
which hinder its effects.</p>
                  <p>In the several Voyages of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter is wholly taken up,
in treating of <hi>Tea,</hi> and reflecting
on the advantages of the People of
<hi>China.</hi> He says, One of the things
which in my opinion do very much
contribute to the great health of this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56959:23"/>
people, which oftentimes appears to
the very last, in their old age, is <hi>Tea,</hi>
whose use is exceeding common
through all the East, and begins to
be known in some Countrys of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
by the means of the Hollanders,
who bring it from <hi>China,</hi> and sell it
at <hi>Paris</hi> for thirty Franks the pound
which they buy in this Country for
eight pence or ten pence, and yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that it is commonly very old
and naughty. 'Tis thus that the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> suffer strangers to
enrich themselves in the <hi>East-India</hi>
trade, whence they might draw all
the best commodities of the world, if
they had but the courage to undertake
it as well as their neighbours, who
have less means to prosper therein then
our own Country-men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tea</hi> is a leaf, as big, as that of
our Pomegranate tree, it grows on lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
shrubs very much resembling the
Myrtle Tree, it is not to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in any Country of the World,
but only in two Provinces of <hi>China</hi>
where it grows, one whereof is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Nanquin,</hi> whence comes the best
<hi>Tea,</hi> which they name <hi>Cha,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56959:24"/>
is the Province of <hi>Chincheau,</hi> in
these two Provinces, there is as
much care taken in the Crop of this
leaf as there is in our Vintages.
It grows here in so great abundance,
that they have enough thereof to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the rest of <hi>China, Iapan, Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,
Cochinchina,</hi> and several other
Kingdoms, where they so ordinarily
make use of <hi>Tea,</hi> that those who
drink it but three times a day, are
the most moderate, others take of it
ten or twelve times a day, or to say
better, every hour.</p>
                  <p>When this leaf is cropt, they
dry it well in an Oven, then they put
it into tin boxes, which must be
well shut, for if it takes wind, 'tis
spoiled, and has no more strength
then dead leven. I leave to you to
judge if the Hollanders take great
care of that they sell into <hi>France.</hi>
To know if the <hi>Tea</hi> be good, you
must see that it be very Green, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so dry as to be easily broken
with the Finger, if it is all thus, 'tis
good, otherwise assure your self it is
not worth much.</p>
                  <p>The fashion of the <hi>Chineses</hi> when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56959:24"/>
they make use of this <hi>Tea</hi> is to boyl
some Water in a little pot very clean,
when it boyls well, they take it from
the fire, and put therein, so many
leaves according to the proportion of
Water, that is to say into a good
large glass of Water, they put about
an Ounce of <hi>Tea,</hi> they Cover the pot
well, and when the leaf sinks to the
bottom of the Water, then is the
time to drink it, for 'tis then that
the <hi>Tea</hi> Communicates its vertue to
the Water, giving it a reddish dye,
they drink it as hot as they can, for
if it should cool it would be good
for nothing, the same leaf which
tarries at the Bottom of the pot will
serve a second or third time, but
then they boyl it with the water.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iapeneses</hi> take it another way,
for they first beat the <hi>Tea</hi> to powder,
then they put it into boyling water
and swallow it all together: I know
not whether this way of taking it
be more wholsom then the former.
I have made use of, and always found
that way of the <hi>Chineses</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good: both of them mingle
a little sugar therewith to correct
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56959:25"/>
the bitterness of the <hi>Tea,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
methinks is not so very
unpleasant.</p>
                  <p>There be three principal vertues in
<hi>Tea;</hi> the first of which is to cure and
to hinder the pains of the head; for
my part, when I had the <hi>Megrime,</hi> in
taking of this <hi>Tea,</hi> I found my self so
very much eased and comforted that
it drew out all the pain of my head:
for the principal force of <hi>Tea</hi> is to
abate and expell those gross vapours
which ascending from the Stomach
into the head do very much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
us. If you take it after supper,
it commonly hinders sleep, yet there
be some who by drinking of <hi>Tea</hi> sleeps
the better, because allaying none
but the most foggy vapours, it leaves
behind it those that do cheifly cause
sleep. For my part I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
it often enough, when I
have been compelled to sit up all
night about some extraordinary busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I needed to do no more but
to take some of this <hi>Tea</hi> when I
perceived my self beginning to sleep,
and I could easily watch all night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
winking, and the next morning
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56959:25"/>
I was as fresh as if I had slept my
ordinary time; this I could do once
a week without any trouble. I tried
one time to continue waking six
nights together. But the last night
I found my self quite spent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tea</hi> is not only good for the head,
but it has a marvellous force in easing
the Stomach, and helping digestion,
they drink it also ordinarily after
dinner; after supper not at all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
those that would sleep. The
third thing for which <hi>Tea</hi> is good, is
to purge the reins of the Gout and
Gravell, and 'tis perhaps the true
reason why these diseases are unknown
in those Countries.</p>
                  <p>I have the more enlarged my self
on this discourse of <hi>Tea,</hi> for since my
abode in <hi>France</hi> I have had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to see some persons of great
quality and of an illustrious merit,
(and upon whose lifes and healths
the safety of <hi>France</hi> does almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,)
who make use thereof with
good success, and who have had the
goodness to command me to teach
them the nature and quality of this
Drug, the knowledge whereof I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56959:26"/>
have gained by a thirty years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicholas Tulpius</hi> Physitian of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi>
in his Book of medicinal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
speaks thus. There is
nothing more ordinary in the <hi>East
Indies</hi> than the drink, which is made of
the decoction of a certain Plant, called
by the <hi>Chineses, Tea,</hi> by the <hi>Iapaneses,
Tchia,</hi> whereof I shall make no difficulty
to communicate to Posterity, all the
knowledge that has been imparted to
me by those who hold the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
authority in these Countries. As
therefore the abovesaid Plant has
leaves long picked, and jagged round
about, so on the other side its root
is full of strings, and divided into
two little partitions, and does not
grow only in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> but
also in <hi>Chiam</hi> or <hi>Siam:</hi> moreover
there is this difference, the leaves
of <hi>China</hi> are of a dark green some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inclining to a black, but those
of <hi>Iapan,</hi> are of a more pale and
whitish green, and of a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
taste, which is the very reason
why the <hi>Tchia</hi> of <hi>Iapan</hi> is much more
esteemed than the <hi>Tea</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> so
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56959:26"/>
that it often happens, that one only
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound of <hi>Tchia</hi> is sold for 100.
<hi>French</hi> Livres. And indeed 'tis the
common vogue and opinion of this
Country, that there is nothing more
Soveraign then this plant, as well
for the prolonging of our days even
to an extream old age, as for dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
all that may be an hindrance
or obstacle to our health, and that it
not only renders the body more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and preserves it from the
pains of the Stone (to which there
be none in these Countrys that are
found subject) but which is more, it
cures all pains of the head, Rheums,
and soreness of the eyes, of the breast,
shortness of breath, weakness of the
Stomach, Griping of the Guts,
weariness, and it so evidently hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
sleep, that those persons who
drink of the said decoction pass some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
whole nights without sleeping,
and overcome without any trouble,
or tediousness the necessity of sleep,
which otherwise were insupportable:
for it heats moderately, and contracts
the upper orifice of the Stomach, it
retains and suppresses so well the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56959:27"/>
necessary in the creating sleep
which rise from below, that those
who have a desire to spend th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
whole night in writing, or studying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
do thereby find no manner of trouble
or distrubance.</p>
                  <p>Noreover it is very likely that thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
plant has not been long known to
the <hi>Chineses</hi> themselves, and that it
has been in use amongst them but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

small time, since they cannot find
in their language any ancient word
whereby to explain it, and have not
any hieroglyphick characters (such as
are almost all the Letters of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses</hi>)
by the means whereof they
might express its nature.</p>
                  <p>As to the manner of using this Plant,
we must take notice that these nations
are very different one from t'other in
that matter. For the <hi>Iapaneses</hi> beat
the same Plant to powder, pounding
it upon a marble stone, and afterwards
mingling it well with hot water:
but the <hi>Chineses</hi> only boyl it in some
liquor, adding thereto a few grains
either of Salt, or Sugar, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
as yet hot, they present after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
very courteously, as well to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56959:27"/>
those that being invited to dinner
they treat at home, as to them that
come to render them a visit: This
drink they make with so great care
and so nice an application of their
mind thereto; even persons of the
highest quality are not ashamed, but
on the contrary they take great pride
to make with their own hands the
decoction of this herb for their friends,
or at the least assist in the mingling
thereof, and preparing it as it ought
to be, having expresly for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the middle of their Palaces
Rooms set apart, wherein there are
little Ovens made of the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones, and of most exquisite
wood, reserved particularly for the
aforesaid preparation, keeping, also
curiously in these Rooms the pots,
trivets, funells, bowls, porringers,
and other vessells belonging to this
sort of kitchin, perfectly well wrought,
and on which they freely bestow
some thousands of Crowns, keeping
them handsomly wrapt up and folded
in peices of silk, and not shewing
them to any but their most intimate
friends. They do also make as great
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56959:28"/>
account thereof as we do of our
Diamonds, pretious Stones, Neckla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of pearls of the highest Price.
As one may see more especially in

of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary

                  <p>A Curious
TREATISE
OF THE
NATURE and QUALITY
OF
CHOCOLATE. Divided into Four Parts. In the First whereof is declared, what
CHOCOLATE is; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of the quality of CACAO,
and all the other Ingredients. In the Second is shewn the quality that
results from that Composition. In the Third is taught how to make it,
and how many waies the West Indians use it,
and which of them is the most wholesome. The last part treats of the quantity
thereof, and how it must be taken, and in
what time, and by what persons. <hi>By</hi> Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma, <hi>a

                  <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
                  <p>SO great is the number of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who at present do drink of
<hi>Chocolate,</hi> that not only in the <hi>West
Indies,</hi> whence this Drink has its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also in <hi>Spain,
Italy, Flanders, &amp;c.</hi> it is very much
used, and especially in the Court of
the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> where the great
Ladies drink it in a morning before
they rise out of their beds, and lately
much used in <hi>England,</hi> as Diet and
Phisick with the Gentry. Yet there
are several persons that stand in doubt
both of the hurt and of the benefit,
which proceeds from the use thereof;
some saying, that it obstructs and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
opilations, others and those the
most part, that it fattens, several as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us that it fortifies the Stomach:
Some again that it heats and inflames
the body: But very many stedfastly
affirm, that tho they shou'd drink it at
all hours, and that even in the Dog-days,
they find themselves very well
<pb facs="tcp:56959:30"/>
after it: And therefore it does not
seem needless to me to have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this labour, for the profit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the publick, endeavouring to
accommodate this Drink to every
Mans liking, according to the variety
of things, which may be mixt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
to the end, that every one may
choose that which he shall find most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
towards the cure of his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
I have not seen any thing of
the like nature in Print afore, unless
that which a Physician of <hi>Merchend</hi>
(a Town in <hi>Andaluzia</hi>) speaks thereof,
who judges the <hi>Chocolate</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,
because the <hi>Cacao</hi> is cold
and dry, and because this reason may
not sufficiently avail with some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(that are troubled with obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
to make them forbear the use
thereof, I think it fit to defend this
mixture and composition by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Reasons against all those that
would condemn so good and wholesom
a Liquor.</p>

CHOCOLATE.</head>

                  <head>The First Part.</head>
                  <p>IN this first Division I affirm that
<hi>Chocolate</hi> is a word of the Indians
which vulgarly signifies no more
than a cerain confection, in the
which besides the other simples and
ingredients the <hi>Cacao</hi> Nut comes in
as the princpal basis and foundation;
the Nature whereof first of all we
must necessarily mention. <hi>Chocolate</hi>
therefore, or <hi>Chocolatl,</hi> is an Indian
word by which (as I said before)
is meant a certain paste or mixture
composed of very many drugs, of
which they take a certain portion
to dissolve it in ordinary Water,
or any other Liquor that may serve
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56959:31"/>
instead of drink. This Drink is not
common to all the Indians, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to those that inhabit the Northern
<hi>America;</hi> and namely to those that
dwell in New <hi>Spain,</hi> where grows
the <hi>Cacao</hi> in great abundance, which
is the chiefest thing in this composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is particularly used in <hi>Mexico,</hi>
whence it is transported into <hi>Europe,</hi>
to those places which hold great
Commerce and correspondence with
the <hi>Mexicans.</hi> I hold therefore, with
the common opinion of all the world,
that the <hi>Cacao</hi> is cold and dry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the excess of its quality.
Our Authour not speaking any
thing concerning the Tree which
bears the <hi>Cacao,</hi> we are obliged to
supply his over-sight, by giving you
a description thereof extracted from
the works of <hi>Francis Ximenes,</hi> in
in his book intituled <hi>Of the Nature
of the Plants and Animals of</hi> New-Spain,
a Work very curious and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
scarce, which was printed not
long since at <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Tree of
the <hi>Cacao</hi> call'd <hi>Cucahuaguabuith</hi>
(says he) is of the same bigness, and
has the same leaves tho something
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56959:31"/>
larger, with the Orange Tree. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera</hi>
compares them to those of the
Chesnut Tree, or for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it, like our plumb trees; its
fruit is long, and like a, Melon or
Pumpion, but it is streakt, chanelled,
and ruddy, the which is named <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahuaeinsh</hi>
full of small Nuts call'd
<hi>Cacao,</hi> somthing less than an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
but better cimented, and of
a good taste, its Nuts are divided into
two equal parts, well compacted and
close together. It is of a fine nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment,
being of a middling taste
between sweet and bitter, its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
something cold and moist,
There be four sorts of this Tree, the
first is called <hi>Cacahuaguahuitl,</hi> which
is the biggest of all, and bears a
great quantity of fruit. The second is
called by the same name, but of a
middle size, the leaves and fruit
whereof is a great deal less. The
third is named <hi>Xuchicacahuaguahuith,</hi>
less than t'other, of which the fruit
is redder on the outside, within 'tis
altogether like the others. The
fourth sort is the least of all, so it is
term'd <hi>Tlalcacahuaguahuitl,</hi> that is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56959:32"/>
to say, a little low Tree of <hi>Cacao,</hi>
the which bears a fruit less than all
the rest, although there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them as to the colour:
Now all these fruits are of the same
quality, and of the same use, although
they make use of the last principally
in drink, the others serve rather for
money and change. Moreover they
were wont to Plant near the Tree
which bears the <hi>Cacoa</hi> another Tree
which they call <hi>Atlynam,</hi> to the
end that it may shade it and defend
it from the heat and rays of the Sun,
besides which it is not good for any
other use. He that will may see
what is further spoken thereof in the
Chronicles of <hi>America</hi> Printed at
<hi>Francfort</hi> 1602. In <hi>Ioseph Acosta</hi> in
his general History of the <hi>Indies:</hi> In
<hi>Iean Eusebe de Nuremberg;</hi> and in
<hi>Clusius</hi> of strange things. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to know for the intelligence
of this thing, that although it may
be true that every Medicine, as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as 'tis, possesses and keeps in it
self the four qualities of the elements.
Nevertheless from the acting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting,
which they have one upon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56959:32"/>
another, there proceeds and results
another quality distinct and different
from these four former called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
or Temperement.</p>
                  <p>This quality or Complexion which
results from this mixture is not always
the same, neither is it of the same
sort in all the mixt bodies: but it
has nine kinds and differences, to wit,
four simples, which have one only
Superiour quality; four compound
which have two predominant quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but however which agree very
well together, and for that reason
are called symbolizant, and a ninth
which the Philosophers call <hi>ad pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
as if one should say a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
exactly equal, when as all the
aforesaid qualities are evenly poised,
that is equal in weight and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
The complexion and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
of the <hi>Cacao</hi> is compounded
of all these, for it has two qualities
to wit, cold, and dry, which are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
and predominant, the which
render the body wherein they are
found adstringent, opilative, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
obstructions, from the terrestrial
quality thereof, but furthermore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56959:33"/>
the <hi>Cacao</hi> being a mixt Body, compos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the four Elements, it ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to have some parts corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond,
and proportionable to all the
elements; and it has some particular
parts, and those not a few, which
correspondant with the element of the
air, which are the heat and moistness,
which qualities are found joyned with
the buttery parts, so that they draw
from the <hi>Cacao</hi> a great quantity of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which they use in making their
faces shine, which I have seen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd
in the <hi>Indies</hi> by the Spanish Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
born there, who are call'd by the
Spaniards <hi>Croillas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against which one may make this
Philosophical Objection: two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and disagreeing qualities,
cannot be found in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in the same Body; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the <hi>Cacao</hi> is cold and dry
in the highest degree, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore the <hi>Cacao</hi> cannot be hot
and dry in the same degree, which are
contrary to cold and moisture. The
first proposition is most certain, and
received in good Philosophy. The
second is also agreed to by all the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56959:33"/>
World, therefore the conclusion is
most true and certain.</p>
                  <p>One cannot deny but this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
strong argument, and 'tis likely that
these reasons being considered by that
same Physitian of <hi>Merchena,</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to affirm, that <hi>Chocolate</hi> was
obstructive, for he thought it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all Philosophy, to say that the
<hi>Cacao</hi> is hot and moist in the highest
degree, which is certainly believed to
be cold and dry. But to this I answer
two things, the one is the small expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and knowledge this Physician
had thereof, having never seen them
extract the great quantity of Butter
from thence; and that, when they
prepare the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing to the powder of the
<hi>Cacao,</hi> but beating and pounding
it sufficiently, it becomes a part firm
and well compacted, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sign that it has within an oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and viscuous matter, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
corresponds with the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the air: The other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we shall draw from the very
fountain of Philosophy, wherein I
shall demonstrate, that in the <hi>Cacao</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56959:34"/>
are included different Substances, in
some of which, to wit, in those that
are not so thick and gross, there is a
greater quantity of oyly and buttery
than of earthy parts, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense
and heavy parts there is a more
earthy than oyly substance; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
heat and moisture are predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
the latter are accounted cold
and dry.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is hard to believe, that one
and the same substance, and that so
small as the <hi>Cacao</hi> is, can contain two
different qualities. Yet that this may
appear more easie, clear, and evident,
we see it more especially in <hi>Rhubarb,</hi>
the which has some hot and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
parts; others cold, dry, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent,
which have the power to
fortifie, shorten, and to stop the flux
of the belly. Whosoever also shall see
and consider the nature of Steel, which
is of an earthy quality, heavy, thick,
cold, and dry, will (methinks) hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be induced to believe that it is good
against obstructions, but rather more
fit to increase them, and yet for all
that the best Physitians do prescribe it
as the chiefest remedy against them.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56959:34"/>
This difficulty is resolved; for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that Steel has several gross and
earthy parts, there be some Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Mercurial; whereby it is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and takes away Obstructions.
Tis true, that this does not appear,
but by means of the way and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereof, which is that in poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
grinding, and beating it into a
very fine powder, its Sulphureous and
Mercurial parts, as being active sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til,
and incisive, mingle themselves so
perfectly and exactly with the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
and astringent, that being thus
mingled the one with the other, one
cannot affirm that the Steel is astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
but rather that it is incisive, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates,
and removes obstructions.</p>
                  <p>We will prove this opinion by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Doctrines, and first that of <hi>Galen,</hi>
who in the Third Book <hi>Of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of simple Drugs,</hi> in the 14. chapter,
at the beginning thereof; saith, That
all Drugs, that are simple to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, are altogether mixt,
and by this means have contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
that is to expel, and to retain;
to thicken, and subtillize; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense,
and rarifie; of which there is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56959:35"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56959:35"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56959:36"/>
no wonder, since that the same Drugs
hath the power to heat, and make cold,
to moisten or dry, and that in every
Drug or Medicament there are found
parts subtil and gross, thick and thin,
soft and hard, and in the following
Chapter of the same Book; he asserts
the example of an old Cock, the broth
whereof loosened the belly, but its
flesh was binding; and also of Aloes,
the which being washed, immediately
loses its purgative vertue, or that
which remains thereof is very feeble.
Then that this difference of the vertues
and qualities is found in different parts
or substances of Medicaments, <hi>Galen</hi>
shews in his 1. Book <hi>Of the Power of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,</hi>
c. 17. Where he particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instances of Milk, wherein is found,
and from which is separated three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
substances, to wit, the Cheese,
which hinders and stops the flux of
the Belly, the serosity or Cream which
is purgative, and the Butter which
nourishes, as he himself has explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in the Third Book <hi>Of Aliments,</hi>
and in the fifteenth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>This is manifestly experimented in
the Must or new Wine, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56959:36"/>
has three different Substances,
the Terrestrial, which are the Lees;
the Subtlety, which is the Flower or
the Scum thereof; and a third which
is properly the Wine; and each of
these Substances has its different fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and vertues, in colour, taste,
and in other Accidents. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in
his fourth Book of Meteors, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
treating of Putrefaction or Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
acknowledgeth these different
Substances; as the more curious, if
they will take the pains, may see at
large in the following Chapter of the
same Author, and so according to the
opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Substances are assigned to each
mixt part, under the same form, and
quantity, which is very agreeable to
reason, if we consider that of each
Aliment, how simple soever it be,
there is produced, and ingendered in
the Liver four humours, not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in temperament, but also in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and there is ingender'd more
or less of such a humour, according as
such an aliment has more or less parts
conformable to the substance of the
humour, which will be produced in a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56959:37"/>
greater quantity: And so to cold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
we order hot food, and to hot
we prescribe cool.</p>
                  <p>From these so evident examples,
and from divers others, one may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that when the <hi>Cacao</hi> is pounded
and beaten, the substances which it
has naturally different, in it divers
parts are so artificially, and exactly
mingled and joyned, the one with the
other, the fat and buttery, hot and
moist, with the terrestrial, cold, and
dry, (as is aforesaid of the Steel) that
these last are quelled and corrected, so
that they are no longer so astringent as
before, but with a mediocrity or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
more inclining to a hot and
moist temperament of the Air, then
to the cold and dry of the Earth, as is
manifest, when we reduce this <hi>Cacao</hi>
to a Drink: [<hi>Maradon</hi> in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
sayes it is made like a Spindle
wherewith they spin the thred in
<hi>Spain</hi>] for scarce can one give two
turns with the Mill, which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Wood they imploy for
that purpose, but you may see a thick
scum, which is a clear proof, that
there are a great many buttery parts
in the <hi>Cacao.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56959:37"/>
By this abovesaid we manifest, that
those Physicians are very much deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
touching the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that it causes Obstructions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Cacao</hi> is astringent, as if the
costiveness where not enough correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the exact mixture of the parts,
one with the other; besides, as has been
said, the grinding, and there being
with the <hi>Cacao,</hi> so many other ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
hot of their own Nature, it
must necessarily happen, that they
work their effects, which is to cut and
attenuate, and not at all to stop or
obstruct, and certainly there is no need
of other examples or doctrines, as a
proof to confirm this truth, then that
which we see in the very <hi>Cacao;</hi> the
which if it be not pounded, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
as we have shewn in the making
of the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> [as also the eating
thereof, as it is in the fruit, by the
Spanish women born in the <hi>Indies</hi>] cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
stoppages and notable obstructions
by no other reason, but that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
substances and parts are not so
exactly and perfectly mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the chewing alone, as they are
by the artificial grinding which they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56959:38"/>
use therein: Furthermore our adverse
part ought to consider, and call to
mind the first Rudiments and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Philosophy, which say, that
from a particular proposition, <hi>&amp; a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto
secundum quid,</hi> we must not draw
from thence a general <hi>&amp; ad dictum sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter,</hi>
so that it serves for nothing, to
say this man has white teeth, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
this man is white; for it may
happen, that a man that has white
teeth may be black; in like manner 'tis
a foolish thing to say the <hi>Cacao</hi> is astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
that by consequence therefore
the confection which is made thereof
and of other ingredients is astringent.</p>
                  <p>The Tree which bears this fruit is
so delicate, and the ground where it
grows so excessively hot, that for fear
the Sun should burn and dry it up,
they plant there the Plantane or <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
tree to be a shade, and defence
to them, to secure them from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
beams of the too near Sun, and
when these are great, and grown up they
plant under them the <hi>Cacao</hi> Tree, (those
Trees the Indian call <hi>Athlynam,</hi> vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
the Mothers of the <hi>Cacao</hi>) to the
end, that when the young and tender
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56959:38"/>
Tree shall spring up out of the earth,
the others may serve as a Canopy to
them. Its fruit also is not naked, or
uncovered, but ten or twelve <hi>Cacao</hi>
Nuts are as it were wedged, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in the same shell, just like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
gourd, as big as an early fig, and
sometimes bigger, of the same colour
and form with the said fig. There be
two sorts of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> the one is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
of a Brown colour inclining to
a reddish, and the other bigger and
larger, called <hi>Patlaxte,</hi> the which is
great and very drying, and which by
that means keeps persons awake, and
hinders sleeping, and therefore thats
the reason, that this is not so proper
as the ordinary <hi>Cacao,</hi> and this is all
that can be said, touching this Fruit.</p>
                  <p>As for the other ingredients which
go to the making of your Confection
of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> I find many different sorts,
some put therein black Pepper or <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vases,</hi>
the which as being very hot and
dry does not agree but with those
whose Liver is very cold. An emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Doctor of Physick of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Mexico</hi> is of the same opinion,
who, as likewise a certain Religious
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56959:39"/>
man, worthy to be credited has assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, that it seeming to him, that
black pepper was not very proper in

they do not heat too much, and do
not hinder the adding Annis-seed, as

in his Receit: It being certain

cold distempers, and allays the

force and power of that little inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Seed:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Achiote</hi> is a certain dye or
tincture drawn from a fruit-Tree
which some call <hi>Achiotl</hi> others <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarica,</hi>
and others <hi>Pamaqua,</hi> take it
as it is described by <hi>Francis Ximenes</hi>
in the fifth book at the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is says he a Tree, in greatness,
body, and shape very like the <hi>Orange</hi>
Tree, its Leaves are like those of the
<hi>Elm</hi> in Colour and roughness, its
Bark, Body, and Branches are reddish
drawing to a Green, its flowers are
large, distinguished or divided into
five Leaves in the shape of a Star,
of a whitish Purple Colour, its fruit
is like the outward Shell of a <hi>Chesnut,</hi>
of the form and bigness of a little
green <hi>Almond, Quadrangular</hi> or four
Square, which being ripe opens it self
containing certain grains or Stone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

like those of the <hi>Raisins,</hi> but much
more round. The Savages and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Country have it in great
Esteem; and Plant it near their houses,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56959:41"/>
'tis green all the year round, and bears
its Fruit in Spring time, at which time
they have a custome to lop it, for
out of its wood they Strike Fire as
with a Flint-stone, its bark is very
proper to make Ropes, which shall be
stronger than that which is made of
Hemp it self, of its seed they make
a Crimson red tincture, which the
Painters imploy in their Colours, they
make use of it also in Physick, for
being of a cold quality, and being
drunk with some Water of the same
Nature, or applyed to the outward
parts, allays the ardour and burning
of the Feaver, hinders the Dysenterie
or griping of the Guts, lastly they mix
it with great profit and success in all
the cooling potions, whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that they mix it with the drink
of <hi>Chocolate</hi> to cool, and to give it a
taste and fine colour, <hi>sed haec obiter.</hi>
Now this <hi>Achiote</hi> in the quantity of
a Nut is not sufficient to Colour so
great a quantity of ingredients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the receit, that must be left
to the Judgement of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
this confection, who shall use as
much as he shall think sufficient to give
it a good Colour.</p>

It is no small good to add thereto
<hi>Almonds,</hi> (Here our Author speaking
of <hi>Almonds,</hi> means those of the <hi>Indies</hi>
and not our <hi>European</hi> ones, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of which we will give you
as <hi>Ioseph Acosta</hi> has it in his Natural
History, Book 39. <hi>Chap. 26. Of Indian
Almonds.</hi> There is another kind of
<hi>Cacao's</hi> which have in their Shell a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

these <hi>Almonds</hi> are three times as big
as those of <hi>Castile,</hi> and resemble them
in taste, altho they are a little more
rough, and are also humide, moist, and
oyly; 'tis a reasonable good food, they
do also use it in Sweet meats for want
of <hi>Almonds</hi> to make <hi>March-panes,</hi> and
other such like things, they call them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Almonds</hi> of the <hi>Andes,</hi> because these
<hi>Cacao's</hi> grow abundant on the high
Mountains call'd the <hi>Andes</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi>
and they are so hard and strong, that
to open them they are wont to strike
them with a huge Stone with all their
force; when they fall from the Tree
if they meet with the head of any
one they will hinder his journey from
going further. And it seems to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56959:42"/>
a thing incredible, that in the crevises
or hollow of these <hi>Cacao's,</hi> which are
not bigger, or but little more than
the others there should be such a vast
number and quantity of those <hi>Almonds;</hi>
but concerning these <hi>Almonds,</hi> both
these and all the other Fruits in like
manner, must give place to the <hi>Almonds
de Chachapoyas,</hi> the which I know not
how otherwise to name: This Fruit is
the most wholsome delicate and dainty
of all that I ever saw in the <hi>Indies:</hi>
Even a Learned Physitian assured me
that amongst all the fruits which are
found either in the <hi>Indies</hi> or in <hi>Spain</hi>
none came near the excellence of these
<hi>Almonds.</hi> There be some of these that
be bigger, others less then those of
the <hi>Andes,</hi> yet all of them are bigger
than them of <hi>Castil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e.</hi> They are very
tender, have very much substance
and juyce, very oyly, and very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the taste; they grow upon
high tall Trees, very thick of leaves,
and as it is a precious thing, Nature
has bestowed on it a coverture and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
almost impregnable, it has a
Skin or Shell something bigger and
more pointed then that of a <hi>Chesnut,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56959:43"/>
nevertheless, when this is dry they get
the Kernel out very easily. They
report that the Apes which are very
greedy and desirous of this fruit, of
which Creature the Country of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chapoyas</hi>
in <hi>Peru</hi> does greatly abound,
(which is the only Country I know
of, that has this sort of Tree) who
to break the Shell and to get the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
from thence, they strongly throw
it from the tops of the boughs upon
the stones, and so having broken it,
they make an end of eating it at their
pleasure. The <hi>Filbeards</hi> also are far
better than the <hi>Maiz</hi> or <hi>Panis</hi> which
some are wont to put therein to give
a better body, and strength to the
Composition, and therefore I would
use them in all sorts of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> for
besides all the commodities, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which I have here before
counted, they are moderately hot and
have a delicate juice, especially the
dry ones, the green and the new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in no wise proper, but rather

has expressed in these Verses

Then the <hi>Filberts</hi> are not unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Christopher Acosta</hi> in his book <hi>Of
Spices</hi> Chap. 18. describes the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Filberts</hi> after this manner: The
Tree is a very great Tree, strait,
smooth, round, and of a spungy
matter or substance, its leaves are
longer and larger then that of the
Palm Tree which bears the <hi>Cacao's,</hi> and
which bud out of the very top of
the Tree, amongst which there spring
out little smooth branches, full of
small white flowers, and almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any smell, whence proceeds the
fruit called <hi>Areca,</hi> as big as <hi>Wallnuts,</hi>
yet not altogether round, but Oval
in the form or shape of a little Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
egg, the outward Skin is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
green before it becomes ripe,
being ripe it becomes very yellow, like
Dates that are fully ripe; this Skin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
Shell is of a soft and Shaggy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which contains a Kernel as big
as a large <hi>Chesnut,</hi> white, hard, and
full of little red Veins, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56959:44"/>
eat; being yet green they put
it under the Sand, to render it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more agreeable to the taste,
sometimes they eat it mixt with the
leaves of <hi>Bethel,</hi> other times they
break it, and dry it in the Sun, and
afterwards make great use thereof in
their eating, and in their astringent
potions, with the Skin they clean
their Teeth. There is another kind
of <hi>Filbert</hi> which grows in the Isle
of St. <hi>Dominico,</hi> which is purgative,
but this is not that they mix with
the <hi>Chocolate.</hi> These <hi>Filherts</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say, are not altogether unuseful,
since that they have the same tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
or Nature with the <hi>Almonds</hi>
though being dryer, they come more
near to a Chollerick temperament, but
they have also this good, they corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
the Stomach, and Belly being
well dryed before the fire, and as it
were broyled, as they Prepare it for

the fumes of the Stomach from
rising up into the Brains as the same
Author writes.

That is to say, the <hi>Filbert</hi> engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
melancholly humours, but it

It is very certain that both the one

                  <p>This which the Indians call <hi>Maiz</hi>
we call Indian or Turky-Wheat,
which being so common amongst us
there is no need to treat thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further, yet I cannot forbear to
mention that of <hi>Francis Ximenes</hi> in
his third Book Chap. 7. who seems to
contradict our Author speaking of
it very advantagiously in these terms.
The difference of the <hi>Maiz</hi> is in the
Colour of its ears, (which the Vulgar
call <hi>Mazercas</hi>) of which there is a
greet difference, for some are of a
white Colour, others red, there be
some that are almost black, others
purple, blew, and diversified or
sprinkled with divers Colours, which
is to be understood of the upper
skin, for the flower of each is white;
as to the rest if there be any Corn
that God has made of a temperate
quality and great nourishment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt it is the <hi>Maiz</hi> (which
the <hi>Mexicans</hi> call <hi>Theolli</hi>) for it is
neither hot, nor cold, but a mean
betwixt both, as also neither moist,
nor dry, but equally participating of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56959:45"/>
both temperaments, far from being
of a gross and Viscuous nourishment,
as some have imagined: They also
are very much deceiv'd that affirm
it begets obstructions, but one may
clearly see the contrary in the <hi>Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
who live upon it and are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unacquainted with opilations,
and obstructions, and are never
troubled with a pale and sickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
but they assure us that it is
of an easie digestion, and sharpens
the Appetite: That even before the
coming of the Spaniards they never
knew what were the pain of the Stone
or Gravel in the Kidneys, in fine the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi>
have not a better and more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
remedy than this to resist the sharp
diseases, the which experience does
sufficiently testifie, for <hi>Maiz</hi> boyled in
Water does abundantly nourish the
body, and is digested without any
trouble or difficulty, it qualifies and
softens the breast, mitigates the heat
or burning of Feavers; chiefly the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of its Root, steept in Water, and
exposed to the cold of the Evening
and afterwards drunk. Then this
<hi>Maiz</hi> boyled is not only a laudable
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56959:46"/>
and wholesom food, but it may also
be given without fear as well to those
that are sick, as to those that are in
good health; to young as well as to
Old; to Men and to Women of what
condition soever they be, and lastly
it may be used in all Distempers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hurt, or trouble, they say
moreover that it provokes Urine, and
cleanses the Pipes. Then since that the
<hi>Maiz,</hi> used as it ought to be, brings
along with it a thousand Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and no dammages (unless as some
affirm it breeds too much Blood and
choler) one ought not to hearken to
those who affirm that it is hotter than
our ordinary wheat, that it is difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
digested, and that it begets Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
let us rather follow the
Mexican Physitians, who having reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the <hi>Ptisana</hi> or Barly broth, as
troublesom, to the distempered persons
have constituted in its place, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolle</hi>
of which we will speak hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I'le pass over in silence the manner
of making the bread of <hi>Maiz</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing to our purpose, and too
much a digression; the other thing is
the <hi>Panick</hi> or Indian Oatmeal, which is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56959:46"/>
a small grain like unto millet with a
knob full of Corn, though the vulgar
European <hi>Panick</hi> is not here meant,
but that which grows in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
which if the Reader has a mind to
satisfie his curiosity he shall find more
at large described by <hi>Dodonné</hi> in the
fourth part of his History <hi>Of Plants</hi>
book the 7. Chap. 26. and by <hi>Dalechart</hi>
in the <hi>great Herbalest</hi> book 4. Chap. 20.
The next ingredient is the Cinnamon,
but it seems our Author means the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon
of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and not that
of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> which was unknown
in <hi>New-Spain</hi> before the Spaniards
had discovered it. This Cinnamon
is described by <hi>Monardes</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<hi>Of Plants</hi> Chap. 25. <hi>Laet</hi> in his
tenth Book Chap. 26. says that the
Cinnamon Tree is as big as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
Tree, producing certain little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with their Flowers, which being
pounded, come near in some sort to
the <hi>East-Indian</hi> Cinnamon. <hi>Monardes</hi>
takes notice that they do rather make
use of their Fruit than of their bark,
and that being beaten to a powder
they fortifie the Stomach, disperse the
Wind, make good breath, take away
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56959:47"/>
the pains of the belly, comforts the
heart gives a good Colour to the food
being mixt therewith just like the true
Cinnamon. This Cinnamon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is hot and dry in the third degree,
it is good for the Urine and the reins,
expels cold distempers, 'tis also use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the eyes, and in effect it is
a Cordial as a certain Author says.

The <hi>Achiote</hi> [the Virtue which our

different from what <hi>Ximenes</hi> reports
thereof, for the one holds it to be

and therefore 'tis profitable and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
against all sorts of Opilations,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t two sorts
of <hi>Chiles</hi> or <hi>Chilli,</hi> the one the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
which is Ginger, and the other
Western, which is the Pepper of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
the same they call pepper of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basco,</hi>
because it grows in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in that Province of <hi>New-Spain,</hi>
from whence it takes its Name. Our
Author makes thereof four kinds,
but others make more, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is the Father <hi>Iohn Eusebius</hi> in the
15 Book of his History <hi>Chap.</hi> 80.
to which I refer the curious. <hi>Laet</hi>
in the last Chapter of his <hi>5th.</hi> Book
says, that this fruit grows on a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
or Garden Tree called <hi>Xoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xochitl,</hi>
the which is very big, whose
leaves are like those of the Orange
tree, and yield a very odoriferous
smell; its flowers are red like those
of the <hi>Pomegranate</hi> tree, the same
Smell as the Orange, very sweet
and agreeable, its fruit is round,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56959:48"/>
and hanging like Grapes, which
at first are green, a while after red,
and at last black, of a sharp and biting
taste, and of a good smell, hot and dry
in the third degree, so that it may be
used instead of Pepper, the Apothecaries
may imploy it to the same use as <hi>Carpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balsamum,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it pepper
of <hi>Tavasco.</hi> I affirm that there be thereof
four Sorts: The first are called <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotes,</hi>
the second, which are very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<hi>Chiltecpin,</hi> which two sorts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sharp and mordicant; the third are
called <hi>Tonachiles,</hi> which are moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hot, so that they eat them with bread
just as they do other fruit, although
they have a bitterish taste; and they
grow no where but in the Marshes of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> the fourth sort is called <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patlagua,</hi>
which was a kind of <hi>Chiles</hi>
or <hi>Pimientoes</hi> very large, they are not
so biting as the two former, nor so
mild as the third, and they are those
which are used in <hi>Chocolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be other ingredients that they
put into this composition, the cheif of
which they call <hi>Mecasuchil.</hi> This
Plant is described by <hi>Laet</hi> in his fifth
Book, Chap. 4. There is an Herb
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56959:48"/>
(he says) by name <hi>Mecaxuchitl</hi> creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the earth, whose leaves are
great, thick, and almost round, sweet-smelling,
and of a sharp taste, it bears
a fruit like long pepper, the which
they mix with the drink of the <hi>Cacao,</hi>
call'd <hi>Chocolate,</hi> to which it gives an
agreeable savour, it corroborates the
heart and the Stomach, attenuates the
thick and slow humours, and is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Medicine, and Antidote against
poison, its other vertues, as likewise
the figure of its fruit, are more fully
set out by <hi>Iean Eusebe,</hi> Book 14. chap.
62. Another ingredient is the <hi>Vinacax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tli,</hi>
but here I fear mine Author may
be deceived, or that there has been a
mistake in the Printing, and instead of
<hi>Vinacaxtli,</hi> he should have put <hi>Hucli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macutzli,</hi>
which is a Tree the flower
whereof is called by the <hi>Spaniards,
Flor de la Oreja,</hi> or Flower of the ear,
because of its near resemblance with
the ear: It is composed, sayes <hi>Laet
lib. 5. cap.</hi> 4. of purple Flowers within,
and green without, it is of a very sweet
and pleasant smell, the name <hi>Xuchina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutzli</hi>
in our Language signifies little
ears, which are flowers odoriferous,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56959:49"/>
aromatick and hot. The <hi>Mecasuchil</hi>
is purgative, and the <hi>Indians</hi> make
thereof a purging <hi>Syrup.</hi> Those that
live in <hi>Europe</hi> for went of <hi>Mecasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil</hi>
may put therein powder of Roses
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for those that have a
mind to loosen their belly. There be
two other ingredients of which our
Author being silent we are forc'd to
supply his defect, the one is the
flower of a certain pitchy or rosi'ny
tree, which yeilds a gum like that of
the <hi>Storax,</hi> but of a finer colour, its
flower is like that of the Orange
tree, of a good smell, which they
mix with the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> and repute
it good for the stomack; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
is the shale or cod of the
<hi>Tlixochitl,</hi> which is a creeping herb
having leaves like the Plantane, but
longer, and thick, it climbs up to
the top of the trees, and intwines it
self with them, and bears a shale
long, strait, and as it were round,
which smells of the balm of new <hi>Spain,</hi>
they mix this shale with their famous
drink of <hi>Cacao:</hi> their pith is black
full of little seeds, like that of the
poppy, they say that two of these
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56959:49"/>
steept in water provoke urine won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.
See <hi>Laet</hi> Book 5. ch. 7.</p>
                  <p>I have reported all these ingredients
to the end that those that have need
may choose those which they shall
think most useful for the Distempers
wherewith they are molested.</p>

                  <head>THE
SECOND PART.</head>
                  <p>IN this Second Part, we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that though they mix with
the <hi>Cacao,</hi> all these hot ingredients,
yet for all that the quantity of the
<hi>Cacao</hi> is greater than all the rest, so
that the others serve only to allay,
and temperate the coldness of the
<hi>Cacao,</hi> so that of two medicaments
of contrary qualities, we artificially
compose one, which is temperate,
and moderate, just so by the action
and reaction of the cold parts of the
<hi>Cacao,</hi> the <hi>Chocolate</hi> receives a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and moderate quality, very
little different from a mediocrity or
mean between both, and when we
shall venter to say that (in leaving
out of the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> both pepper
and cloves, and only putting therein
a little annis-feed, as we will shew
hereafter) it is purely temperate,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56959:51"/>
we are able to prove it both by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and reason: First by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
(supposing that which <hi>Galen</hi>
says, That every temperate Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
heats that which is cold, and
cools that which is hot, giving for
example the Oyl of Roses) with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
I say, grounded on the practice and
custom which they have amongst them,
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> for (I coming very much
heated to visit one of my Patients,
when I desired some water of them
to cool my self) they advised me to
take a Dish of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> with which
I quenched my thirst, but taking it
the next morning fasting it heated
me and fortified my Stomack. Now
let us prove this opinion by reason,
we have before demonstrated that
all the parts of the <hi>Cacao</hi> were not
cold; for we have shew'd, that the
buttery and oyly parts, which are in
great number are hot, or at least tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
Then although it be true,
that the quantity of the <hi>Cacao</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Chocolate</hi> is greater and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than all the other ingredients toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the cold parts which correspond
therewith do not amount at furthest
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56959:52"/>
but to the moyety, and so that altho
all together come to surpass it, seeing
that it remains somthing allayed, by the
grinding, or rubbing together, by the
means of the hot and buttery parts
of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> and again on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
by the other ingredients that are
hot in the second and third degree, it
must needs be reduced to a mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Just as we see in two persons,
that joyn their hands together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the hands of the one are cold, and
the others hot, those that are hot
grow cold, and the cold hot, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
both the one and the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without that excess of heat, or cold
which they had before, and at last
become temperate.</p>
                  <p>Like this does it happen to those
that wrastle, at first they have their
Forces strong and entire, but at last,
by the action and reaction of the two
adversaries striving together, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble
and weaken themselves, so that
the wrastling being ended, they remain
weakned both the one and the other.
'Tis the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in the
fourth Book <hi>Of the generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi>
Chap. 3. He says, that every A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56959:52"/>
suffers as the Patient, so that we
see, that which cuts is blunted by the
thing that is cut, that that which
heats is cooled, and that which push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or thrusteth is in some manner
thrust back and repulsed. Hence I
gather, that it is better to make use
of the <hi>Chocolate</hi> sometime after it has
been made than to take of it whilst new
and fresh, but you must let it stand at the
least a whole month together, for I
judge so long time to be necessary,
and very expedient, to the end that
the contrary qualities may weaken
and spend themselves, and be reduced
to a convenient temperament and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity;
for it might happen that in
the beginning each contrary would
impress and work its effect, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot endure to be heated and
cooled at the same time.</p>
                  <p>That is therefore the Reason that
<hi>Galen</hi> in his Twelfth Book of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
advises us to tarry a whole year,
or at least six months, before we make
use of the <hi>Philonium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> because in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
there is put the juyce of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
called <hi>Opium,</hi> which is cold in the
fourth degree, and Pepper with other
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56959:53"/>
ingredients, that are hot in the third
degree. And this doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the practice of several lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Physicians, whom I have desired
to inform me which was the best <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
they presently answered me, that
which has been kept several months,
and the fresh and newly made <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate,</hi>
did do them a great deal of
hurt, and did very much loosen and
relax their Stomach, which in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is very probable; for the fat
and buttery parts, are not altogether
corrected by the earthy parts of the
<hi>Cacao,</hi> which I will prove by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
I shall bring hereafter, that if you
should take a dish of <hi>Chocolate</hi> to drink,
that which is thick and buttery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
separates it self from the rest, and
relaxes the Stomach, (although it be
old) as if it were but just made.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to conclude this Second
Part, we must acknowledge that the
<hi>Chocolate</hi> is not so cold as the <hi>Cacao,</hi> nor
is it so hot as the other ingredients,
but from the action and reaction
thereof, there proceeds a moderate
complexion, or temper which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with, and serve as well for the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56959:53"/>
stomachs that be cold, as those that
are hot, provided it be took in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
quantity, as I will shew you
by and by, and that it has been made
a whole month, as is said before, so
that I know not any one, who having
experimented this confection (made
as it is convenient for every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual)
can speak ill thereof, or in any
wise discommend it: besides that all
the world generally using it, there is
scarce any one, that does not highly
approve of it, through all <hi>Europe,</hi> as
well as in the Indies. I know not
therefore what reason any one has to
say that <hi>Chocolate</hi> causes obstructions,
for if it should be so, and the Liver
become obstructed, it would bring a
leanness on all the Body, but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teaches us the contrary, for we
see nothing fattens more than <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
whereof I will give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hereafter, and so much for this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part. Proceed we now to the

In this third Part it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

But first I judge it not unnecessary to
give you the best receipt thereof, and

to dry before the fire all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
(except the <hi>Achiote</hi>) to the
end that they may be easily pounded
and broken, but in the broyling of
them before the fire, there must be
great heed taken, that they be often
turned and stirr'd about, for fear of
burning or becoming black; besides
which, they being too much done,
lose their vertue and receive a bitter
taste. The Cinnamon and the Pepper
of <hi>Mexico</hi> ought to be first pounded,
and the latter of them should be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
together with the Annis-seed:
The <hi>Cacao</hi> is that which is to be last
of all beaten, but by little and little,
till you think there is so much as may
be sufficient for your purpose, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
time you must give it three or
four turns in the Mortar. You must
also take care that every one is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
severally, and by it self, having
beaten all these ingredients to a fine
powder, you put them altogether in
a Vessel, where the <hi>Cacao</hi> is, and these
powders they stir and mix with a
spoon, and presently they take of this
past, which they begin again to pound in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56959:55"/>
Mortar (or rather if they have it the
forementioned Stone) under which
they make a gentle fire, taking speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
heed, that they do not make it too

it too much, for fear of scattering and
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ssipating the buttery parts. You
must also take notice, that in pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Cacao</hi> you mix the <hi>Achiote</hi>
therewith, to the end that you may
give it a better colour, and the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
may remain, and be the better
implanted therein. The Powder of
each ingredient, except that only of
the <hi>Cacao</hi> must be well sifted, and if
you peel the <hi>Cacao,</hi> and take it out of
its little shell, the drink thereof will
be more dainty and delicious. Then
when all shall seem to be well mixed
and incorporated (the which you may
easily know if you find it without the
least straw or lump) you shall take
with a spoon of this mass, which will
be almost all melted and dissolved
(whereof they make little Cakes) and
and put into boxes, which by that
time it is cold will become hard and
firm. You must observe nevertheless,
that to make these Cakes they throw
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56959:56"/>
a spoonful of the Liquor on some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or as in the Indies on some
great leaves, like those of the Plane-Tree,
our Author means here the <hi>Indian</hi>
plane-tree and not that of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the
<hi>Platanus</hi> of the Indies was so named
by the Spaniards for reasons that are
unknown to us, for it has no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with our Plane-tree, but it is
rather like the Palm tree, as well in
shape as in the bigness of the leaves,
which are so large, that they cover a
man from head to foot. Tis also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that these leaves serve for
the same use as paper with us: But to
the purpose; two or three spoonfuls
being thus put on one of these leaves,
and set in the shade, do soon grow
hard, and afterwards folding or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the paper, those Cakes, as being
very fat, are easily separated from the
paper: But if you should pour it into
some earthen Vessel, or on some board
it is not easie to unfasten those Cakes,
or get them off whole.</p>
                     <p>They drink this li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uor in the <hi>Indies</hi>
two wayes, of which the first and most
ordinary is to take it hot with <hi>Atholle,</hi>
an ancient Drink of the Indians, who
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56959:56"/>
call by this name, a Drink made of
the flower of <hi>Maiz,</hi> well steept in
Water, and boyl'd to a clear Liquor,
or rather like starch; but there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
different sorts thereof which are
excellently well described by <hi>Laet</hi> in
his 7th. Book Chap. 3. which the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
may consult at their leasure:
That discourse being too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
to be here inserted. With
this Liquor the Indians mix their
<hi>Chocolate,</hi> and to make it more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
they clear the <hi>Maiz,</hi> by taking
away the upper skin, which is Windy,
and begets melancholick humours,
and so there remains the best and
most substantial thereof: Return we
now to the second manner, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it, which is the modern and has
been introduced since the Spaniards
have made use of this <hi>Chocolate,</hi> the
which is also two fold.</p>
                     <p>The first is to steep or dissolve the
<hi>Chocolate</hi> in cold Water, and to take
off the scum which they put into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
dish, then to set the remainder
over the fire, putting therein as much
Sugar as you shall judge convenient
to sweeten it, and lastly it being hot
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56959:57"/>
and having mixed the Scum there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
which you had set apart, you
may drink it. Before I give you the
other way of making this Liquor
'twill not be amiss to describe the
Cup or Goblet wherein they drink
the <hi>Chocolate,</hi> made of <hi>Xicara,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
which the <hi>Mexicans</hi> call <hi>Tecomates.</hi>
They also make them of the fruit of a
certain Tree call'd by the Spaniards <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guero,</hi>
the Tree is very big<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which bears
leaves in shape and largeness like to
our Mulberry Tree, and has a fruit
like the gourd, whereof the <hi>Savages</hi>
make Cups to drink their <hi>Chocolate,</hi>
as to the Palms which bear these <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co's</hi>
I have nothing to say to them,
which yet are one of the stupendious
Miracles of Nature, I shall only take
notice with the Learned Doctor <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludanus,</hi>
in his remark on the Voyage
of <hi>Linschot,</hi> that the <hi>Coco</hi> is covered
with two barks, the first whereof is
rough, and hairy, of which they
make the Cables and Cordage of a
Ship, of the next Shell they make these
Cups; the common opinion being that
these Cups have an innate vertue (of
which the <hi>Chocolate</hi> being put therein
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56959:57"/>
participates) against the Apoplexy.
<hi>Sed haec o biter.</hi> To the purpose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Second way of preparing
this liquor is to heat the water, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this forementioned Cup, as
much <hi>Chocolate</hi> as is thereto necessary,
and withal a little water, then work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Chocolate</hi> and incorporating it
till it be well mixt, and dissolv'd all
in the Cup, put the rest of your hot
water with some Sugar therein, and
so drink it: Thus in <hi>Spain.</hi> But we
in <hi>England</hi> usually boyl the <hi>Chocolate</hi>
with the water, and some to make it
more dainty, though less wholesome,
use therein Eggs and Milk. There is
yet another way, something different
from this former, for they boyl both
the <hi>Chocolate</hi> and water together till
there swims at top a fat buttery sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
taking care, that there is not
too great a fire to make it boyl over:
But this way I do in no wise approve
of, for the fat separating it self from
the earthy parts, this sinks to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and the other keeps at top, so
that being thus drunk, the first loosens
the stomack, and takes away the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
and the latter causes melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56959:58"/>
There is another way of making
this drink of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> which is cold,
which takes its name from its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ingredient, and is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Chocolate,</hi> whereof they take to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
themselves, and is made after
this manner. They steep the <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
powder'd into a little water, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it well with the little Mill,
whence they abstract a very large scum,
which is so much the more augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by how much the <hi>Cacao</hi> is more old,
and rotten, this scum they put into
a dish a part, mixing therewith a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity of Sugar, which done
they set it up for their use, and drink
it cold, when they find they have
need thereof, but it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that they do not take this sort
in Winter, but in the greatest heat
of Summer, yet thus prepared it is so
extraordinary cooling, that it does not
agree with all stomachs, for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shews the ill thereof, it causing
distempers in the stomach, and cheifly
to Women. I would here give you
the cause and reason thereof, but I
shall omit it, that I may not seem too
prolix, and to trespass on the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
patience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56959:58"/>
There is also another way of
drinking it cold, which so prepared
is call'd <hi>Cacao Pinoli,</hi> it is made in
adding to the same <hi>Chocolate</hi> (after
having made the confection as we
have shewed) an equal quantity of
<hi>Maiz</hi> parcht and pounded, but first
well cleared of its skin, the which
being beaten in the Mortar with the
<hi>Chocolate</hi> becomes a powder and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
it self with the other, and of
the powders managed as we shewed
just before arises a Scum which they
also take and use as the precedent
drink.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another shorter then
the former ('Tis the same with ours)
and therefore more fit for men of
business, who have not the leasure
to attend a longer preparation, the
which is very wholesom, and 'tis
that I make use of my self; whilst you
set on the water to boyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you must
take a Cake of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> which you
may either pound in the Mortar, or
rather grate it to a fine powder, mixing
it with some Sugar, in a little pot, the
water being hot you must pour the
<hi>Chocolate</hi> therein, then taking it from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56959:59"/>
the fire, work it well with your little
Mill, and for want of that, brew it a
score times, out of one pot into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which yet does not so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
it as the Mill; this being
done, let it be drunk without separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from it the scum, as is usual in
the aforesaid preparations.</p>

FOURTH PART.</head>
                  <p>IN this last part it remains to shew
you in what quantity the <hi>Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
is to be drunk, in what time we
must make use thereof, and to what
persons 'tis most proper, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for some using it too excessively,
I do not mean only <hi>Chocolate,</hi> but
also all sorts of food and Liquors,
how good and excellent soever the
things are in thier own Nature, do
thence receive great incommodities,
and mischiefs, and if some persons
do complain, that it causes obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
'tis by reason of the excessive
use thereof; just so we see Wine,
which if excessively drunk instead of
heating, breeds oftentimes cold Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
Nature not being able to
surmount nor turn in its substance so
great a quantity thereof; so likewise
those that drink too much <hi>Chocolate,</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:56959:60"/>
since that it has several fat parts,
which cannot disperse themselves in
the same quantity through all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it must necessarily follow that
obstructions are caused by those which
remain in the little Veins of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which may be remedied, if a
Man will content himself with five
or six ounces only of <hi>Chocolate</hi> in the
Winter time, and if he that takes
thereof is bilious and subject to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly,
instead of drinking it with
common Water let him use therewith
<hi>Endive</hi> water, the same thing is to
be done in the Summer, by those
that would take it as a Medicine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the obstructions and hot Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of the Liver; but he that is
troubled with the coldness of Liver,
and full of obstructions shall take the
same <hi>Chocolate</hi> with Water of <hi>Rhubard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine it may be safely (if regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly)
used as long as till the month
of <hi>May,</hi> especially if the air be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
but I do not at all approve
the use thereof during the Dog-days,
unless by those to whom it will do
no hurt by reason of an habitual
custom and continual use thereof.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56959:60"/>
Then if any one stands in need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
even in the Dog-days, and if he
be of an hot constitution, he shall take
it mixt with <hi>Endive</hi> Water, from
four days to four days, especially if in
the morning he finds his Stomach to
be weak, and feeble. And although
it be very true, that in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
which is a very hot Country they
take it at all times, and that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
one might do the same in
<hi>Spain</hi> and in our other European
Countries, which are far less hot, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
I answer thereto, that first
we must attribute that to Custom.
In the second place that the excessive
heat of those Countries being joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annexed to an excessive moistness,
which helps to open the pores of the
Body it happens oftentimes that there
follows so great a dissipation or spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the proper substance of the
Body, that one might not only make
use of <hi>Chocolate</hi> in the morning, but
also all day long, without any injury
or detriment. And it is also as true,
that by the excessive heat of the
Country the Natural heat is wasted,
and exhaled, and that the heat of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56959:61"/>
the Stomach and other interiour parts
of the body so extend, and spread
themselves to the exterior, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this excess of heat the
stomach remains cold, so that they
receive great profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
not only from <hi>Chocolate</hi> (the
which as we have proved is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
hot) but also from pure Wine,
the which, though it be very hot does
no hurt, but on the contrary, rather
fortifies, and cherishes the Stomach;
but if amongst these excessive heats,
the Indians should drink Water, they
would receive notable detriments by
the coolness, which it would cause
in the Stomach, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
would be corrupted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
several other bad Distempers.</p>
                  <p>You must take notice also, that
the terrestrial parts, which we have said
are in <hi>Cacao,</hi> sink to the bottom of the
Cup, when you boyl your <hi>Chocolate,</hi>
yet there be some who think that
which falls to the bottom is the best
and most substantial of all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those that drink thereof do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
great danger; but besides that
this substance is earthy, thick, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56959:61"/>
it breeds melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
so that we must avoid it as
much as we can, contenting our selves
with the best which is the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial.
Lastly it remains to resolve
one difficulty which I have lively
touched here before, that is to say,
what is the Cause that <hi>Chocolate</hi> does
so much fatten those that drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
For if we consider all the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
except the <hi>Cacao,</hi> we shall find
that their quality is rather to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate;
and make lean the body, than
to fatten, as being all hot and dry,
in the third degree. The qualities
likewise of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> as we have
shewed you in the beginning, being
cold and dry are altogether unfit to
cause fatness. I affirm however that
the great quantity of buttery parts,
which I have proved to be in the
<hi>Cacao,</hi> are those which fatten, and
that the hot ingredients of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
serve instead of a Pipe or
Conduit to derive it, and make it
pass by the Liver, and the other parts
till they arrive at the fleshy parts:
Where finding a substance which is
like and conformable to them, to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56959:62"/>
wit hot and moist, such as are these
buttery parts, converting themselves
into the substance of the subject they
augment, and fatten it. One might
say several others things drawn
from the fountain of Philosophy and
Physick, but as being more fit for the
Schools than for our discourse we
shall omit them. I shall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that to my Receipt one might add
the Seeds of a <hi>Melon, Gourd</hi> or <hi>Valenzia</hi>
(I could never find out what sort of
drug this <hi>Valenzia</hi> is, however one may
venter to say it is of the same Nature
with the Seeds of a Cucumber,) the
which beat to a powder will be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
good for those that have the
Liver, or the reins excessive hot, and if
there happen any obstructions in the
Liver or Spleen, with a cold intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
