            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS
REPENTANCE.</hi>
Shewing, among other things, these two Points
for edification. I. What weakenes remaines in
Gods owne Children, especially in
times of triall and danger; and so, what little cause
they have to trust their hearts, or be confident
of themselves, but get to be strong in the
Lord, and in the power of his might. II. What is the power of Gods grace
and Covenant, for renewing his Children by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and so, what encouragement they have to
return after every fall, and goe on in their course
of Watchfulnesse, Humiliation, Prayer,
and magnifying of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this
night: for it is written, I will smite the Shepheard, and the Sheepe

shalt denie me thrice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 31. But he spake the more vehemently, If I should dye with thee, I
will not denie thee in any wise. Likewise also said
they all.</p>

and holy men of God instructed the Church
as well when they erred and fell into sinne, as
when they delivered wholsome and sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
Which may be particularly instanced
in the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> who in his two Epistles
hath left us very good instructions for our Faith
and Obedience, and against Deceivers: and in
these passages of the Gospell is propounded to
us as a Patterne of humane frailty in his fall,
and of Divine power in his rising and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
both which instruct Believers concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the strength of corruptions remaining in
them, concerning the weaknesse of their graces, their need of renewing faith
and repentance, their need of humility, feare and watchfulnesse, the mercy of a
pardoning God, what thankfulnesse they should returne for that mercy, and for
the certainty of persevering in the estate of grace, though with many failings and
hoblings in the way.</p>
            <p>But first in generall,<note place="margin">Parts of this History.</note> concerning all the Disciples; we have here a <hi>Prediction</hi> of

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62178:3"/>
of it by a testimony of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie, the Shepheard smitten, and the Sheepe
scattered, ver.</hi> 28. To which Christ subjoynes a <hi>consolation,</hi> namely that he and they
should have a joyfull meeting together againe after his Resurrection; with the
place where, <hi>in Galilee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly of <hi>Peters</hi> fall; first we have the <hi>occasion</hi> of it, that is, his rashnesse,
saying once or twice, he would sticke to Christ though all should leave him, <hi>ver.
29.</hi> Then our Saviours <hi>checke</hi> thereto, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. first admonishing him of his fall,
<hi>thou shalt deny me:</hi> secondly, the determinate number of his fals, <hi>thrice:</hi> thirdly,
the time, <hi>this day, even this night.</hi> Fourthly, the signe he gives him, <hi>before the Cocke
crow twice.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Peter</hi> replyes more stifly, <hi>ver. 31. to dye with him rather
then deny him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterward, when this prediction is to be acted; we have first the Occasion of
<hi>Peters</hi> fall, partly in his going into the Priests Hall and warming himselfe by the
fire, partly in the Priests Maids, who charged him with adhering to Christ, <hi>ver.
66,</hi> 67. Secondly, his fall it selfe, <hi>ver.</hi> 68. whose particulars with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances

            <p>Lastly, for his Repentance; we have first the time, <hi>then:</hi> secondly, the meanes,
both <hi>externall,</hi> the crowing of the Cocke, and Christs looking backe upon <hi>Peter;

as a rocke offends no man, but a blinde Man fals and offends at the rocke;
Not properly and Actively, but accidentally and Passively; so Christ offends
none: but so many are the scandals about and concerning Christ, as he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
him blessed that is not offended in him.</p>
            <p>1. Some are offended at the basenesse of his Birth; <hi>Is not this the Carpinters
Sonne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. At the place of his Education; <hi>Can any good come out of Galilee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>At his Doctrine; these are</hi> hard sayings, who can beare them?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>At his Miracles;</hi> he casts out Divels by Belzebub.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>At his conversation as too licentious,</hi> Mat. 11. Johns Disciples Fast, &amp;c. A

               <note place="margin">1 Coa. 1. 23.</note> We Preach Christ crucified, a scandall to the Jews.</p>
            <p>But what marvaile of all this, that Scribes and Pharisees, blinde guides, and
blinde People led by them, take offence by Christ, when even his Disciples and
all they take offence at his lowe estate and Passion, immediately before warned

and they are offended in them that would be offended in Christ himselfe; be
content as Christ; and for no other cause in them then that in Christ, and the
light being the same, if it offended in the Head, it will in the Members; Christs
Doctrine tended to Mortification, and crossed wicked mens lusts; if thine doe so,
as the world was offended in him, so will it in thee. Christs life was holy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and actually reproved the corruptions of the world, and this was another
cause of offence. If thy life doe so, all loose persons, Teachers or others will be
offended in thee;<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 29.</note> Christs Ministry was powerfull against sinne, <hi>not as the Scribes,</hi>
but <hi>with Authority;</hi> this was an eye-sore to blinde guides. If thine be so, then it will
be an offence and pricke in the eyes of numbers.</p>
            <p>Christs whole course was so gracious, so profitable, as God testified with him
everywhere that he was with him; here was a matter of envie: If God testifie
with thee, envious men will testifie against thee; For if we let him alone, all men
will beleeve in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 4. Let our care be,<note place="margin">Offend none justly.</note> that the world may not justly be offended <hi>by us;</hi> and if
<hi>in us,</hi> it was our Lords case, and our comfort shall be, men are not so much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in us, as in Christ in us.</p>
            <p>Christ never offended any man, yet what loads of slanders carried he to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
ours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How should a Christian subject to offence carry himselfe, to stop the
mouthes of wicked men, when nothing he doth never so carefully and justly, but
is traduced, himselfe slandered, wronged, abused?</p>
            <p>Surely thus we must resolve:</p>
            <p>1. That innocency, wisdome, goodnesse, will not free us against the worlds
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62178:4"/>
malice, no not if it were equall with Christs, no more then it did with him; but
before Gods tribunall and equall hearing of men.</p>
            <p>2. That Dogs will bark at Strangers, though they neither make nor meddle
with them; and a wise Traveller (shall make himselfe worke enough to stop
every Dogges barke) will goe on his way, and esteeme it as the barke of
Dogges.</p>
            <p>3. Labour to give no offence; and if Christ in thee offend any, let them stumble
and fall; for to this they were appointed.</p>

               </gap> for the choice of our Religion,<note place="margin">A trial of true religiousnesse.</note> or the triall of it. Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a generall offence to the wicked, as Christ the subject of it; most of the
world are offended with it, as Christ himselfe was left of followers, friends, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
kinsfolkes; and ever suspect that way the most walke in, that is the broad
way; the greater part still is against the better part.</p>
            <p>Few shall be saved, few beleeve, few finde the narrow way; Christ hath but a
few Disciples, and they for a time offended in him too.</p>
            <p>Dislike not that Religion which hath but a few; a few haire braind fellowes
onely run to Sermons, and are so precise, say some. But choose thou the broad
way at thy perill, and esteeme thy Religion as the Papist his, by Multitudes.</p>
            <p>Good men must choose theirs by Truth, and that is a deare commodity in the
hands of a few; and you must make this your wisdome to goe rather by the guide
of a few that have their eyes to see their way, then of Multitudes that are blinde
and discerne nothing.</p>
            <q>For it is written, I will smite the Shepheard, and the Sheepe shall be
scattered.</q>
            <p>COnfirmation of the former Prediction, by a testimony of <hi>Zachary</hi> 13. 7. Christ
gives here a twofold reason of the Disciples scandall.</p>
            <p>1. It was <hi>foretold;</hi> the Prediction must be accomplished.</p>
            <p>2. Because the Shepheard was to be <hi>smitten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they as Sheepe must be <hi>scattered.</hi>

            <p>The Scope of which place is, to prove Christ the true Pastor of the Flocke,<note place="margin">Scope.</note>
even by his smiting and abasement; and so most aptly alledged that the Disciples
might have matter of strength and comfort thence where they stumbled and
offended themselves.</p>
            <p>How different Divine conclusions are from humane,<note place="margin">Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions differ from humane.</note> and how contrary Gods
spirit is from mans in drawing conclusions! Humane reason saith thus, Christ
is smitten, and therefore he is not to be longer followed as a Guide: the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
themselves fall off from him; but Divine reason concludes cleane contrary;
Christ is smitten, and therefore is the Shepheard to whom the Sheepe ought to
cleave and not scatter themselves; so <hi>Isaiah 53. 4. Because he was smitten of God and
humbled,</hi> proves him to be our Messiah and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Reason saith, That is not the true Religion which is so opposed and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by Jewes, Turkes, Papists, held but by an handfull of men; the Spirit
saith, that is true Christianity which is so resisted; never was the Sun so beset
with darke clouds as Truth with oppositions. As therefore that Christ is the true
Messiah,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 34.</note> because he is a <hi>signe of contradiction,</hi> whom now <hi>Herod</hi> seekes to kill, the
Scribes and Pharises are deadly enemies unto: so is that true Christianity, which
the world opposeth.</p>
            <p>Humane reason saith, That cannot be the true way which so few walke in; can
so many Ages,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> so many great Persons be so deceived? the Spirit faith, therefore
it is the right way,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note> because so <hi>few finde it; not many great ones,</hi> wise, learned, &amp;c. as
not many, but a few meane Fisher-men followed Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>Reason saith, they cannot be deare to God, who are so afflicted and smitten;
the Spirit from thence concludes them <hi>Sons of God, Heb.</hi> 12, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62178:4"/>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Vnsafe therefore it is to follow our reason for our guide in divine
things; no, be ordered by the word and rules, of Religion.</p>
            <p>2. And we learne to deny our selves which is the first lesson in Christianity,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 24.</p>
            <q>I will smite the Shepherd.</q>
            <p>WHO is the Shepherd? Christ himself,<note place="margin">Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefits hath many names.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn 10. I am the good Shepherd.</hi>
Christ hath as many names as Benefits.</p>
            <p>1. He redeemed us, and thence called the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He rules us by his Spirit and grace, and thence called the <hi>King</hi> of the
Church.</p>
            <p>3. He feeds us, and called thence the <hi>Bread of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He refresheth us, and thence called the <hi>Water of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. He enlightneth us, and thence called the <hi>Light of the World. Iohn</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>6. He eternally appeaseth the Father, so called our <hi>high Priest,</hi> and here our

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Because promised, <hi>Ezek. 34. 23. I will set up one Shepherd over them, and he
shall feed them,</hi> and accordingly performed all, offices of a good Shepherd.</p>
            <p>So here called <hi>a Shepherd,</hi> a name of great love and sweetnesse.</p>
            <p>1. As descending of ancient Patriarks who were Shepherds,<note place="margin">Christ why called a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</note> and they Types
of him, <hi>Abel, Jacob, David, Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He <hi>knows his Sheepe,</hi> and <hi>markes</hi> them for his owne. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 3. 14. And God
sets his <hi>seale</hi> on them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 21. 19. knows them by name, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Souldiers.</p>
            <p>3. He <hi>feeds</hi> their Soules and bodyes in <hi>greene pastures, Psal.</hi> 23. and drives them
to the sweet streames and waters of comfort, by the paths of grace and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Defends</hi> them from the Wolfe and enemies, being timorous, simple, weake,
shiftlesse creatures, to flye, resist, or save themselves; as <hi>David</hi> met the Lyon and
Beare, and slew them, and saved the Sheepe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 34. so this Shepherd goes
on to meet the Adversaries, and to give his life for the sheepe. Oh wonderfull
love, and accordingly to be much magnified! this good Sheepherd watcheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

what fellowship betweene abhorring natures? therefore he was more pure then
the Sun, and no spot in him from top to toe, but all perfection of grace; he was
not therefore smitten for his own sake, but ours; so <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. he was wounded for

according to the accomplishment plainly and without obscurity.</p>
            <p>3. In both Phrases nothing else is signifyed but that all that trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution

as <hi>Act. 4. 28. Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate met to doe whatsoever thy hand and counsell determined:</hi> the
Prophet in the commandement to the Sword expresseth the counsell of God; the
Evangelist the hand of God in the death of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But he was smitten by the high Priests and <hi>Jewes</hi> who slue him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The hand and action of God was in it latent, the actions of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were apparent, Gods hand was secret and hid to them, and therefore they
sinned highly in bringing Gods purpose to passe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That God had a counsell ordaining and permitting this sin we grant;
but that he had a hand in the sin, is hard to say.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> addeth also, that God had <hi>a hand</hi> in this action, but more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
then counsell; for this hand wrought not with them in the sin, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated,
guided, restrained and over-ruled the sin to his glory and Christs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>

            <p>1. The Church is the great Sheepfold,<note place="margin">Church called a Sheepfold, why.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 16. for out of the Church is
no salvation; the fold is a defence for Sheepe; and because the Members of the
Church live in concord and peace as Sheepe, not as Lyons, Wolves, Tygars, &amp;c.
The marke of Christs Sheep is love, <hi>John.</hi> 13. 13.</p>
            <p>Every Christian resembles this creature in the Text:<note place="margin">Christians why called Sheep.</note> 1. Simple, foolish, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

conversion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. I beseech you as Pilgrims, wherein the whole life is but
a straying from God; but even after never so little left of the Shepherd, as <hi>Noah,
Lot, David, Hezekiah,</hi> and here all the Apostles; and can never returne without the
Shepherds call, partly in the word as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> partly by corrections,
which are as the Shepherds Dog to fetch us in, as <hi>Josephs</hi> Brethren.</p>
            <p>2. Beset with all manner of enemies, Dogs, Wolves, Lyons, Foxes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
in it selfe of all meanes of safety, without speed, courage, and natural wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
(as other creatures are armed with) to resist so many Adversaries, so as
their whole safety is in the presence and care of the Shepherd.</p>
            <p>So the Members of Christ beset with Tyrants, Hereticks, Hypocrites, Seducers,
false Brethren, and cannot put back violence with violence; their safety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
lies not as many beasts, in their Hornes, Hoofes, Nayles or teeth; they are
onely armed with the mercy and care of the Shepherd, without whom they are
sure to be a dayly prey to the Divell,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note>

with meeknesse, without strugling.</p>
            <p>Thus Christians resemble the Shepherd himselfe, he bare all wrongs, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did wrong, he was led as a Sheepe to the slaughter, and before the Shearer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
not his mouth; and his Members must receive a second wrong, rather
then revenge a former, and still possesse their Soules in patience.</p>

to stray away and become a prey to all the ravenous Beasts of the field; take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of our wandring and straying disposition, resembled in the parable of the
lost Sheep, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. that unlesse the good Shepherd leave the ninety and nine to

               <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Imitate Sheep in sundry Christian vertues.<note place="margin">Imitate Sheep and wherein.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Though they be easie to stray, yet being strayed they be easily reduced whither
the Shepherd will without resistance and trouble; so Gods Sheep having broke
out into some sin, sometimes a small check of conscience, sometimes a light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
sometimes a word of threatning or reprehension in the Ministry will bring
them on their knees and humble them, when as all Gods plagues will not subdue
the hard heart of wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> not reduced with ten plagues, therein like the
Leviathan. <hi>Job</hi> 41. 15.</p>
            <p>Sheep know their Shepherd and no man else; they know his voice or whistle
and no man else.</p>
            <p>We must know our Shepherd in his Person, in his offices, and esteeme to <hi>know
nothing but Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and him crucified;</hi> we must know no man else for Pardon of
our sin, for merit of righteousnesse, for intercession or obtaining salvation, but
onely Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vera gloria, Jer.</hi> 9. 24. the right glorying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vita aeterna, Iohn</hi> 17. 3. this is eternal life.</p>
            <p>We must know and acknowledge no voyce but his, no word but his,
no unwritten traditions, no determination of Popes, Councels, Fathers, but his
Scriptures a perfect guide, <hi>Gal. 1. 8, 9. If any man or Angel bring another word, hold him
accursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Sheep presently heare the voyce of the Shepherd, <hi>John. 10. 27. my sheepe hear
my voyce,</hi> not the voyce of Satan calling from light to darkenesse, not of Antichrist
calling to traditions and superstitions; But Christs voyce.</p>
            <p>1. Externall exhortationin the ministry.</p>
            <p>2. Internal inspirations, by the motions of his spirit not quenched.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62178:6"/>
3. Bountifull Largition; Christ speakes in his mercies, inviting to repentance,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>4. Corporal flagellation; his hand is his voyce, and cals to humiliation and
conversion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A good Christian heares all this;</hi> Heare the Rod, and who appointed it,
Mic. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>4. Sheepe follow their Shepherd; so the Sheep of Christ obey him; a fruit of
hearing; and bring in abundant fruits of obedience, abounding in good workes.
Nothing but profitable in Sheepe, fleece, flesh, encrease, profitable in life and
death, they be nowhere but enrich the Ground. Thus did the Shepherd, and
thus must we. So of the Sheepe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, How the Sheepe shall be scattered.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUr Saviour expresseth it,<note place="margin">Of the scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the People.</note> 
               <hi>Ioh. 16. 32. Behold, the houre commeth, yea is now come, that
ye shall be scattered, every one to his owne, and leave me alone.</hi> I shall be this night
smitten with reproach, ignomy, and the sharpest sword of God and men, even
to the death; and now whereas soundnesse of Faith would make you cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me in life and death, you shall forsake me; some of you shall deny and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
me, and all flye from me, and be scattered every one his way, as if you
were deceived and deluded in me; yea, every one of you shall shift for his owne
safety, and fall both from me, and one from another, as Sheepe are dispersed and
scattered, when the Shepherd is slaine and taken from them.</p>
            <p>And how this Prediction was accomplished, see <hi>Mat. 26. 56. Then all the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
forsooke him and fled,</hi> so soone as he was in his enemies hands; and not onely
they but other Disciples and followers of Christ, as the two Disciples that were
going to <hi>Emaus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 11.</note> whose Faith was so shaken, as they say, <hi>We thought this should be he
that should redeeme Israel, and this is the third day:</hi> but now they began to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why were the Disciples thus scattered?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In themselves; carnall and excessive feare of themselves, who were
yet weake, and had not received the Spirit to strengthen them as afterward; they
had not cast the costs of their profession, nor accounted sufficiently the expence
of this building, as their Master had long before exhorted them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. God in his wisdome would have Christ left of all his Disciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was to be knowne to tread the <hi>Wine-presse of Gods wrath alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 63. 3.</note> without
partner or fellow; none must share in the Action, or in the glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. Thus it behoved the Scripture to be fulfilled, in regard of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who voluntarily undertaking the grievous burthen of our sinne, must be
forsaken of God, and all other creatures, and comforts for the time; for so we
had justly deserved, and he must be left alone and comfortlesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 4. To teach us, that all the safety and comfort of the strongest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
were they as neere to Christ as his deare Disciples, is in their relation and
dependance on the chiefe Shepherd; for without Christ, the Shepherd of soules,
we lie dispersed, ungathered, and in a forlorne estate: If he withdraw himselfe
never so little, as great Beleevers as the Disciples flye away from him, and never
come to him till he come to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Are the Disciples scattered when Christ is persecuted and smitten?<note place="margin">No marvell if unsound fall quite away.</note>
what marvaile if hypocrites be quite blowne away from their profession by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
who onely as chaffe cleave to the Wheat?</p>
            <p>If the godly be scattered for a time from Christ and from themselves, as here
the Disciples, what marvaile if hypocrites be scattered from both?</p>
            <p>If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffliction for Christ shake the Faith of so great Apostles, no marvaile if it

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tled and ungrounded.</p>
            <p>This is one of the ends of affliction for the Gospell, to try them that are sound;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62178:7"/>
for as the faire season of the Spring sets and ripens Fruits, so the Winds and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
blasts of Autumn makes them fall off.</p>
            <p>We may not therefore stumble when we see great Professors fall off in trials;
for some <hi>believe but for a time, Luke</hi> 8. 13. and so of some 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. that <hi>they went
out from us, because they were not of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Let no man presume of his owne strength to stand in triall,<note place="margin">Let none trust trust his own heart.</note> nor be too
confident in another in tryall. Little knowes a man, nor will beleeve the deceit
and hollownesse of his owne heart; <hi>Hazael</hi> will not beleeve he can prove such <hi>a
Dogge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 8. 13.</note> and so vile as the Prophet speaks of.</p>
            <p>Little knowes many a man, who now continues wel-affected to sound Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
how soone they should finde their inner disposition and outward too chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if outward occasions were changed but a little.</p>
            <p>So a man would have promised as much as any of the Disciples of Christ, as
any in the world; nay, the Disciples would not beleeve Christ telling them
how cowardly they should leave him; they thought themselves wronged, as their
answer shewes; yet how should a man have bin deceived in them? how were they
deceived in themselves, who immediately after our Lord had forewarned them,
fall into this their weaknesse?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Arme our selves well against tryall;<note place="margin">Arme against shaking trials.</note> it was nothing for the Disciples
to sticke to Christ while in peace; and we now while Christ is with us easily hold
up the head; but when Christ is smitten then is the tryall; sound love to Christ is
tryed by <hi>continuing with him in temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sound love to the Word, Preachers and Professours is that which hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
triall; as that is sound Gold which hath passed the fire; good Ground is
knowne by enduring.</p>
            <p>Arme we therefore our selves with resolution, that we must suffer; that the
Shepherd shall be smitten, and yet goe on: so with sense of our owne impotency
to stand <hi>with watching and prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 41.</note> 
               <hi>that we enter not into temptation:</hi> also with sound
love of Christ and Christian Religion; or else if the Pastor be smitten, thou
shalt be scattered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 4. If godly Ministers or Professors in time of trouble be left, and those
that seemed to depend on them,<note place="margin">Thinke not much to be left alone in a good cause.</note> to affect them for the best things, fall to the
stronger side, it was our Lords case, we must be patient and contented; <hi>Elias</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by <hi>Jezabel,</hi> was left alone; <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe for Christ in his bands, had <hi>none
to assist him (2 Tim. 4. 16.) or stand with him:</hi> it is no new case, that faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
especially should be conformable to the chiefe Shepherd; all times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
did ever confirme this truth, that the Pastor was no sooner smitten, then
the Sheepe were scattered from him. But let it comfort Ministers, as Christ, <hi>I am
not alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 16. 32.</note>

sustaines them with many grounds of comfort.</p>

            <q>Verse 29. And Peter said unto him, Though all men should be offended,
yet would not I.</q>
            <p>HERE we have an instance (as many elsewhere) of <hi>Peters</hi> temerity and
rashnesse, not well considering his weaknesse, and what spirit he was of.
For this holy Disciple bewrayeth great infirmity, in arrogating much above that
was in him.</p>
            <p>1. He directly contradicteth his Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peters</hi> rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in five particulars</note> who said, <hi>all yee; Peter</hi> saith no, <hi>not all,</hi>
he will not; not this Night; no, never.</p>
            <p>2. Beleeves not the Oracle of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie,</hi> but would shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t it off with
pompe of words, not as concerning him; he was none of the sheepe that should
be scattered, though the Pastor was smitten.</p>
            <p>3. He presumes too much upon his owne strength, and of that which is out
of his owne power, never mentioning or including the helpe and strength of
God, by whom alone he should be enabled to stand; he neither considered his
owne frailty, which will overthrow him, nor yet the power of God which should
sustaine and uphold him.</p>
            <p>4. He prefers himselfe too too vain-gloriously above all men; as if all men
were weake to <hi>Peter;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> the onely champion; if all men should deny thee,
I would not; stronger in conceit then all the Apostles.</p>
            <p>5. He is bold, hardy and vainely confident in a thing to come, in which he
had never tryed his strength; he knew his present affection, he will take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his future perill; nay, he disclaimes and almost scornes the danger, now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62178:9"/>
when he is next to it, and even falling into it, and the difficulty expressed <hi>John
13. 37. Cannot I follow thee now? I will give my life for thee;</hi> I will be so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
thee, that I will confesse thee to the death; perils, dangers, feares, or death
it selfe shall not seperate me from thee. Alas man! thou that canst not follow
Christ, canst thou goe before him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> had a Promise,<note place="margin">Noact of faith in a Promise.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. that the gates of hell should not
prevaile against his Faith; might not he be bold in this Promise?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Promises of God make no man presume, but stir up watchfulnesse
and excite to prayer, which <hi>Peter</hi> should have done, being admonished of our
Lord.</p>
            <p>2. Though his Faith lwas not quite to be shaken and extinct, yet he might
for a time be so foyled as might bring him shame and sorrow enough.</p>
            <p>3. He had promised indeed before this the spirit of fortitude and strength;
but <hi>Peter</hi> anticipates the time; they were to be endued with virtue from above, but
not till after the Resurrection, which was no priviledge but that in the meane
time they might fall dangerously.</p>
            <p>4. No Promise could crosse the word of the Prophet, and Christ himself now
applying it to the present occasion, which ought to have bin believed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objec.</hi> But might not <hi>Peter</hi> be bold of victory, standing in so good a cause?
must Christians stand doubtfull and in suspense alwayes of their standing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1. Peter</hi> must not be bold against so expresse a word of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. No Christian boldnesse may make a man confident in himselfe, and
neglect prayer to God; that is a blame-worthy boldnesse for a Souldier to run
into the fight without his weapons, or against the word of his Captaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. He should have considered the infirmity of his Faith, which yet was
weake and suspected, if not for the truth yet strength of it, not knowing the
strength of the imminent temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 4. He should have considered that the strength of Faith of the Saints hath
bin shaken in temptation, as <hi>Abraham, Paul, David,</hi> and why not he?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objec.</hi> Christians are to come with courage to the battaile, assured of victory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. But by his strength that hath loved us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37.</p>

            <p>2. Boldnesse in the strength of God and love of our Father, not of our
strength and love of him; <hi>Peter</hi> presumed to stand because of the love Christ.</p>
            <p>3. A boldnesse upon the assured Promises of God and infinite merits of
Christ, foyling both carnal feare and presumption; <hi>Peters</hi> boldnesse was not with
the Word, but against it.</p>
            <p>4. Boldnesse not suffering to feare damnation, but to extinguish the feare of
transgression.</p>
            <p>5. A boldnesse banishing feare to fall away into perdition, but not the feare of
falling into finne and offence of God, which his owne Children are often too
bold in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> The vaine presumption of mans heart;<note place="margin">Note, and watch pride of heart.</note> in <hi>Peter</hi> see our selves; our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is as confident; we thinke if all should flye from Faith and Religion, sure
we would not. But were the Sword shaken a little, and the Scepter swayed but a

little another way, many would see their mould and temper; they that now spit
at the name of the hatefull Idoll of the Masse, would easily conceive it a better
Religion, and we should not want some Catholike Moderators who would say,
These two Religions with a little yeelding each side, might be brought into one.
We are as strong before the Battle as <hi>Peter,</hi> and when danger seemes farther off;
whereas the sight of one adversary would make a whole Army of us run away,
as <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> should have remembred, and so should we, the Answer of the King
of <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>Benhadad, 1 King. 20. 11. Let not him that putteth on his Armour boast as he
that puts it off.</hi> Let us not crow before the Victory. We are ready to promise our
selves successe and events as he was, which are out of our power; he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and purpose watchfulnesse; endeavour, strive against this temptation, which
was all he could doe; but to promise of the event and issue, was not his part nor
to dispose of.</p>
            <p>We can as easily promise to our selves, above that God hath promised, as he;
nay, against the word of God, as he, that we shall be safe and stand, and conceive
some singular prerogative or strength in our selves, while yet we forget to use
meanes to grow in knowledge, awaken our Faith, provoke our watchfulnesse;
we can be as proud and bragging in our speech as he was, forgetting modesty
and humanity, promising Mountaines; and should our actions swell to our
words, we would doe wonders; but away with these brags, and learne to speak
humbly, warily and modestly, as knowing what befell this Apostle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Beware of Pride of heart, which is so hatefull to God, as robbing him
of his glory, and so prejudicial to our selves; for, if nature onely and the pride
of it, quicken our resolutions, and not Faith, they will dye and deceive us; if
flesh onely incite our courage, it will suddenly be cold, as in <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> But I have great gifts of knowledge, and speech, and zeale, and love
and faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Let no gifts puffe thee up; suppose thou hadst gifts Apostolicall,
<hi>Peter</hi> had all these gifts, but pride of heart foiled them all; and the more and better
the gifts be, it is so much the worse where they be abused or corrupted.</p>
            <p>2. Never pride thy selfe above any man, who mayest see those corruptions and
evils in thy selfe, which thou never sawest in any other man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse 2. Thou standest by Faith,</hi> Rom. 11. 12. <hi>be not high-minded but feare. Peter</hi> that
was now so forward, had no small cause to feare; and we want not more
cause; as,</p>
            <p>1. The weaknesse of flesh and pronenesse to sinne, yea weaknesse of spirit in
the best, being borne of God, but yet as children.</p>
            <p>2. Satans malice, ever seeking to cast us downe, winnowing us also as Wheat.</p>
            <p>3. Naughtinesse of our bad workes, and imperfections of our best, in them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
            <p>4. Perfection of Gods Law, strictnesse against the least disobedience, and in
giving up of our Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> But what need the Saints feare, or how may they, having against the
former Gods power, Gods promise, Gods intercession; and seeing nothing is
more contrary to Faith then fear and doubting?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When the Apostle <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 17. wisheth Christians <hi>to passe the whole
time of their dwelling here in feare,</hi> he implyeth both the possibility and necessity.</p>
            <p>But we must distinguish of feare, which is of

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The former is a reverent feare of Gods presence, whom we would not offend;
a feare of falling into sinne, or making matter of unkindenesse between him and
our selves.</p>
            <p>The latter a hatefull feare of his presence, which we would avoid; a fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into hell, and suffering according to our deserts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62178:10"/>
The one is a despaire of Gods goodnesse, because sinne lyes at doore, and
wrath hangs over their heads, and their Couscience is restlesse, and death is ready
to overtake them in sinne, and hell is open, and the Divell reaching at them to
eternall confusion.</p>
            <p>The other is a feare of reverence, by which we feare the corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and treachery of our owne hearts; we feare the commiting of the least sin,
and make conscience of all known evils; we feare least we be called to account
before the reckoning be ready; we feare to offend God and godly men, or grieve
his holy Spirit; we feare to be infected by evill men, and carried into their
errour.</p>
            <p>The former cannot stand with Faith, but is utterly against it; and being a
feare of diffidence, makes men even distrustfull.</p>
            <p>The latter is not against Faith, but stablisheth it, and makes our hearts watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and attendant to good meanes, both of continuance in the estate of grace,
and worke of it, and increase of Faith, that we may be upheld to the end.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore nourish this feare in us:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 1. This feare is loves keeper and preserver of graces,<note place="margin">Holy fear to be ever cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> fear of fals, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

            <p>Many say, if all were true as the Minister saith, we were in a miserable state; but

            <p>It commonly fals out, that they who pride themselves above others, even in

               </note> almost nothing but
experience of their former fals, which is the Mistris of fooles, bringeth them to
see their folly; so here in <hi>Peter,</hi> all Christs warnings too little; and so long they
must fall; sense of weaknesse is their greatest strength.</p>
            <p>2. Till the judgement be changed, the Actions be the same; <hi>Peters</hi> judgement
is disguised with an erroneous misjudging his owne estate; he is the same man
after Christs speech as he was before, and so contradicteth him as before; as the
most of the Fathers lived in Polygamy, not because it was ever lawfull, but their
judgement being darke and erroneous in it, their practise was answerable; and
who of Gods Children see not, that they know but in part, and grow dayly to
see errors in themselves which they never saw before, as <hi>Peter</hi> saw not so much
in himselfe as he did after?</p>
            <p>3. Weakenesse of grace and regeneration in part causeth even the best to goe
every day over the same wants and common infirmities; as wandring thoughts,
idle speeches, unjust anger, &amp;c. which frailties as they be daily renewed, so they
must daily renew their repentance, and daily lay hold on Christs perfect merits
for justification; this weaknesse of grace gave <hi>Peter</hi> up againe to this sin of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
his Lord.</p>
            <p>4. The same ends remaine still, which may move the Lord to leave his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to themselves, and to fall in the same sort; to try, excite, humble them,
worke more serious sorrow, make them more watchfull, &amp;c. which was the issue
of <hi>Peters</hi> fall here.</p>

            <p>3. He considereth not,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> that every good and perfect gift is <hi>from the Father of
lights;</hi> but hath power in himselfe to stand out the greatest of all trials; and
therefore within a few houres, the contempt of this power of God drives it quite
from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Let us well watch the pride of our owne nature: Nature is so proud in
every one of us, that it will build up a tower to heaven, though it prove but a
Babel and Confusion. Pride of heart will make us sacrifice to our owne Nets,
and rob God of his glory. <hi>Peter</hi> had good things, and true grace in him; but
not acknowledging them in the giver, puffes him up and darkens them; whereas
grace received and acknowledged in the giver, are so far from puffing up, as they
make humble.</p>
            <p>Grace in <hi>Abraham</hi> comming neer to God, maketh him say, <hi>I am but dust and ashes,
Gen.</hi> 18. 27.</p>
            <p>2. In good things take heed of preposterous and rash zeale, which here <hi>Peter</hi>
fals by; guide it by the Word, by Faith, by Prayer, by thy calling, by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our selves; and thinke it safer to fear, then to be very confident of thy self.</p>
            <q>Likewise said they all.]</q>
            <p>THE fourth is the effect of <hi>Peters</hi> presumption; he drew in all the Disciples
into the same sin: 1. which was the stronger:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Because they had heard our Saviour reproving <hi>Peter</hi> for his rash confidence.</item>
               <item>2. They had never yet tryed their strength.</item>
               <item>3. If they had, they should not at all have contradicted his word, who had said,
<hi>all ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> shall be offended.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. This terrible threatning of themselves and <hi>Peter,</hi> should have set them out
of themselves, and clung unto him, and said, O Lord, we know our weaknesse;
if we doe not, thou knowest it; we know thy truth, and cannot but beleeve thy
Word; oh therefore, doe thou take care of us, thou that art the faithfull Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
keepe us silly Sheepe from wandring from thee.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But they imitate <hi>Peter;</hi> they must be as constant as <hi>Peter,</hi> and must never seeme
more fearfull then he. They must not be behinde him, neither in comforting their
Master, nor in professing their zeale to their Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> 1. Frailty in the best; no graine without some chaffe, no flour without
some bran, no rose without some thorne; there is in the best matter of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Disciples themselves in Christs presence shew great imbecillity and
weaknesse.</p>
            <p>Matter of comfort, which concernes us in our fals; <hi>Matthew</hi> was one of them
that said so, yet <hi>Matthew</hi> records for our comfort, how he among the rest was
vainly confident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 2. How quickly sin spreads it selfe;<note place="margin">Sin is of an infectious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> drawes all the Disciples after his
sinne, when all Christs perswasions cannot stay them. The same of the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
after he had received the spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 14. by not walking with a right
foot, drew the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> also into his dissimulation, and compelled

the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Judaism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> not by teaching any Doctrine to that purpose, for they
could not erre in that, but in the authority of his example. Example in sinne is
a kinde of compulsion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Take heed of sinning, least thou bring many sins upon thee, as <hi>Peters</hi>
sinne here; heavie both in regard of his Master and fellow Disciples.</p>
            <p>2. Beware also of the company of sinners; example is become a kinde of Law,
and thy selfe as tinder to receive such sparkles.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to a passage in another part of the Chapter.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 66.</bibl>
               <p> And as <hi>Peter</hi> was beneath in the Hall, there came one of
the Maids of the high Priests:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 67. And when she saw <hi>Peter</hi> warming himselfe, she looked on him, and
said, Thou wast also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 68. But he denyed it, saying, I know him not, neither wot I what thou
sayest; Then he went into the Porch, and the Cock crew, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>WEE have heard in the former Story, how much <hi>Peter</hi> had promised of
himselfe; he would not be offended, he would not flye if all should; he
will dye with Christ before he would deny him.</p>
            <p>We have heard how our Saviour forewarned him of his weaknesse, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
his fall, and how stoutly he contradicted his Lord.</p>
            <p>Now we come to his performance in this Story; which in generall shewes,

            </p>
            <p>The sinne and fall of <hi>Peter</hi> was the foulest and shamefullest of all the Disciples
(except <hi>Judas)</hi> they all forsooke him and fled; so did he; none of them denyed
him once, but he thrice; none forswore him but he, who with cursing and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
abjured himselfe, if ever he knew him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> The Lord foresaw this sinne, foretold it, might have prevented it, and
sustained him in the temptation; why should he suffer his dear Disciple so farre
and so fouly to fall?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">Why God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented not this fall of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </note> who might have prevented it, neither would nor did,
for many Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. He would give us and the whole Church an example of infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
by the fall of such a man.</p>
            <p>2. The strongest must learn feare and watchfulnesse, and while they stand take
heed least they fall, that the enemy suddenly oppresse them not, as <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To crush presumption of men, and to teach to attribute more to the Word
of Christ then their owne strength, which had <hi>Peter</hi> done, he had not so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
fallen.</p>
            <p>4. The Lord foresaw, that in the last times men transported with the spirit
of error, should transforme <hi>Peter</hi> into an Idoll, and grow to that madnesse as to
lift him up into the place and office of Christ, giving unto him the headship of
the Church, and make him the head of the Antichristian <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue;
and therefore the Lord set <hi>Peter</hi> apart above all other Disciples, in whom should
breake out such weaknesse as he might be acknowledged not a God, but a fraile
man; not a Lord, but a weake and sinfull servant; so in his life, <hi>Acts 3. 12. &amp;</hi> 10. 15.
Carnall men worship him, but <hi>Peter</hi> refused.</p>
            <p>And by the way observe, how accurate the Scriptures are to set downe not this

word.</p>
            <p>4. That he among the rest contended for <hi>Primacy, Mat.</hi> 18. 2. that he among
the rest could not <hi>watch one hour</hi> with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. Though Christ had special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>5. That fact of temerity and rashnesse in cutting of <hi>Malchus</hi> his eare, against his
calling and without warrant, condemned by Christ.</p>
            <p>6. That he walked not with a right foot to the truth of the Gospell, <hi>Gal. 2.
14.</hi> but dissembled with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and brought <hi>Barnabas</hi> in; for which <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
him to his face.</p>
            <p>All which we note, not to exprobate to that holy Apostle, but to shew that the
councell of God in particular noting these failings would prevent the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
doctrines and doings of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>

the fellowship of the individuall unity plainely deifying him, which blasphemy
were rather to be buried with stones, then defended as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goeth about
to doe.</p>
            <p>5. In <hi>Peters</hi> rising the Lord would give a singular example of mercy, that he
might raise up great sinners in the hope of mercy that they might not despaire,
but trust confidently in the same grace.</p>
            <p>For these Reasons, the Lord would have all the Evangelists with one mouth
and pen, and in one manner to record this grievous fact of their fellow Apostle;
nay if it be true as some of the Ancients record, that the Gospell of Saint <hi>Marke</hi>
was declared and uttred by <hi>Peter</hi> and written from his mouth by Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> that
providence so overruled the matter, that <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe most ingenuously (for the
former Reasons) did publish to the World both his sin and repentance.</p>

                  </gap>oing into the Hall.</note> for what had he to do there
in the Hall of the high Priest? his Lord had set him about other businesse.</p>
            <p>1. Christ had now told him he <hi>could not now follow him, John</hi> 13. 26. yet he will
follow him afar off; and though Christ had told him he was not able to suffer
with him, nor for him, yet forward he will goe.</p>
            <p>2. Christ had said to his Apprehenders,<note place="margin">John 18.</note> 
               <hi>let these go away;</hi> yet <hi>Peter</hi> will not goe.</p>
            <p>3. Christ had commanded them all to watch and pray, because temptation
was at hand.</p>
            <p>4. Had particularly told <hi>Peter</hi> what would be the event, if he did follow him;
for had <hi>Peter</hi> beene with the other Disciples, or hid himselfe from the Tempter,
he had no more denyed his Lord then they.</p>
            <p>5. By a speciall providence <hi>Peter</hi> found the doore of the high Priest shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, which should have beene a warning to him, and not idly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62178:14"/>
by; for when God casts a stop or bar in every way to hinder us in acting any
evill, we should apprehend it as a part of his gracious providence, and stop our
sinnes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> will not from the doore till he get in; he is hankering about to see
what will become of Christ; he hath a love to his Master, and is unwilling to
leave him; his zeale is not yet extinct, but rash and inconsiderate; he was
greatly bound to his Master, and holdeth it laudable not to leave such a friend
in distresse; though he could not helpe him, yet would shew duty; he seemeth
mindfull of his promise also; though all men forsake him, yet would not he;
and therefore to the high Priests house he will with another Disciple, as <hi>John 18.
15,</hi> 16. whom some thinke to be <hi>John</hi> who useth in his story so to speak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
suppressing his name; but it is not likely that <hi>John</hi> so poore a Fisherman
and Disciple of Christ was so well acquainted with the high Priest; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he was, he was a friend of Christ and his Apostles, and being known to
the high Priest was let in, but <hi>Peter</hi> unknown was kept out, till his friend pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his standing in the cold, entreated the Maid that kept the door to let in <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Peter</hi> with much adoe and importunity of his friend gets into the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
of temptation; his friend hath besped him into that place, which Christ
forewarned him to avoid, which is another argument I thinke him not to be
<hi>John,</hi> who having heard his forewarne to <hi>Peter,</hi> in likelyhood would rather have
diswaded him from his purpose, then been an Author in it; or if it were he and
did not, he were blameworthy, and greatly sinned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. He that would avoyd sin must carefully avoyd occasions,<note place="margin">To avoyd sin avoyd occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> which are

the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and see War, least they should start back and sin against him.</p>
            <p>And our Lord Jesus would have prevented this occasion in <hi>Peter</hi> by forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him of it; he that would not be burnt must not touch fire, or goe upon

commandement, and within the limits of his owne calling, which if <hi>Peter</hi>

that he should not have so much as deliberated on it, much lesse resolved
against it; but he forgetteth the word and commandement of Christ, and so fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into sin.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Eve</hi> had remembred the word of God, and kept her to the commandement,
neither the beauty of the Apple, nor the subtill perswasion of Satan had allured

was worse then witchcraft; the word teacheth wisdome to avoyd snars of sin, but

great sinne without some false glasse or glosse; we must therefore attend to
the mouth of God, walke in the paths of his wisedome, and turn not aside for
shewes; remember <hi>Prov. 3. 5. trust to the Lord, and leane not to thine owne wisedome,</hi> and
<hi>ver. 6. In all thy wayes acknowledge the Lord, and he will direct thy steps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. Lastly here is a notable rule to be observed in friendship examine the
love thou shewest to thy friend by the love of God.<note place="margin">How we are to shew love to a friend.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Take heed thy love be subordinate to the love of God, that if thou canst
not please both, thy friend be not pleased with Gods displeasure, <hi>Mat. 10. 37. He
that loveth Father and Mother better then me, is not worthy of me; nay, he that hateth them
not, Luke</hi> 14. 26. so did not <hi>Peter,</hi> he should first have loved Christ as his Lord,
and then as his friend, had he done so, he would have kept his word.</p>
            <p>2. Love the Word better then thy friend, <hi>Peter</hi> should have stucke to the
word, and not to Christs Person.</p>
            <p>3. See thy love to thy friend be not preposterous, that thy affection destroy
him not; here <hi>Peters</hi> friend helpes forward his sin, though perhaps unawares.</p>
            <p>The subtilty of Satan creepes into our friendship and fellowships, that by our
improvidence, we instead of helping and loving them, hurt them more then the
Enemies could doe. We must pray for wisedome and judgement, that neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
nor unawares we either councell or lead them into any sin, or uphold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sin in them, or hinder in them any good.</p>
            <p>But contrarily become true friends to their Soules; it is lamentable that a
Father should discourage the Child, the Husband the Wife, &amp;c. from piety and
religion, or that they should abet evill, or counsell or draw one another to ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as there is the greatest hatred, so ordinarily it ends in most bitter hatred.</p>

            <p>WEE have seene <hi>Peter</hi> gotten into the Hall of the high Priest; What is he
doing there? [she saw <hi>Peter warming himselfe.]</hi> Three of the Evangelists
make mention of this circumstance. <hi>John</hi> 18. 18. expresseth also his company;
the high Priests servants and officers stood, &amp;c. who had <hi>made a fire of Coals,</hi> for
it was cold, and they warmed themselves, and <hi>Peter</hi> also stood among them and
warmed himselfe, <hi>Luke 22. 56. Peter sat by the fire and warmed himselfe.</hi> We need
take no notice of that small diversity; one of the Evangelists says <hi>he stood,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>he sat warming himselfe;</hi> both are true; for in so long time he somtimes stood,
sometimes sat, warming himselfe as they did.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Company of <hi>Peter</hi> he found a great change; instead of Christ
and his Apostles, teaching, hearing, conferring, praying, confirming one another
against Temptations, and provoking to the love of the Lord, he is among a
company of Rackshels and prophane Serving-men of the high Priest, who are at
busie against Christ as their Master, and all their tongues and talke bent against
Christ, which was now the businesse in hand; and <hi>Peter,</hi> if he will be safe among
them, must frame himselfe unto them.</p>
            <p>Had he beene in the Mountaine or in the Temple, or in his owne House with
his Master, his exercise had bin otherwise; but now he is in the Pretory of the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> and in the House of the high Priest, where Christ indeed was, but taken
and bound, and mockt, accused, and condemned, no safe place to confesse the
truth; and what can he doe there but deny?</p>

God giveth gifts in mercy, when he maketh us better, not worse. We proceed.</p>

kindenesse as she thought, but she payeth him with a mischiefe; a godly man
commonly buyes a wicked mans favour very deare.</p>
            <p>1. Commonly an evill man if he be an instrument of good to a good man, it
is against his mind, being overruled and drawne secretly by God, or inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by some sinister end; they cannot shew sound mercy, being a fruit of the Spirit,
but counterfeit a corrupt love and favour.</p>
            <p>2. Sometimes pretending favour, they intend mischiefe, as the Machiavels of
our Age; so <hi>Saul</hi> will prefer <hi>David,</hi> maketh him his Son, and giveth him his

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1. Peter</hi> presumeth that all men could not cast him downe, Christ had
denominated <hi>Peter</hi> for his solidity and firmnesse, and he thought himselfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enough; but now he shall see more evidently his frailty, to be so suddenly cast
downe by a fraile Woman; he shall see now that the strength he boasted off is
blowne away by the breath of a silly girle.</p>
            <p>2. To shew him the more, as his pride was more then the rest, a shamefull fall
for so great a professor, to fall before so vain a Woman; <hi>Abimelech</hi> would rather kil
himselfe then endure the disgrace to <hi>dye by the hand of a Woman;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 9. 54.</note> but as pride go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

to himselfe, this circumstance shall kill him, and touch him at the quick, the
shame shall be as ill as the hurt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Lord who resisteth all sinners,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6.</note> is said often to <hi>resist the proud;</hi> that is, after
a speciall and severe manner, because they will draw Gods glory upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
he commonly so resisteth them as he turneth their glory into shame, and
confoundeth their pride by weaknesse; hath God neither Angels nor men to
command against <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> yes, but will rather confound him with an army of
frogs, flyes, Catterpillars in derision of his pride; the same God could have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the dust of the Earth into Lyons, Wolves, Bears of strange greatnesse and
fiercenesse to have met that fierce and cruell King that said, <hi>who is the Lord?</hi> and
in spight of him oppressed the People, but in scorne of his pride he turned the dust
of the Earth into Lice, who made him and his enchanters confesse it was the <hi>fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proud <hi>Herod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> who assumed the glory of God to himselfe, <hi>it is the voyce of God,
not of man,</hi> the Lord consumeth him with lice the basest of the Creatures, and not
so much honoured as wicked <hi>Jezabel</hi> to be eaten of Dogs, but of Lice.</p>
            <p>Historians writes of a City in <hi>France</hi> that was depopulated and wasted, and the
Inhabitants driven away by Frogs. A History reporteth of a Town in <hi>Thessalonica</hi>
rooted up and overthrowne by Moles. We read of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> choaked with
a Flye.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord playeth as it were with his Enemies, scorneth to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in field upon them, but armeth the meanest of his creatures against them.</p>
            <p>Let this humble us under the mighty hand of God; presume of nothing in our
selves, be proud of nothing, least we know by wofull experience that a thing of
nothing shall cast us down.</p>
            <p>If our pride shall resist God, Gods weaknesse shall resist us, and we shall know
to our cost, that the weaknesse of God is stronger then man; never was pride of
heart unrevenged with fals, sin and shame.</p>

            <p>Note what are the many quarrels of evill men against the godly, and what are

            <p>As Spyders can turn every thing into poyson; so wicked men turne whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
things into poyson and malicious accusations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts 21. 28. Oh men of Israel helpe; this man, &amp;c. Paul</hi> gave the Law his due, onely
denyed justification by it, nor spoke against the Temple, but their hypocrisie

for evill men, and helpeth them well; I thought it had beene thus; but
what if he had? now the Temple was free for all; <hi>Moses</hi> Law ceremonial was

hath in himselfe, by turning his carnall courage, which resists true feare, into

he shall not want terrors of minde that shall leave him but a little rest. <hi>Herod</hi> is

            <p>Satans ayme is, either to allure and entise us to sinne, by a number of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons

            <q>Verse 68. But he denyed it, saying, I know him not, neither wot I what

            </p>
            <p>2. In doubling it, implying more resolution, <hi>neither wot what thou sayest;</hi> both
which speeches were manifest untruths and lyes against his own conscience; for
<hi>Peter</hi> well knew Christ, having bin long with him; and one of his first Disciples, he
had confessed him, <hi>thou art the Son of God;</hi> besides, he knew well what she meant,
and therefore it was another lye.</p>
            <p>3. In denying him so openly amongst a multitude; <hi>before them all,</hi> saith
<hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The fault is so foule, as one witnesse were too much; but <hi>Peter</hi> provides

2. He that denyeth Christ before any man, shall be denyed before the Father,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. What a great sin to deny him before all men?</p>
            <p>3. In so great a company were a number of wicked men; and now <hi>Peter</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the name of Christ to all their scorne and opproby; he hardens and animates
them, and stands with them in rejecting of Christ.</p>
            <p>There were also some weake ones and well-wishers to Christ, as he that carried
<hi>Peter</hi> in, and some that might be coming forward; and <hi>Peter</hi> by his example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foreman of the Disciples, weakens and scandalizeth all these, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
so many soules, and if he that offends one of these little ones, better a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea; what a case is <hi>Peter</hi> in
that offends so many?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. How far soever the courage of flesh and blood carries a man,<note place="margin">Carnall cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage will faile sooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and rash

follow thee now?</hi> And I <hi>will dye with thee before I will deny thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this to follow the Master, to deny himselfe, his Disciples? is this to lay
down the life for the Master, to fear the voyce of a silly Girle? Is this not to deny
Christ, to deny thy selfe a Christian? for if thou knowest not him to be the
Christ, thou knowest not thy selfe to be a Christian.</p>
            <p>Thus in one word bold <hi>Peter</hi> denyeth and renounceth his Lord, his faith, his
profession and salvation by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Let us looke well to our zeale,<note place="margin">Take heed to thy spirit.</note> that it serve us not as <hi>Peters</hi> did him; the
drugs have Adulterates, and the most cunning Coynes their slips, and the best
graces have in this corruption their cracks and defects; let us try and weigh
and sound our zeale for its truth, and that by these markes.</p>
            <p>1. True zeale is earnest for good,<note place="margin">True zeale what.</note> but it is not for a fit or passion, as <hi>John</hi> at his
entrance, and <hi>Peter</hi> here; but it is a gift of the Spirit, and a grace which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and lasting.</p>
            <p>2. It riseth out of <hi>knowledge of God and our selves;</hi> zeale not guided by knowledge
is hurtfull, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. so here <hi>Peter had</hi> zeale for Christ, but knew not himselfe;
as mettle is dangerous in a head-strong Horse; so zeale degenerated in a head-strong
passion, not guided by knowledge.</p>
            <p>3. It is attended ever with <hi>godly sorrow, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 11. and griefe, first for his owne
sin, and then others; God is dishonoured in both, and he is troubled in both.</p>
            <p>4. Carried with care and feare of falling, not selfe-conceitednesse, trusting to
himselfe, his strength, his judgement, as this of <hi>Peters</hi> did.</p>
            <p>5. Coveteth spiritual things in the world; Christs was zeale to Gods house; so
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Oh how love I thy house!</hi> how deare are thy words unto me! how
sweet, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These ardent desires dryed him, and consumed him; <hi>Peter</hi> coveted Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
but how? his owne name, reputation, life, and safety was deare unto
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 2. The nature of <hi>Peters</hi> sinne which was the most direct deniall of Christ
that might be.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peters</hi> sin of an hainous nature.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, not to professe and confesse his Doctrine outwardly and secretly, is a
denyall.</p>
            <p>2. Not to expresse the Doctrine and power of Religion, which we acknowldge
true, whether for fear or otherwise, is an high denyall of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. To subvert or overthrow some fundamental point of Religion, is fearfully
to deny Christ; for it is all one to deny his doctrine as himselfe, being of the
same nature with himselfe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Peters</hi> denyall was beyond all these, not against his Doctrine onely, but
against his Person immediately, and this not to deny him by silence, but by
speech, whom himselfe had confessed the Son of God, and had heard him so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
from Heaven by God himselfe once and againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62178:20"/>
Yes, when he needed not have openly disclaimed him, for the Maids speech
was, whether he was with Christ; he might have contented himselfe to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
himselfe, and said <hi>I was not,</hi> rather then have sinned directly against his
Lord and Master. Or what lawfull authority had this Maide to examine <hi>Peter;</hi>
he was not bound to confesse that he knew him; neither doth <hi>Peter</hi> confesse
some, and conceale some, to fumble or equivocate to tell you; for if this
could have saved <hi>Peter,</hi> he needed not have wept for denying his Master, though
some Fathers would excuse him; but he flatly, and stoutly denyeth all, that ever he
knew him, or had to doe with him; he doth not say, I know him not so well
as I should doe.</p>
            <p>Alas what a poore case is <hi>Peter</hi> now in; for if he deny Christ, who doth not
confesse him that others may know he doth so as well as himselfe, what a feareful
denyall is to make others even boyes and girles know we disclaime him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctr.</hi> Note hence what a hard matter it is to confesse Christ in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and perill,<note place="margin">Hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christ in danger.</note> when so great a Disciple as <hi>Peter</hi> before any great danger so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Satans malice;<note place="margin">And why?</note> he winnowes and tempts <hi>Peter</hi> here, and the Saints
to plucke them from this confession, because he knoweth that God is greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by the confession of his Servants. That the truth is notably confirmed
which shakes the Wals and foundation of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>That confessing him before men, notably incites and provokes others to the
love and likeing of the truth, and to the imitation of such holy examples, and
because he would hinder the happinesse of Saints, well knowing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Strength of corruption in us makes it very hard at such times.</p>
            <p>1. How hard is it to deny our selves? and not denying our selves, we cannot
but deny him; we not onely reason with flesh and blood, but conclude with flesh
and blood against the yoke of Christ; <hi>Paul</hi> communed not with flesh and blood.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
            <p>2. How doe we blush at the Chaine, and shame at the Crosse of Christ, which
indeed is the glory and crowne of a Christian? he that is ashamed of Christ, how
can he confesse him? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. I suffer these things, and am not ashamed;
for <hi>I know whom I have believed;</hi> one cause why many among the Rulers beleeved
and durst not confesse Christ, was, because <hi>they feared to be cast out of the Synagogue,
John</hi> 12. 42.</p>
            <p>3. How are we glued to the love of the profits, and glory of the World? loth
we are to be too great losers by Christ, much lesse forsake all to follow him;
this maketh it hard to confesse Christ in cases of losse and disadvantage; this
cause is in <hi>John</hi> 12. 43. the Rulers confessed not Christ whom they knew, because
they <hi>loved the praise of men more then the praise of God. Demas</hi> would not have his
commodityes hindred, and so forsooke the Apostles, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Weaknesse of faith and graces; <hi>Peter</hi> had now true faith in his heart,
but weake and raked up in a heape of corruptions; where is no faith, is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
a strong faith, a strong confession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> was now as a man in a sowne or qualme; living, but little shew or sense
of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Beleever, a lover of Christ, his faith made him come to Christ, but
the weaknesse of it made him speake little and low, and not directly for him.</p>

that being ashamed of thee would deny thee his Master?</p>
            <p>4. Christians must be considered not onely as private men, but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

is accompanied with salvation, <hi>Rom. 10. 10. with the mouth confesse to salvation:</hi>
onely this man is of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p>7. Thou canst not but confesse Christ, nor keepe Faith at home; it is as fire

the power of Religion now in the time of peace, God will never give him the
honour to professe in time of persecution; he that will deny by a warme fire, will
deny more easily in a fiery triall.</p>
            <p>4. Arme thy selfe against the sweet and sower, the best and worst of the world;
beware of preferring of the best things as better and sweeter then Christ and the
glory of heaven; God is not so prodigal of his glory, nor of the gracious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

Sonne; neither gaze with both eyes upon outward things never so little, but on
the power of God, which is manifest in weaknesse.</p>

and his Angels; oh this my servant was more willing to dye for me then deny

               <hi>Answ. Peter</hi> was now as a Bird that had lost his nest, knew not what to doe
with himselfe; in staying was danger, and in going now was as much danger;
for if now being questioned he should flye upon it, he should confirme their sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
against him; and confesse that which he would fain dissemble.</p>
            <p>Againe, he had heard that Servants perhaps mutter against him; for it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
there was a great many more then three that set upon him, and feareth
they will pursue him, if he should flye, and there resolveth to returne among
them, set as good a face on the matter as he can, and falleth into familiar and
free talke with them, if by that means he might prevent suspicion.</p>

               <hi>Peter</hi> should have done better if he had left the house, and not stucke in the

            <p>2. Christian zeale, hating all sin even the appearance.</p>
            <p>Many step out of the midst of sinne, but hang about the Porch, would not be
outragious sinners, but retaine a smatch or taste; not open Adulterers, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous

Faith, Troth, God, &amp;c. not workers on the Sabbath, but idle and prophane
in words and deeds; not open Railers and scorners of good exercises, and men,
but secret haters or dislikers; all which is to sticke in the Porch of Sin, and as

            <p>2. Sinne hath a property,<note place="margin">Culpa claudit oculos, Greg.</note> to stun and benum the conscience and Soul of man;
for as a man falling from an high place, lieth a great while in a swoon or trance,

            <p>3. The supposed pleasure of sinne doth drowne Judgement, disturbe Reason,

lesse, or scarce sinnes; every man thinkes his owne breath sweet; and delight
in sinne brings on custome, and custome in sinne taketh away the sense of
sinne.</p>
            <p>

fruit of sinne, and far worse then sinne it selfe; most men are in love with their
Consciences when they lye still and quiet; and this is the case and conscience of

is like a dead body layed in the grave, sleepes, lyeth still, and is cleane

in Mercy,</hi> and in season, as in the godly, when they shall sustaine sorrow enough,
and taste the soure sauce of their sweet meats, and out of deepe sorrow recover
their joy, as in <hi>Peter; Or in Justice,</hi> and too late, as in <hi>Judas,</hi> who slept all the
while he conspired against his Lord, but no sooner wakened, but he went
and hanged himselfe; here was the most fearefull wakening, because his
denyall of his Lord was of maliciousnesse, <hi>Peters</hi> of infirmity.</p>
            <p>Many living in grosse sinnes thanke God they never were troubled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

            <p>A Smith layeth as many hard blowes on the Anvill as on the Iron he works;
the Anvill is the same not dinted, but the other yeelds to his desire; so here is
the difference, but that one hath heat and fire in it, softning it, the other cold
without all fire within; so here, God speaketh as loud stroakes and as hard on
the wicked mans heart, as on the godly; the same voyde, the same hand, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all fire and heat of the Spirit mollifying without all impression, onely recoyls

If God take away a mans bodily sight or hearing, every man taketh notice,
and mourneth under such a rod of God, but when sinne hath taken away the
inward ear and eye, that there is no seeing or hearing of admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
of sinne, no man thinkes this a judgement, but a benefit; seeing therefore
soft a hearing heart and eare is so great a blessing, as the contrary is a curse, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for soft hearts, pray against hardnesse; use meanes to waken thee; get
wise and understanding hearts to observe the crow of the Cocks, to observe the

come to know and speake of that they most sought to cover.</p>
            <p>3. Shame and Sin goe hand in hand; and in effect.</p>
            <p>The Sinner hateth not onely his owne soule, but his owne good name; the
Adulterer that watcheth the twilight, and hideth himselfe in the night, shuts the
doores, windowes, drawes curtaines, &amp;c. cannot shut out Gods eye, nor the eye of
his owne conscience, no nor the mouthes of men, but some one or other spyeth
him, and for the most part he is reputed as he is.</p>
            <p>The Drunkard that is drunke in the night, he is ashamed of his sin in the day,
though many deboyst Persons be not; yet because the Wife, Children, Servants,
Neighbours, Companions spye him, he beareth justly the name and shame of his
sin, which he thought darkenesse could beare off; so the Usurer, the unjust trader
that smootheth over deceit, one time or other, one Maid or other, one occasion
or other, shall detect them, and cast the shame of their sinne in their faces, and on
their names.</p>
            <p>Nay more, hide thy hypocrisie, thy distaste of Gods Servants in the darkest
cave and corner of thy heart; lock up secret wrath and displeasure in the most
inward Closet of thy breast, God will one day detect thee, he needes neither
man nor Maid to discover thee, the sparkes of thine owne fire within thee shall
fly abroad, and make men know thee better then thou wouldst be knowne; he
that hath birds of Heaven to carry forth curses of the thoughts against the King,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 20. and by that which hath wings can declare the speeches of thy bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
can and will easily in his time declare what thou art in things which
of all others thou wouldest be masked in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. Here is another Maid of the high Priest as good as the former,<note place="margin">Like Master, like Servant.</note> and both
as good as their Master, all of them very busy against Christ and his Disciples,
the Master against the Master, and the Servants against his Servants.</p>
            <p>But these Maids forgetting their businesse, their Sexe, their modesty, their place,
shew themselves very rude in that, in the presence of so many men, they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to prate to a man; a stranger, in a businesse not concerning themselves
or places.</p>
            <p>But learne, that <hi>as the Master is, commonly such are the Servants,</hi> such is the Family;
a good Master will have good Servants, a bad contrary.</p>
            <p>The Centurion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 8. being a good man, hath a number of good Servants
and trained in good order and subjection.</p>
            <p>And we scarce read of a convert, but we read of the faith and conversion of <hi>his
Family, Acts</hi> 16. 33. The Jaylor. <hi>chap. 18. 8. Crispus beleeved, and all his House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how contrary we see that of</hi> Solomon? Prov. 29. 12. If the Prince be given to lyes,
all the Servants are wicked.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Esau</hi> be wickedly and malitiously minded against <hi>Jacob,</hi> he hath three or four
hundred Servants all at his heeles ready to destroy him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 1.</p>

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62178:23"/>
If <hi>Absolon</hi> unnaturally plot the death of his owne Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> he keepeth
Servants ready enough to act and execute it.</p>
            <p>A swearing Master, hath blasphemous Servants; a Popish Master, Popish
Servants; an Atheist Master, hath Atheist Servants; he careth not, nor careth
whether their Religion be for God or the Divell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. A good man hath a care to provide himselfe good Servants,<note place="margin">Why a good Master hath good Servants</note> sober,
teachable, at least inclinable to goodnesse; <hi>David Psal.</hi> 101. will not suffer a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person in his house, a Lyer, a Slanderer.</p>
            <p>No man is willing to entertaine a Thiefe in his house, to rob him; and art
thou more carefull of thy Goods, and weary of him, then he that will rob God
of his glory by blaspheming, cursing and wicked courses?</p>
            <p>2. If he find them not so good, he is carefull to teach and instruct them; so
<hi>Abraham</hi> was commended that he would <hi>teach his Family after him, Gen.</hi> 18. 19.
and become a good patterne and example of piety and grace; every man for his
owne advantage will teach and traine up his Servants and Apprentices in the
knowledge of their owne trads and occupations, and much more good men hold

the prophane and incorrigible Scoffers, and such as will not yeild to instruction

            </p>
            <p>1. Because he delighteth in no other, but such as abett his own evil and execute
it; some men thinke it not for their profit to keepe a Servant that cannot lye
and sweare as fast as speak, so it be to others, not themselves; they must not have
their Servants blockish, for then they will neglect their businesse, nor have too
much knowledge; for they will see their faults, and make scruple of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
            <p>2. Because of the contagion of Sin; Sin is of a strong and swift motion, it can
move up hill and ascend from Inferiors to superiors; from the Wife to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as <hi>Jehoram</hi> did evill, for <hi>Ahabs</hi> Daughter was his Wife, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18. and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>

            <p>If it goe up Hill so fast, how swift is it downe Hill? if it can rise from the
feet to the Head so quickly; how suddenly from head to feet? from Superiors
to Inferiors?</p>
            <p>3. Because of the countenance sin gets from Superiors; if sin be so bold and
active as all the Authority and care of Superiors can scarce represse and restraine
it; how can it but thrive, when it hath gotten Authority, countenance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
when it is incited, commanded, backed and abetted?</p>

            <p>That all wisedome is little enough to support a man matched with an evill

            <p>But in these two Maids observe more specially, that as the Women had the first
hand in the first sin; so women had hand also in this great sin of the death of
Christ; forthough they could passe no sentence against him in publique, yet in
their places they could scorne him, and endanger his Disciples.</p>
            <p>And consequent it is that women had need of their redemption by Christs
death as well as men; whosoever have hand in the transgression, stand in need
of the benefit and meanes of pardon.</p>
            <p>Many Women are carelesse of the main businesse,<note place="margin">Luke 10. 42.</note> of the <hi>one thing necessary;

            <p>2. To perswade and councell good things; not as <hi>Hamans</hi> Wife when he told

denouncing damnation for them, and yet persist without reformation, but that
custome of sin hath made them so deafe that they take no notice either of the sin,
or that there is any need of reformation? why doth yet the Adulterer blush,
the Drunkard shame, the blasphemous Swearer hide his face for shame at so foule

            <p>And whereas it were very hard if they could not devise some quarrell against

Christ, members of his body, and one of another reproached and reviled at this

they repeat Sermons when they come home, and sing Psalmes in their houses,
can goe about no worke till they have solemnly prayed, nor goe to bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reading and praying, so great is their hypocrisie. They be <hi>Jewes</hi> in keeping
the Sabbath, they must doe nothing, nor speake but holy things, scarce make
their Beds, dresse any meat, or eat it when dressed.</p>
            <p>Nay, they have beene accused sometimes in Pulpits, sometimes on Stages, that
they would not sweare, nor suffer an oath in another unreproved, nor they will
not be drunke, nor abide to run to Tavernes or Ale-houses; they are so strict as
they will not indure any merry company, nor be merry themselves, as <hi>Israel</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 38.</note> and numbred not themselves among the Nations; and are not
these proper accusations? or are there any other greater justly cast upon them;
so as our Saviour concluds the matter; if ye were of the world, the world would
love her owne;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 4.</note> and <hi>Peter,</hi> because ye <hi>run not with them to the excesse of errour,</hi> but
stand with Christ in your owne duty and station, and therefore they hate you.</p>
            <p>This so being, let godly men be so much the more wary of themselves and
courses, as small things are made great matters in them. Judge your selves in
small things, let the righteous smite you, and the word of God wound your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmityes,
least you fall into their hands.</p>
            <p>Oh that Professors would so walke, as all their accusations would vanish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
shadowes and smoake; oh that you would by innocency thus dull and blunt
all their keen Weapons! the wisdome of a man will make a benefit of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
much more the wisedome of God in his Servants.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this may be a comfort and incouragement to godly men; if they have

            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Sin is very bold where once it is bid welcome; if it once enter,<note place="margin">And why?</note> it
knowes the way againe, and once admitted will plead, <hi>not possession, but prescription;</hi>
an army is easier kept out, then beaten out.</p>
            <p>2. The Sinner is lesse able to resist the second time, then he was the former, so
<hi>Peter</hi> here; for grace is weakned and decayed by yeilding to the first temptation,
and the strength of God which onely makes the way of grace easie, plucked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by grieving his holy spirit.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> here denyes as often as he is tempted, and would have denyed
a thousand times if the Lord by his prediction had not limited the temptation,
and returned with new strength.</p>
            <p>3. The way of sin once set open, is as the Gates of a City cast open for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
by which Satan bringing in his forces, strongly plants them, and quickly
so fortifieth them, as a great strength shall hardly raze or remove them.</p>
            <p>Every sin admitted, not onely weakens, but corrupts the facultyes of the Soul
by which it is upheld, it darkens understanding, corrupts the will, disturbs the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and raiseth a cloud of passions to dazel reason, as <hi>Peter</hi> here in feares and
perplexityes, and doubts, marvelous blind for a time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> Be exhorted to give sin no entrance at all,<note place="margin">Keep sin out or drive it out quickly.</note> or if thou canst not keepe it
out, drive it out presently by repentance; as the wise Mariner carefully keeps his
Ship from leaking; and if he cannot ever prevent, but it will take in some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he emptyes and pomps it out at the beginning, because then it is easier emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed
then afterward.</p>
            <p>A wise man is carefull to prevent a disease, and preserve his health; but if he
cannot alway do it, he will run to the remedy betime, knowing that an old di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
troubles the Physitian, which not distemper onely, but age and continuance
hath confirmed.</p>
            <p>It is a folly to taste of Sin, and the sweet meates of it; but to sit downe to feed
upon it, is madnesse to him that knowes he must vomit up every morsell, yea eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
crumb of it, before he can be well.</p>
            <p>Againe, seest thou sin let in by sin? though it may sollicite thee, yet let it no
settle on thee; cast thine eye about, and see how hard, how impossible almost to
remove a custome of swearing, of lying, drunkennesse, or any evill habit which
hath fastened on us; how seldome are such habituall Sinners reclamed? how
hard is it to turne the course of the Thames or River, which time out of minde
hath kept his owne Channell? how hard to plucke out a Naile which one hath

            <p>Let Satan prevaile with others to helpe themselves to wealth by lyes, oathes,
deceit, to recovery of health, and things lost by the Witch; to wind themselves
out of punishments by hiding themselves in lyes and tricks, and to avoyd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
run into a mischiefe; but let them beware in their hunger to make
stones bread; let them not leape out of the pan into the fire but serving a
good Lord, let them expect his goodnesse in good meanes, which had <hi>Peter</hi> done,
he had beene kept from great offences.</p>

and <hi>Josephs</hi> Brethren, brings an increase of sins; denying brings in swearing,
swearing brings in forswearing; <hi>Peter</hi> should not have sworne, much lesse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne;
for it was enough and too much to deny the second time.</p>
            <p>1. Here was no necessity for an oath,<note place="margin">Conditions of an oath.</note> neither being lawfully called, nor in a
thing which (had it beene true) might not have beene otherwise proved by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
testimony, or other proofes or Arguments; now an oath is ordained of
God for confirmation of a weighty and necessary truth when all other proofes
faile.</p>
            <p>2. Here is an oath made, neither for Gods glory, which tended to the denyal
and dishonour of God, where a right oath is a glorious use of Gods name; nor
the necessity and good of men, except it be good to be deceived in so great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as acknowledgement or mistaking Gods owne Person.</p>
            <p>3. The right end of an oath is a defence and shield of truth to confirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
backe it, and not to be a Sanctuary of lyes, or to deceive the Person to whom
we sweare.</p>
            <p>4. But this Oath besides is a perjury in the highest degree; it neither agrees
with the truth in the matter, nor yet in the mind; and how fearefull is this sin?</p>
            <p>1. How dares <hi>Peter</hi> produce God himselfe as a witnesse to confirme a knowne

that he is the God <hi>omniscient</hi> and knowes the heart, that he is <hi>omnipotent</hi> and
just, able and willing to revenge all unjust oathes? if he know not, why sweares
he now by him? if he doe know, why will he call a Maintainer of truth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of falshood against his owne soule? knowes not <hi>Peter</hi> that the Lord, who
is the <hi>Avenger of all guile, 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 6. must especially avenge this guile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the highest kinde, masked under a religious and solemne oath? if no

            <p>Beware of swearing company; <hi>Peter</hi> here doth as they doe; perhaps they will

            <p>Beware especially of false swearing,<note place="margin">Especiall to swear falsly.</note> which notes a fearfull contempt of Gods
justice and power, a sin that the Heathens trembled at, a sin that we never read
the Divells committed; for though he impudently resisted the truth, and is a

read not that ever he durst backe his lyes with oathes.</p>
            <p>A vaine Oath is too much for a Christian, much more a false oath; a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should invocate the name of God, as his strongest helpe, not impricate it as

            <p>In a word, if thou wouldest avoyd forswearing, or voyd swearing it selfe; an

they never had been where Reason and Religion was, but bewray themselves as
the most rude and barbarous Heathens, or as the curst Dogge, scorne and barke
and rage against God, if any man cast a stone against him, or crosse him never

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ had foretold <hi>Peter</hi> he must deny him thrice, and hereby most

1. I will lay downe my life for thee.</p>

            <p>3. <hi>If all men, yet not I.</hi> Now <hi>Peter</hi> shall better discerne his threefold presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

up; and he that had no such cause to be proud, shall have cause enough to
be humbled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why doth the Evangelist and al the rest of his fellow-Disciples set down
this most third and fearfull fall of their fellow Disciple,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Peters</hi> great sin is thus blazed forth.</note> that was to be so great
a pillar in the Church of God? Why doe they thus shame him to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. These holy men guided by the holy Ghost in penning the Scripture,
looked neither at their owne nor other mens glory, but the glory of God; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Pen-men of Scripture set downe their owne infirmities and fals, as
<hi>David, Matthew, John</hi> his curiosity, <hi>Paul</hi> in most vehement wise against himselfe;
and some thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe did dictate this Gospel, and <hi>Marke</hi> writ it
from him. Had they bin guided by a humane spirit, they would have favoured
themselves and one another.</p>
            <p>2. They more respect the glory of the grace of Christ in raising him out of such
a fall, then the disgrace of <hi>Peter</hi> in so falling.</p>
            <p>3. More eye the consolation of the weake then his reputation; teaching us, in
case of Gods glory, neither to spare the reputation of others, or our owne; but
let God be true and all men lyars; let God arise, and all flesh fall downe before
his foot-stoole.</p>
            <p>First for the time, <hi>Anon after.] Luke.</hi> 22. 59. determines the time, and tels us,
that betweene the first and last temptation was the space of an hour, a very small
time to heap up so many foule sins as in <hi>Peters</hi> were.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. The godly are by nature the children of wrath as well as any; and
after grace have the seeds and spawn of al sin in them; and that there is any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in them from others, and they breake not out into outragious Sinnes, is
onely by grace; as <hi>Paul, by the grace of God I am that I am, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
            <p>2. Doe we not see how notwithstanding grace received, we may discerne
the naughtinesse of our nature in a pronenesse to all evill, to which we are as
headlong and naturally carried as a sparke to flye upward? the best find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>a law of evill, a law in their members, rebelling against the Law of their minde, Rom.
7. A weight of sin which presseth downe, and hangeth fast on, Heb.</hi> 12. 1. A rebellious flesh
<hi>which lusts and fights against the spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 17. doe we see notwithstanding true
grace received, notwithstanding our watch and best endeavour, we are carryed
captive to sin, and forced to doe things we hate; how lamentable Slaves and
Captives should we be? how forlorn and forward unto all unrighteousnesse; were
it not for the Spirit of grace restraining and renewing?</p>
            <p>

foule Adulteryes, outragious Murthers, other sins so quickly afterward?</p>
            <p>2. Acknowledge it is not of our selves that we stand or fall not so soulely as
others, our hearts being as slippery and ready to play false play, but by grace we
stand, <hi>Rom. 11. 14. Thou standest by faith, be not high minded, Rom. 6. 14. sin shall not raigne,
because ye are under grace.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Doctr. Note</hi> 2. That <hi>Peter</hi> was not so assaulted by both the former temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as by this,<note place="margin">Last temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commonly the worst.</note> nor is in so great danger.</p>
            <p>The last temptation is commonly the worst and strongest, and most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and the most dangerous reserved till the last place; Satan bids not <hi>Peter</hi>
curse himselfe if ever he knew the Lord, for this he would have detested; but
first follow aloofe, and then goe into the high Priests Hall, then sit among Gods
enemies, then doe as they did, and having once denyed his Lord, stands to it
stoutly.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Judas,</hi> he doth not as first bid him betray his Lord; for, as wicked as he was
he could not be <hi>tam repentè improbus;</hi> but first to covetousnesse, and blinded his
eyes with the offer of thirty pieces, and then struck up the matter by degrees, and
yet after the betraying of his Lord, he must goe and hang himselfe.</p>
            <p>He doth not usually tempt the Adulterer to cast himselfe upon the bed of his
Harlot; but first <hi>David</hi> must looke upon <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and that is a small thing, then
grow to liking, then to familiarity, and then to commit the hainous fact of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.</p>
            <p>He doth not usually tempt the cruell man to murther his Neighbour or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at first, which is fearfull and desparate, but first to dislike and fall out with
him, then to hate him, then to kill him actually.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. This is Satans method in his temptations,<note place="margin">And why?</note> to begin with small things
wherein so much blacknesse appeares not, which are easily swallowed, wherein
men are more secure, as not thinking them to need any great resistance; but
there he meanes not to stay; experience of every day shewes, that being to deale
with melancholly dispositions, he makes them discontent and impatient in
some crosse or losse, which is a great sinne, but lyes close and hides it selfe, as in
a just sorrow; then brings them to discontent themselves in Gods blessings, they
joy not in Husband, Wife, Children, wealth, nor any thing; then to fall out
with himselfe, no joy of themselves; and then the last temptation is worst, to
kill thy selfe or thy Children, which was too blacke at first, and needed a time
to prepare them.</p>
            <p>2. Satans subtilty, who knowes well by lesse temptations to make way to
greater, as a cunning Thief by a little hole can wrinch up and open a great Gate;
so this subtill Serpent can by a little hole winde himselfe into the heart, and
cast open the doores to all Robbers and Spoylers.</p>

            <p>3. One faculty corrupted corrupts another; imagination being corrupted

Curse compassed, and doth still, the <hi>Jewes</hi> at this day; <hi>His blood be on us and our

            </p>
            <p>And thy curse against thy selfe or others shall as a Garment cover thy selfe,
and as water come into thy Bowels and rot thee away, according to thy curse.
Many stories I could alledge of such as whose Curses have instantly over-taken
them, some in one kinde of death, some in another. If God have let thee hitherto
outstand thine owne curse of thy selfe, it is to provoke thee to Repentance, and
bewaile so high a sin against Gods soveraignty and thine own salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. See in <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Little credit to be given to Swearers and Cursers.</note> how little Swearers and Cursers are to be beleeved; many
Oathes and Curses make not a matter good, but farre worse and lesse credible;

thou swearest and cursest? I would be charitable, but I cannot be so blind, but

            <p>
               <hi>Vse 3. Peter</hi> sins so foulely as he could doe, more to sinke himselfe into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

<hi>Peters</hi> Free-will, that so little besteads himselfe in so great need?</p>
            <p>How can the Pope challenge from him freedome from errour? How can they

            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 4. Though <hi>Peter</hi> here sweare and curse,<note place="margin">Temptations limited to Gods People</note> they beleeve him as little as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
they beleeve their eyes, they saw him in the Garden, knew him by face and
by speech; Why doe they let him goe and draw him to no further punishment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Time was not yet; when <hi>Peter</hi> was old, then he must be led where
he would not.</p>
            <p>2. Christ had said that his Disciples must goe their way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Every temptation and danger is limited for substance, manner, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and all circumstances, beyond which the enemy cannot goe. Here Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
come thicke upon <hi>Peter,</hi> one in anothers necke, but shall not utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
him; besides, these were as restlesse against <hi>Peter</hi> as against his Lord, yet
can they not touch an haire of his head, because his houre was not yet come, as
his Lords was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Let the Adversaries be never so violent and busie, yet Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is so wakefull, as nothing shall befall, wherein he hath not a good hand
and a good end.</p>
            <p>3. Gods mighty power restraines Sathans power and his instruments, who
are as Lyons in chaines. A Legion cannot hurt a Swine of <hi>Gaderens,</hi> till Christ
say, <hi>Goe;</hi> and when he permits Satan to molest <hi>Job,</hi> he commands him in <hi>save

            <q>Verse 72. Then the second time the Cocke crew.]</q>
            <p>THat the Cocke crew againe, was an ordinary and natural thing; but at this
time ordained for a speciall end.</p>
            <p>First, to put him in minde of his promise.</p>
            <p>2. To reprove him of his sinne; for as the dumbe Asse reproved the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Prophet, so the Cocke here reproves the foolishnesse of <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To beare witnesse to the words of Christ, which <hi>Peter</hi> will not, till now,
believe to be true.</p>
            <p>4. To accuse <hi>Peter</hi> to his owne Conscience, he should have cryed and crowed
aloud and lifted up his voyce, to have awaked others out of their sinne, but he
needs the voyce of a Cocke to helpe him out of his sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is admonished by this voyce, that the silly Cock kept his watch,
according to the word of his Creator; but <hi>Peter</hi> hath not kept his watch with his
Lord, but fearefully fallen in his station.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctr. Note,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Voice of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice.</note> If <hi>Peter</hi> will not heare the voyce of his Lord, and be taught by his
Master, he shall heare the voyce of the Cocke, and be taught by him. God puts
his Creatures to a threefold use.</p>
            <p>1. To serve man serving his Lord, the best of them not too good; the Angels
fellow servants.</p>
            <p>2. To punish man rebelling against his Lord; for they all take their Lords
part, are his Hoasts, his Armies, as against <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To teach man many lessons, which otherwise he is loth to learne; as when
<hi>Balaam</hi> will not heare the voyce of God, God opens the mouth of the Asse, and
she speakes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 28. So when <hi>Peter</hi> will not heare the voyce of his Lord, his
Lord opens the mouth of the Cocke, and he speakes.</p>
            <p>If the stiffe necked <hi>Jewes</hi> will not heare the voyce of the Prophets, the very
Oxe and Asse shall be called in to teach them to know their owner and feeder,
<hi>Isay</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But have the Creatures more power to teach then God himself, or why
doth the Lord thus use them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God is the chiefe Teacher,<note place="margin">Why God sets them to teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man.</note> what Minister or Instruments soever he useth,
he teacheth <hi>Principaliter &amp; Authoritative;</hi> but all Creatures teach <hi>Ministerially,</hi> and
all their voyce is subordinate to the voyce of God; as this Cocke was to Christ.
And therefore God speakes not to us by Creatures, as if they had more power
and perswasion to effect what he cannot; but hereby to shame the dulnesse and
obstinacy of men, whose sinne hath made them inferiour to the very Creatures,
over whom the Lord gave them Lordship and soveraignty. Now <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse is
wiser then his wilfull Master; and man who was made Lord and Ruler of the
Creatures, is now become of lesse understanding then they, yea, must be brought
into order by them whom he should order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To heare the voyce of the Creatures waking us,<note place="margin">Heare their voyce, and learne duty.</note> calling us, inviting us
to repentance.</p>
            <p>Their voyce in Generall and in speciall; not one of them, but all in their
kinde reprove Mans rebellion; they stand in their kinde and station, Man doth
not. The Cocke crowes and keepes his watches according to the law of his
Creation; so doe they all further then mans sin hath disordered them; when
as great a Disciple as <hi>Peter</hi> sleepes and snorts, and cannot watch one houre with
his Lord; not one of them but all of them by their example, teach us to grow
weary of our present servitude of sinne, and wait for promised deliverance,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21.</p>
            <p>Shall we be more senselesse then insensible Creatures? All of them call for

Time, <hi>Then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note 1. Peter</hi> now begins to waken and come to himselfe.</p>
            <p>There is a time when God will awake the Elect out of sinne,<note place="margin">Elect have a time to repent</note> who suffers none
of his to sleepe in death. <hi>Psal. 37. 24. Though he fall, he shall not be cast off; for God
puts under his hand. 2 Cor. 4. 9. We are cast downe, but we perish not;</hi> God is faithfull
to give with every temptation an issue.</p>
            <p>Hence we read of the Saints that have layne a great while, as if they had bin
quite cast off, as <hi>David, Josephs</hi> Brethren, <hi>Solomon, Manasses;</hi> but in Gods time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
and called to mercy, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay foure dayes in the grave, but was at
length raised; the same in this first Resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> God loveth with an everlasting love, and leaveth not very long, not to
their losse but good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Farre (we say) he goes that never turnes; the godly never goe so farre;
though <hi>Peter</hi> went so farre, yet repented; the Prodigal Sonne went into a farre
Countrey, but at last came to himselfe, and so to his Father.</p>
            <p>2. Hence take no warrant to venture; a River that seemes shallow at brinke,
may ducke him that will wade along, and many adventurers are never fetcht out;
thinke with thy selfe it is no small power nor mercy to bring a sinner backe out
of the depth of any sinne; it was a wonder that ever <hi>Jonas</hi> was brought safe to
land out of such a deepe, presuming to run from God. This Doctrine is for peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not presumptuous sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Thou that hast taken a time to sinne, examine whether thou hast found
a time of Repentance; for if thou belong to God, thou hast or must; and let it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62178:34"/>
be a motive to hasten our Repentance, lest delaying too long, thou be forced
out of anguish of soule to say with that desparing Papist,<note place="margin">Spira.</note> 
               <hi>I have sinned with</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>but not repented with</hi> Peter: a signe of a Reprobate, not to finde Repentance,
as <hi>Esau, Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. How to understand that and such places, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 12. If we denie him, he
will deny us,</hi> except himselfe graciously looke upon us, to give us repentance and
recover us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Repent of sin presently.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> hath no sooner sinned, but he returns and repents. The
fittest time of Repentance is presently upon the sin, without delay. <hi>David 2 Sam.
24,</hi> 10. had no sooner numbred the People, but his heart smote him. <hi>Luke 17. 8.
Zacheus</hi> presently made <hi>restitution,</hi> so soon as he knew his sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Consider the Exhortation, Heb. 3. 7. <hi>To day if ye will heare his voyce:</hi>
hast thou a lease of thy life till to morrow, that refusest to repent to day? the
day may <hi>come on thee as a snare, Luke</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>2. Sinne gets strength by continuance; thou art unfitted to morrow, grace
weaker, corruption more rooted; the nayle is hard driven in; conscience more
corrupted by custome of sinne; now <hi>wrath treasured, Rom.</hi> 2 5. heart more <hi>hardned
through deceitfulnesse of sinne, Heb.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>3. Nature teacheth in other things to take the fittest season; to sowe in Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
to make Hay while Sun shines, to trade while Fayre lasts, to take the winde
and tyde, which stayes for no man. Let grace teach thee to know thy season, thy
day of visitation; looke on Christ mourning over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that knowes not the
season of her own mourning.</p>
            <p>4. Late Repentance is seldome true Repentance; we never read of any that
Repented at last but one, that we should not presume; and yet one, that none
should despaire. <hi>August.</hi> For God giving now a call, and putting forth his voyce,
if thou wilt not heare, God may be not onely dumbe, never to call thee hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but deafe, never to heare thee call, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. And it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> just, that thou who
wilt not be at Gods command, to repent now, shalt finde that Repentance shall
be out of thy command hereafter.</p>
            <p>The like of forced Repentance, of such as be sicke or distressed, pretend a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
pray, promise, cry, vow, and what not? but not rising out of love,
but forced feare, their Feare is slavish and base, and so is their Repentance; and
so they grow worse in time. The Divell returnes with seven worse spirits; and
running away from God againe, God is gone farther then ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Meanes of <hi>Peters</hi> Repentance was,<note place="margin">Meanes of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> repentanc</note> the knowledge of his sinne,

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. The Cocke crowes the second time,<note place="margin">1. Externall. A second crow sometime ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</note> and by this crowing <hi>Peter</hi> is
wakened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why had this second crowing effect, and not the first? it was as loud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. So now unto us, that God will call men when he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>2. That he tyeth not himselfe to such meanes as he tyeth us unto.</p>
            <p>3. That we should looke beyond the meanes for the successe and blessing of
them.</p>
            <p>4. To note how farre a degree of sinne <hi>Peter</hi> was now entred into, who had
wonderfully grieved the spirit, and hardned his owne heart so far, as the former
admonition was lost upon him.</p>
            <p>We read of few of the children of God, but they have bin moved and wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the first crowing of the Cocke, as good <hi>David</hi> by the admonition of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than;</hi>
so <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. But to <hi>Peter</hi> the Cocke must crow againe, according to
Christs prediction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Comfort to painefull Ministers, who are the Lords Cocks, cry out and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62178:34"/>
crow against the sins of men, labour to awaken sinners, proclaime to them their
sinnes and danger, but they heare not, remember as little as <hi>Peter;</hi> no good
is done.</p>
            <p>What comfort have they, but that the Cocke may crow the second time and
be heard at one time or other? the Lord may let them see their labour not
lost; God hath his set times to bring things to passe. The time of <hi>Sauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
was when he was most furious; and this time we wait and pray for, to
men as furiously bent against Gods word and Gods Ministers, as <hi>Saul</hi> against the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To shew us where the fault is, that the word so little profiteth among
many; the fault was not in the Cocke at first that <hi>Peter</hi> remembred not himselfe,
but in himselfe; so when little good is done, the fault is not in the Preacher or
in the word, but in the hardnesse of thy heart.</p>
            <p>Was the the fault in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> let not the people go? was not
the fault in that <hi>Herod</hi> would not let go <hi>Herodias?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. In use of meanes still to depend on Gods blessing,<note place="margin">Pray for the Spirit to goe with the word.</note> that he would open
the ear, and accompany his word with his blessed Spirit; for the <hi>hearing eare is
from him, Job. 33. 14. God speakes once or twice, and one sees it not, till he open the eares of
men which were sealed, ver.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>God hath spoken not once, but a thousand times amongst you; but a number
of tuffe corruptions in the heart are like ear-wax which stops that the voyce can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter in.</p>
            <p>This is the cause that many are like the Fish in the Sea who lives in salt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but without all taste of Saltnesse.</p>
            <p>A setled ministry is like the salt of the earth under which many live without
any seasoning, because they neglect the higher teaching, even the spirit of truth
that must lead them into all truth, <hi>John.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Externall meanes to bring</hi> Peter <hi>to acknowledgement of his sin;</hi> Christs
looking backe upon him, non oculo exteriore, sed oculo clementiae.</p>
            <p>By this looking backe of Christ we must not conceive a bar turning of his face
or eye upon <hi>Peter,</hi> nor an extraordinary looke or countenance; for Christ also
set his eyes upon <hi>Judas</hi> when he came to apprehend him,<note place="margin">Christs looke what it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</note> and on <hi>Pilate</hi> sitting
ready to sentence him, and on the <hi>Jewes</hi> stoning him, who were never the better
by Christs looking upon them; but with his looke he adjoyned a gracious and
secret efficacy of his blessed spirit.</p>
            <p>The very lookes of Christ was a most real and effectual Sermon to <hi>Peters</hi>
heart; the tongue of Christ was now otherwise employed in defence of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and putting of the malitious accusations of the wicked <hi>Jewes;</hi> but the
eyes of Christ silently speake unto <hi>Peter</hi> after this manner; oh <hi>Peter</hi> dost thou
thus persist in denyall of me thy Lord? where is thy faith, thy fidelity, thy love,
thy great promises of not forsaking me? have I made thee of a poore Fisher, a
chiefe Follower of me to this end? is it not enough that thy eyes see me despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and refused among mine enemyes, but thou must also deny and refuse me?
oh <hi>Peter,</hi> these vex my Body, but thou my mind; thy unkindenesse is greater to me
then theirs, and thus the Lord might take up the complaint, <hi>Psal. 142. 4. I looked
on my right hand, and behold there was none that would know me, all refuge failed me, and none
cared for my Soule;</hi> he looked for no great helpe on his left hand among his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes;
for even his dearest friends and Disciples on his right hand failed him, and
knew him not.</p>
            <p>Note 1. <hi>Christ hath an eye of grace and favour for his People in all sad cases.</hi> I
have surely seen the affliction of my People in Egypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7. The eyes of the Lord run
to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to shew himselfe strong in the behalfe of them whose
heart is perfect towards him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
and his eares are open unto their cry, Psal 34. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas</hi> 1. His heart is upon them continually, and then no wonder if he have a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62178:35"/>
loving eye toward them;<note place="margin">Vbi amor, ibi oculus.</note> because, where the heart loves, the eye lookes, and is
loth to be taken off; as it was said of the Temple, 1 <hi>King. 9. 3. mine eyes and my
heart shall be there perpetually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Is there not a cause? <hi>Peters</hi> case in the Text tels us, that even a good Soule
needeth Christs looking to it, that so it may recover out of every fall, and stand
in termes of favour with God; all meanes else without a gracious aspect from
Heaven will never keep us tyte in the course of true piety.</p>
            <p>3. When all is well with the soule in respect of grace and gracious confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the will of God, yet there needs a good looke from Christ in respect of
sound comfort,<note place="margin">Psal. 63. 3.</note> which is the light and life of the Soule. <hi>The loving kindnesse of God
is better then life;</hi> and if <hi>he hide his face</hi> a little, the good Soule is soone troubled,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Which may marvelously chear and refresh the spirit of Gods people in
all sad cases, that go over them from time to time, and not onely in afflictions or
persecutions for righteousnesse sake, but in all their foyles and fals into sin,
wherewith their righteous soules are much troubled, and sometimes ready to
sinke into despaire; yet remember for your comfort, that <hi>the high and lofty One,
who inhabits eternity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 57. 15.</note> 
               <hi>lookes also unto him that is poore, and of a contrite Spirit, to revive
the heart of the contrite ones;</hi> and when such doe most put away comfort, as too
good for them, he will restore comforts <hi>to the Mourners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. If Christ have an eye to thee in all thy sad cases, doe thou ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to keepe thine eye open unto him,<note place="margin">Looke to Christ, as he to thee.</note> yea, both thine eyes.</p>
            <p>First, an eye of Faith, to wait for the gracious issue he will please to give
out of all thy trials: <hi>Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord;</hi> say with the Church
in their proverbial speech, <hi>In the Mount the Lord will see and be seene.</hi> What if the
visi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n stay beyond thy time in hastinesse prefixed for deliverance? yet in due
time it will speake, and not lye. Still therefore make use of thy Faith, which is
the evidence of things not seene, and the foundation of things hoped for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the eye of Obedience; still keepe close to him in Dutie, whether he
deliver or no; still have respect to all his commandements; remember how the
promise runs, to keep thee in thy wayes, and in these ways be sure he will take his
time, and the best time, to grant deliverance, or any mercy thou wantest. <hi>He is a
God of judgement, and waites to be gracious to his People, and blessed are they that in his owne
way waite for him, Isa.</hi> 30. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Lastly, if God have ever an eye of love to his People, then wo be to his
and their enemies; his eye of jealousie is set against them, to root out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> marching against <hi>Israel, Exod. 14. 24. The Lord looked on their
Host, and troubled them;</hi> So in <hi>Psal. 11. 6. 7. Vpon the wicked he shall raine snares, fire
and brimstone, and an horrible tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup;</hi> why? <hi>for the
righteous Lord loveth rightousnesse, his countenance doth behold the upright;</hi> it is time ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for such to humble themselvs before God and his people, and take the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
which <hi>Pilates</hi> Wife gave him; have thou nothing to doe against that just
man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note 2. Peter</hi> was now at a very low Water,<note place="margin">God sometime lets his be brought very low, before deliverance.</note> both in respect of sin and danger,
not knowing well which way to turne himselfe, and now his Lord lookes backe
upon him, so to turne the streame againe. <hi>The Lord many times lets his People be
brought into a very low estate, and then turnes their captivity for them.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Zachariah</hi> 3. 2. The state of godly men, is to be as <hi>brands pluckt out of the fire,</hi> mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

3. To set forth his mighty power which sets in when all meanes faile; <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>

of nature, nor Christ himselfe till the case was hopelesse after the third day, and
Disciples faith somewhat quailed.</p>
            <p>4. Sore crosses drive to God, and make us seeke him diligently, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 15.

            <p>
               <hi>Manasses</hi> out of Fetters would never seeke the Lord; that is the Lords season
to be found of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> will cry out of Deepes, and <hi>Moses</hi> at the red Sea, when there is no way

for ever, but departs for a season, that he might returne for ever; Nay his comforts
are the nearest, when affliction is at the height; as in the Body, the disease come to

but not before the disease have beene desperate; so here.</p>
            <p>

themselves, and even when <hi>Joseph</hi> must needs discover himselfe unto them after he
had long dissembled his affections.</p>
            <p>So the Lord seemes not to know us, when we are knowne well enough, and
hides his affections, when they yearne within him toward us, <hi>Psal. 9. 9. He is a
present refuge in time of affliction;</hi> he steps in to <hi>Abrahams</hi> comfort not till the third

whose helpe comes never too late, 2 <hi>King. 5. 11. Naaman</hi> would be cured by his

and touched and healed the Leprosie; and <hi>John 11. 32. Mary</hi> would have had
Christ there before her Brother was dead, as if now he had beene come too
late.</p>
            <p>But in these and such like examples we are taught to shut up our own eyes and
leave all to him who knowes times and seasons and meanes of our good.</p>

               <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Nothing can keepe God from his Elect,<note place="margin">Nothing can separate from and his love.</note> nor them from him; <hi>Peter</hi>
here was not onely in an exceeding strait of affliction, but led away in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and swallowed up in the quicke sands of a number of hainous sins; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lords, the Lord lookes on him, and fetches him out.</p>
            <p>The Belly of the whale could not keep <hi>Jonas</hi> from God, nor God from <hi>Jonas,</hi>
but he must deliver him againe.</p>
            <p>The hellish <hi>Behemoth</hi> may seeme to swallow up <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other of Gods
Children, but he must deliver him again.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Peters</hi> example, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. we see the strongest prison, watch, chaines, cannot
keepe the Lord from him, nor here a stronger prison and chaine of sin cannot
still bind him, but the Lords very look looseth him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> rescues the Sheep out of the mouth of the Lyon and Bear; the true <hi>David</hi>
rescues his out of the Divels jawes and mawes; death itselfe cannot keepe the
Elect from God, nor him from them, but at the second resurrection, the Grave,
the Sea, the fire, water, and all elements shal give up their dead to Christ; and even
not sin which is the death of the Soul, nor the Grave of sin which is continuance,
and rotting in it, shall still hold the Elect; but this first resurrection of grace
shall deliver them up to Christ, and give up their dead unto the life of
grace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which doctrine must not encourage to sin, but stir up to repentance and the
life of God, that thou mayest have some good testimony thereby of thy Election.</p>

               <hi>Secondly, The weighing the words of his Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE voyce of the Cocke not onely puts him in minde of his Masters words,
but moves him to bethinke himselfe better, as one that by wofull experience
begins to finde all true that his Master had said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> had heard his Master telling him of his weaknesse and frailty; but he
weighed not that word; he thinkes himselfe strong enough for all that; he had
heard his Masters word telling him that he should shamefully and suddenly, even
that night, deny him thrice; but he weighes not that word, he scornes to be
thought so wicked.</p>
            <p>But now weighing the words of his Master, he findes himselfe in a wofull case,
now he feeles the verity of his Masters prediction, the vanity of his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;
now he rates himselfe that he heard not the first Cocke, that he might
have prevented the fearfull fals he had taken; now the second crowing hath put
him in minde of the whole matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Not the hearing of the Word,<note place="margin">Due weighing of the Word, helpes out of sinne.</note> but the weighing of it makes it a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
meanes to helpe us out of sinne.</p>
            <p>A man may hear the Word a thousand times, as <hi>Peter</hi> heard the words of his
Master many times repeated; but without weighing and considering it, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
either prevent, or repent of any sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62178:37"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> heard the word of God well enough, but not well weighing it, was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
by the first temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. As meat never so good received into the stomack, if it be not retained
and digested into wholesome nourishment, is so far from profiting, as it is very
hurtfull; so the word never so powerfull, coming into the minde, if it be not
considered and weighed, goes as it comes, leaves no fruit of instruction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation;
but ordinarily more hardens and tends to condemnation.</p>
            <p>2. Not the hearing of the word makes it powerfull on the conscience, but the
weighing it; for let a man heare all the Sermons in the World, if he weigh not
the word of God in the Author of it, in the truth, in the eternity, in the necessity
of obedience unto it, he shall easily loosen himselfe from obedience, further then
himselfe listeth.</p>
            <p>But this consideration makes the word weighty in it selfe, and upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
that God whose word it is, will ever make it good on the godly in
mercy, on the wicked in justice and judgement.</p>
            <p>3. Is it onely weighing of the Word that makes sinne weighty and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some?
many remember their sins but weigh them not, and so carry them lighter
then a Feather; others remember them, and weigh them in false weights, or in
a false manner, or lay a false finger on the Scale; our owne judgement and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
affections are as false weights, or we favour our selves, or we would not
have our sins so heavy, so great, so damnable, though we be Sinners as other
men be.</p>
            <p>But if we weigh them in the ballance of the law, we shall find them weighty,
and exceed the Mountaines of the Earth, or in the curse of the Law, we shall find
them so heavy as they weigh us downe to Hell.</p>
            <p>Or in the Doctrine of the Gospell, the least of our sins so heavy, that it weighs
Christ out of Heaven or else the Sinner for ever.</p>
            <p>1. Resolve with <hi>David, Psal. 112. 15. I will meditate on thy precepts</hi> and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy wayes;<note place="margin">Ponder the Word heard or read.</note> he knew it is not hearing or knowing that discernes betweene
truth and falshood, but weighing and discerning in the ballance of sound
judgement.</p>
            <p>Why doth the Vsurer hold his sinnes, or the Drunkard, or the Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
&amp;c. not because they know not what is good, what is evil, or because he is
not taught, but he weighs not, nor considers the word of God; he weighs the
word in his false weights, and not his false wayes by the weights of the Word,
ballance of the Sanctuary; they weigh not the sinne in the sentence of the Law
nor by the bitter end, but present profit or pleasure.</p>
            <p>So, why doe men generally boulster themselves in all their sinnes, and embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
themselves against God and their duty, but because they weigh not the word?
they have promises, and God is mercifull, and Christ dyed for Sinners, &amp;c. but
weigh not to whom the promises belong, which are Childrens bread.</p>
            <p>As <hi>John</hi> said to one, what hast thou to doe with prayer, or with the promises?
God will not be mercifull to an obstinate Sinner; they weigh what God is, and
they weigh not themselves, what themselves are; God is a God of mercy, but
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all of mercy; Christ is a Lamb for meeknesse, but weigh it that he is a Lyon
also, and will tear in pieces all impenitent persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To comfort Ministers who see their Doctrine slightly regarded for the
present; many they have to heare, almost none consider, but see in <hi>Peter,</hi> that
an happy use may be made in time of things, which at first were heard care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly;
so the Disciples heard Christ often speake of his passion, of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and other articles of Religion; but heedlesly for the time, neither remembred
nor weighed, but after made more use of them; sometimes carelesse Hearers are
brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into as great streights as <hi>Peter</hi> here, and then they have time and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to weigh things better, and rate themselves for their unprofitable hearing.</p>

            <p>BY going forth is meant an utter forsaking of the place and company where

or tranquillity, but full of danger and feare and tumult, and not fit place for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>2. In respect of the company; he sees the longer he stayes among wicked men,
the more sinnes he heapes up against the Lord, and against his owne conscience,
and therefore he sees it high time to be gone.</p>
            <p>3. In respect of the businesse in hand;<note place="margin">Threefold bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse he had now to doe.</note> he is to bewaile his sin, to weepe bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>2. He truly sorrows that he doth it <hi>sine teste</hi> secret teares flowing from the
inward affection of his heart, frees his repentance from hypocrisie, in that it is not
done in respect of men, but onely in the sight of God and his Angels.</p>

a little leaven leavens the whole lump. How three Traytors in <hi>Corahs</hi>
Camp presently prevailes with two hundred and fifty Captaines, men of renown,
appeares in story; how one evill man may kindle an unquenchable fire in a
Towne, so evident as one plague soare may taynt a whole City or Kingdome;
one <hi>Achan</hi> enough to plague a whole congregation; how much more when a
Company of evill persons are knit together?</p>
            <p>2. As they are great Drawers to evill, so they are strong Resisters of good; the
darkenesse in them must needes fight against the light; what they can, they will
hinder, what they cannot hinder, they can scorne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> here durst not acknowledge him a man, whom among Disciples; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

            <p>3. Our owne inclination to evill makes it more dangerous; a little Pitch
will sticke to his fingers that toucheth it; <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Shittim</hi> will commit whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with the Daughters of <hi>Moab, Numb.</hi> 25. 1.</p>

               <hi>Joseph</hi> will sweare a little by the life of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh; Peter</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To avoyd evill company; thrust not into such company when we
need not, nor stay longer then needs must in such fellowship; for,</p>
            <p>1. He that will cleave to God, must sever from Gods Enemies; the same
grace that binds us to God, loseth us from the wicked; solitarinesse is better
then bad company.</p>
            <p>2. What comfort can a Sheep have among a Herd of Swine, which wallow
and tumble in foule lusts? or a silly Dove among a company of Ravens? how can
a good heart but grieve in their society whose sports and pleasures are in such
things as onely grieve the Spirit of God? how can a Christian solace himselfe
among such as care for none but brutish delights, in eating, drinking, sporting,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62178:38"/>
gaming, attended with swearing, rayling, drunkennesse and idlenesse? but to
speake of God, or of Religion, to discourse of sobriety, temperance, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and prayer, is to be unseasonable as Snow in Harvest; can a good heart be
glad among them who can never be merry till God and all thoughts of him be
shut out of doores?</p>
            <p>What comfort can a man have among a company of dead men, who as Ghosts
are moved by the Divell? no spirit of grace, no breath, or life of grace, but in
whom <hi>the Divell rules effectually;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> and the like comfort can the Childe of God have
among wicked men, dead in sin, and enemies to the life of God, ruled at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Satan.</p>
            <p>What safety among evill men, whether we respect themselves or their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
for themselves they are so poysonfull, so infectious, as we can hardly partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
with them in good things, and not be defiled; as with some persons we dare
scarce eate or drinke wholesome meat or drinke of the same cup, because of some
poysonful and infectious disease; we would not take a sweet flower from some
hand; so here.</p>
            <p>For their practices how just is it if we joyne our selves in their sins, that we
should not be disjoyned in their judgements? as they that stood with <hi>Corah</hi> were
all swallowed up together.</p>
            <p>4. This hath beene the practise of the godly, <hi>Psal. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. I have not haunted with
the wicked;</hi> for they know, blessednesse is promised to such as neither <hi>walke,</hi> stand
nor sit with them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
            <p>He that sees the mischiefe that hath befallen him by such company, will shake
them off.</p>
            <p>He that hath beene drawne to scorne godlinesse, to reforme godlinesse must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
such company.</p>
            <p>He that hath beene taught to sweare, lye, be drunke; to reforme, must avoyd
such company.</p>

               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. If we fall among,<note place="margin">Directions how to carry our selves in such company.</note> or be cast into such company, take some directions
how to carry our selves, which our Apostle here omitted.</p>
            <p>1. Enter not into their company, fashion not to them,
separate in
<list>
                  <item>Fashion and</item>
                  <item>Affection</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Lot</hi> among <hi>Sodomites,</hi> goe not to them, but let them come to thee; <hi>Peter</hi>
went to them, and so fell by them. <hi>Prov. 1 10. If Sinners entice, consent not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Consider, who thou art; <hi>Peter</hi> should have remembred himselfe to be a
Disciple, by grace separated from this gracelesse company; so thinke with thy
selfe; I am distinguished and severed from the world by grace of Adoption, and
a Son of God; oh what an honour to <hi>Peter,</hi> or for thee to shew thy selfe a Son
of God in the midst of a naughty generation?</p>
            <p>3. Look upon ungodly examples, to detest them, to grieve at the dishonour of
God, to grieve at the wickednesse of man made to the Image of God; how did
good <hi>Lot</hi> vex himselfe at the uncleane conversation of <hi>Sodome? 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>What a paine was it to <hi>David</hi> to see the transgressors? <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. And make this
use of it, to blesse God that thou art not so far given up, whose nature is as vile
as theirs.</p>
            <p>4. See them, to stop them if it be possible; if there be hope of doing good,
admonish them, 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 14. warne them that are unruly,</hi> warne them of the wrath
of God coming on them that do such things; win them, and pray for them and
their amendment.</p>
            <p>5. If there be no hope to win them, yet by thy godly carriage convince them,
checke them, confute, shut their mouthes.</p>
            <p>Let thy light shine in despite of their darkenesse, to glorifie thy Father; and at
least let them see thy watch and godly care to preserve thy selfe from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62178:38"/>
6. If thou hast beene a little tainted and drawn aside by them; go forth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
like <hi>Peter,</hi> and bewaile thy sin; to which sorrow of <hi>Peter</hi> now we come.</p>
            <q>And Peter wept bitterly.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>PETER,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of repentance it selfe see the tract.</note> as he had chosen a fit place, so he expressed his repentance by an
excellent token and signe of it, which is abundance of tears, both salt and dry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether is weeping alwayes true repentance for sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No;<note place="margin">Teares no certain signes of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> for then <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> had beene truly penitent; but where is true
sorrow, it will often wring out teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are not repentance it selfe, but an
effect of true repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether are teares necessarily required in sorrow for sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In true sorrow of sin must be allwayes a deep displeasure with himselfe,<note place="margin">Whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to true repentance.</note>
sighs and groanes of a broken and bleeding heart for the displeasure of God,
which is a supernatural motion of the heart.</p>
            <p>But as for that bodily and sensible motion of the heart, which produceth tears
and crying, it is always co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable where it is, but not always simply necessary;
for sundry things may hinder teares, and yet true sorrow be with dry cheeks; As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Abundance of griefe may stop teares; as a man may weepe for his
friend, and cannot at the death of his owne Son.</p>
            <p>2. Sometimes the constitution of the body will afford none, when the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heart desires to ease it selfe by them.</p>
            <p>3. Sometimes the Spirit of God supplyes joy and comfort in the midst of
their heavinesse which abates the sensible smart, although it abates not the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of our wils against sin, but enlargeth it.</p>
            <p>4. Teares proceed from many causes <hi>outward,</hi> as excessive joy, excessive sorrow,
anger, compassion; and in a word, both from fained repentance, and unfained,
as we may not count them among the infallible signes of true repentance and
sorrow for sin.</p>
