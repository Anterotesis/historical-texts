            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Narrative of the Proceedings at the Seſſions, <hi>February</hi> 26. 1678/9.</head>
            <p>THis Seſſions beginning in the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> 26 <hi>February,</hi> the firſt perſon brought to Tryal, was an unhappy Wench, whom the Devil had ſeduced to endeavour, to cover the filthy ſin of Fornication, with the Scarlet Mantle of Murder, having made away her own new-born Baſtard-Child, and in a very barbarous manner cut the Throat of it ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that the Head was almoſt ſeperated from the body, which being found ſo expoſed in an Alley near <hi>Biſhops gate ſtreet,</hi> and not far from the Priſoners dwelling, ſearch was made for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lyable to be ſuſpected; and amongſt the reſt ſhe charged, who at firſt denyed that ſhe had had any Child, at laſt confeſſed that, but not the whole truth: however, on full evidence, nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary here to be related, ſhe was found guilty.</p>
            <p>As were likewiſe a Man and a Woman for a Burglary, who broke into a poor Womans Houſe in the Evening, whilſt ſhe was gone to buy Candle, and upon her return, were taken in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, having removed ſeveral Goods, but carried none quite away, though narrowly prevented, for the Man-priſoner being by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion a Porter, was buſily preparing for their removal. As for the Woman, her Husband but the laſt Seſſions received the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Merits at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Woman whipt but the laſt Seſſions ſave one, was now Convicted for a Felony, ſtealing a parcel of Cloths out of an Houſe, but diſcovered before ſhe had quite ſecured the booty, and forc'd to drop them in the ſtreet, for which ſhe was Condemned.</p>
            <p>A Man coming to drink at an Ale-houſe in <hi>Birchin-lane,</hi> made ſuch uſe of his Art to convey away a Silver Tankerd, but ſcarce knowing what to do with it when he had it, gets a band-box, and putting the Tankard therein, goes to another Ale-houſe in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30898:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Finch-lane,</hi> where he was wholly a ſtranger, and gives the ſaid Box to the Gentlewoman of the Houſe, to lay up for him till he call'd for it; who perceiving ſomething in it to rattle, and the Box having neither Lock nor Seal, out of an innocent curioſity took up the Lid, where ſeeing a Tankard Inſcribed, with the Name and place of Dwelling of her Neighbour, ſhe ſent for him, and ſometime after the Priſoner calling for his Box, was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and now burnt in the hand, which he well deſerved, if we conſider either his wickedneſs in ſtealing, or his folly in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Theft.</p>
            <p>The ſame puniſhment was awarded another Man for the like offence of ſtealing a Tankard from an Houſe in <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> with whom was Indicted a Woman, but ſhe paſſing for his Wife, and ſo the Law favourably ſuppoſing what ſhe was concern'd in the Fact, to be by Coertion of her Husband, was acquitted.</p>
            <p>A young fellow coming to a Sempſtreſſes ſhop, pretended to buy Cravats, who ſhewed him ſeveral, and ſome Money he had bidden for two, which ſhe refuſing to except, he reſolved to have them cheaper, (though like to prove a dear bargain) for on a ſudden he betakes him to his heels, but ſhe crying out after him, he was quickly ſeized. In this caſe, becauſe he had the Goods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into his hand by the Proſecutor to look upon, ſome ſcruple was raiſed, whether the running away with them afterwards, was Felony; ſo that the Jury found the matter ſpecially, and 'tis left to be determined by the Judges.</p>
            <p>A bold Woman, that had lately been Servant to a Gentleman of Quality, having purloined a conſiderable quantity of his Plate, and being thereof fairly Convicted, was ſentenc'd to dye.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon, on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> a Lad belonging to a Ship, called the <hi>Laurence and Mary,</hi> lying below <hi>Wapping-dock,</hi> was Tryed for Killing one <hi>Tho. Young</hi> on board another Ship, called the <hi>Advance,</hi> lying hard by the former. The Priſoner was trying his skill in ſhooting at the Cat-head of his own ſhip as a Mark; but the Bullet glancing thereon, flew to the other ſhip, and through the boards of the great Cabbin, and there unhappily killed the ſaid <hi>Young,</hi> who was caſually come on board to ſee the Ship,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30898:3"/>
hitting him in the Forehead, that he preſently died; whereupon they that were with him running out on the Deck, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring who fired that Piece, the Priſoner own'd it, and preſently came on board of his own accord; declaring both then, and now at the Bar, his hearty ſorrow for the Miſchance: for as he had no malice, ſo could he not ever ſee the perſon dead, or thoſe that were with him, becauſe they were in the Cabbin as aforeſaid. However, it being adjudged an unlawful Act in him to ſhoot ſo negligently on the River, where ſo many Veſſels and People are continually paſſing, he was found Guilty of Manſlaughter, and carries a <hi>Memorandum</hi> in his Hand, to make him and others more wary for the future.</p>
            <p>The next was a baſe and horrid Cauſe, horrid in the pretenſions, and a ſin not to be named amongſt Chriſtians; and baſe in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, ſince nothing of that kind could be made appear. The perſon accuſed was a Man of good repute and competent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which 'tis feared was the firſt motive to the Proſecution, hoping to get a ſumm of Money out of him, rather than endure the diſgrace even of being charged or ſuſpected of ſuch an odious Crime. The Girl that pretended the wrong done her, being between 13 and 14 years of Age, told her Story very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently; but by her own ſhewing it appeared, that for 12 Weeks or upwards ſhe never ſpoke a word of it, and two Surgeons and a Midwife that had ſearch'd her, utterly confuted what ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged; beſides 'twas made out, that her Father would have compounded the buſineſs, but demanded 100 <hi>l.</hi> &amp;c. Upon all which Circumſtances, and many perſons of Repute juſtifying the Priſoners credit and converſation for many years without Blemiſh, he was thereupon acquitted by the Jury, and with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of his Innocence from the Court diſcharged, and the Girls Father ordered to give Security for his good Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>A Fellow at <hi>Stepney</hi> having one Night made an invaſion on an Hen-rooſt, and carried away captive about 18 of them, of which ſome were found at one of his Neighbours houſe, where he left
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30898:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, was for the ſame found Guilty of petty Larceny, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be Whipt. As alſo was another for ſtealing a laced Waſtcoat out of a Ship, which was ſound upon his Back.</p>
            <p>A Woman was Convicted of Felony, for robbing one in <hi>Hatton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden</hi> on the 2d of <hi>February.</hi> Having lately been Servant there, ſhe had obſerved where they uſed to lay the Key of their outward Door, when they went forth, and ſo comes with two of her Companions, goes into the houſe breaks open a Cloſet door and a Desk, and takes away 11 <hi>l.</hi> odde Money and a Sword, and ſo lockt the Street-door and go their way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but left behinde them a Chezil, which was proved to have been borrowed the ſame Afternoon by her in <hi>Fetter-lane:</hi> and that ſhe and two men did go forth together, aſſoon as ſhe had got that Tool, and were alſo ſeen at the Houſe where the Robbery was done.</p>
            <p>Two Rag-women were Indicted for ſtealing two Gowns and ſeveral other Wearing-cloaths, in the <hi>Strand.</hi> A Gentlewomans door being accidentally left open, there were ſeveral ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions againſt them, but no poſitive proof, ſo they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted on Thurſday in the forenoon.</p>
            <p>A perſon was Convicted for ſtealing two Livery Cloaks, and the ſeats out of two Coaches at <hi>Piccadilly,</hi> and being purſued, the Goods were taken in the ſame Room with him at <hi>Maribone.</hi> So was another for breaking open a Shop in <hi>Fetter-lane</hi> the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> and ſtealing one Beaver, and ſeveral other Hats, to the value of Ten pound; ſome of which were taken upon him in <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi> and therefore he was tryed by that Jury.</p>
            <p>A Wench, formerly a ſervant to a Waſherwoman in St. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets Weſtminſter,,</hi> had four Indictments brought againſt her for ſtealing of Linnen, ſome of which was the Waſherwomans own, but moſt of the parcels other peoples: The Priſoner acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe did pawn the things, but pretended it was done by the Dames order; and it did appear, ſhe had ſent her ſometimes with things to the Pawn-brokers, ſo that ſhe was cleared of three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments; but a Gentlewomans ſhift that her Miſtriſs waſht to, being found on her back, ſhe was on the fourth found guilty, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30898:4"/>
the value of ten pence, and ſo to be well whipt. As likewiſe were two Men for ſtealing a couple of Pigs at <hi>Wapping,</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing very ſorrowful for their Crime; which as they affirmed it to be the firſt, ſo they proteſted it ſhould be the laſt that ever they would be guilty of, in that or the like kind.</p>
            <p>A Woman Arraigned for breaking an Houſe in the day time, and ſtealing Goods, and that ſhe had confeſſed one put them out to her at an hole; denying now very confidently, that ſhe knew of, or was any way concern'd in the buſineſs; the Court of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den asking her, what the Womans Name was, that ſo flung the things out? to which, before ſhe was aware, ſhe replyed, <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo in effect own'd her own ſhare in the Fact; but the things being of no great value, 'tis like only to coſt her a whipping Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.</p>
            <p>But the moſt conſiderable Tranſactions of this day, were the Tryals of two moſt notorious Coiners and Clippers of Money; who upon full and plain Evidence, and their own Confeſſion at Bar, were found guilty of two Indictments of High-Treaſon apiece; and indeed, 'tis believed, they have not equals in that wicked Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in <hi>England.</hi> They ſtampt Groats, Nine-pences, Six-pences, Shillings, Half-Crowns, and Five-ſhilling pieces; no ſort came amiſs to them; and they had an Art to make a Nine-pence or Groat juſt new made, look as if it had been Coined theſe hundred years. Two Witneſſes ſwore directly againſt each of them, that they had ſeverally ſeen them at work, both Coining and Clipping, and produced great variety of the individual pieces, which they had ſeen paſs through their skill and handling. Their Inſtruments likewiſe, mixt Mettals, and other Utenſils taken in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Lodgings were publickly ſhown. They were both of a Gang, and confeſſed they had for ſome years been concerned in ſuch practiſes. The Witneſſes had been acquainted with them, and deſigning a diſcovery, ſeemed to comply with them, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with large Money, which firſt they would Clip, and with thoſe Clippings and baſer Mettals, Coin new Money, and then Clip that too to make it paſs with leſs ſuſpition. Four Five-ſhilling pieces they will afford for twenty ſhillings good Money,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30898:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and twenty ſhillings in Groats of their own Manufacture, for fifteen ſhillings Sterling; and one of them offered to teach one of the Witneſſes ſuch his Trade for ſix pound, and to make and ſell rare ſtamps for Coining, at Ten pound a pair. The matter was ſo evident, that they had nothing to ſay for themſelves, and ſo could not but be both found guilty by the Jury, of the ſeveral Crimes of Treaſon, wherewith they ſtood charged, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly condemn'd to be Drawn and Hang'd.</p>
            <p>Two honeſt 'men of <hi>Fulham</hi> were charged for ſtealing a Mare, but upon a long diſquiſition of the matter, it not appeared that the Mare in queſtion, was the ſame the Proſecutor loſt, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the contrary, that one of the Men at the Bar, had this Mare given him by a Worthy Gentleman in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> whereupon, they were acquitted. So likewiſe was a Woman of St. <hi>Martins in the fields</hi> Indicted for Murther, but by the Witneſſes it onely appeared, That as long ago as laſt Eaſter Holy-days, a fray happened between her and the party deceaſed, and that they were down together, but the Priſoner uppermoſt; that the ſaid party liv'd till ſince Chriſtmaſs, and then dyed, having been infirm, and as was aſſerted, troubled with a Dropſie.</p>
            <p>Three perſons were Convicted of Felony, for Robbing a Scotch-Merchant (or Pedlar) of above five pounds worth of Holland Callime, flaxen Stockings, &amp;c. in the night <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. at his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> three Men forced into his Chamber with drawn Swords, &amp;c. who took away the Goods, but underſtanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſome Pedlers were ſeen carry a bundle, he on enquiry got their Names, whom he followed, and at the Houſe of one of them, found part of his things, and hard by the Perſons, and on one of their legs, a pair of his Stockings, in anothers pocket his Tobacco-box, and a third confeſſed the Robbery; whereupon, being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted only in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> it was but a ſimple Felony, for which they eſcaped with a Brand; whereas in <hi>Kent</hi> it would have proved a Burghlary, which mexcy the Court minded them of, as a grand Argument to warn them from running into any future Crimes of that kind, ſince they are like no more to be indulged by any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:30898:5"/>
A complaint having been made, that a conſiderable ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had been extorted by ſome under Officers, from the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a perſon lately Executed, before they could obtain his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burie it, the Court was pleaſed to inquire thereinto, and nobly expreſſing their deteſtation of the inhumane practices of ſuch Vulters, as would make a prey even of Mens Carcaſſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled one that had received ſome of the Money, to refund it in their preſence, with farther marks of diſpleaſure threatned to be inflicted.</p>
            <p>There were in all fourteen burnt in the Hand, and nine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Die, <hi>viz.</hi> two Men for Treaſon, one Woman for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Man and a Woman for Burghlary, and four Women for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Houſe-breakings and Felonies, moſt of them having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been Whipt, burnt in the Hand, or received other chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet would take no warning.</p>
