         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> with my

Your Majeſty with the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

pleaſed with an Invention of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Benefit, that We cannot but with our
Humbleſt Duty, acknowledge your Gracious
Reception of it; However, as your Great
Wiſdom and Judgment is not eaſie to be
ſurpriz'd, and your Royal Approbation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known to be your haſty Act of Grace;
<pb facs="tcp:39078:3"/>
your Favour and Patronage was not fully
obtain'd, till with the ſtrictest Scrutiny you
had firſt examin'd thoſe Hopes and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
you vouchſaf'd to incourage in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</p>
            <p>But, when upon further conſideration, We
had obviated all Difficulties, and ſolv'd all
Objections againſt this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, (which
We hope will appear in this Printed Paper,)
your Majeſty was Graciouſly pleas'd to give
us your Approbation, and to Order us your
<hi>Letters Patents,</hi> which Grace and Favour,
ought to be, and is receiv'd by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s with the

and Gratitude.</p>
            <p>And if the Fruits of your Royal Grant
has not hitherto been deriv'd to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, 'tis
partly by ſome Obſtacles we met from the
ſuggeſtions of a private Perſon, but more
eſpecially by the late <hi>Horrid Conſpiracy,</hi>
when, not only our Loyal apprehenſions
for your Majeſties Danger, diverted our
Thoughts from all other Concerns, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
we judged it a part of our Duty not

<pb facs="tcp:39078:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 1.</hi> IF this <hi>Water</hi> can be made in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
quantities to ſerve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of
any Ship at Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> About Ninety Gallons may be Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in every Twenty four Hours by an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 33 Inches Diameter, which will ſtand
under the Deck of any Ship; and it's computed
that leſs than three Quarts is a good Allowance
for any man in that time: And if a large Ship,
wherein there are many men aboard, ſhould
require more Water, then two or more of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
may be had upon reaſonable Terms,
and one man may attend ſeveral of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 2.</hi> In caſe the Operation be by <hi>Fire, it</hi>
may require a Skilful <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> or one knowing
in ſuch Operations, to be on Board every Ship,
who will require great Wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:39078:5"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There will be no occaſion for any ſuch
Perſon, for any Sea-man may be Inſtructed in
an Hour or two to prepare this Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 3.</hi> It's probable that the <hi>Engine</hi> may be
frequently out of Order, and being ſo at Sea, where
Artificers and Tools are wanting to repair it, there
muſt neceſſarily follow want of <hi>Water,</hi> which
will be of Ill Conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This <hi>Engine</hi> is of ſuch Contrivance,
that it's never likely to be out of Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Can this <hi>Engine</hi> be of uſe in Stormy-weather?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Since a ſufficient quantity of Freſh-water
may be ſo eaſily had by this <hi>Engine,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
will be careful to make a good Proviſion
of it before-hand; however 'tis not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but it will anſwer the worſt Accidents of the
greateſt Storms, and have its Effect ſufficiently
in the worſt Weather, eſpecially conſidering
that in ſuch deſperate Extremities men muſt
be content with ſmaller Allowances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 5.</hi> The Operation being by <hi>Fire,</hi> it may
endanger the Ship, and the Smoak be very offenſive?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Engine</hi> may eaſily be placed in any
Ship without danger of <hi>Fire,</hi> or offence of Smoak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 6.</hi> Will not the Charge of this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Materials belonging to it be very great?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is difficult to make exact Anſwer to
this, but an Inſtrument of the largeſt Size, with
all the Materials belonging to it, will not amount
to above 18 pound, and may laſt many years,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39078:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and according to the Rates of Ships, they may
be proportion'd both in Bulk and Price. And
where it may be thought neceſſary to make uſe
of this Experiment on Shore, for Brewing, or
other uſes of a Family, Inſtruments and Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
may be very large, and very much cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on Shore, than at Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 7.</hi> Will not the Fewel be very Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and take up much room in the Ship?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The quantity of about ninety Gallons
of Water, may be prepared with leſs than three
pecks of Coals, and proportionably with any
other Fire; and the whole Room that will be
taken up in the Fire, and in the few Casks to be
imployed in the making and receiving this
Water, will be leſs than the tenth part of Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
now employed for Water onely, and upon
a ſtrict Computation made by the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in this Grant, the whole charge of Water
will come to leſs than an half penny <hi>per</hi> Gallon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 8.</hi> Will not the Ingredients take up much
Room, and be very Chargeable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> A Veſſel leſs then a Barrel may contain
enough of the Ingredients to carry a Ship to
the Eaſt <hi>Indies</hi> and back again; and the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
for near one hundred Gallons of this
<hi>Sea-water</hi> will not amount to above 12 Pence,
and will be cheaper when great quantities are
uſed at Land.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:39078:6"/>
                  <hi>Queſt. 9.</hi> Admitting this Preparation of Water
may be made, and in ſufficient Quantities, it may
be doubted whether it be wholſome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Famous Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
learnedly of this Subject, had not the leaſt
thought that the Sea-Water, after it had been
Diſ-ſalted, without any Noxious addition, was
Unwholeſome: and it neither now is, nor ever

               <p>Ships are often forc'd to leave their Anchors

               <p>TO give you a ſhort Account (ſuitable to the
little time I have to do it in,) of the
Tranſaction, which I ſuppoſe muſt have
given the riſe to the Mention made of my Name in
the publick <hi>Gazette,:</hi> I muſt inform you, that one
of my neareſt Relations, (Captain <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi>)
and ſome other Worthy Gentlemen, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his Majeſty, that They had an Invention
for making <hi>Sea-water</hi> ſweet and wholſom in great
quantity, and with ſmall Charge, and that I had
examin'd, and did approve the Water ſo prepar'd;
His Majeſty was pleas'd with very Gracious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
to command Me to attend him with a
further and more particular Information. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
readily obey'd this Order, and been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Objections the King thought fit
to make againſt the Practicableneſs of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, (tho a private Man had urg'd them,)
I ſhould think the moſt Judicious that have been
fram'd againſt it; I humbly preſented to him,
that I look't upon this Invention as Comprizing
two differing things; a <hi>Mechanical</hi> part, which
related to the Engine it ſelf, and the uſe of it a
Ship-board<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a <hi>Phyſical</hi> part which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39078:11"/>
the Potableneſs and Wholſomneſs of the Liquour.
About the former of theſe I did not pretend to
clear the Difficulties, eſpecially ſuch ſtrong ones, as
His Majeſty had propos'd; but left it to the <hi>Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi>
to give him Satisfaction, which they were in
a readineſs to offer. But as to the Wholſomneſs of
the prepar'd Water, I had made ſome Tryals upon
the Liquour, which gave me no juſt Grounds of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
it to be unwholſom, but ſeveral Motives
to believe it well condition'd, and of great uſe to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators,</hi>
and not to them only. And having here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
briefly acquainted His Majeſty with the chief
Tryals I had made to examin this <hi>Sweetned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
He was pleas'd to look upon them as Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and vouchſafed on that occaſion to Diſcourſe as a
<hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> of the Sea and Brackiſh-waters, and gave
me ſome new, as well inſtructive Obſervations about
them: and in concluſion, diſmiſs'd the <hi>Patentees</hi>
with a Gracious Promiſe of his Royal Protection,
and peculiar Favour.</p>
               <p>To this ſhort Narrative it now remains, that I
briefly Subjoyn the chief things that perſwaded me
of the Salubrity of this Water, (whence may be
juſtly and eaſily inferr'd, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility the Publick may
receive by a cheap and eaſie way of preparing it.)
Firſt, then I conſider'd that almoſt all the Rain-water
that falls from the Clouds on the Main Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and which (except perhaps in very few Places
in Torrid Climates) is unqueſtionably receiv'd as
wholſom, muſt be afforded by the Sea, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39078:11"/>
be but Sea-water freed from its Salt, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the famous Motto, <hi>Redit Agmine dulci.</hi>)
Next I found, (as his Majeſty himſelf had done,)
that the Liquour was well taſted, and without any
ſenſible Brackiſhneſs; and ſome of it continued for
between 4 or 5 Months in a large Chriſtal Bottle,
that I purpoſely kept unſtopt, and for the moſt part
in a <hi>South</hi> Window, where it neither did, nor
probably in a long time, will putrifie, or ſo much
as appear troubled or leſs tranſparent; during
which time, it was with Approbation taſted and
ſmell'd by ſeveral Learned Phyſicians of the famous
Colledge of <hi>London. Thirdly,</hi> I found it laver
very well, which moſt Pump-waters, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that have ſome little (tho unperceiv'd) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt in them, will not do. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will boyl Peaſe tender, which amongſt Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is one of the principal ſigns of good Water.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> In very good Ballances, with an Inſtrument
that I purpoſely caus'd to be made for the nice
weighing of Liquours, I found this Water far leſs
heavy than one would expect; for if it differ'd at
all in weight from the like quantity of undiſtill'd
Water, (I ſpeak with an <hi>If,</hi> becauſe it is far more
difficult to be exact in ſuch nice Tryals, than the
unpractic'd will imagine) the difference was not
conſiderable, being but one part in 400, and that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is very ſmall in compariſon of that which
<hi>Navigators</hi> and learned Authors relate to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in natural Waters, all of them good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

potable: I might tell you on this Occaſion, that the
laſt Great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who was an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and the Patron of the celebrated
<hi>Academy</hi> of the <hi>Lyncean Philoſophers,</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
among other prudent Courſes that he took
for his Health, whereof he was very Sollicitous, to
have conſtantly made uſe of diſtill'd <hi>Water,</hi> when
he us'd any <hi>Water,</hi> for his own Drinking. And
I could add other things favourable enough to the
<hi>Patentees Water,</hi> if Haſte, and perhaps Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too, did not oblige me to leave them yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
that I might now have time to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the main thing of all that convinced me
of the <hi>Saltleſsneſs</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> I ſpeak of. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
then, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> that the thing that was aim'd
at by thoſe <hi>ingenious</hi> men, that at differing times,
and in ſeveral Countries have attempted to make
Sea-water ſweet, and the thing that was requir'd
by propoſing Recompences, or otherwiſe to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Makers of ſuch Attempts, was to free the
Sea-water from the Brackiſhneſs without any noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Additament: ſo that on all ſides it was taken for
granted, that the only thing that kept the Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
from being ſafely Potable, was its Brackiſhneſs
From which reflection it was natural for Me to
infer a Concluſion very favourable to our prepar'd
Water. For having long ſince written a ſhort Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the <hi>Saltneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sea;</hi> I had been in
