         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> with my

Your MajeÅ¿ty with the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reducing <hi>Salt Water</hi>
into <hi>FreÅ¿h;</hi> your MajeÅ¿ty Å¿eem'd Å¿o well
pleaÅ¿ed with an Invention of that <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al
Benefit, that We cannot but with our
HumbleÅ¿t Duty, acknowledge your Gracious
Reception of it; However, as your Great
WiÅ¿dom and Judgment is not eaÅ¿ie to be
Å¿urpriz'd, and your Royal Approbation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
known to be your haÅ¿ty Act of Grace;
<pb facs="tcp:39078:3"/>
your Favour and Patronage was not fully
obtain'd, till with the Å¿trictest Scrutiny you
had firÅ¿t examin'd thoÅ¿e Hopes and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
you vouchÅ¿af'd to incourage in <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>s.</p>
            <p>But, when upon further conÅ¿ideration, We
had obviated all Difficulties, and Å¿olv'd all
Objections againÅ¿t this <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ndertaking, (which
We hope will appear in this Printed Paper,)
your MajeÅ¿ty was GraciouÅ¿ly pleas'd to give
us your Approbation, and to Order us your
<hi>Letters Patents,</hi> which Grace and Favour,
ought to be, and is receiv'd by <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>s with the
deepeÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e of our humble Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Gratitude.</p>
            <p>And if the Fruits of your Royal Grant
has not hitherto been deriv'd to <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>s, 'tis
partly by Å¿ome ObÅ¿tacles we met from the
Å¿uggeÅ¿tions of a private PerÅ¿on, but more
eÅ¿pecially by the late <hi>Horrid ConÅ¿piracy,</hi>
when, not only our Loyal apprehenÅ¿ions
for your MajeÅ¿ties Danger, diverted our
Thoughts from all other Concerns, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e
we judged it a part of our Duty not
to be preÅ¿Å¿ing on your MajeÅ¿ties GoodneÅ¿s,
or on your MiniÅ¿ters of State, in Å¿o Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a juncture of Affairs: But having now
<pb facs="tcp:39078:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
regained LeiÅ¿ure and Freedom after the
diÅ¿Å¿ipation of the greatest part of our Fears,
We preÅ¿ume a Å¿econd time to lay theÅ¿e En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

            <p>This Experiment is in a great degree
owing to the Eminent Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
well worthy Å¿o Ingenious a Promoter,
being Å¿o much the more the Favorite of his
happy <hi>Genius,</hi> as it is <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niverÅ¿ally uÅ¿eful to
Mankind; But whatever Advantages this
Country, or indeed the World, may receive
by it, his whole Ambition is bounded in the
publick Profit, contenting himÅ¿elf with no
other Benefit from it, than the Å¿atisfaction
and pleaÅ¿ure of Å¿eeing it accompliÅ¿h'd by his

            <p>The advantages in regard to <hi>Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
eÅ¿pecially in long Voyages, which are

               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 1.</hi> IF this <hi>Water</hi> can be made in Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
quantities to Å¿erve the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>Å¿es of
any Ship at Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> About Ninety Gallons may be Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in every Twenty four Hours by an InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 33 Inches Diameter, which will Å¿tand
under the Deck of any Ship; and it's computed
that leÅ¿s than three Quarts is a good Allowance
for any man in that time: And if a large Ship,
wherein there are many men aboard, Å¿hould
require more Water, then two or more of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments
may be had upon reaÅ¿onable Terms,
and one man may attend Å¿everal of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 2.</hi> In caÅ¿e the Operation be by <hi>Fire, it</hi>
may require a Skilful <hi>ChymiÅ¿t,</hi> or one knowing
in Å¿uch Operations, to be on Board every Ship,
who will require great Wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:39078:5"/>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> There will be no occaÅ¿ion for any Å¿uch
PerÅ¿on, for any Sea-man may be InÅ¿tructed in
an Hour or two to prepare this Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 3.</hi> It's probable that the <hi>Engine</hi> may be
frequently out of Order, and being Å¿o at Sea, where
Artificers and Tools are wanting to repair it, there
muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow want of <hi>Water,</hi> which
will be of Ill ConÅ¿equence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> This <hi>Engine</hi> is of Å¿uch Contrivance,
that it's never likely to be out of Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Can this <hi>Engine</hi> be of uÅ¿e in Stormy-weather?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> Since a Å¿ufficient quantity of FreÅ¿h-water
may be Å¿o eaÅ¿ily had by this <hi>Engine,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
will be careful to make a good ProviÅ¿ion
of it before-hand; however 'tis not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but it will anÅ¿wer the worÅ¿t Accidents of the
greateÅ¿t Storms, and have its Effect Å¿ufficiently
in the worÅ¿t Weather, eÅ¿pecially conÅ¿idering
that in Å¿uch deÅ¿perate Extremities men muÅ¿t
be content with Å¿maller Allowances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 5.</hi> The Operation being by <hi>Fire,</hi> it may
endanger the Ship, and the Smoak be very offenÅ¿ive?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> The <hi>Engine</hi> may eaÅ¿ily be placed in any

                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 6.</hi> Will not the Charge of this InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Materials belonging to it be very great?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> It is difficult to make exact AnÅ¿wer to
this, but an InÅ¿trument of the largeÅ¿t Size, with
all the Materials belonging to it, will not amount
to above 18 pound, and may laÅ¿t many years,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39078:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and according to the Rates of Ships, they may
be proportion'd both in Bulk and Price. And
where it may be thought neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make uÅ¿e
of this Experiment on Shore, for Brewing, or
other uÅ¿es of a Family, InÅ¿truments and Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
may be very large, and very much cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
on Shore, than at Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 7.</hi> Will not the Fewel be very Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and take up much room in the Ship?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> The quantity of about ninety Gallons
of Water, may be prepared with leÅ¿s than three
pecks of Coals, and proportionably with any
other Fire; and the whole Room that will be
taken up in the Fire, and in the few Casks to be
imployed in the making and receiving this
Water, will be leÅ¿s than the tenth part of Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
now employed for Water onely, and upon
a Å¿trict Computation made by the PerÅ¿ons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in this Grant, the whole charge of Water
will come to leÅ¿s than an half penny <hi>per</hi> Gallon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>QueÅ¿t. 8.</hi> Will not the Ingredients take up much

               <p>

               <p>Ships in long Voyages have been forc'd to
run many Leagues from their intended courÅ¿e,
which much retards their Voyage, and makes
them loÅ¿e fair Winds, and maintain more

they have occaÅ¿ion for; which inconveniencies
may be prevented by having Water within
themÅ¿elves.</p>
               <p>Ships are often forc'd to leave their Anchors

great quantities of FreÅ¿h Water are neceÅ¿Å¿ary,

               <p>TO give you a Å¿hort Account (Å¿uitable to the

TranÅ¿action, which I Å¿uppoÅ¿e muÅ¿t have

of my neareÅ¿t Relations, (Captain <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi>)
and Å¿ome other Worthy Gentlemen, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
his MajeÅ¿ty, that They had an Invention
for making <hi>Sea-water</hi> Å¿weet and wholÅ¿om in great
quantity, and with Å¿mall Charge, and that I had
examin'd, and did approve the Water Å¿o prepar'd;
His MajeÅ¿ty was pleas'd with very Gracious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions,
to command Me to attend him with a
further and more particular Information. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
readily obey'd this Order, and been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Objections the King thought fit
to make againÅ¿t the PracticableneÅ¿s of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, (tho a private Man had urg'd them,)
I Å¿hould think the moÅ¿t Judicious that have been
fram'd againÅ¿t it; I humbly preÅ¿ented to him,
that I look't upon this Invention as Comprizing
two differing things; a <hi>Mechanical</hi> part, which
related to the Engine it Å¿elf, and the uÅ¿e of it a
Ship-board<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and a <hi>PhyÅ¿ical</hi> part which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the PotableneÅ¿s and WholÅ¿omneÅ¿s of the Liquour.
About the former of theÅ¿e I did not pretend to
clear the Difficulties, eÅ¿pecially Å¿uch Å¿trong ones, as
His MajeÅ¿ty had propos'd; but left it to the <hi>Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi>
to give him Satisfaction, which they were in
a readineÅ¿s to offer. But as to the WholÅ¿omneÅ¿s of
the prepar'd Water, I had made Å¿ome Tryals upon
the Liquour, which gave me no juÅ¿t Grounds of Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pecting
it to be unwholÅ¿om, but Å¿everal Motives
to believe it well condition'd, and of great uÅ¿e to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators,</hi>
and not to them only. And having here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
briefly acquainted His MajeÅ¿ty with the chief
Tryals I had made to examin this <hi>Sweetned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
He was pleas'd to look upon them as Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and vouchÅ¿afed on that occaÅ¿ion to DiÅ¿courÅ¿e as a
<hi>VirtuoÅ¿o,</hi> of the Sea and BrackiÅ¿h-waters, and gave
me Å¿ome new, as well inÅ¿tructive ObÅ¿ervations about
them: and in concluÅ¿ion, diÅ¿miÅ¿s'd the <hi>Patentees</hi>
with a Gracious PromiÅ¿e of his Royal Protection,
and peculiar Favour.</p>
               <p>To this Å¿hort Narrative it now remains, that I
briefly Subjoyn the chief things that perÅ¿waded me
of the Salubrity of this Water, (whence may be
juÅ¿tly and eaÅ¿ily inferr'd, the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>tility the Publick may
receive by a cheap and eaÅ¿ie way of preparing it.)
FirÅ¿t, then I conÅ¿ider'd that almoÅ¿t all the Rain-water
that falls from the Clouds on the Main Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and which (except perhaps in very few Places
in Torrid Climates) is unqueÅ¿tionably receiv'd as
wholÅ¿om, muÅ¿t be afforded by the Sea, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39078:11"/>
be but Sea-water freed from its Salt, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the famous Motto, <hi>Redit Agmine dulci.</hi>)
Next I found, (as his MajeÅ¿ty himÅ¿elf had done,)
that the Liquour was well taÅ¿ted, and without any
Å¿enÅ¿ible BrackiÅ¿hneÅ¿s; and Å¿ome of it continued for
between 4 or 5 Months in a large ChriÅ¿tal Bottle,
that I purpoÅ¿ely kept unÅ¿topt, and for the moÅ¿t part
in a <hi>South</hi> Window, where it neither did, nor
probably in a long time, will putrifie, or Å¿o much
as appear troubled or leÅ¿s tranÅ¿parent; during
which time, it was with Approbation taÅ¿ted and
Å¿mell'd by Å¿everal Learned PhyÅ¿icians of the famous
Colledge of <hi>London. Thirdly,</hi> I found it laver
very well, which moÅ¿t Pump-waters, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that have Å¿ome little (tho unperceiv'd) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt in them, will not do. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>Fifthly,</hi> In very good Ballances, with an InÅ¿trument
that I purpoÅ¿ely caus'd to be made for the nice
weighing of Liquours, I found this Water far leÅ¿s
heavy than one would expect; for if it differ'd at
all in weight from the like quantity of undiÅ¿till'd
Water, (I Å¿peak with an <hi>If,</hi> becauÅ¿e it is far more
difficult to be exact in Å¿uch nice Tryals, than the
unpractic'd will imagine) the difference was not
conÅ¿iderable, being but one part in 400, and that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is very Å¿mall in compariÅ¿on of that which

<hi>Academy</hi> of the <hi>Lyncean PhiloÅ¿ophers,</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
among other prudent CourÅ¿es that he took
for his Health, whereof he was very Sollicitous, to
have conÅ¿tantly made uÅ¿e of diÅ¿till'd <hi>Water,</hi> when
he us'd any <hi>Water,</hi> for his own Drinking. And
I could add other things favourable enough to the
<hi>Patentees Water,</hi> if HaÅ¿te, and perhaps DiÅ¿cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too, did not oblige me to leave them yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
that I might now have time to Å¿ay Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the main thing of all that convinced me
of the <hi>SaltleÅ¿sneÅ¿s</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> I Å¿peak of. I conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
then, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> that the thing that was aim'd
at by thoÅ¿e <hi>ingenious</hi> men, that at differing times,
and in Å¿everal Countries have attempted to make
Sea-water Å¿weet, and the thing that was requir'd
by propoÅ¿ing Recompences, or otherwiÅ¿e to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Makers of Å¿uch Attempts, was to free the
Sea-water from the BrackiÅ¿hneÅ¿s without any noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Additament: Å¿o that on all Å¿ides it was taken for
granted, that the only thing that kept the Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
from being Å¿afely Potable, was its BrackiÅ¿hneÅ¿s
From which reflection it was natural for Me to
infer a ConcluÅ¿ion very favourable to our prepar'd
Water. For having long Å¿ince written a Å¿hort DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e
