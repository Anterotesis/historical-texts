            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Chronology.</head>
            <p>IN the first year of King <hi>Charls</hi> his Reign, a Parliament being called at <hi>Oxford,</hi> two Subsidies were granted, no grievances removed, but the said Parliament soon dissolved. The sad effects which the dissolution of this Parliament produced, were the losse of <hi>Rochel,</hi> by the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py help of <hi>Englands</hi> ships. The diversion of a most facile and hopeful war from the <hi>West Indies,</hi> to a most expensive and succeslesse attempt on <hi>Cales.</hi> The attempt on the Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> and thereby a precipitate breach of peace with <hi>France,</hi> to our great losse. A peace concluded with <hi>Spain,</hi> without consent of Parliament, contrary to a promise formerly made to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by King <hi>James,</hi> a little before his death; whereby the cause of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was altogether most shamefully deserted by us. The Kingdome suddenly billetted with Souldiers, and a concomitant project set on foot for <hi>Germane</hi> Horses, to force men by fear to fall before arbitrary and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Taxations, continually to be laid upon them.</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Parliament.</hi> The dissolution of a second Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the second year, after a declarative grant of no lesse then five Subsidies, and the sad issues that flowed to the Kingdom thereupon. As first, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent exacting from the people that mighty sum of the five Subsidies, or a sum equal to it by a Commission for a Royal Loan. Many worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen imprisoned and vexed, that refused to pay it. Great sums extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Privy Seals and Excises, and the most hopeful Petition of Right blasted.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> A third Parliament called, and quickly broken in the fourteenth year of the King, the best Members clapt up close Prisoners, denied all ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and extraordinary comforts of life; and so that Parliament was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Opprobrious Declarations published to asperse the proceedings of the last Parliament, yea Proclamations set out to those effects, thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly to dishearten the Subjects, yea, and plainly forbidding them once to name a Parliament, or to desire them any more. Whence immediately gushed out the violent inundations of mighty sums of money, got by that strange project of Knight hood, yet under a colour of Law. The most bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome Book of Rates, the unheard of Taxation of Ship-money, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of Forrests, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the injurious Taxation of Coat and Conduct money, the forcible taking away of the Trained Bands Arms, ingrossing Gunpowder into their hands in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The destruction of the Forrest of <hi>Dean,</hi> which was sold to Papists,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53654:3"/>

They refusing of them, were called and counted Rebels and Traytors; yea, so proclaimed in all Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was also raised to oppresse and suppresse them. A mighty and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous rising of Apprentices and young men in <hi>Southwark</hi> and <hi>Lambeth</hi> side, with Clubs and other weapons, especially at the Arch Bishops house, which put him in such a fright, as made him flye to <hi>Croyden,</hi> to convey himselfe to some more private and remote place: And although <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Magicians were so honest, that at the sight of the dust of the earth turned into lice, they cryed out, <hi>It was the finger of God</hi>; but he grew more and more outragious, and caused one to be hanged and quartered, and his head set on <hi>London</hi>-Bridge, who said at his execution, he came there by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and he must dye.</p>

            </p>
            <p>4 <hi>Parliament.</hi> A fourth Parliament was thereupon shortly after called again, by those complotters means, but to a very ill intent,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53654:4"/>
and another Parliament summoned also at the same time by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> both of them only to levy and procure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to raise another Army, and wage a new War against the <hi>Scots.</hi> The Ships and Goods of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were in all parts and Ports of this Land, and of <hi>Ireland</hi> also, surprized and seized on for the King, their Commissioners denied audience to make their just Defence to the King, and the whole Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> too, hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much distracted and distempered with levying of moneys, and imprisoning all amongst us that refused the same. This Parliament also refusing to comply with the King, <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Strafford,</hi> in this Episcopal War against the <hi>Scots,</hi> was soon dissolved and broken up by them, and thereupon they returned to their former wayes of wast and confusion, and the very next day after the Dissolution thereof, some eminent Members of both Houses had their Chambers and Studies, yea their Cabinets, and very pockets of their wearing Cloaths (betimes in the morning, before they were out of their Beds) searched for Letters and Writings, and some of them impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and a false and most scandalous Declaration was published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the House of Commons in the Kings Name.</p>
            <p>A Forced Loan of money was attempted in the City of <hi>London,</hi> to be made a president (if it prevailed there) for the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but some Aldermen refusing, were sorely threatned and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned. In which interim, the Clergies Convocation continuing, (notwithstanding the Dissolution of the Parliament) New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science oppressing Canons were forged, and a strange <hi>Oath</hi> with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in it was framed for the establishing of the Bishops Hierarchy with severe punishments on the refusers to take it.<q>

Contribution to forward that intended War against <hi>Scotland.</hi> For the advancing of which said sums for this War, the Popish were most free and forward; yea, and a solemn Prayer was composed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Bishops on their Ministers every where, to be used and read in all Churches, against the <hi>Scots,</hi> as Rebels and Traytors. The Papists also in a high measure enjoyed even almost a total Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and a <hi>Popes Nuncio</hi> suffered amongst us to act and govern all Romish affairs, yea a kind of private Popish Parliament kept in the Kingdome, and Popish Jurisdictions erected among them. Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners were also (secretly) issued out for some great and eminent Papists, for Martial Commands, for levying of Souldiers, &amp; strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their party with Arms and Ammunition of all sorts, and in great plenty. His Majesties Treasure was by these means so extreamly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, and his Revenues so anticipated, that he was forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell (as it were) his owne Servants, Judges, and Officers of all sorts, to lend him great sums of money, and Prisons filled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusers of these and the other illegall payments; yea many High-Sheriffs summoned in the Star-Chamber, and to the Councel board, and some of them imprisoned for not being quick enough in levying of Ship-money, and such like intolerable Taxations.</p>
            <p>In sum, the whole Land was now brought into a lamentable and languishing condition, of being most miserably bought and sold to any that could give and contribute most of might and malice against us, and no hope of humane help, but dolour, desperation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to be the portion of all. In which interim, the <hi>Scots</hi> being entred our Kingdome for their own defence, the King had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Royal-Standard at <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the cream of the Kingdom, Nobles and Gentry being assembled, and a Treaty betwixt the prime of both Armies had at <hi>Rippon,</hi> for a fair and peaceable accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the King was, at last, inforced to take his Nobles Councel, and in the first place a cessation of Arms agreed on, and then a fifth Parl. was necessitously resolved on to begin, <hi>Nov:</hi> 3. 1640.</p>

                  <p>LIberty being that which in all times hath been; but especially now is the condition, the aime and desire of all men, common reason shews that Kings lesse then any should endure captivity, yet I call God to witnes with what patience I have endur'd a tedious restraint, which so long as I had any hopes that this sort of my suffering might conduce to the peace of these three Kingdomes, or the hindring of more effusion of blood, I did willingly undergo, but now finding by too certain proofs, that this my continued patience would not only turn to my personall ruine, but likewise be of much more prejudice to the furtherance of the publick good, I thought I was bound as well by naturall as politicall Obligations, to seek my safety, by reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my selfe for some time from publick view both of my friends and enemies; and I appeal to all indifferent men to judge, if I have not cause to free my selfe from the hands of those who change their principles with their condition, and who are not ashamed openly to intend the destruction of the Nobility, by taking away their Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voyce, and with whom the Levellers doctrine is rather counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced then punished; and as for their intentions to my person, their changing and putting more strict Guards upon me, with the discharging most of all the servants of mine, who formerly they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to wait upon me, do sufficiently declare: nor would I have this my retirement mis-interpreted, for I shall earnestly and unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly endeavour the setling of a safe &amp; well grounded peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am or shall be, and that (as much as may be) without the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of more Christian blood, for which how many times have I prest to be heard, and yet no ear given to me; and can any reasonable man think (according to the ordinary cours of affairs) there can be a setled peace without it, or that God will bles those that refuse to hear their own King? surely no, I must further add that (besides what concerns

                           <date>Jan. 30. 1648.</date>
                        </head>
                        <p>I Shall be very little heard of any body here, I shall therefore speak a word unto you here; indeed I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think that holding my peace would make som men think that I did submit to the guilt as well as to the punishment; but I think it is my duty to God first, and to my Countrey, for to clear my self both as an honest man, and a good Christian. I shall begin first with my innocency, in troth, I think it not very needfull for me to insist long upon this, for all the world knowes I never did begin a War with the two Houses of Parliament, and I call God to witnesse, to whom I must shortly make an account, that I never did intend for to incroach upon their priviledges, they began upon me, it was the Militia they began upon, they confest that the Militia was mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from me; and to be short, if any body will look to the dates of Commissions, both theirs and mine and likewise to the Declarations, will see cleerly that they began these unhappy troubles, not I, so that as for the guilt of these enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes that are laid against me, I hope in God that God will clear me of it, I will not, I am in charity; God forbid that I should lay it upon the two Houses of Parl. there is no necessity of either, I hope they are free of this guilt; for I doe beleeve that ill instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between them and me, ha's been the cause of all this blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53654:15"/>
so that by way of speaking, as I find my selfe clear of this, I hope (and pray God) that they may too: yet for all this, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I should be so ill a Christian, as not to say that Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are just, upon me, many times he does pay justice by an unjust sentence, that is ordinary; I will onely say this. <hi>That an unjust Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me</hi>; that is, so far I have said, to shew you that I am an innocent man.</p>
                        <p>Now for to shew you that I am a good Christian, I hope there is a good man <hi>(pointing to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Juckson)</hi> that will bear me witnesse that I have forgiven all the world, and those in particular that have been the chief causers of my death, who they are God knowes, I doe not desire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity must goe further, I wish that they may repent, for indeed they have committed a great sin in that particular, I pray God with Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this be not laid to their charge; nay, not onely so, but that they may take the right way to the peace of the Kingdome: So (Sirs) I doe wish with all my soule, and I doe hope (there is some here will carry it further) that they may endeavour the peace of the Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>Now (Sirs) I must shew you how you are out of the way, and will put you in a way; first, you are out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conquest, certainly this is in an ill way, for Conquest (Sir) in my opinion is never just, except there be a good just Cause, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for matter of wrong, or just Title, and then if you goe beyond it, that makes it unjust at the end that was just at first: But if it be onely matter of Conquest, then it is a great Robbery, as a Pirate said to <hi>Alexander, That He was the great Robber, he was but a petty Robber</hi>; and so, Sirs, I doe think the way you are in, is much out of the way. Now Sir, for to put you in the way, believe it, you will never doe right, nor God will never prosper you, untill you give God his due, the King his due, (that is, my Successors) and the people their due, I am as much for them as any of you: You must give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church (according to his Scriptures) which is now out of order, for to set you in a way particularly now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but onely this, a Nationall Synod freely called, freely debating among themselves, must settle this; when that every Opinion is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cleerly heard.</p>
                        <p>For the King indeed I will not, the Lawes of the Land will cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instruct you for that; therefore, because it concernes my owne particular, I only give you a touch of it.</p>
                        <p>For the people, and truly I desire their liberty and freedome as much as any body whomsoever; but I must tell you, that their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53654:16"/>
and their Freedome consists in having of Government; those Lawes, by which their life and their goods may be most their owne. It is not for having share in Government (Sir) that is nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to them, a Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things, and therefore until they doe that, I mean, that you doe put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that Liberty as I say, certainly they will never enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p>Sirs, it was for this that now I am come here: If I would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way to an Arbitrary way, for to have all Lawes changed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) <hi>That I am the Martyr of the people.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In troth Sirs, I shall not trouble you much longer; for I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say this to you, that in truth, I could have desired some little time longer, because that I would have put this that I have said in a little more order, and a little better digested then I have done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope you will excuse Me.</p>
                        <p>I have delivered my conscience, I pray God, that you do take those courses that are best for the good of the kingdom, and your own Salvation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Biship of</hi> London <hi>minding him to say somthing concerning his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>King.</hi> I thank you very heartily (my Lord) for that, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgotten it. In troth Sirs, my Conscience in Religion, I think, is very well known to all the world, and therefore I declare before you all, <hi>That I die a Christian, according to the profession of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as I found it left me by my Father, and this honest man I thinke will witnesse it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then turning to the Officers, said,</hi> Sirr, excuse me for this same, I have a good cause, and I have a gracious God, I will say no more. Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Col. <hi>Hacker,</hi> he said, Take care that they doe not put me to paine, and Sir, this and it please you. But then a Gentleman coming neer the Ax, the King said, take heed of the Ax, pray take heed of the Ax. Then the King speaking to the Executioner, said, I shall say but very short prayers, and when I thrust out my hands — Then the King called to Dr Iuxon for his night cap, and having put it on, he said to the Executioner, does my haire trouble you, who desired him to put it all under his Cap, which the King did accordingly, by the help of the Executioner and the Bishop, then the King turning to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Juxon,</hi> said, I have a good Cause, and a gracious God on my side.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jaxon,</hi> There is but one stage more, this stage is turbulent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, it is a short one, but you may consider it will soone carry you a very great way, from Earth to Heaven, and there you shall find a great deale of cordiall joy and comfort.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53654:16"/>
                           <hi>King.</hi> I goe from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banc can be</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Then the King took off his Cloak and his George, giving his George to</hi> Dr. Juckson, <hi>saying Remember, 'tis thought for the Prince, and some other small Ceremonies past, after which, the King stooping down, laid his neck upon the blocke, after a very little pause, stretched forth his hands, the Executionr at one blow severed his head from his Body, his Body was put in a Coffin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with black Velvet, and removed to his Lodging Chamber at</hi> White-Hall.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>I Think it is truly not very necessary for me to speak much, there are many Gentlemen and Souldiers there that see me, but my voyce truly is so weak, so low, that they cannot hear me, neither truly was I ever at any time so much in love with speaking, or with any thing I had to expresse, that I took delight in it; yet this being the last time that I am to doe so, by a Divine providence of Almighty God, who hath brought me to this end justly for my sins; I shall to you, Sir, <hi>Master Sheriff,</hi> declare thus much, as to the matter that I am
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53654:17"/>
now to suffer for, which is as being a Traytor to the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi>: Truly Sir, it was a Countrey that I equally loved with my owne, I made no difference, I never intended either the generality of its prejudice, or any particular mans in it; what I did was by the Command of the Parliament of the Countrey where I was borne, whose Command I could not disobey, without running into the same hazard there, of that condition that I now am in.</p>
                        <p>It pleased God so to dispose that Army under my Command, as it was ruined; and I, as their Generall, cloathed with a Commission, stand here, now ready to dye; I shall not trouble you, with repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Plea, what I said in my owne Defence at the Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, my self being satisfied with the Command that is laid upon me, and they satisfied with the justnesse of their procedure according to the Lawes of this Land. God is just, and howsoever I shall not say any thing as to the matter of the Sentence, but that I doe willingly submit to his Divine providence, and acknowledge that very many wayes I deserve even a worldly punishment, as well as hereafter, for we are all sinfull, Sir, and I a great one; yet for my comfort, I know there is a God in Heaven that is exceeding mercifull, I know my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer fits at his right hand, and am confident (clapping his hand on his brest) is mediating for me at this instant, I am hopefull thro his free grace, and all-sufficient merits, to be pardoned of my sins, and to be received into his mercy, upon that I rely, trusting to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the free grace of God through Jesus Christ: I have not been tainted in my Religion I thank God for it, since my infancy, it hath been such as hath been profest in the Land, and established, and now it is not this Religion or that Religion, nor this or that fancy of men that is to be built upon, it is but one that's right, one that's sure, and that comes from God, Sir, and in the free grace of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Sir, there is truly somewhat that (<hi>he then observing the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>) had I thought my Speech would have been thus taken, I would have digested it into some better method then now I can, and shall desire these Gentlemen that doe write it, that they will not wrong me in it, and that it may not in this manner be published to my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, for truly I did not intend to have spoken thus when I came here.</p>
                        <p>There are, Sirs, terrible aspersions that have been laid upon my self, truly such, as I thank God, I am very free from; as if my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; intentions had not been such as they were pretended for, but that notwithstanding what I pretended it was for the King, there was nothing lesse intended then to serve him in it. I was bred with him for many years; I was his domestick servant, and there was nothing declar'd by the Parl. that was not really intended by me; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in it I ventured my life one way, and now I lose it another way:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53654:18"/>
and that was one of the ends, as to the King; I speak only of that, because the rest ha's many particulars; and to clear my self from so horrid an aspersion as is laid upon me: neither was there any other designe known to me by the incoming of that Army, then what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Declaration published. His person, I doe professe, I had reason to love as he was my King, and as he had been my Master: It hath pleased God now to dispose of him, so as it cannot be thought fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ttery to have said this, or any end in me for the saying of it, but to free my self from that Calumny which lay upon me: I cannot gain by it, yet Truth is that which we shall gain by for ever.</p>
                        <p>There hath been much spoken, Sir, of an invitation into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it's mentioned in that Declaration, and truly to that I did and doe remit my self: and I have been very much laboured for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of these inviters; 'tis no time to dissemble, how willing I was to have served this Nation in any thing that was in my power, is known to very many honest, pious, and religious men, and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I would have been to have done what I could to have served them, if it had pleased them to have preserved my life, in whose whose hands there was a power: They have not thought it fit, and so I am become unusefull in that which willingly I would have done. As I said at first (Sir) so I say now concerning that point, I wish the Kingdome happinesse, I wish it peace, and truly Sir, I wish that this blood of mine may be the last that is drawn: and howsoever I may perhaps have some reluctancy with my self, as to the matter of my suffering, for my Fact, yet I freely forgive all, Sir, I carry no ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour along with me to my Grave, his will be done that ha's created both Heaven and Earth, and me a poor miserable sinfull Creature now speaking before him. For me to speak, Sir, to you of State bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and the Government of the Kingdom, or my opinion in that, or for any thing in that nature, truly it is to no end, it contributes nothing: My owne inclination hath been to peace, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it is known to many, that I never was an ill instrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his people; I never acted to the prejudice of the Parl. I bore no Arms, I medled not with it, I was not wanting by my prayers to God Almighty for the happinesse of the King; and truly I shall pray still, that God may so direct him, as that may be done w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shall tend to his glory, and the peace and happinesse of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</p>
                        <p>For my Religion, that which I said was the established Religion, and that which I have practiced in my own Kingdome where I was born and bred; my Tenets they need not to be exprest, they are known to all and I am not of a rigid opinion; many godly men there are that may have scruples which doe not concerne me at all at no time; they may differ in opinions, and more now then at any time;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53654:18"/>
differing in opinion does not move me (not any mans) my owne is clear: Sir, the Lord forgive me my sins, and I forgive freely all those that even I might as a worldly man, have the greatest animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity against; We are bidden to forgive, Sir 'tis a Command laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us (and there mentioned) <hi>Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then the Earl turning to the Executioner, said, Shall I put on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Cap? Must this haire be turn'd up from my Neck? There are three of my Servants to give satisfaction; he also asked him which way he would have him lye.</p>
                        <p>The Executioner pointing to the front of the Scaffold, the Earl replyed, what, my head this way?</p>
                        <p>After a little discourse in private with some of his Servants, he kneeled downe by the side of the Scaffold and prayed a while to himselfe.</p>
                        <p>Then with a chearfull and smiling countenance (embracing Dr. <hi>Sibbalds</hi>) he said, truly Sir I doe take you in mine arms, and truly, I blesse God for it, I doe not fear, I have an assurance that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here (laying his hand upon his heart) now that gives me more true joy then ever I had. I passe out of a miserable world, to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eternall and glorious Kingdome; and Sir, though I have been a most sinfull creature, yet Gods mercy I know is infinite, and I bless my God for it, I goe with so clear a conscience that I know not the man I have personally injured.</p>
                        <p>Then imbracing those his Servants which were there present, said to each of them, You have been very faithfull to me, and the Lord blesse you.</p>
                        <p>And so turning himselfe to the Executioner, he said, I shall say a very short prayer unto my God, while I lye downe there, and when I stretch out my hand (my right hand) then Sir, doe your duty, and I doe freely forgive you, and so I doe all the world.</p>
                        <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> said to the Executioner, Must I lye all along, he answered, yes, and 't please your Lordship. Then he said, when I stretch out my hands— but I will fit my head, first tell me if I be right, and how you would have me lye, and being told he must lye a little lower, he said,</p>
                        <p>Well, stay then till I give you the signe. And so having laine a short space devoutly praying to himselfe, he stretcht out his right hand, whereupon the Executioner at one blow severed his head from his body, which was received by two of his Servants then knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by him, into a Crimson Taffety Scarfe, and that with the body immediately put into a Coffin brought upon the Scaffold for that purpose, and from thence conveyed to the House that was Sir <hi>John Hamilton's</hi> at the Mews.</p>

                        <head>The Speech of the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> upon the Scaffold.</head>
                        <p>IT is to no purpose (I think) to speak any thing here, which way must I speak? and then being directed to the front of the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he (leaning over the raile) said, I think it is fit to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, since God hath called me to this place.</p>
                        <p>The first thing which I must professe, is, what concerns my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and my breeding, which hath been in a good Family, that hath been ever faithfull to the true Protestant Religion, in the which I have been bred, in the which I have lived, and in the which by Gods grace and mercy I shall dye.</p>
                        <p>I have not lived according to that Education I had in that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where I was borne and bred: I hope God will forgive me my sins, since I conceive that it is very much his pleasure to bring me to this place for the sins that I have committed.</p>
                        <p>The cause that hath brought me hither, I believe by many hath been much mistaken, They have conceived that I have had ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to the State, and to the Kingdome, truly I look upon it as a judgement, and a just judgement of God; not but I have offended so much the State and the Kingdome, and the Parliament, as that I have had an extream vanity in serving them very extraordinarily. For those actions that I have done, I think it is knowne they have been ever faithfull to the publick, and very particularly to Parliam: my affections have been ever exprest truly and cleerly to them. The dispositions of affaires now have put things in another posture then they were when I was ingaged with the Parl. I have never gone off from those principles that ever I have profest, I have lived in them, and by Gods grace will I dye in them.</p>
                        <p>There may be alterations and changes that may carry them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I thought reasonable, and there I left them: But there hath been nothing that I have said or done, or professed either by Covenant or Declaration, which hath not been very constant, and very clear upon the Principles that I ever have gone upon, which was to serve the King, the Parl. Religion (I should have said in the first place) the Common-wealth, and to seeke the peace of the Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>That made me think it no improper time, being prest out by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and circumstances, to seek the peace of the Kingdom, which I thought was proper, since there was something then in agitation, but nothing agreed on for sending Propositions to the King, that was the furthest aime that I had, and truly beyond that I had no
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53654:19"/>
intention, none at all. And God be praised, although my blood comes to be shed here, there was I think scarcely a drop of blood shed in that action that I was ingaged in.</p>
                        <p>For the present affaires, as they are I cannot tell how to judge of them, and truly they are in such a condition, as (I conceive) no body can make a judgment of them: and therefore I must make use of my prayers, rather then of my opinion, which are, that God would blesse this Kingdome, this Nation, this State, that he would settle it in a way agreeable to what this Kingdom hath been happily Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under; by a King, by the Lords, by the Commons, a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that (I conceive) it hath flourished much under, and I pray God the change of it bring not rather a prejudice, a disorder, and a confusion, then the contrary.</p>
                        <p>I look upon the Posterity of the King, and truly my conscience di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects me to it, to desire, that if God be pleased that these people may look upon them with that affection that they owe, that they may be called in again, and they may be, not through blood, nor through disorder, admitted againe into that power, and to that glory that God hath in their birth intended to them. I shall pray with all my Soul for the happinesse of this State, of this Nation, that the blood which is here spilt, may be even the last which may fall amongst us, and truly I should lay down my life with as much cheerfulnesse as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver person did, if I conceived that there would no more blood fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us; for a State, or affairs that are built upon blood, is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the most part that doth not prosper.</p>
                        <p>After the blessing that I give to the Nation, to the Kingdome, and truly to the Parliament, I doe wish with all my heart, happinesse, and a blessing to all those that have been authors in this business, and truly that have been authors in this very work that bringeth us hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I doe not only forgive them, but I pray heartily and really for them; as God will forgive my sins, so I desire God may forgive them.</p>
                        <p>I have a particular relation, as I am Chancellor of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and truly I must here, since it is the last of my prayers, pray to God that that University may goe on in that happy way which it is in, that God may make it a Nursery to plant those persons that may be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Kingdome, that the Soules of the people may receive a great benefit and a great advantage by them; and (I hope) God will reward them for their kindnesse, and their affections that I have found from them. (Looking towards Mr. <hi>Bolton.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>I have said what Religion I have been breed in, what Religion I have been born in, what Religion I have practiced, I began with it and I must end with it.</p>
                        <p>I told you that my actions and my life have not been agreeable to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53654:20"/>
my breeding, I have told you likewise that the Family where I was bred, hath been an exemplary Family (I may say so I hope without vanity) of much affection to Religion, and of much faithfullnesse to this Kingdome, and to this State.</p>
                        <p>I have endeavoured to doe those actions that have become an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, and which became a good English-man, and which became a good Christian. I have been willing to oblige those that have been in trouble, those that have been in persecution, and truly I finde a great reward of it, for I have found their prayers and their kindnesse now in this distresse, and in this condition I am in, and I think it a great reward, and I pray God reward them for it.</p>
                        <p>I am a great sinner, and I hope God will be pleased to hear my prayers, to give me Faith to trust in him, that as he hath called me to death at this place, hee will make it but a passage to an eternall life through Jesus Christ, which I trust to, which I relye upon, and which I expect by the mercy of God. And so I pray God blesse you all, and send that you may see this to be the last execution, and the last blood that is likely to be spilt among you. And then turning to the side raile, he prayed for a good space of time.</p>
                        <p>God hath given me (speaking to Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>) long time in this world, he hath carried me through many great accidents of Fortune, he hath at last brought me downe into a condition, where I find my selfe brought to an end, for a dis-affection to this State, to this Parl. that (as I said before) I did believe no body in the world more unlikely to have expected to suffer for that Cause. I look upon it as a great judgement of God for my sins. And truly Sir, since that the death is violent; I am the lesse troubled with it, because of those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent deaths that I have seen before: Principally my Saviour that hath shewed us the way, how and in what manner he hath done it, and for what cause, I am the more comforted, I am the more rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. It is not long since the King my Master passed in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and truly I hope that his purposes and intentions were such, as a man may not be ashamed not onely to follow him in the way that was taken with him, but likewise not ashamed of his purposes, if God had given him life. I have often dispu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ed with him concerning many things of this kind, and I conceive his sufferings, and his better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and better understanding (if God had spared him life) might have made him a Prince very happy towards himselfe, and very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py towards this Kingdome. I have seen and known, that those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed souls in Heaven, have passed thither by the gate of sorrow, and many by the gate of violence: And since it is Gods pleasure to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose me this way, I submit my soule to him, with all comfort, and with all hope, that he hath made this my end, and this my conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that though I be low in death, yet neverthelesse this, lownesse
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53654:20"/>
shall raise me to the highest glory for ever.</p>
                        <p>Truly, I have not said much in publick to the people concerning the particular actions that I conceive I have done by my Counsels in this Kingdome, I conceive they are well known, it were somthing of vanity (me thinks) to take notice of them here, I'le rather dye with them, with the comfort of them in mine own bosome; and that I never intended in this action, or any action that ever I did in my life, either malice, or bloodshed, or prejudice to any Creature that lives. For that which concerns my Religion, I made my profession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was bred, in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that was looked upon to be no little notorious in opposition to some liberties, that they conceived, then to be taken; and truly there was some mark upon me, as if I had some taint of it, even thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole wayes that I have taken: every body knows what my affections have been to many that have suffered, to many that have been in troubles in this Kingdome, I endeavoured to oblige them, I thought I was tyed so by my Conscience, I thought it by my chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and truly very much my breeding; God hath now brought me to the last instant of my time, all that I can say, and all that I can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto is this, That as I am a great sinner, so I have a great Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that as he hath given me here a fortune to come publickly in a shew of shame in the way of this suffering, (truly I understand it not to be so) I understand it to be a glory, a glory, when I consider who hath gone before me, and a glory when I consider I had no end in it but what I conceive to be the service of God, the King, and the Kingdom, and therefore my heart is not charged much with any thing in that particular, since I conceive God will accept of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, whatsoever the action seem to be. I am going to dye, and the Lord receive my soul, I have no reliance but upon Christ for my self, I do acknowledge that I am the unworthiest of sinners, my life hath been a vanity, and a continued sin, and God may justly bring me to this end, for the sins I have committed against him, and were there nothing else but the iniquities that I have committed in the way of my life, I look upon this as a great justice of God to bring me to this suffering, and those hands that have been most active in it, I pray God forgive them, and that there may not be many such Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their Victory. I might say somthing of our Tryal, which I think hath been extraordinary, but because I would not seem as if I made some complaint, I will not so much as mention it, because no body shall believe I repine at their actions, or my owne fortune; it is the will of God, it is the hand of God under whom I fall, I take it intirely from him, I submit my self to him, I shall desire to roule my selfe into the arms of my blessed Saviour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53654:21"/>
And when I come to this place (pointing to the Block) when I bowe downe my selfe there, I hope God will raise me up, and when I bid farewell, as I must now to hope and to Faith, that Love will abide, I know nothing to accompany the Soule out of this World but Love, and I hope that Love will bring me to the Fountaine of glory in Heaven, through the Arms, Mediation, and the Mercy of my Saviour Jesus Christ, in whom I believe, O Lord help my unbelief.</p>
                        <p>I shall make as much hast as I can to come to that glory, and the Lord of Heaven and Earth take my soule: I look upon my selfe intirely in him, and hope to find mercy through him, I expect it, and through that Fountaine that is opened for sin, and for uncleannesse, my soule must receive it, for did I rest in any thing else, I have nothing but sin and corruption in me; I have nothing but that, which instead of being carried up into the Arms of God and Glory, I have nothing but may throw me downe into Hell.</p>
                        <p>And here is the place where I lye downe before him, from whence I hope he will raise me to an eternall Glory through my Saviour, upon whom I rely, from whom only I can expect mercy: into his arms I commend my spirit, into his bleeding arms, that when I leave this bleeding body that must lye upon this place, he will receive that Soule that ariseth out of it, and receive it into his Eternall mercy, through the Merits, through the Worthinesse, through the Mediation of Christ that hath purchased it with his owne most precious Blood.</p>
                        <p>Christ Jesus receive my Soule, my Soule hungers and thirsts after him, clouds are gathering, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>That Lamb of God, into his hands I commit my soul; and that Lamb of God that sits upon the Throne to judge those 24 that fall down before him, I hope he will be pleased to look downward, and judge me with mercy that fall down before him, and that worship him, and that adore him, that only trusts upon his mercy for his compassion, and that as he hath purchased me, he would lay his claim unto me now, and receive me.</p>
                        <p>Indeed if Christ justifie, no body can condemn, and I trust in God, in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, though there is confusion here without us, and though there are wonders and staring that now disquiet us, yet I trust that I shall be carried into that mercy, that God will receive my soule.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then the Earl of</hi> Holland <hi>looking over among the people, pointing to a Souldier, said, This honest man took me Prisoner, you little thought I should have been brought to this, when I delivered my self to you upon conditions; and espying Capt.</hi> Watson <hi>on Horse back putting off his Hat said to him, God be with you Sir, God reward you Sir.</hi>

Then turning to his Servants, be said to one, Fare you well, thou art an honest fellow, and to another, God be with thee, thou art an honest man, and then said, Stay, I will kneel down and aske God forgivenesse, and then prayed for a pretty space with seeming earnestnesse.

                        <p>Which is the way of lying?

And truly, this I think I am most guilty of, of not courage enough in it, but malice I had none; but whatsoever it was, God I am sure hath pardoned it, hath given me the assurance of it, that Christ Jesus his blood hath washed it away; and truly, I doe from my soule wish, that all men that have any stain by it, may seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously repent, and receive a remission and pardon from God for it. And now Gentlemen, we have had an occasion by this intimation to remember his Majesty, our King that last was, and I cannot speak of him, nor think of it, but truly I must needs say, that in my opinion that have had time to consider all the Images of all the greatest and vertuousest Princes in the world, and truly in my opinion there was not a more vertuous, and more sufficient Prince known in the world, then our gracious King <hi>Charls</hi> that dyed last; God Almighty preserve our King that now is, his Son, God send him more fortunate, and longer dayes; God almighty so assist him, that he may exceed both the vertues and sufficiencies of his Father: For certainly, I that have been a Councellour to him, and have lived long with him, and in a time when discovery is easily enough made, for he was young (he was about thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen yeers of age) those years I was with him, truly I never saw greater hopes of vertue in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young person, then in him; great Judgment, great Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great Apprehension, much Honour in his Nature, and truly a very perfect English-man in his Inclination; and I pray God restore him to this Kingdome, and unite the Kingdomes one unto another, and send a happinesse both to you and to him, that he may long live and Reign among you, and that that Family may Reign till thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, that is, while all Temporall Power is consuminated: I

beseech God of his mercy, give much happinesse to this your KING, and to you that in it shall be his Subjects, by the grace of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>Truly, I like my beginning so well, that I will make my conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, that is, That God Almighty would confer of his infinite and inestimable grace and mercy, to those that are the causers of my coming hither, I pray God give them as much mercy as their owne hearts can wish; and truly for my part I will not accuse any of them of malice, truly I will not, nay, I will not think there was any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in them; what other ends there are, I know not, nor I will not examine, but let it be what it will, from my very soule I forgive them every one: And so, the Lord of Heaven blesse you all, God Almighty be infinite in goodnesse and mercy to you, and direct you in those wayes of obedience to his Commands to his Majesty, that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may be a happy and glorious Nation again, &amp; that your King may be a happy King in so good and so obedient people.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I mention the matters of Fact, I humbly crave leave to signifie the time when, and manner how I came to be intangled in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy businesse.</p>
                        <p>As for the time, it was after the breaking off the Treaty between
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53654:27"/>
the King and the Scots at <hi>Jersey</hi>; for before that time (to the best of my remembrance) I was not privy to, or acquainted with any meetings about the sending of Captain <hi>Titus</hi> (whose face I never saw) to <hi>Jersey,</hi> or sending Letters to him, or receiving Letters from him, while he was there; or about sending any Letters to, or receiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters from the King, Queen, <hi>Jermyn, Piercy,</hi> or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in forreign parts during the Treaty at <hi>Jersey,</hi> but after that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <figure/> was ended, Mr. <hi>Wil: Drake</hi> came to me, told me he had Newes to impart, and to that end, he desired to know (if he could get friends together) whether I was willing that they should meet at my house (it being conveniently scituate in the midst of the City) that so he might communicate what he heard of affairs abroad. To satisfie my curiosity to hear News, I was content to let him, with those he should bring to meet at my house. Thus for the time when, and manner how I came to be present at any meetings about Intelligence.</p>
                        <p>I now come humbly and truly to relate the matter of Fact, which is as followeth: It appeared to me by the testimony of the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that there were freequent meetings by Mr. <hi>Drake, Alford, Titus, Adams,</hi> and others, soon after the death of the late King, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations made to the King of Scots, the Queen his Mother, to <hi>Jermyn,</hi> and <hi>Piercy,</hi> both before and during the Treaty at <hi>Jersey,</hi> of which I know nothing, nor was I present: But the first meeting I was at, was at my House (and as I remember) at the reading of a Letter which came from Captain <hi>Titus,</hi> after the Treaty was ended at <hi>Jersey</hi>; the Contents of that Letter were (if I mistake not) to this effect: That the Treaty at <hi>Iersey</hi> was broken off through the violent and evill Counsels of desperate Malignants; and that he had something of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53654:28"/>
to communicate, which he durst not doe in person, being not safe for him to come over into <hi>England,</hi> nor could he well doe it by writing, he judging it not fit or safe to send by the Common Post scaring a miscarriage; wherefore he desired some body to be sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him to <hi>Calice,</hi> to whom he might give an account of all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Upon the reading of this Letter, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> moved that some person should be desired to goe to <hi>Calice</hi>; for said he, we shall hear the whole relation of the businesse at <hi>Iersey</hi>; whereupon Major <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> or Capt. <hi>Farr</hi> were moved by Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> to goe. There was mention of Major <hi>Alford</hi> to goe, though he was not then present that I know of, nor was he ever within my house, as I remember, untill after he returned from <hi>Calice</hi>: so that there was none that I know of was gone, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> told me, Major <hi>Alford</hi> was the fittest man to go over to <hi>Calice,</hi> having businesse of his owne to goe into <hi>France,</hi> to look after his Prodigall Son, so that it was (said he) a plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to concea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>About 2 or 3 dayes after Maj. <hi>Alfords</hi> return from <hi>Calice,</hi> M. <hi>Drake</hi> told me he was come to <hi>London,</hi> and told me he would goe to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ministers and Citizens, to desire them to meet at my House, that so we might hear what Newes Maj. <hi>Alford</hi> brought with him from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>; accordingly the next day in the evening they met at my house, Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> brought Maj. <hi>Alford</hi> with him, who gave an account of his conference with <hi>Titus,</hi> and his receiving a Copy of the Kings Letter from him, as also a Narrative of the Treaty at <hi>Iersey,</hi> and said, that he brought not over the Letters himselfe, but delivered them to a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger that came in the Ship, least himself should be searched; but after he came into <hi>England</hi> he received the Letter &amp; Narrative from him (but who he was I know not) and so brought them to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whether the Copy of the Kings Letter was read at my house, in my hearing, I remember not; yet I deny not but it was read there; I am sure I heard the Contents of it were to this effect, That he took in good part the affections and loyalty of those who formerly had Petition'd to him (of which Petition I know nothing) and if ever God restored him, or put him in a condition, he should remember them. The Narrative read in my House, was to this effect, He made a large description of the <hi>Scots,</hi> commending his prudent carriage, &amp; good inclinations to an agreement with the <hi>Scots,</hi> but that his bad Councel about him hindred it; also he made a rehearsall of his lus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings from the Cavaliers at Jersey, how he was imprisoned in a close Room. There were present at this meeting, Maj. Alford, M. Drake, Mr. Case, Maj. Adams, Mr. Jaquel, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Jenkins, Dr.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53654:28"/>
Drake, Capt. Potter, Mr. Sterks, Capt. Farr, and my selfe, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but who. I doe not remember.</p>
                        <p>A little before the Treaty at <hi>Bieda,</hi> there was a meeting at my House, Mr <hi>Drake</hi> proposed, that wee should thinke of some way to promote the agreement between the King and the Scots; where by the way I desire humbly to give notice, that this was the first and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting of this nature, at my house. Mr <hi>Drake</hi> took out some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers out of his pocket written in Characters, which he read in my Study, which went under the name of a Commission and Instructions to be sent to the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> Alderm: <hi>Bunce, Massey, Graves,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to appoint them to advise with, and use their interests in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of honour, to provoke the King to agree with the Scots, &amp; take the Covenant; as also to advise with the Scots Commissioners, and perswade them, That in their agreement with their King, they would have speciall respect to the interest of Religion, and terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the Commission ran in this form, as if it were in the names of all the Presbyteriall party in <hi>England</hi>: after I heard it read, I was against it alledging severall reasons, chiefly, that it was an act of high presumption for private persons to send a Commission with Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and an act of notorious falshood, to say this was in the name of all the Presbyteriall party of <hi>England,</hi> when but a few persons knew thereof; many in the company also exprest a dislike thereof: Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> also read a Letter in this meeting, but to whom it was I know not, neither know I the Contents of it, I was at least a dozen times called out of the Room, whiles the Company were there, so that I am not able to give so ful and particular an accompt of the Contents of the Letter, and of the Commission and Instruction: What Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> did about the Commission and Instructions after he was gone from my house, I know not, what and by whom he sent I know not, until <hi>Maj.</hi> Alford declared before the High Court, That he received the Papers from <hi>Mr.</hi> Drake, carried them to Gravesend, and delivered to one <hi>Mason,</hi> and he caried them to Holland. There was at this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Maj.</hi> Huntington, <hi>M.</hi> Drake, D. Drake, <hi>M.</hi> Jackson, <hi>M</hi> Jenkins, <hi>M.</hi> Cauton, <hi>Maj.</hi> Alford, <hi>M</hi> Gibbons, <hi>Maj.</hi> Adams, Cap. Farr, and my selfe, with others, whom I cannot remember. There is one thing more I make bold to mention, That there are other persons besides those I have named, who did now and then come to my house, as <hi>M.</hi> Robinson, <hi>M.</hi> Nalton, <hi>M.</hi> Haviland, <hi>M.</hi> Blackmore, Col. Vaughan, Col. Sowton, were present at one time or another, but at what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meeting, I cannot positively say.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have cleerly laid open the whole matter of Fact, so far as I well remember, and distinctly know of passages about these meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Transactions at my House.</p>

                        <p>BEloved Christians, I am this day made a Spectacle unto God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and men; and among them I am made a grief to the godly, a laughing stock to the wicked, and a gazing stock to all; yet blessed be my God, not a terror to my self; although there be but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and death, yet this bears up my heart, there is but a little between me and Heaven: It comforted Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> the martyr, when he was going to Execution, That there were but two stiles between him and his fathers house; there is a lesser way between me and my fathers house, but two steps between me and glory, it is but lying down upon the block, and I shall ascend upon a Throne: I am this day sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ling towards the Ocean of Eternity, through a rough passage, to my Haven of rest, through a red Sea, to the promised Land: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear God say to me as he did to <hi>Moses, Goe up to Mount Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo and dye there,</hi> so goe thou up to <hi>Tower</hi>-hill, and dye there <hi>Isaac</hi> said of himself, <hi>That he was old and yet he know not the day of his death,</hi> but I cannot say thus, I am young, and yet I know the day, the kind, and the place of my death also; it is such a kind of death as two famous Preachers of the Gospel were put to before me, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, we have mention of the one in Scripture story, of the other in Ecclesiastical History: and <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. <hi>The Saints were beheaded for the word of God, and for the testimony of Iesus.</hi> But herein is the disadvantage which I am in in the thoughts of many, who judge that I suffer not for the Word or Conscience, but for medling with State matters. To this I shall briefly say, That it is an old guise of the Devil, to impute the cause of Gods peoples sufferings to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements against the State. The Rulers of Israel would put <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to death upon a Civil account, though it was the truth of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie made them angry, because he fell away to the Chaldeans, so <hi>Paul</hi> must dye as a mover of sedition. The same thing is laid to my charge, whereas indeed it is because I pursue my Covenant, and will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute my p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Beloved, I am this day to make a double exchange, I am changing a Pulpit for a Scaffold, and a Scaffold for a Throne; and I might add a third, I am changing this numerous multitude upon Tower-hill, for the innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of angels in the holy hill of Zion; and I am changing a guard of Sould<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ers for a guard of angels, which will receive me and carry me into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome. This Scaffold is the best Pulpit I ever Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in, for in the Church Pulpit God through his grace made me an instrument to bring others to heaven, but 'in this he will bring me to heaven; and it may be this Speech upon a Scaffold may bring God more glory then many Sermons in a Pulpit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53654:29"/>
Before I lay down my neck upon the block, I shall lay open my Case, and that without animosity or revenge; God is my record, whom I serve in the spirit, I speak the truth, and lye not, I doe not bring a revengefull heart unto the Scaffold this day; before I came here, upon my bended knees I have beg'd mercy for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied mercy to me, &amp; I have prayed God to forgive them who would not forgive me: I have forgiven from my heart, the worst enemy I have in all the world, and this is the worst that I wish to my Accusers and Prosecuters, who have pursued my blood, that I might meet their souls in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>I have no more to say, but to desire the help of all your prayers, that God would give me the continuance and supply of Divine grace to carry me through this great work I am now to doe; that I, who am to doe a work I never did, I may have a strength that I never had; that I may put off this body with as much quietnesse and comfort of mind, as ever I put off my Cloaths to goe to bed. And now I am to commend my soule to God, and to receive my fatall blow, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in this, though men kill me, they cannot damne me, and tho they thrust me out of the world, yet they cannot shut me out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I am now going to my long home, to heaven my fathers house, to the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the innumerable Company of Angels, to Jesus Christ the Mediator of the new Covenant, to the spirits of just men made perfect, to God the Judge of all, in whose presence there is fulnesse of joy, and at whose right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</p>
                        <p>Then he kneeled down and made a short Prayer privately.</p>
                        <p>Then after rising up, he said, Blessed be God I am full of joy and peace in believing, I lye down with a world of comfort. And then saying The Lord bless you, he lay down with his head over the block, and when he stretched out his hands, the Executioner did his office.</p>

                        <p>AFter it had pleased God not only to reduce <hi>Ireland,</hi> and give in <hi>Scotland</hi> but so marvellously to appeare for his people at <hi>Worcester,</hi> that these Nations were reduced to a great degree of peace, it was matter of grief to many well affected, in the Land, to see the Cause of God so little forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Parl. whereupon they applied to the Army, expecting redresse by them, notwithstanding which, the Army being unwilling to meddle with the Civill Authority, in matters so properly appertaing to it, it was agreed, That his Excellency and Officers of the Army should be desired to move the Parl. to proceed vigorously in reforming what was amisse in Government; which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53654:32"/>
having done, we hoped that the Parl. would seasonably have answered our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, but finding delayes therein, we renewed our desires in a Petition in <hi>August</hi> last, and although they signified their good acceptance thereof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the particulars to a Committee of the House, yet no considerable effect was produced, but there more and more appeared among them an aversion to the things themselves, with much bitternesse and opposition to the people of God; which grew so prevalent, that those persons of honour and integrity who <figure/> had eminently appeared for God and the publick good, were rendred of no further use in Parl. then by meeting with a corrupt party to give them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to carry on their ends For which purpose, they frequently declared themselves against having a New Representative, and when they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to take that Bill into consideration, they resolv'd to make use of it to recruit the House with persons of the same temper, thereby to perpetuate their owne sitting, which intention divers of the most active did manifest, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to perswade others to a consent therein; and divers Petitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring from severall Counties for the continuance of this Parl. were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by them. For obviating these evills, the Officers of the Army obtained severall Meetings with some of the Parl. to consider what fitting meanes might be applyed to prevent the same; but such endeavours proving altogether ineffectuall, it became most evident to the Army, that this Parl. would never answer those ends, which God, his people, and the whole Nation expected from them. But that this Cause must needs languish under their hands, and be wholly lost. All which being sadly considered by the honest people of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as by the Army, and wisdome and direction being sought from the Lord, it seemed to be a duty incumbent upon us to consider of some more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall means to secure the Cause which the good people of this Common wealth have been so long engaged in, and to stablish peace in these Nations. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much debate it was judged necessary, that the Supream Authority should be devolved upon known persons, men fearing God, and of approved integrity, and committed unto them for a time, as the most hopefull way to encourage and countenance all Gods people, reform the Law, and administer justice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53654:32"/>
hoping thereby the people might forget Monarchy, and have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment setled upon a true Basis, without hazard to this glorious Cause, and necessitating to keep up Arms for the defence of the same. And being still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to use all means possible to prevent extraordinary courses, we prevai'ed with about twenty Members of Parl. to give us a Conference, with whom we freely and plainly debated the necessity and justnesse of our Proposals, and did evidence that these would most probably bring forth something answerable to that work, the foundation whereof God himselfe hath laid. The which found no acceptance, but it was offered, that the way was to continue still this Parl. as being that from which we might reasonably expect all good things; and this being insisted upon, did much confirm us in our apprehensions, That not any love to a Representative, but the making use thereof to perpetuate themselves, was their aim. They being plainly dealt with about this, and told, that neither the Nation, the honest interest, nor we our selves would be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by such dealings, did agree to meet again next day in the afternoon, and nothing in the mean time should be done, that might frustrate the Proposals. Notwithstanding the Parl. next morning did make more hast then usuall in carrying on their said Act, being helped therein by some of the persons enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to us the night before, none of them endeavouring to oppose the same, and being ready to put the main Question for consummating the said Act, whereby our Proposals would have been made void. For preventing whereof, we have been necessitated to put an End to this <hi>Parliament.</hi> And desire that all men, as they would not provoke the Lord to their owne destruction, should wait for such issue as he shall bring forth, and to follow their businesse with peaceable spirits, wherein we promise them protection by his assistance.</p>
