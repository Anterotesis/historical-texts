            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I must confesse it was not matter of long dispute or study put me upon this choice; it was of the same date with my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to say something to this Bold Pretender; For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that in Your Lordship, having not onely a Powerfull Patron, but a most proper and competent Judge, I was bound in Gratitude to make use of this opportunity, to witnesse to the World my particular Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Your Lordship for the long Encouragement I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Your Honour in

               <hi>George Thomsons,</hi> ENTITULED, GALENO-PALE:</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Authour throughout his whole Treatise, quarrells so much with Method, that I shal not observe his, by dividing my Reply into Chapters; but by one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110025:6"/>
thread of Discourse pass through his whole Labyrinth, that so I may securely strike dead, or which will be all one, discover to the World, the Monster therein lockt up, in his true Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>In the very Entrance, nothing will satisfie the Fury of our <hi>Minotaure,</hi> but <hi>Galen</hi> himself, thinking indeed in him at once to swallow all, that own his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but alas he finds him so tuff a bit, that his venemous tooth cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: His Reputation is so great and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, his Parts, Industry and Success in Physick so Eminent, that he is put to it, where to take any hold with his envious fangs, though sharpned with malice and detraction.</p>
            <p>It is an Argument of a very ill nature, or of a bad design, to forge a Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, the most Eminent persons of their Times; that so he might have some pretense and colour to raise a Faction by assigning to each their distinct followers; this is done all men know, upon a false
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110025:6"/>
supposition; for the Judicious and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do not build the Praises of <hi>Galen,</hi> on the Disgrace of <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> but honour both according to their respective worth, and are ready to confess that the <hi>German</hi> on <hi>Galens</hi> shoulders might possibly see more then he; Nay, <hi>Vanhelmont</hi> himself will own, that he was Assisted by him in his further prospect: but it is very just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be suspected, that these Jugglers neglecting of <hi>Galen,</hi> the Foundation, and <hi>per saltum</hi> mounted up to <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> their heads are grown dizzy, and 'tis no wonder they endeavour to cast a mist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of others, when they can see nothing distinctly themselves.</p>
            <p>The Ignorant Impudence of this man will further appear, when we consider him making it his business, and profest design to cry down <hi>Galen,</hi> yet at the same time is forc't to confess him a man of Excellent Parts; how this Character can consist with his Ignorance in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, I leave to any indifferent judge; since it was in this Science, that his Wit
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110025:7"/>
and Learning, not without great Paines and Study, have been transmitted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; witness those many great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes writ upon that subject, which in all Ages Sober and Discreet Physitians have received as the Oracles of <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom Antiquity makes the God of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</p>
            <p>I very much question, whether my Friend has ever read <hi>Galen,</hi> and more, whether he understands him: I rather believe he speaks against him at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because he has met with a more easie, though a by way, to his ends, which is not with <hi>Galen</hi> to cure, but delude the Patient; to purge him not of his Disease, but of his Money.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that I am not so much an Oratour, as to be able to write <hi>Galens Panegyrick</hi> proportionable to his merit, and real worth; neither indeed is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, for what use is there of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to perswade, what is already so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed, both as to his Abilities, and our Authours Ignorance: That
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110025:7"/>
which I intend by this Discourse, is to caution all sorts of People, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with any such thing, as a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> &amp; are apt to be deceived by Master <hi>Thomson</hi>'s scandalous Reproaches of the one, and his great Elogiums of the other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he neither rayles or commends to any other end, then to bring an odium upon the Colledge, and all Physitians in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who onely by Sobriety, and long Study commend themselves unto the World: He is not concern'd either to oppose <hi>Galen,</hi> or cry up <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> but in order, to gain a reputation with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himself, and the rest of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks in Physick, Master <hi>Odoud,</hi> Master <hi>Lockyer,</hi> and I know not how many of the like Rabble, Foot-Men Gun-Smiths, Heel-Makers, and Botchers, that are all made Doctors in the Opinion of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who deluded with a few hard words, and the bare Names of Chymical Preparations (which is all the stock these men set up with) are apt to admire what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110025:8"/>
is above their understanding; but I wish they would consider, that they deal with a sort of Jugglers, that do not understand themselves.</p>
            <p>Thus, the more plausibly to deceive all that are not capable of enquiring into the Mystery of their Trade, but yet may be apt enough to avoid them as Up-starts; they range themselves under the banner of <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> whose Name having made a considerable noyse in the World, they think sufficient to silence such as should question their Knavery; but their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance does not a little appear in the very choice of their Patron, for had I been of their Council, I would have suggested to them a more Ancient and Stouter Champion, whom <hi>Helmont</hi> himself ownes, <hi>Theophrastus Paraselsus,</hi> who was the first, not that dissented from <hi>Galen,</hi> but that made any considerable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Chymistry; for it is not to be questioned, but that He and <hi>Vanhelmont</hi> through their ingenious labour in the fire, made discovery of many Rare and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110025:8"/>
Excellent Medicines; but neither of them buried <hi>Galen</hi> in the ashes, wholly laying aside, as these men would have the World believe, his sober Rules and Prescriptions; and this ingenuity of theirs hath been abundantly requited by that Esteem, which hath been paid them by most learned Physitians since their time, but especially those now of theColledge, (who for many years last past in all the Universities of <hi>Europe</hi> have carried the vogue.)</p>
            <p>My particular Relation bath given me opportunity of frequent converse with these Famous Men, and when any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> or any Chymical Authour has occasionally being raised, they were so far from being traduced (as this Impostor in divers places of his Book impudently affirms) that they were never mentioned without some remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Commendation; Indeed it is so much against the Nature of any Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man to Vilifie an Artist (such as doubtless <hi>vanhelmont</hi> was) that I believe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110025:9"/>
by this it will appear, our Adversaries undervaluing of all, but themselves, must needs be out of malice and base design; for my own part, I may presume to say, (without being guilty of much boasting) it will be acknowledged, by a sufficient Testimony, that I understand my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but I should think my self very ungratefull, if I did not acknowledge the helps and incouragements I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Colledge; 'tis from their favourable influence my fires have received a new light and heat, and they have taken care to blow and cherish the flame.</p>
            <p>Let any Judicious man but look back, and compare the practise of our Worthy Physitians for Twenty Years last past, with the preceding times, and he must confess Chymistry, and its Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been their great care, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant study; that pitch, to which this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Art is now advanc't, is ow'd to them, and if it ascend yet higher, the same hands must lend their assistance.

            <p>Surely the man's asleep, or how could he be guilty of so gross a mistake, for doubtless this part of his Treatise is as it were designed to whip himself and his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110025:10"/>
Juggling Brethren; for at the same time when he mentions the sad Exorbitances, Irregularities, and abuses in Physick, he in plain terms confesses them to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by swarms of Quacks in every place numerous, as Locusts; he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the head of this band himself, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently bidding defiance to the Doctors, &amp; telling them to their teeth, they would fain put them to the rout, if they had power equall to their will; But alas this Exprobation of all others is the most fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous; for give these Impostors but rope enough, and they will hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, withering like hasty weeds for want of sap and root.</p>
            <p>Among his other insignificant reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, tis very pleasant to observe, how he quarrels with the Colledge for their plain dealing, and openness, as if they were to blame for imparting their fkill, and expounding the riddle of Physick so far as is susficient to discover the Juggle of these Quacks and Mountebanks.</p>

This Fellow goes on to tax the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with uncharitableness, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation is better Answered by the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals then by me, though many thousand other poor people besides can testify their charity and readiness to do them good freely without taking any thing for their Advise; whereas His and his Brethrens, being nothing worth, their way is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act money before hand of the poorest for Physick of their own jumbling up; so that they do not onely wrong them, but those also whom they would seem to pity, under a title of the Poor Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries; and surely they are in a fair way to deserve this Epithite, if they, with the help of the Colledge do not get the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Physick purged from such pitiful Physitians.</p>
            <p>These subtle insinuations they use to foment a groundless discord between Doctor and Apothecary; for doubtless the late Appeal to the Parliament, was intended to tye the hands of such Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as your selves, who would ingross
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110025:11"/>
doth Professions, without being quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied for either: and this, contrary to their ill grounded hopes, will in its due time take effect; and then if some <hi>Epidemical contagious Disease,</hi> worse then your selves (the omen of which God avert) <hi>should Reign amongst us,</hi> we doubt not Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon the sober endeavours of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Apothecary, each being careful in his respective Sphear; and surely there is not much likelihood our <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> that have stay'd the brunt of former infectious times, should now run from their colours, if the like danger should happen: Almost in every Church in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or Vestry, there is to be found a Printed Memoriall of their pains and care in the Sickness-time; However I hope thus much in your behalf, that a Publick Edict will be instrumentall to free your Fraternity from the disgrace of a voluntary flight.</p>
            <p>'Tis no wonder at all to hear you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh bitterly against Rule and Method in Physick, when out of your Anarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110025:11"/>
Principle, you are as ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Order and Government in the State; Your designe is to subvert, what the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and Priviledges of both Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities have Established, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> That none under so many years standing in one of our two Universities, ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to practise Physick; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Doctor requires more: Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, according to an Antient Grant from His Majesties Royal Ancestors given to the Colledge of <hi>London;</hi> None, of these persons though so qualified, can have liberty to practise Physick within divers miles of <hi>London</hi> without leave from the Colledge: Yet every Heele-Maker, Foot-man, or Botcher, that can but steal a Receit from some Doctors Man (by the consent of Master <hi>Thomson)</hi> shall presently mount the Common Stage, and under the notion of a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Doctor, defie the whole Body of Physitians; Besides you do not onely go about to infringe the Liberties of this Honourable Society, but you doubly

incroach upon the Freedom of Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries; who, as to the Pharmaceutical part of Physick, have a Pattent of the same Authority (as to their Corporation) with that of the Colledge relating to the practise of Physick, and unless a man be invested by one of these two Authorities, he can neither Justifie his preparing any Medicines, or practising when he has done, and in what degree then you rob the Apothecaries of their profession, I shall have an occasion to demonstrate in another part of my Discourse; Though I would have you take notice of what is now said, and consider how unjustly you assume the practise of Physick in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whatever; and yet not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, through your fallacious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, <hi>You wonder, and stand amazed</hi> (as you say) <hi>to see such Learned Physitians, men so highly reputed for their Parts, to carry on such a design, as the confirmation of their Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent!</hi> You may as well wonder why a man should defend his house against Thieves, which is but a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110025:12"/>
but in this the common good is so much concern'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the keeping down such Drones and Quacks, as through their ignorance, and irregular practise would prove prejudicial to the Common-Wealth, creating more Diseases then they cure.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny but tis possible they may stumble upon success, in some of their desperate attempts, but tis very rare, since Nature is doubly assaulted, by the Remedy as well as the Disease. In this case of good Fortune they fail not to open, and not unlike the Lottery-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, who blow the Trumpet before every single Prize, though never so inconsiderable, whilest all the Blanks are husht up in filence. Thus they make a great cry, where there's no wooll, unless it be that which their own wits are still gathering.</p>
            <p>But these Impostors of late do flatter themselves with a new advantage, which they make so much of, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let go all their former shifts and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110025:13"/>
deceits to trust wholly to this; I mean a pretended quarrel between the Doctors and the Apothecaries; Upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of which, the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fancies to himself a perfect Victory; but alas the poor wretches are as much mistaken in their Policy, as their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions: this does but alarm both to unite more strongly, and to joyn their Forces, for the more easie subversion of these Apotheco-Medicasters.</p>
            <p>I must confess this to be the only Reed they can with any hope of safety take hold of now they are sinking, but it will doubtless prove in the end a broken one, and they, if not in danger of being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, sure to prick their fingers to the bone; Oh! how I long to see them shew their teeth, when they cannot bite, when they have nothing to fasten upon, and must be forc'd to turn their fury upon themselves, and fret in their own grease; then the sport will be to see these Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jugglers crumbled into diverse petty intrests, and devour one another, Whilest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110025:13"/>
Doctors and Apothecaries in a perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable, concurrence shall have nothing else to encounter, but the Distemper of the Patient, and not be troubled to keep off a second infection, and more dangerous, namely these intruding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks; of whom, though I should be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the usuall success of their care will evince to the World, that the abuse of Physick for some late years past did not come from any <hi>Labourer, Drudge or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the Doctors,</hi> as my Friend seems to aver, but from an ignorant, and no less impudent sort of people, the very refuse of the whole Town, those <hi>Swarmes of Quacks,</hi> he mentions in his third Chap. with an ingenious Acknowledgement, that tis themselves have made this Noble Science <hi>(The True Professors where of Divine Writ hath charged to be Honoured)</hi> a very Trade to get Money; to which end they have cover'd and adorn'd themselves with Jewels, stoln out of other mens Clossets, those <hi>Arcana</hi>'s he so often speaks of; but alas in their ill wearing them,

they are sullyed and lose their Native Lustre the greatest <hi>Arcana</hi>'s in the world, when improperly apply'd, must needs fail in the performance of their usual Effects.</p>
            <p>When this undertaking first enter'd into my thoughts, I resolv'd out of my affection to Chymistry, to take off this General Scandal, the ignorance of these pretenders to the Art have brought upon it; knowing nothing more destructive to Chymistry, then such Chymists, who presuming (as justly they may) that the generality of the people cannot disprove them, do confidently affirm themselves to be Artists; so that what Reputation they gain with the Vulgar, tis wholly due to their tricks and noise; <hi>Subtle</hi> and <hi>Lungs</hi> in this case making up but one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymist. <note place="margin">Ben.

            <p>It were to be wisht, that this railer were guilty of what he accuses the <hi>Galenist,</hi>

               <hi>(viz.)</hi> plausible Rhetorick; but he is now grown so abusive and scurrilous, that in his Fourth Chapter, he is not content to scandalize the Physitians, but also the Apothecaries, whom hitherto out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign he would seem to have Courted, and in many places of his Book, doth curry Favour with, yet not minding his self-contradiction, when any thing falls into his purpose against the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, he does not stick falsely to asperse the whole Company of Apothecaries, and accuse them of a sordid and base eomplyance, (that he might wound the Reputation of Doctor and Apothecary together) impudently asserting an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon them, <hi>Not only to speak for the Doctors, but to lye for them, yea and to do some things for them to the hazard of their Souls, being forc't to maintain, and sometimes to own all their Miscariages, Misdemeanours, and gross Aberrations in Physick, or else He, His Wife and Children must bite on the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle:</hi> But I am sure this Brute wants one in his mouth; whither will he run in this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110025:15"/>
full Carriere, casting dirt in the faces of known honest men? but the best is, their Reputation is so unquestionably unblemisht in the World, that all the dirt, which is thrown at them, will the more forcibly return upon the Authors, and so stick the faster.</p>
            <p>But do you hear, my good Friend, <hi>Oportet mendacem esse memorem;</hi> were not you he that all along have accused the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists</hi> of being too communicative, and now tell us tis their principal study to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve all in obscurity;</hi> And I pray tell me, has not the dint of your Accusation been all along, that they <hi>Cryed down Chymistry,</hi> and do you now indite them for become<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chymists? But you say tis <hi>of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> and methinks that should please you, since tis your own case; 'Twas neither time nor pains perfected your Fraternity, you are a Generation of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists bred like <hi>Myrmidons</hi> or <hi>Mushromes,</hi> coming to full growth in one night: and the truth is, among you, he is the best Chymist, that has most Impudence, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110025:15"/>
least Conscience: But that our worthy Doctors allow'd now to be Chymists, are not become such of a suddain, needs little proof; I my self have been their Servant near twenty years countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and daily imploy'd by them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chymical Medicines, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, many of the Colledge, whom I had the Honour to know, kept private Elaboratories in their own Houses, and notwithstanding, this is so Eminently known among all that were ever concern'd in Physick; yet this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor presuming many others know it not, thinks by cajoling of the people, to reap not onely the Profit, but the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit too of all their Industry and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>To promote this, he tells you in the end of his Fourth Chapter, a story of a perspicacious Gentleman, who extorted, after much urging, from a Physitian, this Answer, <hi>Hang it, we are but a company of Cheats;</hi> and sayes our Authour further, <hi>This was reported to us, &amp;c.</hi> It seems there
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110025:16"/>
was a Juncto of Quacks met, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Empricks, at whose sitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, as frivolous, this report was made forsooth, and sayes our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, <hi>By a Person of Quality;</hi> To this, I shall only offer the improbability of the thing it self, for a sufficient Answer, and Advise him for the future, to Lye more feisibly.</p>
            <p>This Cunning Man being neither Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist nor Astrologer, undertakes boldly to personate both, upon the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that each of them is above the Capacity of the Vulgar, whom it is his business to delude: Whereupon in his Fifth Chapter, he talks to us of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; but the vanity of this Cheat is long agoe exploded by the Learned and Judicious; besides tis known to be a common refuge for such Ignoramuses, as can give no rational account of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Distempers; so that in this case, he that will confess himself never to be mistaken, <hi>But as a Man,</hi> does ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acknowledge he never is in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110025:16"/>
right, which is our Authours case, in his own words, <hi>Happy be lucky, hitting the mark with as much uncertainty as those People called Andabatae, that fought wink ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding he blames the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for being sober and modest, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to promise what they never expect to perform; he quarrels with them for not being as Impudent as his Faction, who confidently assert themselves to be Infallible in the business of Physick, and in the most difficult cases, pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all conjecture. My good Friend, tis shrewdly to be suspected, he is most Erroneous, that would have it thought he cannot erre at all.</p>
            <p>It will not be much from my purpose (which is chiefly to present this Crew in their colours) to inform the World, that they not only pretend to bePhysitians, but would be thought Able to recover for us, all other losses besides that of Health, by their skil in Astrology; If one good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man loseth her Petticote, another her wedding-ring, they are ready to cast a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110025:17"/>
for them; but believe me, 'tis such a one, as will in the conclusion stand for a Cypher; and if at any time they seem to make any discovery, tis sufficiently known they do it by confederacy.</p>
            <p>Neither do they take a course much different to come into credit with their Quacking Trade, bringing and hiring all people whatsoever, to feign both Sicknesse and Cure, that other silly poor Wretches, who really want help, may be trapan'd into a false Opinion of their skill, and be gull'd at least out of their money, if not out of their lives.</p>
            <p>I do not take up this barely upon the credit of a flying report, but I know it by personal Experience, for there is not a Juggling Figure-flinger, or Quack in the Town, but I have had some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, and am very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all their Fallacious Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Designs; so that I might justly be accus'd to be of their party, if I kept their Council, which I am little conceru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, since they are so unworthy as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110025:17"/>
to make their pretended zeal to Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, a cloak for their knavish and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious practises.</p>
            <p>Ther is hardly a page in his whole book but what is fill'd with some abusive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or other, though withall so full of self-contradiction, 'tis below me to think him worth an Answer: besides he is an Enemy so inconsiderable, that I can hope for little credit by undertaking him: In his Sixth Chapter, his main business is to cry down Anatomy, as very insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and little conducing to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Patient: I wish some of our <hi>Galenists</hi> had this Fellow under their hands to cut him off the Simples; I am confident, were they to read a Lecture upon him, they would discover his want of brains; but this is sufficiently proved to all men by his own scribble; Did ever any Sober Man find fault with Industry imploy'd in Anatomical Dissections? Who ever imagin'd it possible for a man to be a Good Physitian, without great Skill and Judgement in the subject of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110025:18"/>
this Art; and most Diseases proceeding from Internal Causes, what way to be taken for the discovery of them, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy? so that the great care of the Colledge in opening of Bodies cannot be; <hi>A meer Publick Theatrical business, more for Ostentation, and to get a fame abroad, then for any notable improvement in the cure of Miserable Man:</hi> Though these be my Friends own words, yet he is Master of so much reason, or Justice, as that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after he condemnes himself, <hi>Ex ore suo,</hi> by an apparent recantation; <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> (sayes he) <hi>we stand up for as much as any, without which a Physitian we are certain, must needs be defective in Physick:</hi> These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions are so frequent throughout his whole Book, that 'tis not indeed worth the while to take notice of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle one; In truth I think it had been a very good way of confuting this fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Writer, onely to have transcrib'd him; but the same in effect, every Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader will do in the most cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory perusal.</p>

'Tis to me a wonder, the rest of his Fraternity do not fail upon him, for so ill defending their Cause; 'I would be much for their Interest to have his Book called in betimes; or I would Advise them to call a Conventicle of Jugglets, and make a resolve, that this Pamphlet be forthwith distill'd, and as one of their own Chymical Operations for the future kept, <hi>inter Arcana,</hi> and so privately, that the World may not be so fully informed of their Misterious Cheat: But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his censure of Anatomy, which all along he both magnifies, and cryes down in one breath, he undervalues it, because the Skill is not to be attained without great Pains, and a Study his Capacity comprehends not, yet he is forc't to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it, as not being ignorant, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of Anatomy, <hi>All their knowledge is in vain;</hi> And this he himself confesses, in a comparison he makes of a Mechanick, who ought <hi>To have a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent insight of that Machine, as Watch or Clock, which he goeth about to mend:</hi> Thus

After all these impertinences, he once more presents himself to us as a Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, with his more <hi>prevailing helps;</hi> and this I observe to be the clinch of all his Discourse, (next railing) and the hinge, on which all his design turns; under this notion, he talks wildly of a <hi>Pyrotechnicall Anatomy, which</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>shews us where every Disease is seated;</hi> It seems by this, these Impostors, do not use to Anatomize Dead Carcasses, but Calcine them; so that the Effect of this Operation must needs prove to be nothing else but a <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi>

            <p>As in almost every Chapter of his Book, so in this Seventh, he has a new Hocus to carry on his old design; he has been nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling formerly at the Apothecaries, and now he would bring the Chirurgions to cut a way through for him, if he can but raise a jealousie between them and the Doctors; to effect this, and the better to bring his purpose about, he boldly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to reprove the Doctors, <hi>For the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of most of them in Surgery;</hi> which is

But at this rate he proceeds through the whole Chapter, taking occasion at every inconsiderable conceit of his own Invention, either to cast some dirt upon the Colledge, or to promote some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; nay, rather then not propagate his own cause, he raises a quarrell between them and his Medicines; <hi>Tell them</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the Alkahest, or Universal Menstruum, of Lapis Chrysopeius, or of a Panacea, they will but deride and flout at it;</hi> These are things indeed <hi>Vanhelmont</hi> mentions, but I dare be bold to say, our Authour never saw any of them; and further, as to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Chrysopeius,</hi> and Liquor <hi>Alkahest,</hi> I Affirme positively, there is no such <hi>Arcana</hi>'s to be found in <hi>Rerum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ:</hi> 'Tis probable Master <hi>Thomson</hi> has a strong faith, and <hi>It were to be wisht,</hi> that he had as much patience, or it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he should continue till the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reduction of those <hi>Coagulations, or Tumors into their first matter</hi> (as he mentions) be performed by Art; nor is

            <p>As to his relation of three large stones expell'd by a Chymical Physitian from a Maid-Servant; I once saw as great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done, and from a Maid-Servant too; but rather by accident, then by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any Medicine at all; so that <hi>his Turkeys Egge</hi> is addle: the stone that came from this Maid, was bigger then any of these three he mentions, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry scraggy: 'Tis possible therefore for Nature to free her self from such <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous products,</hi> meerly by the force of her own expulsive faculty.</p>
            <p>I know there are many Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, much conducing to this effect; and as I have no reason, so I do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

this Accident, against that Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Physitians Experiment, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, to take off the Validity of Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Medicines; But to take away those pernicious and mistaken inferences that Master <hi>Thomson</hi> draws from thence, (only to lay hold of any means to scandalize the Physitians) as <hi>bleeding, Pernicious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, Blistrings, &amp;c.</hi> A practise which ne Physitian uses barely in reference to the Stone, but as some other accidentall Distemper may require; Nor ever do they appoint the Knife, till sound Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon serious deliberation counts it necessary.</p>
            <p>'Tis very pleasant, how in his Eighth Chapter, he represents the Doctors as concern'd to vindicate their credit from these Jugglers Imputations; whereas alas, they take no more notice of them, then a Lion does of a whiffling Curr, or the Philosopher of his Scolding Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippe: Notwithstanding, he is pleased to begin this Chapter thus: <hi>Ye make your boast that ye possesse (as well as we) your labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>

Was ever any one so senseless as to imagine, or dream of a True Artist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or that a man can be so accounted, without convenient Utensils? Yet as Books and Furnaces do not, <hi>meerly of themselves,</hi> make either Scholars, or Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks, so it must be granted, neither Books nor Furnaces could be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them both; but away with these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious truths, by you repeated to the same purpose, with your as notorious lyes and bare pretenfes to Chymistry, out of which there arises only an <hi>ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> making a false glare, like the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor so call'd, which leads the poor Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller out of his way, and leaves him in a Ditch crying out for help; just thus do these Jugglers by their Patients, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been seduced, and ill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by these Empiricks, are forc't to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the discreet, and wary Physitian for their Cure.</p>
            <p>I should think it strange, out of any Mouth but our Authous, or his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to hear a Physitian accused for not

use of it in all cases alike, which is the custome of our unworthy Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and Abusers of Learned <hi>Vanhelmont;</hi> yet thus far I am willing to comply with my Friend; <hi>It had been happy for the credit of his Art, (viz.)</hi> of cozening by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, if no Chymical Medicines had ever been prescribed by the Colledge, for therein a palpable discovery of my Gentlemens Villany is made, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of True Gold seen, from that which only glisters.</p>
            <p>I must confess there are many <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Sophisticate Preparations</hi> vented in the Town, for Good; but this can in no sense be imputed to the Colledge, for they are sensible of this abuse, and are resolved to reform it in due time, as an Appendix to the imposture and Knavery of these Jugglers. As to what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hints concerning the <hi>Doctors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,</hi> I am confident he laugh'd at himself in the mention, as very well knowing, his Faction was never in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to oblige that Worthy Society,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110025:24"/>
unless it were by being as a foyle, to set off their Great Abilities.</p>
            <p>Next he goes on, pretending <hi>An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to some Objections laid to their charge by the Galenists;</hi> and truly in those charges which he mentions, there is couched and imply'd so ingenuous a confession and home Character of the Faction, that I think it a hard task to set them out more perfectly in their own Colours. They are Objections indeed, with a witness; so undeniable, as that himself is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to set his hand, and say; <hi>This we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess ingenuously is not be denyed in part, and we could wish it otherwise:</hi> If the Reader would but peruse his Ninth Chapter, he will believe him to have sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that it is as hard for him to Answer, or remove these Objections, as it was for <hi>Ulysses</hi> to remove the great Stone from the mouth of <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his Cave; where by the by, this crafty <hi>Grecian</hi> gave the <hi>Cyclops</hi> such an <hi>Arcanum,</hi> that what he could not âccomplish by strength, he brought about by wiles, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110025:25"/>
subtilty; first he put out the <hi>Cyclops</hi> eye, then rob'd his Flock: This course these Empiricks usually take, casting a mist before the understandings of the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous people, and then picking their pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.</p>
            <p>But is any thing more childish and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, unless it be himself, then his following words, on which he seems to lay the whole weight and stress of all his Brethrens reputation. <hi>We know</hi> (sayes he) <hi>a Chymist, that desires no more practise in Physick to get a competent living by, then those Patients to whom ye cannot make the promise of a Cure after two or three moneths time, whom he would undertake to resolve in lesse then a moneth:</hi> And no question is to be made of this, but I presume, Sir, you mean a resolving them into their first Principles, and then surely a moneth is too long a time for you, that usually are more quick and nimble in your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches: Fye, Fye, will you become now so cruell, as to think of torturing your Patients, for a whole moneth, who
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110025:25"/>
all along have pretended to be such sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Executioners; <hi>Kill or Cure</hi> is your known maxime, and at that rate, the most desperate of Diseases, nay, death it self may be styl'd a Physitian: How conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the doctrine of this bold maxime, does he go on to declare himself? <hi>For our parts,</hi> (saith he) <hi>we should think it very strange, and be infinitely ashamed, if any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient should be Cured by the Galenists, whom we have given over:</hi> For the truth is, they handle the matter so for the most part, that they are sure to put it out of the power of all Physick, to do any good to those they have tampered with, by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd, and abused Chymistry.</p>
            <p>His next, and Tenth Chapter seems to be spit out of the mouth of a Zealous Brother at a meeting, where he holds forth the Doctrine of <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> as down right Gospel, and advises the Colledge <hi>To Embrace it sincerely, and be wise to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> He improves the Exhortation in the same strain of Devotion; <hi>Let him lay his hand upon his heart, and considering his</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:110025:26"/>
               <hi>own emptyness, reflect upon himself, how he hath deceived, and been deceived.</hi> Ah! doubtless this must needs be a Precious man; How has Chymistry contributed to make him Spiritual, and his trading in the fire inflam'd his Zeal? And now that has run his pretense to Physick, quite out of breath, 'tis time for me to make Observation that, <hi>Ubi desinit Medicus, incipit Theologus:</hi> But least he should not be a thorough-paced Fanatick, another part of this Chapter is spent in decrying of Humane Learning: great Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is ever a crime to a Dunce, and it being for the carrying on his design, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, that our Authour should either be a Scholar, or a profest Enemy to the name; he takes the more easie and cheap way to his end, which is to bring himself and ignorance, as much as in him lyes, into some credit in the World. But all will not do; neither Fanatick in Religion, nor Physick, with all their specious Hypocrisie will ever be able to perswade the World, that the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110025:26"/>
Letter is not a fit Hand-mand to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that Learning is not subservient, and necessary to the cure both of soul and body.</p>
            <p>I am not so well read in <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> (neither do I think it my duty so to be) as to be able to contradict my Friend, when he talks of that Learned Mans fair proposals, <hi>Why</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath not your Sect yeelded formerly to</hi> Helmonts <hi>fair proposal while he was alive, that there might be a final conclusion of these Controversies by matter of fact? (indifferent Judges appointed on both sides to give their censure)</hi> tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this proposal was really made; but tis very insignificant in his mouth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his Faction were in such a degree Eminent, that they could make it out to all, that they are as able as <hi>Vanhelmont</hi> himself: How far they are from this pitch, I dare fubmit to the Judgement, not only of indifferent persons, but even of those that are some way byassed with Interest, and willing to be partial in the Empiricks Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:110025:27"/>
In his next hard Chapter, where he talks of the Principles of Phylosophy, which the <hi>Galenists</hi> own, he runs on upon a false supposition; for 'tis very well known, that the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Tenents, which <hi>Galen</hi> owned, are in many things found little consonant to Nature and Truth; whereupon the Learned Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of our Age, not sworn to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any of the Antients in particular, (as our Authour would have the World believe) do act according to the freedom of their own Judgements, and do by a kind of rational Chymistry, extract what is good either in <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the dross of both; so that these several Calumnies he reproaches the Doctors with, are groundless and false.</p>
            <p>Above all, these Quacks it seems are very desirous to be thought compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and full of pity; as appears by their general out-cry against sheding of blood: I confess such a cautious behaviour, as this, among the <hi>Welch</hi> men, might bring them into good practise; but here at home
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110025:27"/>
the long and successfull use of Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, easily out-votes their groundless clamour against that processe: and though the <hi>Devil be</hi> undeniably <hi>a sworn Enemy to Man-kind,</hi> I dare presume to acquit him thus far, that he never suggested the wholesom <hi>Emission of Blood,</hi> being very unlikely by this way to make good his title of a Murtherer from the beginning. What my Friend sayes concerning our being <hi>Governed by Nature, which intends all things for its ownPreservation, &amp;c.</hi> May very deservedly be retorted upon him; for we plainly may observe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oftentimes Nature is her own Phlebotomist, in which she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to breath a vein rather then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her help, usually afforded by sending forth blood at the Nostrils, which is lookt upon to be the best and purest: But the impudence of these men knows no bounds, and thinks to out-face common Experience, which assures us, that in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Distempers, letting of blood is the only and certain Remedy; The like may be said of Purgation, by which Nature is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110025:28"/>
eased of a pernicious burden and load, oppressing and obstructing her in her Vital Operations. And here by the way let us examine the inference he makes from an Aphorisme of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> to which he is forc't to give the Epithite of Excellent; he quotes him in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and interprets them thus. <hi>If that be carried out of the Body by Purgation, that ought to be, the Sick Man finds himself the better for it, and his Spirits more chearfull, and better able to bear his Disease:</hi> From hence he is pleased to inferre that <hi>Hippocrates fore saw the great mischief, that was likely to come upon indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Evacuation:</hi> But surely, he, that has but half an eye, will conclude from hence more naturally, that he foresaw like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the great benefit, that was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to ensue upon purging discreetly, by the prescription of a Judicious Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and performed by proper Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>As to that common maxime of <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:110025:28"/>
               <hi>contraria sunt Remedia,</hi> how far it holds true, and how far made use of by Physitians, I do not think my self a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge; but to my Apprehension, it seems to be very rational; For how can the Disease be conquered, without an Enemy to give it battel?</p>
            <p>The next thing our Learned Authour flyes at, is the Pharmacopoea; this he pretends to accuse of several Infirmities, and would perswade us, that tis very improbable, this Book should contribute to the cure of the Sick, when it self is so Diseased, and needs a Physitian: But let us put the Saddle on the right Ass; the Sickness is in the mans brain, and it fares with him, as with one that has the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to whom all Objects seem yellow, whereas the Distemper is onely in the Organ.</p>
            <p>The Title of his Fifteenth Chapter, is, <hi>A Brief Examination of their Pharmacopoea.</hi> in this Judicial Procedure, he himself undertakes to sit as Judge, Party, and Witness; and-because he is pleased to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110025:29"/>
Pronounce Sentence of Condemnation, all the World he thinks must necessarily subscribe to it, and from hence forward look upon the <hi>Pharmacopoea Londinensis,</hi> as Out-law'd: But stay a while, I shall make bold to bring a Writ of Errour, and briefly examine <hi>His Brief Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This Book has by the unanimous consent of the Learned in Physick, been owned and approved of, as the best of that kind ever was extant; and truly tis no small vindication of its worth, that tis Calumniated and Vilified by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, and his Factious Ignorant Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Can there be a greater Elogium out of the mouth of such a <hi>Nonsensical, Ridiculous, Improper, and Languid</hi> Fellow as he is, then this, when he boldly sayes, the Pharmacopoea contains, <hi>Nonsensical, Ridiculous, Improper and Languid Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> Poor mistaken fool, the only way for you to destroy the Dispensatory, is highly to commend it, for nothing but your Approbation can ever bring its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit into the least question.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:110025:29"/>
He is pleased to say, <hi>It would require a long time to set down the Errours of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensatory;</hi> I easily believe him, because really there are not any to be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I am sure, not by his dim-sight, but however he will give us <hi>a glance of some of them:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first glance is this: <hi>We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> (sayes he) <hi>a great defect in the Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis or opening of the body of any concrete;</hi> I must confess this to be a glance indeed, but no more, for had he seen perfectly or understood any thing in the dispensation of a Medicine he might have known the pulverizing of most <hi>Concretes,</hi> to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient preparation for the opening of their Bodies, as proper Ingredients to any Electuary, Playster or Conserve, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Dispensations, not onely the Virtue and Crasis, <hi>sed totum corpus,</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual Concrete is to be put.</p>
            <p>A second glance, is his Observation, <hi>What a Congeries, Cento, Linsey wolsey of Simples they jumble and clutter together to some Scores, without any reasonable contexture</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:110025:30"/>
               <hi>or congruity:</hi> What, does he see all these at a glance? Sure he must either have those <hi>Argus Eyes</hi> he talks of, or else he can squint, and look nine wayes at once; But I think, I shall do him more right, to tell you he is pur-blind, or else he might perceive with what admirable Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Art, the opposition of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ingredients in a Medicine is mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make one proper Compound, and how the properties and qualities of each Simple are either improved or abated by a due and just temperament, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Patient may require; So that out of this <hi>Clashing, Conflicting, and Hostility,</hi> there arises an agreement, as it is remarkable, that Peace is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and end of War; and the health of the whole Universe consists in the poize, and just ballancing of contraries.</p>
            <p>Our Authour throws a sheeps eye once more, and in his third glance, tells us, <hi>He cannot but especially take notice, and condole the Ineffectual, Frivolous, and vain Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those Virulent, and Poysonous Concretes,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:110025:30"/>
               <hi>which they take into many of their Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> For instance of which he Cites you <hi>Scammonie</hi> and <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, that have been used in Physick, with exceeding great safety, and no less success for many score years without any other Correction, then what is appointed in the Dispensatory: And tis not his spitting his Venome, can make these Medicines thus corrected to be Poison: But against these two, he opposes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, seeming to admire the Doctors should be <hi>so wilfully ignorant, as to make no scruple of prescribing ten or twelve grains of Scammony, and yet startle, and seem very nice, to give four or five grains of Antimonium Diaphoreticum:</hi> Where first I would have the Reader take notice of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, or wilfull ignorance; for to my knowledge, and as will appear by the Bills or Prescriptions of diverse Eminent Physitians, for many years, they have not scrupled to give 20 graines of <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Diaphoreticum,</hi> at one Dose, and that for several dayes together. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110025:31"/>
I would beg the Reader to consider, that he opposes a Diaphoretical Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Antimony, against a purgative medicine of Scammony, by which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he would make Scammony appear to be the strongest Poyson: But if the Poyson of any Concretes ought to be proportionated by their force in hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Operations on the Stomack, and that force determined by their different Doses, Antimony will appear much the stronger Poyson, because four or five grains of any Purgative Preparation of Antimony, being in substance exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Stomach, shall operate more violently then sixteen or twenty graines of Scammony. Further, to imform our Authors Judgement, let me tell him, the Purgative quality of Scammony may be taken away, as well as of Antimony, and that <hi>secundum Artem,</hi> it may be made as perfectly Diaphoretical; and then supposing them thus prepared, he must acknowledge Antimony and Scammony, to be equally alike poysonous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:110025:31"/>
But by the way, tis not my business to maintain the Quarrel of Scammony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Antimony; what hath been said in the case, hath only been to shew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Thomson</hi>'s unjust comparison; yet how much so ever we have differed in this particular, I will agree with him in his following Expression recited; <hi>That the best Remedies in the Dispensatory are Chymicall:</hi> but what, or who he means by <hi>U S,</hi> when he adds, <hi>For which they are beholding to U S,</hi> I do not at all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; certainly he cannot be so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to joyn himself with any part of the Colledge, whom he may imagine more addicted to Chymistry then the rest: And again, me thinks he should not be so stupid, as to think, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self joyn'd in Commission with Master <hi>Lockier,</hi> Master <hi>Odowde,</hi> or any of those Up-start pretenders to Chymistry, can any way oblige the Colledge; Besides, if I mistake not, there were Chymical Preparations in the Dispensatory of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> before any of them had a Name.</p>

To this truth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that Chymical Preparations are the best Medicines; he adds another, (which by the way is one more truth, then I have met withall in any one page of his Book before) That these Chymical Preparations are not <hi>free from being Sophisticated,</hi> which cannot be denyed, and will hardly be prevented, till by a Publick Authority, some course be taken with those Fooles, that will be medling, as well as the Knaves, that will be Cheating; and then, the True Artists wanting no incouragement, these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines will be Exalted in their hands.</p>
            <p>In the next place, (sayes our Authour) <hi>The most usual, safe, and best Vomit (in their account) is borrowed from Antimony, called Infusio Croci Mettallorum;</hi> By <hi>their Account,</hi> I suppose he means the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Physitians, which may passe as none of the least of his presumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, though I believe he never saw a Catalogue of half the Vomits they make use on, and dare presume, when he has view'd the Catalogue of his own
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110025:32"/>
               <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, he will find no Vomit there like it, either for certainty or safety in its Operation, or <hi>for carrying off the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter;</hi> If he thinks to reckon <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius vitae</hi> within the number of his <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s, (which is also an Antimonial prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,) as I presume he may, because presently after he seems to wonder, <hi>They ever would venture to admit it into a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of their Safe Medicines;</hi> the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue he mentions, will prove him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; For, it will appear to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine appointed in the Dispensatory of <hi>London,</hi> before ever he could be capable of knowing any thing in Physick; and this he cannot be ignorant of though he will rather venture to be found guilty of some plausible falsities, then not to throw some scandall or other upon the Colledge; As for the Exalting or Graduating of these Medicines, I may safely say, there are many Apothecaries Boyes in the Town, able to undertake it, with the most Learned, well Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Chymist, our Author can find in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110025:33"/>
all that Tribe, that so utterly renounces the <hi>Galenical Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This man is furnished with a strange measure of confidence, I might very justly say impudence; otherwise he could not possibly use this frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration, of the Doctors <hi>being beholden to them, obliged to them</hi> for several Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: Surely he is of opinion, the Sun is beholden to the Stars, which receive from him all the light they impart to the Inferiour World: What these men have in them, their Conscience bears them witness, is only gleanings gathered from the Colledge; these they feed upon, chewing the cud, and yet are not to be numbered among the clean Beasts, for their ill digestion turns all to putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making good that common maxime, <hi>Corruptio optimi fit pessima.</hi> Into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Doctors Debts, there is foysted Oyle of Vitriol, with its use and virtue; for which our Author would have them confess, <hi>They are much Obliged to them for the Discovery;</hi> But when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110025:33"/>
the Colledge comes to reckon with all these wilfull, and as fradulent mistakes, they will be glad to sneak out of the way, as ashamed to own their account.</p>
            <p>The next Quarell he picks, is with <hi>The preparation of Pearles, and Corral with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> concluding it to be no more then a bare pulverizing them <hi>into small parts or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes;</hi> if there were no more in it then thus to Alcohalize, or reduce Pearls or Corral into such a fine Butraceous Magisterium, as is done by <hi>Vinegar,</hi> it were worth the charge and trouble; but this is not the first errour his ignorance hath made him Father, but tis a very gross one; we may certainly and easily infer from the insipidness of the Spirit of Vinegar (from which all the gross and corrosive Salts are separated by rectification) when the Pearle or Corral is precipitated after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that the Medicament must needs be exalted by the volatile Salt of Wine, the Vinegar leaves behind: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as I said before, the bare pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing either of Pearle or Corral, will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110025:34"/>
never reduce them into such a Butyrous substance <hi>instar Magisterii,</hi> as is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this way of dissolution.</p>
            <p>Diverse other preparations of Vitriol and Mercury he to as little purpose makes mention of; for tis sufficiently known, they have been in long esteeme and use with the Colledge; so that he might have spared the pains he has taken to perswade the World, that the Doctors are alwaies inveighing against Chymical Medicines, unless he will be pleased to give us leave to understand them in their own, and truest sense; for when they undertake to speak against Chymicall Medicines, tis meant as they are Unchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically handled by Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> and his Illiterate Faction; they know full well nothing can eat out the heart of Chymistry, but the Hypocrisie of these combining Empiricks; They are very sensible, that in all these Fellows prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations whatsoever, Mercury never is wanting, since their Medicines smell more of the Knave then the Artist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:110025:34"/>
Notwithstanding all our Author can say, it remains evident, as well from the great pains and study, as the common practise of the Doctors, that their grand design hath been to promote and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Chymistry; on the contrary, the design their Adversaries drive at, is to promote themselves; This makes our Pseudochymists, that they cannot endure such Rivalls as are likely in courting the same Mistresse, to discover their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and treacherous Love, which is contented with the shew and picture of Chymistry, but neglects the truth and substance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hogen-Mogens</hi> would seem wholly to ingross this Art, and pretend to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly, when alas their ignorance is so great, and their stock known to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, I know not when they will have right and liberty to vent by Retaile; and when any of them does open Shop, I am sure they must shew their wares at a false light, or else their Commodity will stick upon their hands; and whereas they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110025:35"/>
are pleas'd to pass in the world by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>Adepti,</hi> they more justly may stile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Servantes;</hi> for what <hi>Arcana</hi>'s they have got, they will be forc't to keep.</p>
            <p>Hitherto our Authour has been casting dirt upon all occasions in the Doctors faces, either as to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> or as to their general Method in Practise; but now he comes to throw waters, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, to which</hi> (sayes he) <hi>the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matists fly, as to a Sanctuary, in difficult cases.</hi> It cannot be denyed, there is a Healing Virtue in these Natural Springs, but when they are to be used, must be known from the Experienced Physitian; for doubtless, in some cases, they are like the Waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> bitter and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in others, as healing as those of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesdah,</hi> after the Angel had descended into the Poole: I, for my part, am of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That he is the Best and Ablest Physitian, that wanders least from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts of Nature; that knows best how to apply the helps she has provided for her own recovery; the finding out of which,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110025:35"/>
together with the due administration, is both the Physitians Imployment and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence: This being a task too difficult for humane Endeavour, recourse has been had to the assistance of Art; yet so, as that they best manage it, that most imitate nature; I shall not therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with my friend, <hi>How many by Virtue of these Mineral Wells have been-restored, that have been brought to a very low Ebb by ill Physitians,</hi> such as himself; But tis very rare, these Impostors consult so much the Publick Good, as to advise so Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a Remedy; No, they are for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana</hi> and Minerals of their own Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, rather then for being beholden to <hi>Kind Nature, who bath provided some better and more forceable helps for the Poor Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased, ready at hand.</hi> In the mean time then, he is very impertinent, when, he as the representative of his Faction, saies, <hi>We are perswaded that they</hi> (meaning the Colledge) <hi>lookt upon the Waters with as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious an eye, as ever they did upon our Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Preparations.</hi> For in the first place,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110025:36"/>
the going to these waters is the Doctors frequent Advise to their Patients, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chronical Distempers; And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their Chymical Preparations sure were never the subject of the Colledges Envy, but Contempt.</p>
            <p>But let us attend; he opens as if he were about to say some thing in these words, <hi>Who, that had not been Lazy and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, but would have found out e're this a Succedaneum to Natural Martial Liquors, that so powerfully rectifie the Spleen, &amp;c.</hi> Who, but an Ignoramus would aske such a question? This is done long agoe by the appointment of the Colledge, whose indefatigable pains and care in this very particular has been such, that there is not an Apothecaries Shop, almost throughout all <hi>England,</hi> but what for many years hath been furnisht with diverse Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chymical Preparations, both from Iron and Steele, whose Virtual Qualities are equivalent to those of <hi>Natural Martial Liquors,</hi> if not exceeding them; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever when there is no opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110025:36"/>
to the Wells, of <hi>Tanbridge, Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, Spaw,</hi> and the like, the Patient may be supply'd at home; and by this means too, <hi>The excessive sumption of crude Water to Prejudice</hi> may be prevented; though I must confess there are some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial advantages by drinking the Waters in <hi>Specie</hi> at the Spring head, which Art cannot supply.</p>
            <p>My Friend comes next to inquire into the Benefit of Convenient Menstruums, what may be done by insipid Liquors upon the Bodies of Minerals; Which I believe to be but little, unless they are reserated first by some Corrosive, which I take to be some thing of the Nature of our Master <hi>Vanhelmont</hi>'s Liquor <hi>Alkahest,</hi> without which, or some Succedaneum he does not promise you any <hi>Primum ens Veneris,</hi> and consequently not the <hi>Primum ens,</hi> of any other Metal or Mineral: But by the way, though this Operation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed without a Corrosive, yet it must not be such a one, as operates in the Nature of other Corrosives, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110025:37"/>
the Bodies of those Concretes dissolved in them, but as the <hi>Acetum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Esurinum, quod amicè soluit concreta in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrè illi injecta;</hi> by which means, e're twice three months pass, I intend to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto the World, for its publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and satisfaction, with all respect due to <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> His <hi>Primum ens Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> not placing the Honour he merits, and the Credit of the Medicine to my own contrivance, by concealing of its Name, under the notion of an <hi>Arcanum</hi> of my peculiar Invention.</p>
            <p>After this little digression, to bring my Discourse into its wonted Chanel, I am here to mind the Reader, how my Friend in all his Clamorous Scrible, as well in this Chapter, as else-where in his Book has been continually, both Accuser, Witness, Judge, and Executioner, whereby he takes occasion, not only to Vilifie the Doctors at his pleasure, but to foist in whatsoever he thinks may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Interest of his Quacking Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Whereupon in this Sixteenth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110025:37"/>
Chapter, having decry'd the use of the Waters, sayes he, <hi>For our parts, few of us depend upon these Mineral Fountains, having where with all to supply the wants of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and to procure sanity at home.</hi> I am sure all the mineral waters in the world, though of never so cleansing a Quality, will not be able to wash our Author from the stain of his foul and base designs; the stream of which runs all the same way, and drives directly at self-interest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least regard to the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; yet the better to palliate his Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, he will undertake to give <hi>Faithful Advise in general, to such as drink these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> which Counsel, though curtail'd, and disguised, is yet so methodically drawn up, and so expresly contrary to his own Principles, that it appears <hi>verbatim</hi> to be borrowed from those, he calls Dogmatists.</p>
            <p>The Title of Master <hi>Thomson</hi>'s Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter did at the first sight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me into a tolerable Good Opinion of him, and I was in some hopes, we
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110025:38"/>
should grow Friends; but in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal, I found the Text and the Comment, to be of so different a hue, that once more I was forc't to dip my pen in the same sharp ink, that hitherto hath dropt from it. The flattering inscription he hath prefixt is this; <hi>A Vindication of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Medicines from that false Accusation of being dangerous:</hi> The beginning of his Chapter is as specious, as the Title, and carries in the front an undeniable truth, (viz.) <hi>That it is a hard thing to strive against the stream of a Vulgar Opinion at any time, but especially, when countenanc'd and back't by Men of Eminent Knowledge and Fame.</hi> That Chymical Medicines are danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is rather to be reckoned amongst the Vulgar Errours, then Opinions; but yet this which seems an Errour, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stated, I am afraid will appear too great a truth, and harder for my Friend to strive against, if rightly understood; for indeed, the meaning of it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the undue preparation by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull hands, and tis upon this account
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110025:38"/>
               <hi>backt and Countenanced</hi> by those, whom he is forc't to confess to be <hi>Men of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Knowledge and Fame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis Evident, and something I have said before to the same purpose, but here I must repeat it, that the beginning and rise of Fame to Paracelsian or Hermetical Physick proceeded from some particular Physitians of the Colledge; whil'st the Quacks and Mountebanks of these times, as they never are wanting in that case, impudently assume to themselves, the repute of those beginnings, and from time to time, have continued the same cheat; So that, when ever any Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicine by the practise of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge began to get Credit, the Empiricks lying at the catch, have made it their business, either really to steal the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, or, which is all one for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to counterfeit the Medicine; and then in their Bills posted in every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Streets, they confidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the World a false Affirmation, which is, that by their great Travels, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110025:39"/>
long Study they have produced these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Secrets for the benesit of their Country. Thus by such shifts, they have all along crept into the Opinion of the Common People, in whose Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ther's never wanting a readiness to joyn with irregularity, rather then to adhere to any thing, that carries the face of Order and Authority.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these subtil insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they could never have gotten such a Repute in the World, but that they Politickly made an advantage of the Factious Principles then abounding in the Common People of our late Unruly times, when the Common Interest was to be carried on by crying down Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning; then these Illiterate Fellows spit in the face of all the Liberal Arts and Sciences: And, as at that time, in point of Divinity, the Fanaticks of that Faction bawling against Learning, as Idolatrous, and Superstitious, yet to delude the World, and better to carry on their Design, made use of necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110025:39"/>
persons, that were Scholars, and of Jesuites too, who (though for another End and Interest) were ready to be transformed into the shape and habit of Coblers, or any other mean Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, pretending hereby they Preached by the Spirit. The same Tricks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices have been continually used by our Fanaticks in Physick, who as well knew the current of those Times, did run in oposition to all Just Authority: But they will find their case to be different, and the modesty of those Discreet Men rewarded, who chose rather to let such snarling Whifflers go on, as things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, then appear contentious with such, who by their own growing Enormities (now Justice is in the hand of the Proper Legislator) will prove their own Destruction.</p>
            <p>Our Authour does not at all Decline from the common custome of other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks, who alwayes wound the True Physitians with their own Weapons; wherefore he is not ashamed in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110025:40"/>
Chapter to tell us, that it was the <hi>Galenists course in the Infancy of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Science, to cry down Chymistry, with all might and main, conjuring the world, that they should avoid all Chymical Medicines, as most dangerous, damning them all without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction;</hi> How the Doctors are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in this particular, and what Great Patrons they alwayes have been of true Chymistry, I have already made out sufficiently, and cannot say any thing to these last lines, without being guilty of Tautology, and vain Repetition; Besides, I find he himself gives the same Exposition, in this Hypothesis, <hi>If they be not well prepared;</hi> which is not so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent as he would have us think, since tis not impossible they should be well prepared, by such who are unprepared, as I may say, themselves, wanting the <hi>Sublimate</hi> of Art, and abounding with the <hi>Precipitate</hi> of gross ignorance: And hereupon I very readily fall in with my Friend, and say as he does, <hi>Who that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues for Spagyrical Medicines, doth not take</hi>

               <hi>it for granted, that they ought to be made by an Artist?</hi> But if I be not mistaken, this inquiry of Master <hi>Thomsons</hi> makes not at all for himself, nor his Ignorant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are as far from Art, as from fair and honest dealing: As in our dayes, so formerly there never wanted bold Pretenders, who would venture at any thing, for their private advantage, let the publick dammage be never so great, or the lives of men never so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; Such as would be thought Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, though they were not acquainted, so much as with Vessels requisite to Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor knew the Nature, hardly the Names, of those Minerals, with which they were to deal; certainly the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had reason to advise all people in general, against the use of any Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prepared by such hands, least it should come to pass that those Minerals dugg out of the Earth (ill prepared) should make room to bury those poor Mortals, whom such ignorant wretches were sure to murther.</p>

But now our Authour is mounted into the Chair, and speaks with Authority; <hi>You would,</hi> sayes he, <hi>do very well to reslect upon your Dispensatory, wherein (except some few Chymical lent you) all your Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations either omit to do what they should, or commit what they should not.</hi> He charges here the poor guilty Dispensatory with sins of Omission, and Commission, but at the same time betrays more of his own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or indeed presumption. Does he imagine that every man of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be swaid, or governed by his private observation; sure 'tis impossible he should be believed, and I am willing to be so much his Friend, as to think he does but droll.</p>
            <p>In Answer to his next preamble, I am sorc't to recite more of the Authours own Language then I am willing to give you the trouble of perusal, but because it carries with it more of his impertinent boldness, then most of the rest; I shall not think much of my own labour, to render it to you as followeth, thus: <hi>For</hi>

               <hi>Example,</hi> saith he, <hi>and Experience, which is the true Touchstone that must discover us; let any of you that is in perfect health pick out of your formal Apothecaries Book, stuffed full of supernumerary preparations, the most safe and active of them, that do you the greatest service, to the number of ten; weigh out the known Dose of any one singly, with the strictest curiosity you please; take each of you the same into your own Stomaks, and repeat the Dose as often as you dare; and so proceed likewise with another, and so to the residue of the ten: When ye have acted your parts, we likewife (every way sound) selecting ten of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's, will swallow down (without trusting to the Scales) a sufficient quantity of any one (that may be most suspected) which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly exhibit to the sick for their recovery; look how often ye have taken of each of your ten, so often will we iterate or duplicate the sumption of any one of ours. And then let any indifferent person judge who bears their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines best, having the fewest bad symptomes following, and so conclude accordingly whose are most dangerous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:110025:42"/>
That the madness of this Man may appear as well as his folly, I will meet him at the same Touchstone of Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very he desires (as above mentioned) and will give him leave to pick out any ten of those supernumerary preparations he talks of in the Dispensatory, and when he has done, the known Doses shall be weighed out; Then shall he also have liberty to pick ten of his own Arcana's, and without any Juggling or Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to his own Proposition here recited, I will my self, before any such as shall be chosen, and counted competent Judges, (allowing our selves to be equally sound) take Dose for Dose with Master <hi>Thomson;</hi> provided, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's be as candidly discovered to the World, as those Preparations in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensatory, which is but reason: And if Master <hi>Thomson</hi> refuse this, I may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally believe his bold Challenge, was no more then a plain Juggle; and his not <hi>trusting the Scales</hi> in the Dosing of his Medicines, gains so little trust to either,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110025:42"/>
that I am apt to compare him to an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirical Medicaster, whom I have known to perform his tricks upon the Stage, in a Market Town; whose way of deceiving the people, was by a pretended Antidote against Poyson, or any Infection; for which purpose he suborn'd a Fellow, that would take his pretended Poyson and Antidote, to counterfeit both Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Cure; but one day having neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to make some Antidotes ready, when the Fellow before all the People had taken his Dose of Poyson, and there was no Antidote at hand, the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Empirick presently commands one of his Servants to fetch a piece of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison of a leg of Mutton, and cut it in the form of his Antidotes, which was all that he gave at that bout; and when they had done, with a good round Oath, he affirm'd it as good an Antidote as the best: The truth of this story being so Eminently known to some others as well as my self, compared with Master <hi>Thomsons</hi> careless dispensing of his Doses,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110025:43"/>
makes me much mistrust his Medicines. Hence one may conclude certainly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his Medicines are invalide, or that expression of his, a <hi>sufficient quantity,</hi> to be like the rest of his Equivocations; but take him which way you will, he surely intends to play the Hocus-Pocus; his Medicine, and the Medicasters Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton differing but little in effect, only the Mutton is more Nutritive, and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines chips in the Porridge; And <hi>these are the Medicines,</hi> sayes he, <hi>we commonly exhibit to the sick for their recovery:</hi> How sad then must the condition of those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients be, what little hope can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of recovery, from such Medicines as these? Medicines, that may be given by guess; let any man judge whether this be not <hi>hitting the mark with as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, as those People called Andabatae, that fought with one another winking:</hi> And thus has he practised <hi>hab nab,</hi> by his own confession, <hi>out of zeal for the good of his Neighbours for some years;</hi> and he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des this Chapter with an admonishment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110025:43"/>
to all that are desirous of being improved in the Jatricall Art, <hi>To acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the practicall use of those Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines they do profess;</hi> but the pains and study he injoynes them for this Achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, me thinks is abundantly more then's needfull; for 'tis not a business of labour, but impudence, to be an Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; and their Medicines cannot be truly Jatrical, because they dare deliver them out to their Patients, without trusting to the Scales.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Thomson</hi> very well knowing what makes for his Honour, does fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently throughout his whole Book, and particularly in his Eighteenth Chapter speak of the Colledge of Physitians, as His Adversaries, whom he is pleased to introduce here, as if they did <hi>Much glory and vaunt in their method of curing, asserting, That if a Man have never so Excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, if he be ignorant therein, he cannot discharge his Duty as he ought.</hi> As to the terms of <hi>Glory and Vaunt,</hi> they are but the continuation of his ill language; the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110025:44"/>
subsequent words speak a truth, which is, and deserves to be own'd by all sober and judicious persons; for Method is the life of all Science, without which, a man that knows much, is but confounded with a farrago of notions; the want of this in His brain, has made him so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contradict himself, and in this very particular given me advantage to confute him out of his own Assertions; <hi>Tis not the Laboratory,</hi> sayes he, <hi>or specious Furnaces that make a Spagyrical Philosopher, no more then a vast Library of Books will of themselves make a Learned Scholar;</hi> And I may consequently add, no more then a multitude of Excellent Medicines will make a Good Physitian; for the cause is not at all different; Furnaces, Books and Medicines being no further useful, then as they are judiciously understood, and methodically apply'd to their respective ends: I would aske the question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Physitian, being to cure a Feaver would not be ridiculous, if he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Patient a Medicine proper for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110025:44"/>
the Gout? Or if our Authour were to be cured of his Vertigo, 'twould be counted proper to cut his Cornes. But is this Method, <hi>We pray,</hi> sayes my Friend, <hi>any more then a short way of healing Maladies?</hi> I answer him, 'Tis the shortest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases can be capable of; some of which are so inveterate, they are not presently to be removed; others, whose roots are not so deeply fixt, are more sodainly pull'd up, and eradicated; In both which, the Physitian is directed best by a good Method, and orderly procedure: Should a man find a Box of Carpenters Tooles, and thereupon rapt up with his good fortune, presently fancy himself a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Would not you laugh to see him instead of a Saw to take up a Chisel, or for a Hammer use his Axe, but yet his work all this while is, in a manner, at a stand; whereas, if he had gone orderly and methodically to work, he might have done more with his Saw in one hour, then he could perform with his Chisel in a whole day: Thus it is with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:110025:45"/>
those Quacks who stumbling upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Good Medicines, and ignorant of their right application, are so far from making a progress in any cure, that they rather go backwards, strengthning the Disease, and not their deluded Patients: The rest of this Chapter is spent in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dirty Language, but his tongue being no slander, I think it not necessary to rake in the kennel; and this I forbear as a friend to my Authour, for the more that is stirr'd, the more he will stink; ill Language alwayes having this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that it does, <hi>redire in Authorem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inscription of his next is, <hi>The Helmontian Method;</hi> and it fares with it, as in other places, that it is not at all answered by the contents of the Chapter; wherein he plainly declares in effect, that the method of the <hi>Helmontians</hi> is to use no method at all: And after a long &amp; tedious canting to no purpose, he comes to his old way of Challenging; <hi>Moreover,</hi> sayes he, <hi>We declare that we shall take twenty sick persons, that have Acute Feavers of what</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:110025:45"/>
               <hi>kind soever, and of these twenty we will ingage to secure under God sixteen of them, upon the fifth or sixth day after our approach, or to give a Prognostick, upon the same dayes, how the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease will terminate; in which, if we fail, we shall be willing to suffer accordingly, supposed that ye come to the like tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am afraid here Master <hi>Thomson</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons without his Host; for the difficulty in this case wil be to find twenty persons, though sick of Feavers, so mad, and hot headed, as to put themselves into his hands; this he so well knows to be his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that he carries himself as cowards usually do in the like case, who ever seem most eager to fight, when they are sure the Company of Standers-by will not permit the tryal: But tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, our Friend <hi>Engages to secure six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> of the forementioned number, <hi>or to give a prognostick how the Disease will termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:</hi> I easily believe he may do one of the two without dispute, but most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the latter; for I suspect he may give them such a dead - doing <hi>Arcanum,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:110025:46"/>
as upon the sumption of it the <hi>Disease</hi> and <hi>Patient</hi> may <hi>Terminate</hi> together; and this way I my self will ingage he may <hi>Secure</hi> the whole twenty; and it shall be done in such a manner, that none of them shall ever be in a condition to open their mouths against his never failing practise: But they shall confesse by their silence, he has cured them of all Diseases: And 'tis well known, this is the way for the most part which they take, <hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a languishing wretch, tortured and racked by some cruel malady,</hi> as our Authour phrases it, by putting him out of his pain, but in the worst sense; wherefore in this extraordinary brevity, and compendious dispatches we cannot expect <hi>Method,</hi> which is requisite only where multitude or confusion is to be reduc'd into order, and not to be seen in one single attempt of a Quack, that has but one Salve for all Sores.</p>
            <p>Upon such a like account it is, Master <hi>Thomson</hi> makes inquiry (addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Doctors) <hi>What signifies it if ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:110025:46"/>
               <hi>with hundreds of Medicaments, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by your own Apothecaries?</hi> Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that this question is not singly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a plea for his <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but does implicitely aime at the ruine of the Apothecaries; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to perswade the World, that many Medicines, and the Profession of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, are equally insignificant; and this further appears by what he sayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, concerning <hi>Preparations made with his own fingers;</hi> for it seems, Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> besides his Panacea, has some Auxilary Preparations; But I will be bold to say, If his Interest would give him leave to be honest, and deal plainly, that he will not be able to produce one Medicine among all his thirty Auxiliary Forces, but what he is beholden for to some Apothecaries Shop; but because our Empiricks craftily use known Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines by obscure names, this cheat is not so easily demonstrated,</p>
            <p>Thus hath my Gentleman shown our Doctors <hi>the way,</hi> not <hi>to redeem the credit of</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:110025:47"/>
               <hi>this noble Science,</hi> which he has indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to stain; but yet <hi>to restore it to its pristine renown;</hi> yes, such as it was in the days of Yore, when <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius</hi> were Deified for two or three good Receipts; and <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaure past for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Physitian; in succeeding Ages Physick acquired a greater growth; and then knowledge generally increasing in the World, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> though far exceeding their Predecessors, were yet esteem'd but as Men; This Noble Science from its small beginnings grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees, is arrived now at the highest top of perfection in the most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Colledge of <hi>London,</hi> in which there is not one Physitian, but far out-shines <hi>Apollo</hi> himself, with his brightest rayes; and if they had liv'd in that Age, had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall'd him out of his Apotheosis: all this our Quacks are very sensible of, and envy; and no wonder they indeavour <hi>to reduce</hi> Physick <hi>to its pristine Renown,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause according to that Calculation they might expect to be inserted into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110025:47"/>
of Physitians, and claim a share in the Patent or Diploma, which the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge does injoy (to use our Authors phrase) <hi>ex condigno,</hi> these Quacks for the same reason excluded.</p>
            <p>This Rabble seeing themselves thus shut out of doors, have of late been knocking their heads together for a New Patent, of which Master <hi>Thomson</hi> seems to give a lame account in the twentieth and last Chapter of his Book, Entituled, <hi>Some Animadversions upon the late attempt to procure a Patent from his Gracious Majesty, for the Erecting a Colledge of Chymical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians.</hi> And here I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of His Sacred Majesties great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, together with His Exceeding care for the good of his Subjects, whose lives he is so tender of, that His Majesty would not intrust them in the desperate hands of unskilful Empiricks; we are all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give our most Humble thanks to our most Gracious Soveraign, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign never went beyond an attempt; but that this Monster was stifled in the birth,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110025:48"/>
and proved Abortive, which otherwise was like to prey upon, and devour us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of Authority.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, our Authour has the confidence to say, that <hi>Never was there a more Just, Honest, Desirable, and usefull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize set upon in this Nation;</hi> This last Hypocritical strain of his seems to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the late Rebels Declarations, wherein, under the most specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses of Justice and Loyalty, they hid the most Desperate Treason; which, when the mask was taken of, appeared in its own bloody Colours; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I fear my Friend has lost his jest, since all men are sufficiently awake to discover his Hypocrisie, that desires to betray so many innocent lives, under the pretense of preserving them by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</p>
            <p>Thus are the best of Virtues counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by the worst of Vices; and those that have the worst ends, are necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to guild them over with the fairest shews, or else they would never be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110025:48"/>
swallowed. The like carriage in our new-found Chymists, did for a time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some honest men into a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the undertaking, who, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the honey they perceived the sting, drew back from the Confederacy, and are become their greatest Opposers; just as it fared with some honest heatted men who had been drawn in, and out of good Principles had sided with the Factious in our late troubles; yet when the blackness of their designs appeared, they proved the most Zealous Loyallists.</p>
            <p>I am inclin'd to make use of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, as very pertinent to my present purpose; for just as the late Rebels De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they would make His late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, of Blessed Memory a Glorious King; so these Jugglers pretending <hi>To Regulate and Reform the present Enormous Abuses in this Excellent Spagyrick Science,</hi> talk of <hi>Advancing it to be Queen Regent in Physick,</hi> whil'it their real intention is to dethrone <hi>Her,</hi> and set up themselves. I Wonder much at the impertinence of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110025:49"/>
these Reformers! Do not we all know, that Chymistry is already fixt upon a good and sure fundation? If their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign had been honest, as it is found rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and fallacious, to what purpose, I pray, should it be put down in one place, to be set up in another? I would have these Jugglers know, (and indeed they know it full well) there is already Erected <hi>a Colledge of Chymicall Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> for I dare say, there are none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Doctors, that will not own this Epithite, and I am sure, none more justly deserve it.</p>
            <p>Besides, for a further Encouragement, and to shew a particular countenance to this Noble Art, His Majesty hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a peculiar Elaboratory of his own to be Erected, which is managed by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Febure,</hi> a Person of known Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Parts, who hath approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the World to be a most Able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist: So that these Up-starts must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude partly upon his right, as well as upon the Company of Apothecaries, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110025:49"/>
cannot justly be admitted Operators, their design being under that notion to become Physitians.</p>
            <p>The business of this new Patent, was carried on by Subscriptions to a Petition, which being speciously penn'd, invited some few of Note to favour the Design; but as I intimated before, they did upon second and better thoughts, re-demand their hands. The number of Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all sorts, as Master <hi>Odowds</hi> List in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me, did never exceed five and thirty, and when the forementioned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons had withdrawn, there were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, as Master <hi>Thomson</hi> confesses, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very illiterate persons, that were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Chymici umbratiles, mock Chymists, no whit exercised in Anatomy, and Botanicks, inexpert in the History of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, &amp;c.</hi> And these Petitioners pray for a Patent, that they may be admitted, in a Lawfull way, to make good that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Character Master <hi>Thomson</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:110025:50"/>
I hope I need not make any Apology to those Ingenious and Worthy Men, who out of their forward and true zeal to Pyrotechny at first consented: I am confident they themselves will acquit me, that nothing in this Treatise is directed against them; it must needs appear, that where I mention any, as concern'd with Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> I mean only those, whom he himself hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to be very illiterate persons. They may likewise be assured, as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to my self, I shall ever be ready to give a perfect Testimony of a true and real respect to them, as persons, whom I know without any sinister ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, to be such truly zealous labourers in the fire, that they ought not to be blemisht by those, who under the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Mantle of their protection, carry on unhandsome Designs.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> if he meets with any thing in my reply beyond his expectation, he must thank himself, and his own Stile, in whose
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110025:50"/>
Inke the Gall and Vitriol exceeds the proportion allowed by others in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Menstruum. If I have toucht him home, and to the quick, let him reflect upon his own unhandsome language, and he will see, that he is paid but in his own coyne; Yet 'tis a hard matter to make the account even, in regard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Thomson</hi> asperses two worthy esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish't Societies, Famous in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Imployments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctors, and Apothecaries, and yet falsely too; on the other hand, what I say to him, is truth, and tends to the setting out, in their own shape, an inconsiderable new-born Faction.</p>
            <p>But after all, I am yet to give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Character of Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> and his Fraternity, those whom I presume he means every where by his <hi>u S</hi> and <hi>w E,</hi> when he talks so highly of their great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployts: I shall give you likewise a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full description of his Elaboratory so much boasted on throughout (almost) his whole Book, as if it were the Eighth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110025:51"/>
Wonder of the World, as sure as he is the Eight Wise Man. Both his Faction and his Furnace, I am the better fitted to describe, having had an interview and personal Dialogue with him, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at a meeting in his own House, to which I made a Journey upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall of his Book, in order to this my then intended discourse: And to do Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Thomson</hi> all Just right, upon talking with the man, I found him as to Parts much beyond my first apprehension, or what it was possible for me to believe, making my conjecture only from his Book, wherein is so much self contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and impertinent abusive railing, that one must conclude the Authour, (though guilty of some Learning) far from any Ingenuity, as all those must needs be, who carry on their design by calumniating the most Eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of that Science, they pretend to own, and within the compass of which they aime at a reputation in the World to themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:110025:51"/>
I may justly tell Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> that he abounds less with Learning, then Choler, yet according to his proportion of each, he makes use of them together in charging others as being culpable of what his own Omissions have necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him deservedly to suffer, so that in effect, he complains of Justice; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less had he gone on in a regular way, he might have expected favour from the Colledge: That which I would say, is this; had Master <hi>Thomson</hi> sedulously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himself to the study of Physick, and taken his Degrees, as the custome of the Universities require, he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained License to practise; the Colledge never denying such as are lawfully qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified: But since our Authour has mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the end without the means he is to blame himself, if he be disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>I cannot positively accuse Master <hi>Thomson</hi> in particular, that he like the Faction he owns, intended formerly some other profession, and that failing in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110025:52"/>
attainment, either through Idleness or want of Ability, he stumbled upon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; yet this I am sure he is guilty of, that he attempted to fly, before he was pen-feathered, venturing upon Practise, before he was well versed in the Theory; which is one reason he is no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Method; But for the rest of his Crew, they are obliged by their Ignorance to be utter Enemies to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having nothing justly to plead for their irregular courses, must make up the defect with impudence.</p>
            <p>If so be, Master <hi>Thomson</hi> have in him something more then the rest of his Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Brethren, yet he is obnoxious to the same censure with them, in regard he is of the Club, and tis a common Rule,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Noscitur ex sociis, qui non cognoscitur ex se:</q>
            </p>
            <p>With this rabble he frequently meets, and bears his part in the Consort, where the burden of their Song is, railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Universities, the Colledge,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110025:52"/>
and all Learning in General, but the Doctors especially; who if they oppose them, do it not as they practise <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> and not <hi>Galenically,</hi> but as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to practise contrary to the rules of Order and Authority; But I am apt to believe the private quarrels of this Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are like to save the Doctors a labour; for there is now a great falling out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, as I perceive by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Thomson</hi>'s bitter inveighing against the Dropping Doctor, against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Odowde,</hi> and some others; in the heat of his railing, he told me, they especially were the persons that obstructed their business, and disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them from achieving <hi>That which</hi> (in their account) <hi>would prove so usefull to the World;</hi> But I would have Master <hi>Thomson</hi> understand thus much, that 'tis not any particular persons of his Faction that are his binderance, but the general design of imposing upon the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tandem aliquando,</hi> I am got into his Elaboratory which is so pitifull a sight, that it minds me of an Expression in his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110025:53"/>
Eighth Chapter, 'tis not the <hi>Laboratory or Specious Furnaces that simply make a Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi> For if his Skill in Pyrotechny were to be calculated by his Utensils, he would hardly be thought able to out - do <hi>Aniseed - Water - Robin:</hi> And whereas, in the beginning of the forenamed Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he sayes to the Doctors, <hi>Ye make your boast, that ye possess (as well as we) your Laboratories and Variety of Furnaces;</hi> His Elaboratory affords but two, one of Earth, the other of Iron; the former (like the Master) for want of <hi>Lutum Sapientiae</hi> being crackt, was tyed together with a Rope, that of Iron in case of necessity, for some Kitchin might serve as a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-Dish, for indeed it does not much exceed that Standard; when I compared his own large boastings of this Fabrick, with my ocular view, I began to think my Chymist had shew'd me the Extract, and Elixir of his magnified Pile, which I admired to behold, shrunk as it were into two Calcining Pots, and about that number of broken Retorts.</p>

Thus furnisht, my Friend intends to venture at <hi>Helmonts</hi> Liquor Alkahest, and makes no doubt of getting the Philosophers Stone, but I fear the poor wretch will be gravell'd in his design in the conclusion.</p>
            <p>But that Master <hi>Thomson</hi> and I, may part Friends, I shall do the ossice of one in advising him for the future, to raile less against those Worthy Men, whose Books he is not worthy to carry, and to be less injurious to the Company of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, to whom he owes some Respect, though he disown it; however as to the Doctors, me thinks he and his Brethren should the rather forbear, in regard their Scandalous Tongues can do the Colledge no more hurt, then the Arrows of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> do the Sun, when they aime at this Fountain of Light, which laughs at their vain and ridiculous Choler; and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their bolts, continues the same course, and inunterrupted motion above the reach of their foolish attempts: All
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110025:54"/>
the injury, that they are able to offer these Eminent Men, resembles but the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Curs, that bark at the Moon and Stars, but cannot by the importunity of their howlings, diminish eitheir their Splendor or Influence.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110025:55"/>
to be said to take it off, but the very bare repetition; However, it sufficiently sets the Authour out to the World for one, that has but a small stock of modesty and less religion.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of the Mans Ingenuous Confession of the Imposture, commonly practised by those of his rank, but not so frankly acknowledged by any, as himself; For I can make no other Interpretation of this specious promise, <hi>If poor,</hi> sayes he, <hi>I will not only cure them, but likewise give them considerable Gratuities for their Publick appearance in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their several Cures:</hi> This is to me an evidence, that he trades with those that are in want, and working upon their necessity does by an under-hand agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hire them to bear witness to the Cure, that never was perform'd; and this trick of his managed with subtlety, might very easily make his Catalogue so numerous. I really believe, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting some few Cured by accident, he is forc't to this Expence in all other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:110025:56"/>
but the Pox; and in that particular these Empiricks have another fetch to help themselves; but when examined, it will prove of less credit, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, namely, their privy bargains.</p>
            <p>The French Disease, having so much of shame intayled upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Contracted usually from great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, 'tis the great care of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons punisht with it, to conceal it as much as is possible; and therefore such are sure to loose their custome, who tells tales: Under this colour, such as our Authour is, take occasion to Exagerate the number they have cured, setting them out, and their Disease by severall circumstances and degrees, and being excused from naming the persons upon the account of Reputation, they leave us no possibility of convincing them of their Knavery, but we must believe all upon their single Word: This I take to be most of the Reason, why the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease all these Mountebanks most pretend to the cure of, is the <hi>Lues Venerea;</hi> in this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110025:56"/>
particular it is, Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his Preface) would have us all acknowledge, <hi>His just and Christian Practises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Master <hi>Groomes</hi> great drift and design, I perceive is, to decoy the rich, and draw them into his Net; to this purpose he takes a very plausible course, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending much to the doing of good for Gods sake, and relieving the Poor that want Medicine; That this is the end of all his Charity is very evident from his own Discovery, <hi>He will traverse,</hi> he sayes, <hi>all the Streets, Lanes, and Allies, of this Great and Glorious City, to find out the Poor and Necessitous wanting help and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine;</hi> The conclusion of this is, that the over-weening man fancies, he shall <hi>Force the Rich to seek him;</hi> but alas, this Plot will not take; while there are Good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians in the Kings High-way, we need not go look such Cattel as he in the By-Lanes; and I would Advise Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> to Endeavour all he can, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Yeomen of the Guard; for going
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110025:57"/>
of their Errands, is still like to be his best imployment.</p>
            <p>'Tis high time to <hi>Assure the World that he scorns to Print a Paper to beg a Patient;</hi> Alas, that Cheat is worn thread-bare, and though at the first coming up, it served to delude for a time; yet now experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the emptiness of such like Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festo's hath made them as unprofitable, as they are common; This my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is very sensible of, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be above what he cannot reach; and instead therefore of posting up his Bills, he hath lately clapt on a face of Godliness, which he hopes will be his great gain: This strain runs parallel with his Railing throughout his whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; Hence springs such frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Conscience; so much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Diseased Poor; such Blessing of God; such imploring of the Great Creatour: But alas, I am afraid for him, this knack will hardly work upon the Brethren, and the Holy Sisters in the City; His Manners and Conversation is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110025:57"/>
so notoriously known, that he of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is like to make little advantage of his Hypocrisie; therefore he had as good pull off the Vizard-masque, and appear in his own shape.</p>
            <p>And me thinks he appears to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose about the two or three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth page of his Book; where having told a long story of <hi>William Miller</hi> Servant to Master <hi>Langston,</hi> whom, he sayes, he Cured of a violent Surfet, Feaver and Lunacy, in the close of the Narration, <hi>Complains he received not a sufficient Reward;</hi> This I thought was contrary to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but it seems 'tis only against his Pretenses: That which is most strange, and much surpriz'd me in a Man of his Seraphick temper, that professeth so much Piety, is, that <hi>thus disobliged,</hi> as he calls it, upon occasion afterwards, being sent for to the Mistris, he should out of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect spite and revenge, refuse to come; Nay, he so stood it out, <hi>That he would in no case be importuned to it;</hi> And this is the man, which has taken upon him the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110025:58"/>
Profession of Physick, only to do good <hi>for Gods sake.</hi> I cannot say after this, that he forgets himself, though he so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and boldly calls upon God <hi>To bear record with his Conscience,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Integrity and Single-hearted sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: No, this is the remembrance of himself, and the forgetting of God, whose Name he so vainly takes into his mouth.</p>
            <p>Such is the profane craft and subtlety of this man, that, from his Atheisticall Principles, he is careless of his Words and Protestations, as to the truth of them, so they do but carry on his design of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and get him a reputation with honest meaning men, who being by their own charity betray'd to him, may help to furnish him with money to spend upon his Vices: He, like the tempter, applyes himself in his Book suitably to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inclination of those he addresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to, and accordingly he has another way to tickle the fancies of persons ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, using divers vain and lascivious
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110025:58"/>
expressions; Nay, in a manner, down-right incouraging them to pursue their lusts, and venture for that loathed disease, because so obvious and easie to be cured by him; as appears by his <hi>Relation of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of great Worth and Fortune, who having got a Clap with a witness, came to him to be Cured within fifteen dayes, because his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns required he should then take a Journey;</hi> He like an impudent Wretch answered him (they are his own words) <hi>If it might be a Service to him, he should be as well Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as in all his life, and have time to get an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other if he pleased, and be Cured of that too in that time;</hi> And me thinks here it had been proper for him to add to all, that he would do <hi>This for Gods sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest part of his Preface (which indeed is the whole Book, the rest being as it were but an Index) is taken up in railing at the Doctors; this is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Place or Topick of all these Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancks Rhetorick: Their sole study (but all in vain) is to draw a Cloud over the lustre of these men that out-shine them;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110025:59"/>
and they think (but they are mistaken) to make their own couterfeit glistering by this means pass for Gold: I confess, some of these sort of Men do shew some Wit and Parts in their Calumnies, and make the best of their bad Cause 'tis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; but this Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> is so bold, and dull an Ignoramus, that, as we say of a Notorious Villain, He is one that shames the Gallows; So this Groom is such a Wretch, that he is a disgrace, even to his most disgracefull Party; and that in such a measure, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cry him down, and blush to own him.</p>
            <p>One of the most considerable Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Ring-leaders of this Faction, I take Master <hi>Thomson</hi> to be, and therefore I look on him to speak the mind of the whole Junto; besides, he hath been an Intimate Friend and Associate of <hi>O Dowdes,</hi> and consequently one that best knows him: From his own mouth, I had it to this essect, That he is an Illiterate Person, and so grosly Ignorant, that he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110025:59"/>
alone was able to bring into question, the Knowledge of all the rest, they for his single sake lying under the censure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, as ignorant as himself; and no doubt most of them did not much come behind him for this gift and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ignorance. Master <hi>Thomson</hi> told me, That the Ignorance of this Dunce alone occasioned the Obstruction of the Patent, which was lately in Agitation, for the Erecting of a New Colledge: In this I do not altogether give Credit to Master <hi>Thomson,</hi> but however it serves for my present purpose, to convince the World of Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> insufficiency, when his own Party, whose business it is to cry up one anothers Merit, shall bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon him for an unletter'd Groom.</p>
            <p>'Tis his gross Ignorance makes him so rude and saucy with the Doctors, as he is; if he had had any Learning, I am sure he would have had more civility, and better manners: What he undertakes to say of them, is as false, as his Declaration, (viz.) <hi>That he scorned to Print a Paper to</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:110025:60"/>
               <hi>beg a Patient;</hi> whereas he has spoyl'd many sheets onely to that purpose, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness his First, Second, and now a Third Edition of his Book publisht for the same design, and imbroidered with a long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of counterfeit Cures, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended now his own Fraternity has cast him off, to put in for the Monopoly, and prove <hi>Medicaster Universalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Gentleman (though such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist, that I think he seldome sayes his Prayers) has notwitstanding at last found out <hi>Amen Corner</hi> (and I wish it prove not a Formidable place to him) where he talks of a body, and where I have seen many dissected, that had more brains, I believe, then himself, and yet had not Wit enough to avoid that Destiny: By the <hi>whole Body of Amen Corner</hi> he talks on, he must be supposed to mean the their Situated Colledge of Physitians; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who for their Eminency and known Abilities in Physick and Anatomy, the King Himself was Graciously Pleased lately to Honour with his Presence, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:110025:60"/>
as a signal Testimony of His Affection to the Professors, as well as to the Profession, Conferred the Honour of Knight-hood upon the Worthy Reader <hi>pro tempore,</hi> (now Sir <hi>George Ent)</hi> together with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers signal Expressions of Favour and Respect to the whole Body of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: And yet such is the impudence of this ignorant Scandalous Fellow, that with strange impertinent, insignificant, and false aspersions he ventures to throw dirt upon those His Majesty thought fit so highly to Honour.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Perfasque, Nefasque,</hi> the old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign must go on; Self-interest and Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling must to be advanc't, and no way else is possible to effect it, unless it be by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying those that are most likely to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Cheat. Thus our Autorculus, and the rest of the Crew are of opinion, That if they do <hi>Calumniari fortiter, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid haerebit;</hi> and indeed the mischief is, that, to the ruine of many simple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they do it with some kind of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; but I hope for the future, all sorts
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110025:61"/>
of men will be more carefull of their lives, and not cast such pearles, before them that are ready to devour; And I wish this little Book might serve as a guide for some of the misled, to direct them, least they split upon this Rock.</p>
            <p>The Title of Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> Book, (viz.) <hi>The Poor Mans Physitian, Or, the True Art of Medicine, as it is Chymically prepared, &amp;c.</hi> Did not a little raise my expectation; I hop't to have made a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery there of something extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as to the Preparations of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, by the Art of Pyrotechny; which indeed was the chief Reason why I Esteemed it worth my while to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; for (Chymistry being both my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Delight) the improving my knowledge in this Art, is my sole Study, and that, for which I have not spar'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cost or Pains: But upon the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal, I found my self utterly disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For instead of performing what his specious Title promises, he obtrudes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World a farrago of <hi>Names</hi> and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:110025:61"/>
               <hi>Cures,</hi> most of which are notoriously false, and fictitious; so that what in the Title Page is the true Art of Medicine, is in the Book meer forgery, and the true Art of cozening.</p>
            <p>I would not be thought to speak at random, or shoot at rovers, as this fellow does his bolts, though it be in the case of so inconsiderable a person; and therefore that I might be furnisht to give a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Testimony of his insidelity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the dangerous consequence that must necessarily ensue upon his bold undertakings, I have taken no small pains to examine the truth of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, he so mightily boasts of, and magnifies himself for; and in truth I do not find one in ten to answer in the least to that he so impudently asserts in his Book: I do believe, if it were possible to trace him through his whole Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, one in twenty would not appear to give him a good report; and this sure comes far short of those Miraculous cures he would possess the World with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:110025:62"/>
of being the performance of his daily practise.</p>
            <p>If one may judge <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> I shall be able by shewing the falsness of some Cures he boasts of, give the world an Essay of the whole Muster: That which he particularly insists on and by a formall Preface bespeaks the attention of the Reader even to the least circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is the Cure of one Master <hi>Richard Rawlinson,</hi> mentioned in the fourth page of his Book, <hi>Living on the back-side of the Shambles, in New-Gate-Market;</hi> Out of my desire to know the truth, I went to him, being my Neighbour, and had with him some Discourse concerning this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he told me, he was brought very low by the Scurvey, and had been for a good space in a course of Physick for his recovery by the advice of a friend, and about that time, a Colonel of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance came to visit him, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him so ill out of pity sent presently for Master <hi>O Dowde,</hi> who very readily came, and after a cursory view of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110025:62"/>
               <hi>Rawlinson,</hi> appointed him some of his Medicine (without any inquiry what had formerly been given him) which operating with him, as well by vomit as by stool, gave him present ease, and freed him, but 'twas only from a Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matismus, caused by the effect of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Preparation, which his friend, and my acquaintance had given him (without discovering to Master <hi>Rawlinson</hi> the intent of the Medicine) in order to his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; with which method, who ever is acquainted, do very well know the Effect, and will not wonder, that Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> found my Neighbour in that Condition, he is pleased to call an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Distemper; but will rather admire he should call this a Cure, that did but only check the former Medicine, and turn the Humour another way, which every Artist in Physick or Surgery knows was a hare-brain'd rash undertaking, and in all probability, did prevent the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Cure; Master <hi>Rawlinson,</hi> not withstanding the repetition of Master
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110025:63"/>
               <hi>O Dowde</hi>'s Medicine, (being put out of his former course of Physick) remains to this day uncured, being still deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Scurvey, and shewing me spots upon his Arm, told me with his own mouth, that because he did not continue Gratuities according to his expectation, he heard no more of Master <hi>O Dowde.</hi> And thus I have given you an impartial account of the great Cure, which this false and impudent man would <hi>Have stand as a perpetual record to all Ages, against the sordid method of Galenical Prescriptions:</hi> But let this stand as a perpetual record to all Ages against Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> false and scandalous aspersions, for to my knowledge, what had been done before in order to this mans Cure was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Chymical Operator in Surgery, a Man so Eminently known to be able in his Profession, that had not this bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder prevented, Master <hi>Rawlinson</hi> might have at this time been perfectly well.</p>
            <p>His great Idol being thus thrown down
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:110025:63"/>
before the face of truth, all the other pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Imps and Cures of little moment must needs be sensible of the fall; and I shall put some of them to the tryal, if they are able to stand the test: as I take it, two or three of them well shaken and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being found too weak and tottering, will be sufficient to give us an estimate of the whole Tribe, and plainly evince, that they are all either absolutely forg'd, or only the effcts of chance.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with Master <hi>Adams,</hi> a Brewer in Saint <hi>Thomas Southwark,</hi> whom Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> is pleased to say in the third <hi>p.</hi> of his Book, <hi>He Curedof a violent Gout in two dayes of Medicine,</hi> which I must confess to be a very expeditious Cure of such an inveterate Disease; But 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, not performed, for a Friend of mine, a person of known Credit, afflicted with the same pain, willing to be eafed, was inclined to believe what he so much desired should be verified in himself; but he was not altogether so credulous, as to venture upon Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> without
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:110025:64"/>
a particular inquiry into the certainty; whereupon, going to Master <hi>Adams,</hi> he was satisfied by him to the contrary, and told, that <hi>O Dowde</hi> was a lying Fellow, and that he was no better then he was before the taking of Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> Medicine; the like account has been given me by divers of those persons mentioned in his Catalogue, within these few dayes.</p>
            <p>A second I went to speak withal my self not long ago, by Name Mr. <hi>Rawley a Baker neer Barking Church in Tower-street; this man</hi> (says O Dowde) <hi>was under a five years Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, Lask, and Bloody Flux, a Patient so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as to call men, and Angels to witness against the Barbarous inhumanity of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that stile themselves Doctors, &amp;c.</hi> 'Twould be too troublesome to relate the whole Fable; to be brief therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a lamentable, and as false a report, he tells you, <hi>This Man after wishing for death, at last with a terrible Dropsie became his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, his Leggs and Thighes swoln, not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginably to be moved, and hard as boards, yet in Eleven dayes Medicine cured by him.</hi> The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110025:64"/>
Man himself was at that time a sleep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bed, and I received the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narration from Mistris <hi>Rawley</hi> to this Effect, that as to Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of her Husbands Disease, 'twas in part true, but he was so far from being well or cured in Eleven dayes, that he was half a year his daily Patient with little benefit; and that Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> having received divers gratuities, did at several times after, bring more of his Medicine almost for the space of a year, till at last, either for want of those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Gratuities, or for shame he had not yet Cured him, from that day to this he never appear'd: Her Husbands Leggs, and Thighes being swoln as much as ever, it seems Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> can cure the Dropsie without the removall of the Symptomes.</p>
            <p>A third lye he tells, is of Mistris <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Friend,</hi> who unfortunately became his Patient, he says, for the Falling Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and relates the Story in the twenty seventh page of his Catalogue, to which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:110025:65"/>
for brevity sake I refer the Reader: Some terrible fits of the Mother indeed she had, for the Cure of which, by the Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some Friend, that was deceived into an Opinion of Master <hi>O Dowde,</hi> she was Boarded at his House, where he Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick't her at his old rate; this poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman by the excessive, or (to use his own phrase) <hi>The wonderful Operation of his Three and Twenty times Medicine,</hi> had so lost her Spirits, that she became deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Lethargy, which he minces into <hi>an Indisposition and Drowsiness:</hi> After this, she had the Small Pox, but recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that Disease, she went on in the former course of Medicine, till her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy was attended by a kind of Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and her former fits so much heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thned, that when they were upon her, she would stare, and start, like one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly out of her Senses, and in the times of her intermission, her face was puft up and bloated; which by one of Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> Figures, he calls in his forty sixth page her growing fat, <hi>After twenty</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:110025:65"/>
               <hi>nine dayes of Medicine, to the Operation of at least Two Hundred Vomits, and One Hundred and odd Stooles, grew Strong, Chearfull and Fat;</hi> which Fatness was such Bloatiness, that they (indeed) who had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, might look on it as the usual habit of her body: This poor young Gentlewoman, whose Cure this impudent man so much boasts of, dyed in one of these fits, to the great grief of her Friends, and in particular her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is at the very Name of <hi>O Dowde</hi> like a distracted person, to think she should be so indiscreet as to suffer her self to be deluded by such a vain bragging Impostor. This Relation was given me by the Gentlewomans near Friends, who likewise told me, they dare not mention <hi>O Dowdes</hi> Name to her Mother in any case, least by the disturbance of her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, she should fall into the like pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate fits with her Daughter.</p>
            <p>After these several Convictions, I take it for granted, that all sober Men will know Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> for a Lyar, and I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110025:66"/>
doubt not but he will have his due, and proper punishment, which is never to be believed.</p>
            <p>Certainly, had this Man been of sober Principles, he would never have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so much Vanity and Frothiness in several places of his Scribble; tis so gross, that 'tis hardly fit for modest eares: Some of that which is most cleanly, I met with in a passage concerning a young Gentleman, whom he Cured of the Pox: After a long up-braiding of the Doctors under the notion of <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> with a tedious Method of Curing the Old Gentleman <hi>(as he calls it)</hi> to shew his Dexterity that way, he brings in for Witness; <hi>A Witty and Accomplished Young Gentleman, who some years since, from a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Gonorrhea, was run into a most prodigious POX, and almost Two Years course of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; who afterwards becoming my Patient, was perfectly Cured long since; And many Moneths after getting an Inveterate Clap, was in lesse then Ten dayes cured by Me; and then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly assured me, that he now was satisfied,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:110025:66"/>
               <hi>that in a Clap, nothing more was needful, then to Pray the Physitian</hi> (not to the God our Authour so often invocated) <hi>and pay him well, and to it again, for it was Cured as soon as a scratcht finger.</hi> This is the <hi>Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans</hi> Descant upon <hi>the Old One;</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>O Dowde</hi> gives him the stile of <hi>Witty and Accomplished,</hi> flattering him into the humour of <hi>Paying Well,</hi> and as it may be guest by this Familiar Dialogue, finding him sit for his Company, they became Cronies; by which Debauchery you may likewise guess at our Authours vain Conversation.</p>
            <p>As it was tedious for me to examine every particular in Master <hi>O Dowdes</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, of those he sayes he has Cured, so it would be to as little purpose to make a New Catalogue of All those I may say he has Killed; If I should undertake it, I am of Opinion, I could fill a Book as Large as his own; for when I made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after those whom he Cured (in his Book but no where else) I met with several Tragick Stories of his bold under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110025:67"/>
I shall recount one or two, that Master <hi>O Dowde</hi> may take notice of, and add them in the next Edition of his Book.</p>
            <p>The first was one <hi>Thomkins,</hi> at the spread <hi>Eagle</hi> near <hi>Fleet-Bridge,</hi> who was another of his Patients for the <hi>Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but his Medicine wrought so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently with him, that he dyed of a Scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but while under those Gripes and Tortures, occasioned by his Potion, would often say if he recovered, he would be revenged of him, and if he dyed, which he did suddainly after, he was confident <hi>O Dowde</hi> was the cause of his death.</p>
            <p>Another was a Maid-Servant, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately became his Patient, in <hi>Long-Lane;</hi> she upon taking of his Medicine, which wrought so violently with her, presently died, having strange kinde of Cramps and Fits; divers others I am furnisht to recite, but I forbear to trouble my Reader, whom I am confident I have already satisfied, and more will nauseate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:110025:67"/>
This Master <hi>O Dowde,</hi> though never so desperate in the exhibition of his <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> as he all along phrases it, yet in his manner of Dispensing, he uses a more then ordinary caution: I made a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this, as well by his carriage, set out in his own Book, as from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of several of his Patients: His way is never to trust his <hi>Medicine</hi> in the hands of his Patients, but they must either in the presence of Himself, or his Boy, take down whatever he gives or appoints; and in my Opinion, this can bear no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, then that he is afraid his Knavery should be discovered in using some common rejected preparation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shew of his own invented Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Arcanum.</p>
            <p>Just such another Fellow is Master <hi>Lockier,</hi> (and I think these Geese are sitly coupled together) who by difgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Stibium,</hi> hath exposed to the world his <hi>Pilula, Radiis solis extracta,</hi> and for some considerable time, hath sold it for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110025:68"/>
Sixteen Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce; whereas, to my own knowledge, the same quantity, of the same Commodity, might be had without any trouble in any Apothecaries Shop for Three Pence: Such kind of Cheats as these are frequently put upon the easily deluded and credulous people, by such Politick Empiricks and Falsifiers in Physick as these.</p>
            <p>I leave it therefore to Master <hi>Lockiers</hi> choyce, whether he had rather be couut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Knave, or a Fool, one of the two he cannot avoid; for having Publisht in Print, that there is no Antimony in his Pill; either he is so ignorant, he knows not what Antimony is, or else he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to deceive the World: Though for my own part, I was well satisfied, and found divers of the same Opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it to be a Mineral, &amp; that nothing else could Operate in so small a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet notwithstanding, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction or the World, I made an Experiment, in the Publick Elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Colledge, before divers of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110025:68"/>
the Fellows, in order to a Pyrotechnicall Resolution of this Pill, as followeth.</p>

               <p>AFter the dissolution of half an ounce of Master <hi>Lockiers</hi> Pills, in a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Spirit of Wine, which served onely to take away the mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous substance, with which they were formed into those small proportions; I found a remaining powder, which after it was dry, answered (as I thought) in colour and weight to <hi>Vitrum Antimonii;</hi> for further discovery, I pulverized half an Ounce of <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> and in the opinion of all that were present, there was no ocular demonstration to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but that they were all one: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that it might be put beyond all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I melted down Master <hi>Lockiers</hi> Pills, and out of that half Ounce, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Two Drams and Eleven Grains of pure <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony;</hi> after this, I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:110025:69"/>
melted down the same quantity of <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> out of which I also did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the same quantity of <hi>Regulus,</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but five Grains, which is not onely an undeniable demonstration, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Lockiers</hi> Pills are altogether Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, but as evidently plain, that they are nothing else but <hi>Vitrum Antimonii,</hi> powdered and formed into those small Granula's, in which form he has so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly sold them all <hi>England</hi> over.</p>
               <p>And now what will be the dangerous consequence, and hazard to many mens lives, to whom these Impostors thus unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly offer their Medicine, without any consideration or respect, either to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Disease, habit of Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Patient; but in all cases, to persons of all Ages and Constitutions, at a venture, give it in like quantity, I say, what evil event must ensue such absurd practises, I leave to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of All Rational Men.</p>

               <salute>Worthy Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I first undertook an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to these indirect Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in Physick, I also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to offer something oy way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, or rather a most Humble Address to You; The President, Fellows, and Commonalty of the Kings Colledge of Physitians in this Famous City; As also to the Master, Wardens, and Company of Apothecaries, in order to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of some Enormous abuses, that within the space of some fevv years past, have crept into the general Practise of Physick.</p>
            <p>But having perused a little Book En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110025:70"/>
               <hi>A Letter concerning the present State of Physick;</hi> Written by a Person of Quality, and without dispute great Learning, who has so effectually and fully discust the whole matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed such excellent means and wayes, as well to prevent the like for the future, as for the advancing all the <hi>desiderata</hi> of this <hi>Profession;</hi> in all which his principal aim is, the restoring of this Practise of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to its antient Constitution, which, as this Worthy Gentleman sayes, <hi>Till good Learning came to be over-thrown and laid wast by the Furious irruption of the Goths</hi> (though it now stands devided, between the Chirurgeon and Apothecary, was then the sole care of the Physitian onely; and tis very true, they did then offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in all the faculties of Physick: But it is observ'd likewise, that this Profession in general never flourish'd better then it has in these three Branches, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, Chirurgeons, and Apothecaries; nor has there been a greater improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Physick, in any Age of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:110025:70"/>
World, then what has been made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Thirty years last past; and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume without disparagement to any, I may affirm, this to have been brought about, by the Industry and Pains, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of the Honourable Society of Physitians in <hi>London,</hi> as well in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Anatomy, as Physick: Nor has the Chirurgeons, and Apothecaries been unuseful in this advancement; but each of them in their respective Sphears, have been Exemplary to our Neighbouring Nations.</p>
            <p>Then, what remains to the perfect advancement of this <hi>God-like Profession,</hi> but a reuniting of the whole Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of these Branches) into those true and amicable respects, in which current, to this day Physick has so well prospered; and the rather, because, as this noble Gentleman has well observ'd, it might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>Be lookt upon in respect of these (though additional) two very Worthy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Men (Chirurgeons and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries) as a thing extreamly unreasonable to</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:110025:71"/>
               <hi>undertake such an alteration, as the restoring of that antient way would necessarily intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce:</hi> Besides the great difficulty must needs be expected in bringing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to its intended perfection, it may probably be conjectured, that then the continuance of more time, with some other inconveniences falling in, may again produce the same exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I humbly suppose, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same sentiment (in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) with this Noble Gentleman, the best expedient, for the rectification of all past abuses, and to free this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Profession of Physick from all those degenerating Vipers, (that do not only eat out her bowels, by their sinister practises, but by their illiterate, rude behaviour, stick on it, like dirt) will in my opinion be found to be, if the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would please (continuing to own the improvement of Rational Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry) as an addition to all their former manifeftations; procure (as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:110025:71"/>
advises) by an address to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, a Publick Authority, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that all Apothecaries may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd, to buy those Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in their Publick Elaboratory for the use of His Majesties Subjects, or else give satisfaction to the Colledge, that they have the same of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to the end, that no Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations may be taken into their shops, from the hands of any unskilful or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Operator, but from such only as shall be allow'd by the Colledge; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because there are several in this City, who have serv'd an Apprentiship to this profession, and are esteem'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of such Integrity, that what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines soever they sell, the Colledge (to whom in obedience they will be ready to give satisfaction in this point) may acquiesce in their just prepatation; for further satisfaction to the Colledge, I humbly propose, that the Master and Wardens of the Company of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, would please to Enact, under a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:110025:72"/>
penalty, that from henceforth none of their Members, shall use, or put to sale any dispenst Medicine, but what they either make themselves, or for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in their Trade be furnisht by some Member of their own Society; since that by this means the Mystery of Physick will not only be preserved with her due bounds, but the profession will be much advanc't, and that door, by which all the fore-mentioned abuses crept in, will be stopt up: Thus much I humbly offer as my own private thoughts and desires, begging pardon, if I have too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</p>
            <p>I cannot after all, better conclude then with the words of that incomparable Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle; Since then, Worthy Doctors, Your selves look upon Rational Chymistry, as an Excellent way of enquiry into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things, and managed with sound <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> an excellent way also of preparing Medicines; Since you are as much conversant in <hi>Chymical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thous,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:110025:72"/>
as any others, and have as many, and more assistances, of learning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to judge of them; to all which I may very well add, since you have also a Perfect and Candid Resolution to Countenance and Improve them; as I am Bound in Duty, so I humbly make Bold to Offer the Continuance of my Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Service, in what ever your Honours shall be pleased to imploy,</p>
