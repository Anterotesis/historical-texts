         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
TRANSLATOR
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of This ſmall Piece is altogether
unknown to me, and as to the Name I ſuppoſe it
is a made one; becauſe neither the place where
it is Printed is expreſſed, nor the Printers
name. I conjecture the Author of it to be a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi>
by reaſon of his great kindneſs for that Religion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in his Title page, and throughout the Book, calling
it every where the Evangelical Religion. Beſides, in the
beginning of the Third Section he falls very ſharply
upon the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> as if none had
been guilty of the Crimes there charged but they. But be
this as it will, I am much better aſſured the Book was
Printed beyond the Seas and imported into <hi>England,</hi> both
by the Paper, Print, and Perſon of whom I had it.</p>
            <p>I have taken the pains to turn it as well as I can into
Engliſh, becauſe I conceive it may be uſeful to ſome of
my Countrey men who cannot read it in the Original; and
if I ſhould happen to be miſtaken, the wonder will not be
great.</p>
            <p>And yet I cannot forbear taking a little more pains
with it before I know what ſhall be the event of that
which I have already undergone, becauſe I conceive
there may be many other Cauſes of the encreaſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:53796:3"/>
abominable and comprehenſive ſin of Atheiſm beſides thoſe
my Author hath mentioned.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved by many Learned men who have
reflected on the tempers of the ſeveral Ages of the World,
that the more ignorant times have been ſtrongly prone
to Superſtition; whence, I ſuppoſe, was taken that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Proverb, that <hi>Ignorance is the mother of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
There being no people ſo ſeemingly Devout as the
Superſtitious. It would make a man amazed to ſee what
ridiculous things our Anceſtors believed in the dark times
of Popery here in <hi>England.</hi> No man can read the ſtory
of the Monk of <hi>Eveſham</hi> which fills three whole leaves
in <hi>Matth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1196.</note> 
               <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein is a very exact account of all
the Pains and Places of Purgatory. Or that in <hi>Guli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmus
Newbrigenſis</hi> concerning the two Green children
that were found at <hi>Wolpet</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 26.</note> and came out of
St. <hi>Martins</hi> Land, where the Sun never ſhines, and where
they never ſee any greater light than that of a twilight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I ſay, no man can read theſe paſſages in men of that great
capacity that they were of in compariſon of others who
lived in the ſame times, but he muſt admire the creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and ignorance of thoſe Ages: and if the great men
and Scholars could ſwallow ſuch things, we may from
thence conjecture how large the Faith and Belief of the
meaner people was.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide,<note place="margin">Quin &amp; vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus tempora ipſa, in Atheiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum proclivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ora (qualia fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt Auguſti Caeſaris) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilla fuiſſe.</note> the Age of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (in which
times our Saviour took upon him our Nature) were,
as Learned, Polite and flouriſhing times as ever hapned
ſince the Creation of the World; but then they were the
moſt corrupt too in point of Manners, and the moſt
Atheiſtical in point of Belief.<note place="margin">Bacon de su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitione</note>

            <p>That they were Learned will appear to any man

Horace, Joſephus, &amp;c.</hi> And we may be aſſured that all
the more Antient Greek and Latin Books which are ſince
<pb facs="tcp:53796:3"/>
loſt, were all then extant, and how much the Romans in
that Age envied the Grecians the reputation of Learning
will thence appear too, tho' as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
acquaints us about three Centuries after they became
wholly careleſs of Books and Learned men,<note place="margin">L. 16. c. 6. p. 27</note>

They entertained inſtead of a Philoſopher a
Singing man, and inſtead of an Orator a Teacher of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous
Arts; but that it was not ſo in the times I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is apparent from the great number of excellent
Books that were then written.</p>
            <p>But then the ſame Books will ſufficiently acquaint us
with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal corruption of manners that then
raged throughout the whole world; and God be praiſed,
tho' our times ſeem to be equal in Learning, they are not
yet ſo bad as thoſe were, in point of Morality.</p>
            <p>Nor did Atheiſm and her Siſter Hypocriſie rage leſs
in that Age than debauchery.<note place="margin">Cicero de fine bon. l. c. 7. Lact. de falſa relig. l. 3. c. 16.</note> The Philoſophy that was

of the Sadduces prevailed upon the great men of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
Nation at the ſame time which was not much better
than the Epicurean Philoſophy being but a ſort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
Atheiſm.<note place="margin">Joſeph. Ant. <hi>L.</hi> XVIII. cap. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was the covetous, ambitious, inſolent and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Hypocriſie of the Phariſees, leſs odious to God, and
miſchievous to all true Religion, than the contrary ſin
of Atheiſm; as appears by our Saviours conjoyning them
always in his ſevere reprehenſions and threats: and I
doubt not but much of the Impiety of that age ſprung
from mens obſerving the Vanity of theſe outſide Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to piety, and that in meer abhorrence of their
Villanies many run into the other extream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53796:4"/>
Becauſe it may ſeem a little ſtrange to moſt men
that theſe two effects ſhould ſpring from ſuch unlikely
cauſes, I will preſume to offer ſomething as the Cauſes of
them, tho' I ſhall perhaps pleaſe no body but my ſelf by
the attempt.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, Ignorance alone never produced any
Devotion in any man. But becauſe in every Age God
has exerted and manifeſted his Power and Providence;
thoſe times that had leaſt Natural Philoſophy in them have
attributed to him not only all thoſe great things which he
in reality did to demonſtrate his Power and Care of
men,<note place="margin">Apud imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos prodigii loco accipieba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ipſa aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum penuria—quod in pace ſors, ſeu natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; nunc fatum &amp; Ira Dei vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabatur. <hi>Tact. H. l. 4. c.</hi> 26.</note> but all thoſe Works of Nature too which they could
not underſtand, ſuch as Eclipſes and the like: by which
means men became ſo Credulous that they eaſily believed
any thing that was told them for want of ability to
diſcern Truth from Falſehood, and others that were
more Crafty did work upon this temper and drive on the
Cheat for their own advantage,<note place="margin">Quibus quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtui ſunt capti Superſtitione Animi. <hi>Liv. l.</hi> 4.</note> ſtill more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
the Superſtitious and fearful, that they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their own Wealth and Power by their needleſs Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
and fooliſh fear.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide in thoſe times in which Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philoſophy hath flouriſhed,<note place="margin">Parum Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiae natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis homines inclinat in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſmum, at Altiorem Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam eos ad Religionem circumagere.</note> men being by that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to ſearch into the Natural and Second Cauſes of
things, have many times from their diſcoveries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that there was no God, but that all things
ſucceeded in a Regular and Natural courſe; and if
there happened ſome things which they could give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of,<note place="margin">Baconis Ser. fidelis, <hi>XVI.</hi>
               </note> they either disbelieved them, or thought there
was a Natural Cauſe tho' they could not for the preſent
find it out.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſtrange, and to men unſearchable order
of the Divine Providence in the Government of the
World, has to Learned Men and Ages, been very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of Atheiſm; it is obſerved by <hi>Lactantius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53796:4"/>
that the proſperity of the Wicked,<note place="margin">De falſa Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia, l 3. c. 17.</note> and the miſery and
affliction of the Good and Virtuous was the thing that
gave <hi>Epicurus</hi> the firſt hint of ſetting up his Atheiſtick
Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>To which if we pleaſe to add the pride of men who
would be thought to underſtand every thing, to have no
dependance, no not upon God himſelf; and to be under
no reſtraint or aw: It will ſomewhat mitigate the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerveth <hi>that Knowledge puffeth up.</hi>
And there is nothing ſo certain as that the moſt Learned
and proſperous times which have ever gone together have
been the moſt proud and inſolent, and forgetful of God
and all Goodneſs, deſpiſing all Religion and Vertue;
whereas on the contrary, times of great Afflictions, Wars,
Famines,<note place="margin">Adverſae dein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de res admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuerunt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus in capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolium ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of this and all former Ages have ſprung from the
Pride and Security of men who thought they ſtood in need
of no God, by reaſon of their wealth and greatneſs, than
from any other cauſe whatſoever.</p>

have Wealth at their command, and leiſure and liberty
to imploy it as they pleaſe, do too often make a very bad
uſe of it, and when they have multiplied their ſins
againſt heaven till they can ſcarce hope for Mercy from
that infinite goodneſs that dwells there, and debauched
and corrupted their Natures, that they have but little
more of a man than the ſhape and ſpeech left, they then
begin to think it their intereſt that there ſhould be no
God to puniſh them: and ſo endeavour to perſwade
themſelves and others that indeed there is none. And
I am perſwaded, God in his Juſtice gives up many of
<pb facs="tcp:53796:5"/>
them to a mind void of Judgment, ſo that they become
uncurable to all but God; and that they are almoſt as
miſerable as the damned.</p>
            <p>To all this give me leave to add one Cauſe more
that ſeems almoſt peculiar to our times, the Factions and
Diviſions in Religion, and the fierce diſputes, and
fearful wars and devaſtations that have happened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in Chriſtendom, within little more than a Century
of years. Thoſe men that are not very fond of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being in theſe diſputes and quarrels a kind of Lookers
on, have remarked both the great miſtakes and foul
play of theſe Contenders, and have ſometimes been
able to ſatisfie themſelves that both ſides were in the
wrong, and have much oftner ſuſpected they might be
ſo, and have from thence drawn one general Concluſion,
that perhaps all this buſtle was about a thing that had no
real being in the world.</p>
            <p>And of thoſe that have been engaged in Parties in
theſe horrible Broils, I doubt not but when they have
ſeen things fall out quite contrary to their expectation,
tho' ſome have thereby been weaned from the world, and
from thence have inferred how vain it was to put their
truſt in man or any thing elſe on this ſide the grave:
yet others have turn'd Atheiſts, and called in queſtion
both that God and Providence that governs the World,
becauſe things did not go juſt as they expected they
ſhould.</p>
            <p>The very difficulty of chuſing the true Religion, amidſt
the various and contrary pretences, hath made others
turn mere Atheiſts to ſave themſelves the trouble of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
their ſeveral pretences.</p>
            <p>The very wearineſs and diſſatisfaction that others have
met with in frequent changing their Religion have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them at laſt to a perfect indifference for all, and
ſome have taken ſanctuary in down-right infidelity and
Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53796:5"/>
The abominable Hypocriſie of the late times when all
the Villanies that men could be guilty of, were uſhered in
by Faſts and Sermon upon Sermon from morning till
midnight with a prodigious Zeal, and no leſs apparent
Knavery and intereſt at the bottom, have had a very
ill effect upon others, and made them conclude againſt
all Religion for the ſakes of theſe wicked Pretenders
to it.</p>
            <p>The horrid perjuries and abominable deceptions
which have of later years been practiſed by our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
godly men, have had their ſhare too in this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>When there have at any time happened differences
in Religion, they have not only excited men to uſe
the utmoſt of their Reaſons and Learning againſt each
other, but Paſſion and Wit too have found their admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the bitter Sarcaſms, biting Jeers, and ſharp
Scoffs that they have made uſe of each againſt other, have
by degrees made all Religion cheap and contemptible, and
expoſed both the parties to the ſcorn of their common
Enemy, and eſpecially of Atheiſts.</p>
            <p>A man that ſhall reflect ſeriouſly on all this, will
hardly wonder that there ſhould be ſo much Atheiſm and
Impiety as there is, but rather that there is any thing
elſe to be found amongſt us; and certainly if the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Senſe of a God were not woven into the Nature
of Mankind, and engraven ſo deep in his mind, that it
is utterly impoſſible totally to deface it: And laſtly, if
God himſelf had not intereſted himſelf for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion, it would, it muſt have been long ere
this time totally extirpated.</p>
            <p>Religion and Civil Government do mutually ſupport
each other, he that has no Religion, deſerves no Faith
nor Truſt, he that does not fear God truely, will never
honour his King heartily, nor ſerve him ſtoutly and
<pb facs="tcp:53796:6"/>
faithfully. It has not been much regarded perhaps, but
there is nothing ſo certain, as that a Ranting, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,
godleſs Gallant is the worſt of Subjects; if it
were poſſible he could be faithful (which when it ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his intereſt to be otherwiſe, is not to be expected)
yet his Crimes are infectious, and he carries Gods curſe
where ever he goes.</p>
            <p>I grant he that will rebel against his Prince for
Conſcience-ſake is a dangerous Subject, but then he that
pretends to be Faithful and Loyal without it, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now this is another ill effect of our Diviſions, that
whilſt ſome are ſeduced by Ill Principles into diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to our Laws, and hatred of the Government; others
have taken the liberty to vent another ſort of Principles
that are deſtructive of Humane Society, Virtue and all
Government both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them both we are fitted for Ruine.</p>
            <p>Now both theſe inſufferable miſchiefs have been ſpread
and propagated by the Liberty of the Preſs, which hath
Midwiv'd into the World a number of Atheiſtical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
Books as well as Factious and diſloyal pieces; and
the former of theſe are as deſtructive to Government as
they are to Religion and good manners, without which
no Government can ſubſiſt long.</p>
            <p>And now to apply all this to my purpoſe, I ſay, the
worſt thing that can betide a man on this ſide Hell, is to
be given up by God to vile and baſe Affections, and
that which the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 30.</note>, <hi>the hatred of
God,</hi> which is the forerunner of Atheiſm, is the worſt
and baſeſt, the moſt deviliſh affection that can take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of a man, but yet is too frequently the effect of
Debauchery, Schiſm, Inconſtancy and neglect of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and therefore it is the intereſt of all thoſe
that have any ſpark of Goodneſs or Virtue left, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the paths that lead to this Precipice, to abhor all
<pb facs="tcp:53796:6"/>
that company that may lead them inſenſibly into this Gulf
of eternal Ruine, and deſtroy all their Reputations and
temporal happineſs into the bargain.</p>
            <p>2. That it is the intereſt of all that are exalted to any
places of Power and Profit,<note place="margin">Principis eſt ea maximè curare quae ad Deos pertinent, nam &amp; metuunt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ne quid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſti accipiunt à talibus—&amp; minus inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diantur, ut Deos habenti Socios, <hi>Ariſt.

common Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the utmoſt of their powers,
and however never to employ or truſt men of infamous
lives or wicked Principles.</p>
            <p>3. That it is the intereſt of all men to endeavour to
put an end to our Factions in Religion by all the Lawful
means that can be thought of.</p>
            <p>4. Seeing all theſe miſeries I have expreſſed have
ſprung from the abuſe of Liberty and want of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good Laws,<note place="margin">Licentia urbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, aliquando diſciplinà me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tú<expan>

freedom will at laſt lead us, let us heartily ſubmit to the
neceſſary reſtraints of Diſcipline and Government and
dread no ſlavery like that of being the bondmen of Luſt,
and the drudges of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And as to our Diſſenters, I deſire they would ſeriouſly
conſider the State of the Churches beyond the Seas, of
which this Author hath given ſo exact an account, and
then reflect upon the little good they have got or done
by all their oppoſitions to that Religion which God by his
Providence has eſtabliſhed amongſt us, how many horrid
ſins they have been guilty of under the mask of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and perhaps more out of ignorant Zeal than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional
Wickedneſs: and laſtly, how deeply they are
concern'd in the Guilt of all the Debauchery and Atheiſm
of the preſent Age, by weakening the force and abating
the reverence that is due, and in all probability would
otherwiſe have been paid to our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical
Governours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53796:7"/>
And becauſe the very root of all our Diviſions is a
quarrel about our Ceremonies, I deſire, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
ſeriouſly upon the laſt Section of this diſcourſe, and
if they cannot be ſatisfied with the proceedings of their
Superiours, yet at leaſt to abate ſomewhat of their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
inflexible ſtubbornneſs.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the ſence of Foreigners is like to be more
prevalent with them, than that of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men who are
ſuſpected to be intereſted, I will give them for a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the ſenſe of a Learned <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant in the
ſame caſe. The perſon I mention is the Author of the
Hiſtory of Calviniſm and Popery in Parallel, or, an

            <p>
               <q>It is fit to be known in the firſt place that We, <hi>(ſaith
he)</hi> would not enter into a Schiſm with a Church, nor
make any great controverſie for a ſmall number of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies:
which being of no great uſe, do yet do no
great injury to Religion; and for this Cauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be concerned to ſee a number of good and devout
people beyond the Seas, out of an exceſſive Zeal for
the ſimplicity of Worſhip, divorce themſelves from the
Religion Eſtabliſhed by the Prince and State, becauſe
of a few Ceremonies of ſmall importance, the uſe of
which they will not endure. Schiſm is the greateſt of
all evils; and if it were true that theſe Ceremonies
did ſome harm; yet they can never do ſo much miſchief
as the ſcandal of Separation and Diviſion do. But
yet after all this, I believe theſe Ceremonies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and that theſe men are very imprudently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53796:7"/>
This Gentleman is no friend to Ceremonies as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this, and in what follows is very importunate
with our Governours to lay them aſide in favour of the
Diſſenters; and yet he cannot but call the Separation
made on that account a Schiſm, and an imprudent and
ſcandalous one too, and pronounce our Ceremonies inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
which is enough to condemn our Diſſenters, and
make them liable to anſwer to God and Man for all the
miſery, ſin and bloudſhed that have already hapned in this
quarrel or ſhall hereafter happen.</p>
            <p>And if the little Religion that is left in the World
do with ſo much difficulty maintain it ſelf againſt the
Atheiſm that grows upon the age, now that the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Religion is defended by Laws, made venerable by
a few innocent Ceremonies, and the Countenance of our
King and Government; I leave it to all men to judge
what would follow upon the breaking down our Fences,
and expoſing it naked and without Authority to all that
pleaſe to put a helping hand to the pulling it down.</p>

            <p>HE that ſhall compare the Preſent Times
with thoſe that are Paſt, ſhall hardly fall
upon an Age of more ſolid Learning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
diſcourſe, or ingenuous Arts, than
the Preſent. But then alas we find by experience,
that there was never any thing ſo great but it left
room for its own Ruine: for by how much the more,
Learning and Arts have ſpread themſelves, into ſo
much the narrower bounds is Piety contracted; ſo
that while the number of Learned men increaſeth,
that of the Pious is daily diminiſhed. Not only the
Jeſuits, but the Members of the other Orders,
though deſpiſed by the former in compariſon of
themſelves, do abundantly ſhew that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is repleniſhed with many Learned men.
Hence many have admired how it ſhould come to
paſs that this Religion which is compoſed with ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53796:9"/>
ſtrict, ſuperſtitious, and artificial a reſpect to the well-being
and Polity of the Pope and Jeſuits ſhould not
only abound with Atheiſts, but even ſeem to be the
ſource of Atheiſm it ſelf. Thoſe famous men, the
Elegant <hi>Theophilus Spizelius,</hi> the Religious <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Reiſerus,</hi> the once moſt Reverend <hi>Joannes Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus,</hi>
the Zealous <hi>Gisbertus Voetius,</hi> the Learned <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua
Arndius,</hi> though they have otherwiſe at large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
of Atheiſm, yet they do not touch this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But to him that rightly conſiders it, the thing
will not be obſcure: for <hi>Italy</hi> where the Seat of the
Popedom is, produceth ſublime and active Wits,
who when they grow up, accuſtom themſelves to
humane Learning, Hiſtory, Criticks, Politicks, and
thoſe other ſtudies which belong to Publick affairs
and the ſecrets of State, who in the mean time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the ſtudies of Piety, Scripture and Divinity as
mean and eaſie things which will contribute very
little to their Reputations in the world.</p>
            <p>And altho' <hi>Petrus Bembus</hi> is long ſince dead, yet
there is ſtill ſome or other of the number of the holy
Cardinals and Biſhops who can ſuggeſt ſeaſonably to
a young Divine, intent upon the Bible, that <hi>thoſe
trifles do not become a grave man.</hi> So that theſe are
only Divines in name, while they purſue the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
ſorts of Learning, or any other rather than The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology;
eſteeming it fitter for men of ſmall capacity,
and their Curates, than for men of thoſe Elevated
parts they are of. The Jeſuits whoſe ſupreme Law
is their Intereſt, do here dexterouſly lead their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
for being weary of Divinity and in our times
very ignorant and unexpert in it, they are very anxious
and careful in the cultivating the Arts of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
publick affairs to their own Ends; raiſing and
fomenting Wars, ſearching into the ſecrets of State,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53796:9"/>
deceiving the minds of Princes, in finding out curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things, and ſuch as may beſt ſerve to divert the
Court Ladies, and in conveying Gun-powder with
a Godly ſimplicity under Kings; and in other ſuch
like myſteries proper to this moſt uſeful ſort of men.
They will not like their Predeceſſors be troubleſome
to Printers in the publiſhing Commentaries and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
on the Bible, they have their <hi>Pererius, Bonfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
Cornelius Alapide, Janſenius, Lorinus, Eſtius, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinianus,
Maſius, Sanctius, Pintus</hi> and <hi>Tirinus,</hi> and thoſe
that take pleaſure in them, may make uſe of them, and
they who having nothing elſe to do, may write more.
The preſent life needs other ſtudies, <hi>Jeremias Drexeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and <hi>Carolus Scrivanius</hi> have written enough for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion:
Now let the <hi>Italians</hi> help the <hi>Italians,</hi> the
books of <hi>Nicolas Machiavel,</hi> and the diſcourſes of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus
Boccalini</hi> on <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> are to be now imployed.
The preſent Pope ſets a good example to the Univerſal
Church; who that he may ſeaſonably and prudently
curb the forces of the great <hi>Turk</hi> which hang as a
cloud over <hi>Italy,</hi> the Seat of the Popedom, ſpares nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Councel, Labour, nor charge, that not only <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
may be delivered, but alſo that the Wars may be
continued againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> by the Emperour and his
Confederates, and not be hindred by the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>But then how the Great men, Kings and Princes
ſhould be induced and perſuaded to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſtudy of Piety and good
Works, and diverted from Adulteries, the too great
oppreſſion of their Subjects, from coveting that which
is not their own, from raſh and unjuſt wars; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to others, and not to the Pope, though he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the ſupreme Biſhop. The Popedom is now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
by Arms, and all other things are trifles. I grant
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not had a better or wiſer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53796:10"/>
Pope than the preſent is, in this laſt Age. But then all
that love the Chriſtian Religion and Chriſt, cannot
digeſt this; that he ſo careleſly connives (that I may
repreſent it ſmoothly) at the manifeſt and apparent
ſins which ſtrike the eyes of the whole world, of his
moſt Chriſtian, moſt Catholick Kings, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of the Faith, and yet this good Pope, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with others, does not once frown, but clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
at all things, leſt he ſhould loſe his Authority,
his Revenews, and his very Kingdom; which is not
obſcurely aimed at by ſome body. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the part of a wiſe man to retain the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
cuſtom of ſending Conſecrated Clouts and
Blankets, with the great peril of his Reputation, and
in the mean time be too Prodigal and careleſs of the
Epiſcopal Correption and Admonition to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of our duties, the amendment of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and laſtly of all thoſe things which tend to the
good of ſome whole Kingdoms Some eſteem the dela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>
of this Pope in the conferring the Cardinals hats, and
other Eccleſiaſtical promotions as a principal part of
his wiſdom; nor do I deny that there is in this a ſecret
which I can eaſily conjecture the cauſe of: but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of them at the Will and Recommendation of the
Lord Protector of the Faith (which new title is now
on the Anvil at <hi>Rome,</hi> perhaps without the conſent of
the King of <hi>Poland)</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the
Count of <hi>Starenburg,</hi> may ſeem to the wiſer part of
mankind too too profane and remote from the Divine
and Apoſtolical prudence. Alas whither does the
Pope fall! how barefaced does Atheiſm approach this
man! Theſe great men have excellently plaid their
parts againſt the common Enemy, and done that
which becomes ſuch perſons, and therefore the Pope is
bound to prefer their Clients, and thoſe they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53796:10"/>
in the moſt Holy Church redeemed with the
very blood and Torments of Jeſus Chriſt? that ſo
the Body and Spouſe of Chriſt may pay that debt
which the King of <hi>Italy</hi> owes to theſe Noble men for
preventing the dangers which threatned his kingdom.
But thus our Lords the Popes do always proceed
where they diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſtical preferments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pleaſure of great men, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of the Edification and Salvation of the Church
and its Members.</p>
            <p>II. The Youth of that Religion in the mean time
being ſeaſoned with theſe ſtudies and examples (if
they have any, and have not forgot and loſt all in the
Camp,) is imployed as occaſion ſerves in thoſe offices
which become void, and purſues the ſame courſe of
life; for the Church and Church affairs are either
committed to ſome Curate, who is for the moſt part
very ignorant, or are managed by theſe men ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
and negligently that they ſeem to mind nothing
leſs. They are wholly taken up with the ſublime Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
of the Mathematicks, Criticks, the ſecrets
of Polity, the Rights of Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they have
either never taſted at all, or lapt like the dogs in the
<hi>Nile,</hi> the Inſtitutions and Compendiums of Divinity,
the methods of Doctrine, and the Expreſſions and
Phraſes of the Bible and approved Claſſick Authors;
in the interim they are unconcern'd for the truth of
the Religion of their forefathers, and never attain the
knowledge of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catechiſm, in the courſe
of their whole lives; being oppreſſed with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Beautiful books, which tend more to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Advantage, and the burthen of other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
I have ſeen many Libraries where the Catechiſm
was not to be found. And from thence it proceeds
that it is ſo ſcarce amongſt them that I could not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53796:11"/>
without much difficulty get a Copy of it for my own
uſe. And thus they live from time to time till ſome
Calamity, Temptation or diſeaſe awake them, and
ſeparate them a little from thoſe vain tho' ſublime
ſtudies, and then in their diſtreſſes they ſeek ſolid
comforts, correſpondent to their great Wits. For as
for the Maſs, the Invocation of Saints and Angels,
Purgatory, the infallibility of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the reſt of thoſe Whimſies they keep them in View,
but like Learned men deſpiſe and ſcorn them, as not
built upon ſo much as a rational foundation: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt he muſt be rather an Aſs than a Learned
man, that ſhould from his heart believe theſe fooleries.
They either have not the Works of the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
or the Pope and Inquiſition will not ſuffer
them to read them. For they ſo ſeverely prohibit the
reading of them eſpecially in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that they
will not ſuffer their own Anſwers of our Books to be
publickly ſold, leſt men ſhould detect the weakneſs
and falſhood of their Superſtition, from the oppoſite
Arguments and their frivolous Replies; tho' all our
Arguments, according to the cuſtom of theſe men,
are repreſented with the utmoſt diſadvantage, being
mutilated, lamed, feigned and falſified; which was
obſerved long ſince by a Learned man <hi>Edwin Sands.</hi>
Theſe men,<note place="margin">Europae ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, or a View or ſurvey of the State of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern parts of the World, <hi>p.</hi> 121.</note> I ſay, being overtaken by Temptations,
examining the whole frame of the Popiſh Religion,
as ſuch, with their acquired and experienced Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
find at laſt, that it is nothing but a pack of meer
frauds, introduced of purpoſe to delude the ſilly Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
preſerve the Majeſty of the Pope, and uphold the
Monaſteries, and in them eſpecially the Idle, Lazy
Jeſuites and Monks. Which things being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected,
and ſurvey'd with great care, the ſumm is eaſily
caſt up, and is no more than this, <hi>All Religion is a

meer cheat,</hi> all ſeek their own Advantage, ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
others obliquely, What if at laſt in truth, <hi>there
is no God?</hi> for I am fully convinced, that no man of
good Learning and ſenſe, ever entered the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church for the ſake of Religion, and the quieting of
his Conſcience without any other bye-ends: for the
chiefeſt parts of Popery are ſo contrary not only to
the Scriptures, but to common ſence almoſt, that they
are forced to patch up a parcel of Fables and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all ſorts to recommend them to the moſt rude
and ignorant part of the People, which yet they will
ſcarce allow to be true; from whence it comes to paſs,
that they can neither underſtand nor teach any thing
of more certainty than theſe falſe Principles, which
yet is abſolutely neceſſary here, when the Salvation
of the Soul is under conſideration, and the buſineſs
is to be tranſacted with the moſt perfect Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
that is, with our own Conſcience, where there
is need of the moſt certain maxims to enable us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Devil, when ſin or our own Conſcience of it
tempts us. For in matters of Faith, we cannot effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
make uſe of any other teſtimonies than thoſe
of the Scripture, nor can any invented reaſons be
brought, which the Animal man ſhall not find to be
ſuch, except thoſe of God. Therefore the Scripture,
becauſe it only is certain, doth moſt inſtruct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Conſcience. If any thing beſides this is feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe it is uncertain, it cannot ſecure and quiet
the Conſcience. And thus far for the preſent of the
Popiſh Religion.</p>
            <p>III. I come now to the Proteſtant Churches, and
here if they who call themſelves the Reformed <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
and <hi>Arminians,</hi> did as much abhor and deteſt
the thing, as they do the name and profeſſion of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi>
and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> they would be no leſs careful of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53796:12"/>
abſtaining from Vice, and induſtrious in the exerciſe
of Virtue and Piety; than they are now obſtinately
engaged in the wickedneſs and debauchery, and an
impious courſe of life. Nor would they be leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of keeping of Commandments of the Beſt and
greateſt God; than they are now fearleſs of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But to ſpeak the truth, almoſt all of us do rather
fear the Envy, and deteſt the Name, than bear any
Averſion in our minds for the thing, which would
otherwiſe be teſtified by our Lives, Actions, and
Manners. For what ſhall I ſay? as I live, and as I
deſire Chriſt ſhould ſhew me mercy, I am aſhamed
and grieved to ſpeak how we live. Can they believe
the Immortality of the Soul, who live little better
than beaſts? or can they be throughly perſwaded that
there is a reward laid up in Heaven for the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
a puniſhment appointed in Hell for the Wicked,
who ſcarce fear to break the Commandments of God
in any thing; as if they thought GOD were an
empty and vain ſound, and that their Souls ſhould
periſh with their Bodies? and altho' we ſhould grant
that there are ſome who fear God, and doubt not
but he will aſſign Rewards and inflict Puniſhments
according as every man has deſerved, yet they are
certainly very few, and ſcarce ſo many as the gates of
<hi>Thebes,</hi> and the mouths of the rich <hi>Nile:</hi> and yet
how much leſs is the number of thoſe whom the
dread of the divine Juſtice can reclaim from Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and miſchief, or perſwade to amend their
lives? but what need is there of many words? No
man vigorouſly purſues heavenly things deſpiſing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
no man is ſenſible of the Anger of God againſt
ſin, no man changes his Vices for Virtue, no man
cures his offences committed by the leaſt acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
no man is recalled from Baſeneſs by Modeſty, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53796:12"/>
from ſin by the fear of God; the lives of all are ſo pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
with great and abominable crimes, that I need
ſay nothing of the leſs and almoſt daily faults?</p>
            <p>IV. For altho' if we will judge rightly, Luxury is
the fault of every Age, the over ſumptuous expences
in Diet, the exceſſive magnificence of Dinners and
Suppers, Surfeits, Revellings, Whoredoms, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Violence, Injuſtice, neglect of good manners, and
the like; are charged, as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves, by the men
of all Ages upon their own times, nor was there ever
yet any Generation of men without faults: and as
the ſame Philoſopher goes on, of this our Anceſtors
have complained, we do, and our children ſhall; that
the Manners of men are totally ſubverted, Villany
reigns, and the affairs of Mankind go on impairing
and deſcending to all manner of Crimes: yet to ſpeak
but the truth, in this Age of ours, the liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any Villany is encreaſed to a prodigious
height: The neglect of all Order and Diſcipline, the
Peſt and Corruption of good manners, and whatever
elſe of Vice, impiety and turpitude can be conceived,
have all of them ſo prevailed, that Impiety and
Atheiſm do almoſt ſeem to have invaded the lives of
men, and to have erected their kingdom in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and to conclude, there ſeems to be but little
liberty allowed to Laws, and the utmoſt that is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Luſt. I durſt Averr, that in this corrupted and
debauched Age, all ſorts of wickedneſs have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that degree, that it is ſcarce poſſible to add any
thing to it, nor does any improvement ſeem poſſible.
For what ſort of Wickedneſs and Villany is wanting,
which if it were ſuppoſed to be thrown in, would
make our times worſe and wickeder in any part?
ſeeing we are come to this, that we cannot endure to
be told of our Vices, nor patiently bear the reproof
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53796:13"/>
that we have juſtly deſerved, or if there be ſome few
that can endure it, yet even there, according to the
Proverb, we do but ſing and tell ſtories to the Deaf.
Either I am deceived with the <hi>Tragedian,</hi> or this is
not the way to Heaven. Alas, alas, what is become
of Chriſtian Piety?</p>
            <p>V. But omitting unprofitable complaints by which
we ſhall gain nothing, or very little, having thought
very often with my ſelf, from whence this fooliſhneſs,
and vaſt and boundleſs Calamity could proceed, I
reſolved at laſt to inquire into the cauſes of it, and
why we ſhould go on ſo inconſiderately, negligently,
and as it were, with our eyes ſhut, in a thing of that
nature, that only our ſafety depends upon it; but it
may ſeem to be ſafety it ſelf. For the cauſes of this
miſchief being once found out and publiſhed, it will
not, (as I conceive) be difficult afterwards, to find
out ſome remedies for this evil, which if they prevail
not upon the obſtinate, what hope is left I know not,
and whether there is any or no, God only knows.</p>
            <p>VI. And in the firſt place, I conceive, the principal
and chiefeſt cauſe of this, to proceed from the neglect
of Youth and Schools: for in the firſt place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other things, Magiſtrates ought to take care
that parents ſhould educate their children well, and
tincture them betimes with Chriſtian Piety, the
knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and holy manners. And
certainly it is very much the intereſt of all Chriſtian
Societies, that both the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
ſhould take care that the Youth be rightly and
devoutly educated, both by their Parents and School-maſters
and Tutors in the Univerſity, becauſe in this
does almoſt the total ſafety of any Community con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and therefore they ought to be very diligent to
ſee that theſe men do their duties in the Religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53796:13"/>
of their children, and in the improving their
Scholars and Pupils by an excellent diſcipline. If this
had been done or might yet be taken care of; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Atheiſm and Vice had never grown to that height
they now are at, and without this, no Laws will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
prevail. For whereas Laws puniſh Villanies
that are already committed, a good Education pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the perpetration of thoſe crimes that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a chaſtiſement; and whereas Laws correct Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Education reſtrains them, from whence we may
take our meaſures to obſerve how much greater effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
is in good Education, than in the beſt Laws.
That I may not add, that thoſe who are ill brought
up, do afterwards put off all fear and reverence of
thoſe Laws that are made to puniſh crimes. And
therefore this was always one of the firſt cares of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Magiſtrates; not what penalties they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
upon lewd and wicked men, but how they might
prevent their Subjects from doing ill things. And
becauſe they thought the moſt likely way to effect
this, was to accuſtom their Youth to live Well and
Religiouſly from their Infancy, and to ſee that their
Parents did Inſtitute and Educate their children as
they ought, they eſteemed it no ſmall part of their
duty to take care of it.<note place="margin">This, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges make me think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was a <hi>Hollander.</hi>
               </note> But how careleſs the <hi>Dutch</hi>
parents are of performing this duty, and how indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and remiſs they are towards their off-ſpring, is
known to every body. Their children accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to delights and pleaſures from their tendereſt
years, neither do they abſtain from filthy and obſcene
diſcourſe, or impious and blaſphemous words againſt
God. They wear Silk and rich cloaths of various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
Military ornaments, Ingraven Breaſt-plates,
foreign habits, and great ſleeves: they do all things
fiercely, confidently and impudently, and nothing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53796:14"/>
with modeſty and ſhamefacedneſs; they revere not
their Parents: for here, to the amazement of all men,
the children have acquired an abſolute dominion over
their Parents, and are in poſſeſſion of a liberty not to
reverence the Ancient, nor bear patiently with their
equals; and to conclude, they do not ſo much deſire
as in fact ſhew, that they can do what they liſt: they
are neither deterred from evil by the reverence of
men, nor fear of God, of which laſt they ſcarce ever
heard: they take no notice of Religion and Piety,
and leſs of Virtue and Honeſty. And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
are many words? Parents in our times do ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their Children by their own lewd examples, that
they cannot correct them with any Authority: for
he that teacheth that in his own manners which he
deteſteth in his children, accuſeth himſelf of his own
crimes, whilſt he chides them for theirs. With what
face I beſeech you, can a man blame his child which
he hath corrupted by his ill example? when yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
a Parent ought to ſpeak nothing before
his children, which is not fit to be ſpoken, nor to do any
thing that is indecent or diſhoneſt to be done: but
ſhould rather live ſo honeſtly and religiouſly, that his
children may propound his way of living as a pattern
to be imitated, and by his example, as in a glaſs, learn
from their Infancy what to purſue and what to avoid.
Let Parents therefore remember that they are under
a neceſſity of living well and honeſtly, and to take the
utmoſt care that not the leaſt footſtep of diſorder and
turpitude may appear in their lives, that they may with
the greater Authority correct the manners of their
children, leſt thoſe vices they reprehend in them,
ſhould be found in themſelves, and ſo their reproofs
loſe their weight, and by their own defaults the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Parent ſhould become vile and light with
their own children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53796:14"/>
VII. And now when children are grown up and
fit to be diſpoſed of to Maſters, to be eſpecially
then accuſtomed to all right and honeſt Actions; and
be inſtructed in Piety, good manners, and learning:
what then? Why I am both aſhamed and unwilling
to ſpeak, but yet I will do it, rather becauſe I muſt,
than becauſe I would; and in the firſt place, there is
hardly any Schools to be found with us, but then how
few good Schools in <hi>Curland, Lithuania, Livonia,
Swedeland, Denmark,</hi> in the Dukedom and Marquiſate
of <hi>Cleave,</hi> and in other Countries profeſſing the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Religion, God knows, I found in my travels?
yea, and how few of thoſe which are to be found in
<hi>Holland,</hi> can bear the ſcrutiny of Religious and Pious
men, who ſeek the welfare of that Common-wealth,
and of Religion, without any reſpect of Perſons;
many beſides my ſelf can be my witneſſes. Without
doubt our Religion had made a greater progreſs, if we
had taken care to found more Schools. For, we can
never aſcribe the great barbarity and ignorance of the
Boors of <hi>Livonia</hi> and <hi>Curland,</hi> that I may not call it
their Atheiſm, to any other cauſe than the want of
Schools. And the Devil and his Inſtruments did not
in any thing ſo much contradict the Eminent Lord
<hi>John Fiſher,</hi> Superintendent general of <hi>Livonia,</hi> as
in his introducing Schools and Catechiſing. And the
Lord <hi>Spencer,</hi> and Lord <hi>Horly,</hi> have ſince experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
and perhaps do ſtill experience the like Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
ſtratagems, theſe excellent men being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all Enemies to their kingdom. The Jeſuits have
learned more wit at our charge, and our neglects have
afforded them a very plentiful harveſt. But that which
is yet more wonderful in this buſineſs is this, that thoſe
in whoſe power it is to Erect Schools in the Villages,
altho' they have children of their own, which for want
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53796:15"/>
of Orthodox Maſters they are forced to commit to the
Jeſuits,<note place="margin">If our Laws <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and ſo run upon an apparent and viſible miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
yet theſe, upon certain unknown private and
domeſtick intereſts, hinder the effecting this moſt
excellent and ſalutary counſel by all manner of ways,
upon certain and frivolous pretences. I do very much
fear that in the great day of Judgment the famous
and excellent virtues of the Heathens will condemn
our baſe Avarice and improbity; eſpecially the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Cimon</hi> towards the Poor, and the honeſty,
juſtice and fidelity of the two <hi>Cato's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. But even where there are Schools, many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
(for I ſpeak not this of all) do but prepare the
way for Atheiſm. For they for the moſt part that they
may win the love of the children, and not offend the
Parents, treat their Scholars too remisſly and ſoftly,
and do as it were overmuch looſen the reins of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
neither reſtraining them from Vice by chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor reducing them to Virtue by good advice.
The inquiry is not now, what a Maſter ſhould deſire in
his Scholar, but the Scholar would have in the Maſter:
They on the other ſide do not ground their Scholars
in Chriſtian Piety, inſtruct them in the fear of God;
nor form them to Modeſty and the other Virtues. They
think they have mighty well and faithfully perform'd
their parts; if they have in ſome degree inſtructed
them in Learning and Arts; but as for the knowledge
of Piety, the ſence of the Catechiſm, the Articles of
Faith, with their foundations in Scripture, as no body
inquires after theſe things, ſo no body delivers them,
nor in truth can they; the Maſters themſelves being
very ignorant of thoſe holy things. I confeſs ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and end with Prayers, but with what fervour
and devotion of mind it is not convenient to ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nor do they as they ought, ſhew themſelves innocent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53796:15"/>
and affable as Parents, but remiſs and diſſolute as
companions. And hence it comes to paſs that the
Scholars deſpiſe their maſters, and become fierce and
inſolent, loathing all that is good, and of an inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſtubbornneſs.</p>
            <p>IX. I wiſh the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
could well conſider the greatneſs of this affair,
and in chuſing School-maſters would yield nothing
to their affections, affinity, relations, domeſticks, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
or maids, nothing to the recommendations or
intreaties of their acquaintances, or even to mercy;
and certainly every body is not to be made a School-maſter,
upon any bodies recommendation, ſeeing the
Common-wealth is ſo much concern'd and intereſted
to have good and Learned maſters ſet up, who may
inure the minds of children to Piety towards God,
Humanity towards men, and adorn them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
manners and diſciplines.</p>
            <p>X. And yet it is impoſſible to repreſent how careleſs
men now adays are in this great concern. I remember
in my Travels, I viſited a fine City belonging to one
of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> where I knew a man who
by the favour of the Magiſtrates, was conſtituted
chief practick Phyſician of the place, and when his
Penſion would not maintain him and his Family, the
Magiſtrates as an Addition to it, gave him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their School, though he was utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of it, and very ignorant of thoſe things that
might fit him for that imployment. I ſpeak nothing
of the Book <hi>de Religione Medici,</hi> this is enough for a
wiſe man. On the other ſide, the beſt and moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
School-maſters, who are of approved Lives, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
manners, and of a known diligence in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſcarce find any acceptance any where, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
having ſo inſinuated themſelves in the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53796:16"/>
and acquaintance of the great men, and prevailed
ſo far upon them, that they think none are ſo fit to
undertake the care of teaching children as theſe, when
they are not better fitted for it, than an Aſs is to be
a Muſician. Nor can they teach any thing that is
worth one farthing: ſo great is their ignorance, and
yet they have an excellent faculty of concealing it.
Who knows not of what force kindred, the marriage
of a Kinſwoman, or maid ſervant if it ſo happen, is in
the diſpoſing of theſe preferments? and when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their ignorance and want of experience, they
find themſelves deſtitute of that Authority which
for the moſt part attends Learning: to counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the reputation of the other School-maſters who
are in ſome places numerous, they do not only looſen
the reins of diſcipline, that they may by that means
increaſe their Schools, but promise marriages to ſome
of the great men; by which means they arrive at that
reputation for Learning and Orthodoxy, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before they were truly thought the moſt ſilly,
wrangling heterodox fellows that could be, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they become moſt Learned, Religious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable.
So much is the man changed! I will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
this by an example after the School-cuſtom; not
long ſince two Students were call'd ſucceſſively out of
the Univerſity of <hi>Konigsberg</hi> to undertake the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the School of one of the principal Cities
of <hi>Livonia.</hi> The firſt of theſe by the marriage of one
of the great Church-mens daughters, was promoted
in the Cathedral Church without any difficulty, and
laid down his School-maſters place with great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The latter, who brought with him a wife
which he had married at <hi>Konigsberg,</hi> tho' he left no
ſtone unturned, and was perhaps equal to the former
in ſolid Learning, could never to this day attain the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53796:16"/>
honour of being a member of the Cathedral Church,
and I fear never, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of ſo much greater value are
women than men, that the husband ſhines by a light
he derives from the wife.</p>
            <p>XI. Now when the School-maſters ſuffer the
youth committed to their truſt, to be debauched and
run headlong into all kinds of Wickedneſs and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whoſe buſineſs it was with all poſſible care, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and ſeverity to curb their boldneſs and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and correct their fierceneſs, petulancy and
youth, prone to Luxury by ſeaſonable inſtruction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and chaſtiſement; what hope is there
when they become men, and come to a greater age,
of reforming them! for when both their Parents and
School-maſters ſuffer them in all ſorts of Vices, and
let them do what they liſt, and never take any care
to reſtrain their exorbitances, what wonder is it if
they become unable or hardly able to live without
thoſe Vices which they have been accuſtomed to
from their very infancy? ſo does cuſtom become a
ſecond nature. Nor is it at all probable, that he that
has lived looſely, and ill in his youth, ſhould become
honeſt and ſober when he arrives at manhood; nor
that he that was wickedly brought up, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
when he is a man. So much is there in the
habits that firſt are taken up by children, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by a long uſe. From whence comes it that
there are ſo many Adulterers, debauchers of Women,
Knaves, Drunkards, deſperate and prodigal Spend-thrifts
and Gameſters, ſo many Citizens contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with all manner of Villany and Wickedneſs,
but from this one fountain of the ill and perverſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Government of Children? for they that
attribute the debauchery of the Age to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
do without doubt need Phyſick. That looſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53796:17"/>
and impious Education and ill diſcipline, which is
now in uſe added to the negligence and diſſoluteneſs
of the Magiſtrates, who are more intent upon their
own private and domeſtick advantages than the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good; that I may make no complaints againſt
the Princes of the World, muſt certainly bear the
blame of all this Wickedneſs. Thus you have the
firſt and principal cauſe of the preſent Atheiſm in my
opinion.</p>
            <p>XII. And now I come to the next, which is the
contempt of the Clergy and Church-men. I will
not at large inquire into the Cauſes of this, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many of them have not brought this diſeſteem
upon themſelves by their own faults: tho' it is not
poſſible that our Clergy ſhould not be vile in the eyes
of men, while they ſee how baſely and poorly they
ſeek Church Functions and Preferments: how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they are of their people, and unconcern'd for the
Glory of God. Now I ſay, when men ſee all this, is it
poſſible that they ſhould not deſpiſe thoſe who ſeek
their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt? And
the very Clergy too, obſerve at time the ſmall eſteem
the people have of them, as appears by their frequent
complaints in their Pulpits, tho' they either know
not, or are pleaſed to diſſemble their knowledge of
the Cauſe, as if they abhorred the remedy more than
the diſeaſe, I will only add this, that the contempt of
the Perſon, for the moſt part brings with it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Office. Now how deep this is rooted
in the minds of the men of this Age, no man can be
ignorant. I remember I heard a perſon of no mean
conſideration at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> uſe theſe words, That he
<hi>valued his Cat as much as he did his Miniſter.</hi> Thus did
an Evangelical hearer ſpeak of an Evangelical Paſtor.
If any that were not of the Eſtabliſhed Church had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53796:17"/>
thought a little under valuingly of them it might have
been born, provided it had not been attended with
publick ſcandal, becauſe they have nothing to do
with them, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> bore with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
<note place="margin">Act. XVII. 18.</note> who call'd him <hi>Babler, and a ſetter forth of
ſtrange Gods:</hi> but when the Auditors who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his care deſpiſe his Admonitions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as if they were too good and learned in the
Scriptures, to be inſtructed by ſuch a man, as it does
not ſeldom happen that thoſe who have wealth and
power in the world, will hardly ſubmit themſelves
to the Church-diſcipline and inſtruction: there I ſay,
the contempt is not to be indured, becauſe attended
with the contempt of the Miniſtery, and tending to
the great damage of the hearers. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Tit. II. 15.</note> 
               <hi>let no man deſpiſe thee.</hi> For
I cannot allow the Expoſition of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and
others, who think that <hi>Titus</hi> was admoniſhed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himſelf ſo, both as to his Doctrine and Life, as
not to deſerve to be deſpiſed. For altho' it is moſt
certain, that integrity of manners does add to the
Authority of the Teacher, and render his Doctrine
more acceptable; and that a good life, as <hi>Primaſius</hi>
ſaith, makes the Doctrine of more Authority: yet
the very ſound and ſenſe of the words ſhew, that
the Apoſtle here does not preſcribe what <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould
do, but what others ſhould not do. <hi>Joh. Crocius</hi> upon
this place take it, that the Apoſtle did not here ſpeak
to <hi>Titus,</hi> but to the whole Church of <hi>Crete,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains,
that ſeeing <hi>Titus</hi> was commanded to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with their vices and errors, and to defend the
Truth and Religion, no man ſhould be ſo prodigal of
his Salvation, as to deſpiſe either his Perſon or his
Office, or prefer himſelf before him, as better or
more worthy. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here uſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53796:18"/>
as is obſerved by S. <hi>Hierom. Witteberg.</hi> and <hi>Fr. Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.
Comm. p. 1501. B.</hi> ſignifies thus much. When any
one being confident of himſelf that he is better than
another, deſpiſeth him whom he thinks beneath him.
And as being above him in wiſdom, thinks the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
perſon worthy to be deſpiſed. Therefore this
is to be imprinted in the firſt place, in the minds of
all that belong to the Church, of what Order or
Dignity ſoever they are of, that they ought to be
ſubject to their Miniſter, becauſe all are ſinners who
ſtand in need of Inſtruction, Exhortation, reproof
and Conſolation, all which are adminiſtred by the
Miniſters of the Church, by the word of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, &amp; therefore they are to be heard of all,
<hi>[as the Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. IV. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and Stewards of the Myſteries
of God.]</hi> But if there be any that will not hear, as the
greateſt part of the men of this Age will not, that
they are not to be connived at, but to be <hi>rebuked with
all Authority.</hi> As the Apoſtle directs in the laſt cited
place out of <hi>Titus,</hi> that they may underſtand (ſaith
the grave <hi>Balduinus)</hi> the Authority of the Miniſtery
excells all worthly Power. We have already the heavy
ſentence revealed againſt theſe deſpiſers, <hi>Luk. X. 16.
Matth. X. 40. Joh. XIII.</hi> 20. But if there be any
Drones and unworthy of the Miniſtery, let them be
driven out of the Hive. But as to thoſe who teach
the true Doctrine, and Religion, and Catechiſe in
publick and in private, and ſerve Chriſt and their
people faithfully, without any vain hopes of lucre out
of love: theſe I ſay, ought to have obedience, libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and reverence ſhewn towards them; leſt if we
act otherwiſe, by the juſt judgment of GOD we
ſhould be left ſo far to our ſelves, as to maintain Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,
Hypocrites, mercenary men; thoſe that are
covetous of great Revenues, carnal men who are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53796:18"/>
unfit for that ſpiritual work, idle bellies indeed
of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſuch as wallow in the
very mire of Pleaſures and Riches, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hapned, not only to our forefathers, but to
ſome of the moſt flouriſhing Churches of theſe times,
as we ſee with ſorrowful hearts.</p>
            <p>XIII. The ill, tho' frequent way of Preaching
gives us the third cauſe of Atheiſm. The firſt duty of
a Preacher, is to ſet forth the Power and Nature of
Religion, and the ſecond is to perſwade men to Faith
and good works, as all agree who know what it is.
For it is in vain to exhort thoſe men who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the force and nature of true Poſitive Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Religion. But a great ſort of our Preachers
having only lightly touched, or rather for the moſt
part totally neglected their Text, fall preſently to the
exhortation, which whoever does proſecute without
the knowledge of Faith and true Religion, does but
play the Philoſopher inſtead of preaching Chriſt, as
<hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> has plainly pronounced in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.
I would not have the latter omitted, but I had
rather they would much oftner handle the former.
For ſeeing the Goſpel teacheth many things above
our Reaſon, it is not poſſible to know which is the
true Worſhip of God and Religion, unleſs we know
what the Goſpel teacheth. Therefore he will do
moſt good to the Church, tho' he will not at firſt be
ſo acceptable as an <hi>Engliſh Moraliſt,</hi> who can beſt ſet
forth the matter of Faith, which many either totally
neglect, contenting themſelves with inculcating the
precepts concerning manners, without delivering the
ſumm of the Chriſtian Religion, or do only lightly
touching it, and yet after all we wonder whence it
comes to paſs, that thoſe that have ſo many years fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
our Sermons, being asked concerning the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53796:19"/>
heads of the Chriſtian Religion can give no account
of them, when yet they never in all their lives heard
much, if any thing, of them. I lament the miſery
of theſe poor ſheep, but I ſhall never more wonder
at the multitude of Atheiſts, and of thoſe that are
ignorant of all Religion. But in ſhort, if the truth
may be ſpoken, the greateſt part of the Preachers
never learned the <hi>Compendium</hi> and form of true Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie;
and what more can be expected from ſuch
men? But I know not how it comes to paſs, that no
Mechanick ſhall be ſuffered to exerciſe a Trade, who
hath not ſpent a great time in learning of it. But
all are ſuffered to preach without diſtinction or
choice, nor do I at all regard the Certificates which
are uſually given to young beginners in ſome places;
for how, and at what price they are purchaſed of the
Profeſſors is as clear as the light. But <hi>Paul</hi>'s precept
was,<note place="margin">1 Tim. III. 2.</note> that the Biſhop ſhould be <hi>apt to teach.</hi> And he
only will be ſuch who has a right notion of Religion,
and has by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the force and power of it in the various
events of his life. For as a builder firſt forms the
whole building in his mind. So the teachers of any
Arts, ought to have the whole Scheme of the
Arts they profeſs to teach in their minds that they
may be able to ſhew the beginning and Series, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of all the precepts. But all other Arts, becauſe they
may be comprehended by reaſon may be more eaſily
apprehended,<note place="margin">I cannot aſſent to my Author in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is any thing in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel againſt the judgment of Reaſon illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by Faith.</note> whereas the Goſpel which contains
many things above, and <hi>againſt</hi> the judgment of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is not apprehended without difficulty, and
therefore the Preacher is obliged to take the more
pains that he may render the moſt obſcure things
plain. And he will then be able to do this, when he
has poſſeſſed his own mind with a comprehenſive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53796:19"/>
knowledge of all the Doctrine of Religion before he
begins to teach others. Therefore it will never be labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
or difficult to ſuch a Preacher to invent what he
ſhould ſpeak; but rather his prudence is to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the chuſing out of the great variety and plenty,
what may ſeem moſt profitable and uſeful, for the
whole Chriſtian Religion is of a Divine Original, and
being delivered to us in writing by the Prophets and
Apoſtles, thoſe writings are to be followed. Now in
this, the firſt thing is, to underſtand rightly thoſe
things which he has undertaken to handle: for no
man can clearly teach another that thing which he
doth not throughly underſtand himſelf. That Verſe of
<hi>Horace</hi> is very common:
<q>
                  <l>Verbaque praeviſam rem non invita ſequentur.</l>
                  <l>For unforc'd words wait on a well known thing.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does any man attain the knowledge of the holy
Scriptures by ſtudy only; but it is neceſſary that by
inſtruction of the Holy Ghoſt he ſhould feel the force
of them in his own mind, and ſo be able by his own
Experience and Practice to interpret them. The next
things required in a good Preacher is, that he have a
good way and manner of interpreting or expreſſing
himſelf; which is delivered in thoſe precepts by
which youth is inſtructed in Eloquence or Rhetorick.
For no man can ever know the way of teaching well
if he be not well inſtructed in Eloquence in his youth:
and be very much, and a great while converſant with
thoſe Arts, in which the precepts of Rhetorick are
contained. And then an Interpreter ought to know
the Genius of the language, for the holy Scriptures
have a certain peculiar Idiom and Phraſe, which
thoſe that are not acquainted with it from their youth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53796:20"/>
cannot underſtand. Nor is it enough to have ſome
degree of knowledge in the tongues, but to enable
a man to judge well, Logick and Rhetorick are of
great uſe. Laſtly, if he be able to draw a ſumm,
or Compendium of the whole doctrine out of the
holy Scriptures, he will then endeavour that the
people alſo may comprehend the whole Chriſtian
Doctrine. The Primitive Church ſeems to have
aimed at this heretofore, when ſhe took ſuch care, that
the ignorant might be throughly inſtructed before
they were admitted to Baptiſm, whom ſhe then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">If the Rite of Confirmation were duly put in execution with us; no Church can take a better and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual care for this than ours has done.</note> Catechumens. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſe,
doth not ſignifie to teach ſimply, but to read
to a perſon, and make him repeat after the Teacher.
And I wiſh the cuſtom were retained in the Church,
of exacting of every man once an account of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
for we do more diligently conſider, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
look into thoſe things which we are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
in other words without changing the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The laſt cauſe of Atheiſm, we fetch from the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
abolition of all Ceremonies, for we ſee that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was never more deſpiſed than in thoſe Churches
where there is no Ceremonies. For there is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity of ſome external ſhews which may
recommend and render Religion more Auguſt and
Venerable to the common people, who are not able
without them, to ſee into the greatneſs and dignity
of this thing, and we ought not to undervalue that
improvement which children make while they
Sing the Pſalms, Read the Bible, and repeat the
Catechiſm aloud in the Church. For if Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are not impious, (as they are, which are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Papiſts for Juſtification,) and if there
be any uſe of them, ſuch as the recommending Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to the people, and children for whoſe ſake they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53796:20"/>
were chiefly inſtituted, and both which they retain
and preſerve in the word, and teach, I ſee no reaſon
why they ſhould be aboliſhed. O how earneſtly do I
deſire that thoſe who govern our Church-affairs
would more deeply conſider this laſt cauſe which at
firſt ſight appears ſo light and contemptible; and that
they would underſtand what Eccleſiaſtical Prudence
is. (concerning which we conjecture <hi>Nicolaus Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
will with the aſſiſtance of God publiſh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in his Elegant book of the Prudence of the
ancient Church) Tho' ours ſhould at leaſt be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
as leave this thing very imperfect. It is a moſt
impious thing, to think that all Ceremonies were
inſtituted by wicked Popes. There ever were ſome
wiſe and holy men, who throughly underſtood that
the minds of the common people were ſo ſtupid and
low, that they could never apprehend the Dignity
and Majeſty of Religion, unleſs their minds were
fixed and detained with ſome outward and viſible
Rites, till they might by that means by degrees be
more and more lifted up, and ſo learn to admire it.
And yet I would not have too much haſte made here,
becauſe <hi>Abraham Scultetus</hi> a prudent Divine, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in this very Age left us a Tragical example of
the ill effects that followed at <hi>Prague.</hi> And thus at
length I have opened this putrid ſore; and now if the
work might be acceptable, and it might promote the
cure of it, O how great thanks ſhould I give to our
God? but if the evil ſhould happen to be only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated,
and the attempt ſhould incenſe the Patients;
I ſhall comfort my ſelf with the Conſcience of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
and the uſual reward of a Phyſician.</p>
