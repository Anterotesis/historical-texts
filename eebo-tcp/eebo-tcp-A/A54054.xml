            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Some Conſiderations propoſed to the City of</hi> London, <hi>and the Nation of</hi> England, <hi>to calm their ſpirits, and prepare them to Wait for what the Lord is bringing about, that they may not run headily into their own ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by this extraordinary heat of their ſpirits kindle that fire, which will ſoon deuour them.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">With a ſhort Exhortation to them, relating to their true Settlement, and the Removal of that which hinders it.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Lord God Almighty, who made Heaven and Earthly who upholds them by the word of his Power, whoſe they are, with all their Inhabitants, he ruleth in the Kindomes of men, eſtabliſhing or overturning Laws, Governments, and Governours at his pleaſure, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 75. 5. <hi>&amp;c. Don.</hi> 4. 25, 35.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord hath had an eſpecial hand in the ſhakings and changes of this Nation, and hath ſome great thing to bring about, which he ordereth all unto. And though many of the tranſactions and paſſages (as relating to men) have been very <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lamable, yet the Lord hath been juſt and good in them all, and can in his own good time recover the ground which he hath ſeemed to loſe, and advantage both the good of his People, and of the Nation, by all their Sufferings, Loſſes, diſcouragements, and diſadvantages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this late Revolution, there may be more of God than man is a ware of. God in his infinite wiſdome might ſee that this <hi>Parliament</hi> was not fit for the Work, and ſo might ſuffer ſuch a thing to fall out between them and the <hi>Army</hi> (heightning their ſpirits on both ſides) as might occaſion the Removal of them out of the way. Yea and this preſent change may be but a paſſage to another, unleſs the Lord find theſe very faithful and diligent in his Service, and not minding themſelves and their own Intereſts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If this late Revolution was of God, and he ſaw it good to bring it about, for the further carrying on of his Work, he will be able to maintain it; and thoſe that oppoſe him therein, ſhall not be able to ſtand before him. They may bring Ruin upon the Nation and themſelves but they cannot ſet up what God throws down, nor raiſe up any thing elſe in the ſtead of it according to their wills; but that which he, by his Providence and diſpoſing hand, appointeth to ſucceed, muſt have the time of Trial which he allotteth it.</p>
            <p>Therefore let men fear the <hi>Lord God,</hi> whoſe eye is upon us, and whoſe power is over us; and let us take heed of being found fighters againſt him. The Cauſe hath long lain a bleeding, yet there is at length a true reviving of it; and thoſe whoſe hearts the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſtirred up to ſeek it faithfully, the <hi>Lord</hi> will be with them, and he is ready to pardon their former miſcarriages. But oh that they could lay themſelves low, and forget their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, that the Cauſe might riſe up clear and manifeſt above them! Remember this ſaying, O ye great Ones, The <hi>Lord</hi> did not throw down the former greatneſs of the Nobility, for you to riſe up in their places; but ye ſhould have lain low, and remained little, and have let the <hi>Lord</hi> been great: and it is your true intereſt to deſcend and become little again. And if it were once manifeſt that ye did not ſeek yourſelves, but the Cauſe of God, the good of his People, and of the Nation, that every part and ſort of men might feel their oppreſsions broken, and their juſt Rights and Liberties recovered and preſerved for them, this would draw the hearts of all the honeſt haerted People to you, as one man: and thoſe which have been ſcattered, would be again united; and our very enemies (ſeeing our integrity and righteouſneſs, and true reformation by the wiſdome and guidance of God) would magnifie that Work of God, which as yet cannot but be a reproach.</p>
            <p>Therefore O <hi>England,</hi> fear before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and wait upon him, and let thine eye be taken off from man, for he is very vanity. Neither thy good nor thy harm ariſeth this way, but out of thine own bowels. What have all theſe afflictions done towards the refining of thee? Art not thou yet what thou waſt? O <hi>England</hi> wilt thou not be made clean! when ſhall it once be? Murmur not againſt the Rods, wherewith the <hi>Lord</hi> ſeeth good to chaſtiſe thee; but mourn over thy wickedneſs, thy pride, thy deceit, thy exceſs, thy cruelty, thy oppreſsion, thy falſe Worſhip and Idolatries, &amp;c. and over thy enmity againſt that which is of God, where ever it appears.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of theſe troubles, thou couldſt bear with no Form of Worſhip, but thine own. Now thou art come thus far, that thou canſt almoſt bear with any Form. Nay but that will not ſerve; The <hi>Lord</hi> will have room for the power of Godlineſs, and he will not alwayes ſuffer thee to ſmite his Servants for their obedience to his Spirit. This is his controverſie with thee, and the cauſe of all thy miſery (when miſery, diſtreſs, and ruin have opened thine eyes, thou wilt ſee it) Oh that thy day of calamity, might paſs over thee! If thou couldſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed humble thy ſelf before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not walk any longer thus contrary to him, in the Work which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to bring about, the <hi>Lord</hi> might pity and ſpare thee, for he delighteth in mercy: but if thou continue to walk contrary to him, and wilt be ſetled afore his time, and in a way, and by ſuch means as he approves not, the ſteps of his power againſt thee will overturn thee. Therefore fear, and be humble and meek before him, for therein lies the wiſdome which can preſerve thee; but ſtrive not to withſtand his footſteps, leaſt he trample down thy crown, thy ſtrengh, thy hopes, thy peace, and all that is deſirable in thine eyes.</p>
            <closer>This is in tender Love, as a gentle Warning to you, that you may take heed of giving way to that fierce ſpirit, which is the forerunner of miſery and deſolation.
<signed>From him who is a dear Lover of this City, and of his native Country,
Iſaac Penington, <hi>the Younger.</hi>
