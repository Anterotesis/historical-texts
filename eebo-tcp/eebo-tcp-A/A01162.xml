            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ennemy came with ſome fourteene or
fiueteene hundred footemen: alſo in the fore-fronte
there were a nomber of horſe, beſides ſondry other

The firſt of May the enemies army was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

yet not without ſuſpect of ſome mening to diſlodge:
For there were paſſed ſome troupes both of horſe
and foote towardes the wayes, whereby they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their victuals, namely toward <hi>Liſlebonne, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keruille,
Arfleur, Newhauen, Eeſcam,</hi> and <hi>Honflew,</hi> which
ſtandeth beyonde the Riuer, ſo that the ſame day
there were taken three or foure thouſand loaues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
400. carriage horſes that were gone on a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging,
and twenty faire horſes belonginge to the
artillery. There returned alſo many carriages
that came from the ſayde places loaden with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall:
There were alſo taken ſome horſemen that
went foorth for to ſafeconduct them: ſo that the
loafe of bread that was worth but one ſouſe before,
was now ſould amonge them for twelue and fiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
ſouſes: and the pot of wine, the worſt for three
franckes, and that that was ſomewhat good was
ſould for foure.</p>
            <p>This firſt of May was the Feaſt of <hi>Iames</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> and it fell vpon a Friday, all which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> to lay the platformes of all
their enterpriſes and purpoſes: howbeit the king
tooke ſo good order in euery quarter, that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
no inconuenience: but contrarywiſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
finding our troupes to bee (as they terme it)
frollicke, ſtood in greater doubt of being aſſaulted,
then in deſire to aſſaile.</p>
            <p>The ſecond day moſt of the enemies army ſtood
ſtill in battaile ray, parte of them paſſinge into a
wood, which lyeth betweene their Forte and the
kinges army, which was but fiue hundred paces
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20657:5"/>
from one of their trenches, &amp; was enuironed with
a very deepe ditch, the trees ſtanding on both ſides
in manner of a hedge, ſo enterlaced that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
vnacceſſible albeit there were none to defende
the ſame.</p>
            <p>The third day the king with his chiefeſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
went to take a view of the head of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
army, to the end there to endeuour to woorke
ſome effect. He found that the enemy had made fiue
rauelinges about the ſaid wood, which flancked
the champion whereby he was to goe to the head:
alſo that he had lodged two thouſande footemen in
certaine houſes that ſtood as in a villadge vnder
the ſide thereof, compaſſed with the ſame ditches
yet in ſome place ther were three ditches one with
in an other that deuided the fieldes from the ſayd
head, which was with in the reach of a ſmal colue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on the one ſide of the <hi>Switzers</hi> lodgings, ſo that
planting the <hi>Canon</hi> he might haue ſtrooke into ſome
of our lodginges, namely into the <hi>Engliſhmens.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the leſſe the king, hauing taken counſaile in the
field, reſolued to ſeaze vpon the ſaid wood together
with the vilage therein comprehended, which was
one of their chiefeſt lodginges, and to that effect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
all his troopes to be in place before day in
battaile array, ſo to giue the aſſault at the breake of
daye: but the darkneſſe of the night was in parte
the cauſe that ſome that were lodged farre of were
not ſo dilligent but that it was almoſt eight of the
clocke before they arryued in eſtate to perfourme
the purpoſed effect. Neither could this aſſembly be
ſo ſecrete, but that the enemie did ſome what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

ſelues in battail, vſing all diligence to fortify &amp; raiſe
the ſaid rauelings, ſhoting of two canons to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
all their troupes, where vpon ſome were of
opinion to referre the enterpriſe to an other time.
But the king finding al his troupes full of courage
and heat, reſolued to aſſault them in ſundry places.
On the one ſide the Engliſh and Wallons and the
reſt to ſupport the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: on an other ſide the French &amp; the
lance knights to ſupport them. The firſt, who were
as aduenturers, ſtrok in ſo valeantly that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the trenches with hard ſight, rather with the
pike and ſworde, then with the harquebuze, and
forced the enemy out of the ſaid wood and village,
albeit they were two thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men, &amp; ſome Spaniſh
Captaines that were come at the bruite of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of our forces.</p>
            <p>There were left dead vpon the place aboue three
hundred men, whereof ſome were Spaniards and
ſome Wallons: Amongſt them were ſix or ſeauen
Captaines, and the Liefetenant Coronell of <hi>la Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>
and he himſelfe wounded, without any loſſe of
ours, except two or three ſlaine, and ſeauen or eight
hurt.</p>
            <p>The Lord Baron <hi>Biron</hi> aduaunced himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Office of Marſhall Generall of the
field, whereby hee beheld the countenance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict
of the enemies, and aduertiſed the king ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
who ſent him fifty horſe, led by the Lord of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni,
Vidam</hi> of <hi>Chartres.</hi> Vpon their comming he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
them that fledde, euen vntill they came within
fifty paces of their firſt entrenchment, where their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20657:6"/>
army ſtood in battaile ray. Here were alſo ſlaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
ſix and ſeauen ſcore, with the loſſe of onely
one of ours, who paſſed ſo farre that he was ſlayne
at the foote of the trench. So likewiſe were there
ſome horſes ſlaine and ſome hurt: yea there were
ſome ſuch enemies ſlaine as offered tenne, ſix, and
foure thouſand crownes.</p>
            <p>The king ſtood about eight houres offering the
battaile, hauing to that end aduaunced his Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,
horſemen and artillery. The enemies tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were raiſed very high in reſpect as they were
at the beginning in the field, and they ſomewhat
annoyed vs with their artillery: but the king pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his forces els where, in place where the Canon
could not hurt.</p>
            <p>His Maieſty perceiuing after ſo long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the night comming on, that the enemies
made no countenaunce to come foorth of their Fort,
returned euery man to his lodginge, vntill further
occaſion to do more, hauing by this effect with their
great hurt, giuen the enemies to know that our
footmen are as good or better then theirs, at the
coſt of the Spaniſh brauery and preſumption, who
can now graunt that the footemen the which the
king now hath are very good: for of his horſemen
they make no doubt, conſidering the many proufes
that they haue had.</p>
            <p>The next day being the fifth of May, about
eleuen of the clock, ther came other aduice, that the
ennemie diſlodged from their Forte, whereof grew
ſondry opinions, the greateſt importing that they
meant ſecreately to ſteale away to <hi>Roan,</hi> and from
thence to the Forreſt of <hi>Andely,</hi> which is but three
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20657:6"/>
leagues thence leauing in <hi>Roan</hi> their munition and
moſt heauieſt baggage, and truly had they ben able
ſo to haue done and to gotten ſixe or ſeauen houres
before hand whereby to haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
with that aduantadge they might eaſily haue ſent
their horſmen and baggage before, and lefte their
footmen vpon the tayl, whome our horſemen could
not haue broken or fought withal in the forreſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could our footmen haue marched in time to
ouertake theirs, but that afterward through this
forreſt they might haue retired euen to <hi>New caſtel</hi> or
toward <hi>Beauuais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The king here vpon ſent out ſome to vew the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
who returned anſweare that they diſlodged,
then in the morning he ſent more &amp; ſtronger troops,
who gaue him to wit that the enemies were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ouer night &amp; that they were broken: here vpon
his Maieſtie reſolued to bring his maine battayle
toward <hi>Clayre,</hi> ſo to winne the fore part of the ſaid
forreſt, whiles himſelfe with his horſmen folowed
the enemie in the taile to the end truly to learne the
order of their march, what way they toke, &amp; what
iourneys they might be able to make: leauing the
Lord <hi>Marſhall Biron</hi> to conduct the armie &amp; to cauſe
it to march in order. His maieſtie had not marched
farre but he perceiued that he had not had certaine
aduice, for within halfe a league of the fort where
the enemy was lodged, he found them in battail ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,
&amp; for a token that they went not ſcatering they
diſcharged ſome canons. But had he bene truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertized,
he would ſurely haue brought his army,
&amp; ſo vndoubtedly we had had battaile, &amp; that with
aduantage, or at the leaſt in equal ballance, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20657:7"/>
is the thinge that the king chiefly deſireth.
The king ſeyng how the caſe ſtood, ſent word to
marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> to ſtay the army where it was, alſo
to conſider how to lodge, like wiſe ſoon after heſent
the Lord Baron of <hi>Biron</hi> ſonne to the ſaide Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
to appoint the ſeate, which hee dyd at <hi>Iuetot,</hi>
twoo leagues from the ennemies campe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
allready to fortefie, notwithſtanding the ſtrong
ſcituation thereof, which was vpon a hill betwene
two valleis, neither was there any acceſſe vnto it,
but at one onely heade, and that very difficulte, as
being flancked with wood and vallies, beſides that
attending vntill the trenches were made, they had
placed at the ſaide heade three rowes of carriages,
whereof they had great plenty.</p>
            <p>The king ſeeing his army too farre off, namely
that his Rutters, were lodged three leagues off,
and diuers of his troupes ſo farre away, that they
could not come together vntill it were very late, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to retire vntill the nexte morninge, and
then to ſee whether hee coulde woorke any good
effect.</p>
            <p>The ſeauenth day of the ſaide moneth of May,
the king departed with ſome of his forces, to lodge
at a place called Saint <hi>Katerines,</hi> from whence hee
might plainely diſcouer the ennemies Campe, but
perceyuing that hee was firſt to paſſe twoo greate
vallies hee returned to the former lodging.</p>
            <p>The eight day, ſome went to diſcouer the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
army, who found them within a great trench
which they had augmented.</p>
            <p>The ninth day, the king tooke counſaile to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
the ennemies horſemen, who were lodged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20657:7"/>
a valley, for the commodity of water, and
in three villages beneath their army: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
hee gaue charge to Baron <hi>Biron</hi> to take
hys Regimente, wherein were ſixe hundred
French footemen, one hundred Engliſh pikes,
and one hundred Muſquettiers, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wallons, likewiſe the Launce knights, to
ſeiſe vppon this lodging. Hee alſo appoynted
that the Lorde Marſhall <hi>de Aumont,</hi> ſhoulde
marche after wyth hys Regimente, alſo that
when they were neere the execution, he ſhould
take on to the lefte hande, ſo to keepe that ſide
from hinderinge the ſame, as alſo to ſette a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>,
as if hee would fighte with ſuch as ſhould ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together, namely wyth the laſte villages,
or elſe wyth the whole army.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
appointed wyth hys Regimente to take
on to the righte hande, towarde the ennemies
Campe, where hee gotte vp aboue on to the top
of the valley, and marched towarde the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
trenches within the volley of a ſmall cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering,
whereby hee ſtopped the ennemies from
comming foorth of their Campe to ſuccour thoſe
lodginges. The Lord Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
after with eight hundred French, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
footemen Engliſh and Wallons, moſt of
them pikes, and then his owne Regiment.</p>
            <p>Being come to the firſt village hee ſlayed
and ſent foure hundred hargabuziers into the
wood on to the right hand, to ſupport the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> if neede ſhould require, alſo two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

kinge remained on the toppe of the Hill, to the
ende to make heade againſt the army, in caſe it
ſhould paſſe out at the ende or beginninge of the
valley with his Cornet, his Regiment, and the
Regiments of the Dukes of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueuille,</hi>
the counties of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Do.</hi> for it
was to bee feared that the ennemy would paſſe
that waye to hinder and diſturbe the execution
aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The fight was ſore, for ye are to note, that
where commonly men ſet vppon lodginges by
night, the king would haue this done by day, to
the ende that if the ennemy ſhoulde offer any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
he might bee ſeene comminge, and to bee
fought withall.</p>
            <p>Beſides of the kinges troupes ſome tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ouer long: others ſhewed themſelues in the
view of the ennemies campe, ſo that when the
ſayd Lord Baron drew neare the lodgings, he
found doble ward of Rutters and launces, and
almoſt all the troopes taking horſe, being in
nomber betwene thirtie &amp; fortie cornets, ſeuen
companies of men of armes of the ordinances,
and the Rutters.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lord Baron had but few men,
in reſpect that the paſſage was narrow: albert
in deede the Lord great Maiſter of the horſe
came vnto him with ſome fiueteene or twenty of
the kinges Cornet, and the County of <hi>Chaſteau-Roux</hi>
Marſhall <hi>de Auments</hi> eldeſt ſonne, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

            <p>The ſayd Lord Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>n ſeeing ſome three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and tenne or foureſcore Rutters comming
to charge vpon him, turned to them, albeit but
meanely accompanied, in reſpecte that parte of
his company had taken an other way, by reaſon
of a hedge, where were fiue and thirty men. For
he conſidered that if he ſhould retire from before
this troupe, it mighte bree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſome daunger of
feare, to the reſt of thoſe that came behinde, and
therefore he reſolued to ſet vpon them. There
followed ſome ſtore of Piſtoll ſhotte and handye
blowes, wherein the ſayd Rutters were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
and ſo he entred the village, where he
found certaine Spanyardes that ſtoode at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and therevpon the ſayd Lord Baron ſtaid
for hys Harguebuziers, to diſtodge them from
the hedges and ditches, where the County <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteau-Roux</hi>
was hurte on the legge, which was
great pittie, in reſpect hee was both valiant and
forward.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that parted from the ſaid Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
did report that they met with a troope of
lancers whom they withſtod, to the end ſo to fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uour
the excecution, which was great both in
ſlaine, wounded, and priſoners: as alſo was the
ſpoyle and loſſe. For the ennemyes doe giue out
that they loſt foure hundred horſe of ſeruice and
ſixtene hundred other, a great deale of baggage
and moueables, and much ſiluer in veſſel and
coyne.</p>
            <p>There were ſundrye conflicts, and the Lord
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20657:9"/>
Baron of <hi>Biron</hi> fought three or foure times aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt
both horſmen and footemen, who, gathered
together both in the lodginges and among the
hedges and ditches, yet in the end they were all
broken, &amp; the rather for that the Lord Marſhall
<hi>de Aumont</hi> put ſome of the ſpaniſh troops in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are,
as alſo thoſe that gathered again together.
The duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was forſed to put ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
couuert from the ennemyes artilery.</p>
            <p>The king alſo ſent a great troope of horſe
toward the enimies campe or trenches, to hold
them ſtill in feare that the ſaid troup wold enter
theyr Campe, whileſt the reſt of the army aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
the trenches.</p>
            <p>This execution perfourmed, the Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
began to cauſe thoſe whome he brought, to
retire, but in great diſorder by reaſon of their
booty, and thoſe two hundred freſh harguebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers,
whome the Lord Marſhall had ſent him,
ſtoode them in good ſtead: When moſt of hys
troupes were on their way, himſelfe began alſo
to retire toward the right hande, at which tyme
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> beganne to diſcend into the
valley, being ſeconded by the ſmall ſhotte that
was ſent into the wood and hedges.</p>
            <p>All theſe troupes aforeſaid thus paſſed, the
Lord Marſhall <hi>Biron,</hi> ſounded the retreat, with
his booty, and the ennemies ſette a face as they
would haue followed in the taile, but they were
ſo well wellcommed, that ſondry of them were
ſlayne and hurte: And heere came his ſonne the
Lord Baron vnto him, wyth ſondry men of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20657:9"/>
that were with him. This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
thus honourably for the execution of
the kinges purpoſe to the ennemies great loſſe
as is aforeſayde: and hys Maieſty was alſo
come downe to ſee how thinges wente, from
whence hee commaunded whatſoeuer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth day of May, the king was
aduertiſed, that the enemy had brought a great
many of boates, which he cauſed to bee faſtened
by two and two, making thereof ſmall bridges
to paſſe ouer: and that they tranſported vppon
each bridge, ſome ſixty horſe with many foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and ſome baggage in the bottome, ſo to get
ouer the Riuer of <hi>Seyne.</hi> A matter ſcarſe to bee
imagined. Alſo that as for forrage, there came
great plenty a long the way towarde <hi>Liſlebonne,</hi>
and along the riuer, likewiſe that they had ſome
ſtore comming a longe from towarde <hi>Newhauen,
Harfleur, Feſcam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Herevpon the king determined to follow
their army, to the ende to cutte of their victuals
and forrage, alſo to aſſault <hi>Caudebeck,</hi> or compell
the ennemies to battaile. The which day hee
departed from <hi>Iuetot,</hi> and came to lodge in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Lauetot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twelfth day hee wente to take the view
of <hi>Caudebeck,</hi> where he found that they had made
a Fort at halfe the mountaine, wherein were a
good nomber of people, &amp; likewiſe in the towne,
But his Maieſty had brought but few troupes,
and therfore he referred al to the next day, being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20657:10"/>
the thirteenth. Likewiſe hee might beholde the
boates loaden with menne horſe, and baggage,
paſſing ouer the Riuer with all diligence.</p>
            <p>The ſame day hee marched with part of his
army and ſome artilery, and at the coming of
our footmen the enimies began to retire to a
place of execution where they made as it were a
litle fort, but paſſing forward they habandoned
their fort, which was at the mid mountain, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could we any lenger perceaue the number
of boats at the kay: But the moſt of them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
toward <hi>Roan,</hi> and as for their forces they
wer al alredy paſſed ouer the riuer ſauing thoſe
that marched as it is aforſaid toward <hi>Roan</hi> and
foure hundred of the towne gariſon.</p>
            <p>Hard by the other ſide of the riuer the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had before made a fort for the ſafetie of the
paſſage, where they had 7. peeces of ordinance,
which being taken forth of their boates they
left behinde them. In the forte had they lefte
ſome men, alſo in a ſmale vilage thereby ſome
both horſmen and footmen, who ſet themſelues
in battail aray without the daunger of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the kinge cauſed to be often times
diſcharged againſt thoſe that were in the forte
and about the peces. Herevpon the enimies ſent
three teemes of horſe to draw away the ſaid
pieces againſt the which we ſhot ſundrie times
and ſlew ſome of theit horſes, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
they drew them away one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>The king lefte certaine French in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20657:10"/>
fort aboue the towne, with ſome
Wallons and Engliſh, alſo ſome artillery vpon
the toppe of the mountayne and ther he lodged
the Suitzers. Likewiſe ſome of the ſhippes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched
and ſhot off, howbeit but few.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth day of May, the king cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his company to ſhoote into the towne: they
that were within, made a brag, wherevpon the
king ſent them word, that he would hang them
all: But towarde eueninge they craued parley,
and ſo the king ſent the Lord Baron of <hi>Byron,</hi> to
make the compoſition.</p>
            <p>There came foorth of the towne of <hi>Caudebeck</hi>
foure hundred men, whereof two hundred were
Spanyardes, whoſe compoſition was the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,
to the ende they mighte haue no cauſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies
or longer ſtay. Becauſe it is hard to plant
a ſiege, alſo that the water ſtood in many partes
of the ditch, and could not be voyded.</p>
            <p>There were alſo threeſcore and tenne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
horſes, that coulde not paſſe away, and
ſome mulets, namely the Prince of <hi>Parmaes</hi>
owne. Beſides the king determined to departe
and to follow the ennemy, and therefore tooke
his way to <hi>Pont-del-Arch</hi> there to paſſe ouer the
Riuer of <hi>Seyne,</hi> to keepe the ennemy from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
on the other ſide of the Riuer, and to force
him to ſome action.</p>
            <p>The king being on the way to <hi>Pont-del-Arch</hi>
had aduice that the enimies horſmen that could
not paſſe at <hi>Caudebeck</hi> but tooke to <hi>Roan,</hi> had
paſſed the Riuer at <hi>Roan,</hi> and ſo marched wholy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20657:11"/>
toward <hi>Paris,</hi> wherevpon he reſolued with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to make way to learne the trueth, where
the ennemy would become. He left his French
horſemen, with the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
forward, alſo his footemen with the Lord
Marſhall <hi>Biron</hi> to the ende vpon aduertiſement
from himſelfe, to paſſe ouer <hi>Seyne,</hi> or to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Paris,</hi> either to paſſe ouer the Riuer of <hi>Oyſe</hi>
at <hi>Creil,</hi> or at <hi>Ile-Adam,</hi> ſo to cut off the ennemies
retraict into the <hi>Low countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixteenth day, the king receyued letters
from the Lord of <hi>Archant</hi> gouernour of <hi>Eureux,</hi>
importing the ouerthrow of a great nomber of
the ennemies, whome hee ſurpriſed, lodged in
the ſuburbes of the ſaide towne, of whome fifty
were left deade in the place, and many were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
priſoners.</p>
            <p>He writeth moreouer that vppon Friday
the fiueteenth day of thys moneth of May, the
Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> ſonne to the Duke, had paſſed
a long not farre from <hi>Eureux,</hi> accompanied with
ſeauentene enſignes of footemen and two maine
troupes of horſe, who marched the one before,
and the other behind, ſo diſorderly and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it had bene an eaſie matter with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
horſe, to haue defeated them all: and that
he marched directly towarde <hi>Paris</hi> where he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
vpon the Sonday after, being the ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the ſame moneth, to arriue.</p>
            <p>The king purpoſeth ſhortly to returne to
the aſſault of <hi>Roan,</hi> who hath found her death in
place where ſhe hoped for health. For the ſame
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20657:11"/>
towne hath had no ſupply of the thinges that it
ſtandeth in moſte neede of, neyther neede wee to
feare, ſo long as the king is maiſter of the fielde
and keepeth the Riuer of <hi>Seine</hi> ſhut vp, that the
ennemies ſhall deliuer themſelues from their
miſery and want of victuals.</p>
            <p>By letters of the eighteenth day from the
Campe neere to <hi>Caudebeck,</hi> wee heare that the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> remayneth at <hi>Roan</hi> ſicke of his

the ſaide Dukes army is alſo there encloſed:
and moſt certaine it is that the Switzers are
there ſhut vp.</p>
            <p>There is newes come ſence that the Duke

            <p>The Lord of <hi>Fay</hi> is at <hi>Guillebocuſ</hi> which he forte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
