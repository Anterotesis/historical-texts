         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to this relation of a Gentleman lately arrived at <hi>Bristol</hi> from <hi>Marcelles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> whose name is Mr. <hi>Charls Chester</hi>: who informed some persons of credit in <hi>Bristol,</hi> (from whose months I had it)<q> That at his being at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> there came thither two Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Capuchin Friers in their habits, who begged some relief from him and other <hi>English</hi> there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they were <hi>Englishmen,</hi> newly come forth of <hi>Eugland,</hi> and travelling towards <hi>Rome</hi> upon some occasions: whom he entertaining with good <hi>English</hi> beer (a rarity in those parts) when they were a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle warmed with it, they began to discourse more freely with him upon his demands, how long, and in what parts they had been in <hi>England,</hi> and what persons they knew there? They answered, that they had been in <hi>England</hi> some years space, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Bristol</hi>; that they were very well acquainted with sundry particular persons in both places, whom they named to him (some whereof are the principal Male and Female Quakers in <hi>Bristol,</hi> whose names I forbear) that they went there under the name of North-Country men (as the Ringleaders of the Quakers all doe) but in truth they were <hi>Irish-men</hi> born; and when they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched their businesse at <hi>Rome,</hi> intended to return shortly into <hi>England</hi> again. And upon his first rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he added; That himself saw and heard them speak to the Quakers at the <hi>Red lodge</hi> in <hi>Bristol,</hi> at one of their meetings there.</q>

            <p>The 4. remarkable thing from <hi>num.</hi> 14, 15. is this,
<q>That these Friers Minorites have a power now in <hi>England,</hi> to receive others into their order, society,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60642:13"/>
and Profession: A Register wherein to record their names, with the dates of the day and year of their reception and profession, and their Provincial Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Assemblies, whereunto they are to be sent.

                     </gap>lians,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
And by the <hi>Latine</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er therein it is most apparent, They have their <hi>private houses</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and other our Dominions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>all the Friers</hi> of this Order within certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, resort at certain times, especially on <hi>Fridays</hi> (or <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The 5. thing of Note therein is, <hi>That before the principal Masse they are always enjoyned to recite the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Letany</hi> (some late one of that name) <hi>for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Country</hi> unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and Popery, here precisely required in positive terms, to which all these other faculties and their endeavours tend.</p>
            <p>The 6. extraordinary in it, is; <hi>The inserting of most of the Ceremonies these Friers are uniformly to observe in their Masses,</hi> into this instrument, taken out of the <hi>Roman Missal, Pontifical, Ceremonial</hi>: &amp; <hi>Missal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hese Faculties in this instrument (as I conjecture) because they cannot now conveniently carry any <hi>Missals, Brevtaries</hi> about them, for fear of being detected by them, as the 5. <hi>Facultie</hi> resolves in direct terms. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these Ceremonies 3 are observable, which our <note n="[q]" place="margin">

               <hi>Popish Prelates</hi> much practised, pressed of late, and some yet observe, and begin to revive amongst us. And that is <hi>standing up at Gloria Patri: Bowing</hi> (to wit) at the naming of <hi>Iesus,</hi> couched in the, &amp;c. rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            </p>
            <p>The 7. observable is this, that however these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised Friers seem outwardly to comply with the late and present Government and Governours to effect their own pernicious designs; yet they do not pray for them, nor their New Republike, <hi>though</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The 8. that in the prayers here specified, there is not one syllable of Prayers to Sts. expressed, <hi>and all merits of their own, and Iustification by works disclaimed, and relying upon the infinite Goodnesse, Mercies and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Iesus Christ, and his precious blood and passion for the pardon of all sins, insisted on in the English pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The 10. observable is, That these <hi>Faculties</hi> proclaim all Protestants to be <hi>Hereticks</hi> sundry times, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them</hi> as such. Yet they dispence with this

Amongst these one <hi>Clovet</hi> a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> (usually stiled <hi>Pere Bastle</hi>) <hi>was elected,</hi> and sent forth as the <hi>Popes Missionary</hi> (the eminentest of all the rest for piety and learning) who had 13 <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Privileges</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> conferred on him <hi>by the Pope, confirmed by his Bull</hi>; which he soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turning <hi>Protestant,</hi> printed at large in <hi>French</hi> in his <hi>Declaration, shewing the reasons he had to separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to joyn himself to the Reformed,</hi> A Sedane 1639. (whiles I was prisoner in <hi>Iersey,</hi> where I met with this excellent acute <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>) <hi>chap.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 116, 117.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60642:14"/>
Whereupon I conclude, that this <hi>Conry</hi> is such an <hi>extraordinary Missionary of the Pope,</hi> and hath these unusual <hi>Faculties</hi> granted to him originally by the Popes <hi>special Bull,</hi> as <hi>Pere Basile</hi> had then, being one of the self-same Order.</p>
            <p>I shall only give you a brief account of what other Papers were found about this <hi>Maurice Conry,</hi> with his Faculties, and conclude this discovery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There were several Latin small Treatises found with him, <hi>concerning Original sin, Iustification,</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring exactly with the <hi>Quakers new Franciscan Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>: And it would be worth inquiry, whether he hath not been a <hi>Speaker</hi> amongst them, in some place or other, during his near 3 years aboad in <hi>England</hi>; as well as others of his Order have been?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There were sundry <hi>Physical receits,</hi> and <hi>Chirurgical Medicines</hi> found about him, most worn and used, <hi>with receits to drive away, catch and kill Rats, Lice, and other Vermin</hi>; which makes me conjecture he professed himself <hi>a Physician in some places, a Chirurgion in others, a Rat-catcher in a third</hi>; since his pretended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as a <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Souldier,</hi> to raise men for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were out of date, by a breach with <hi>Spain</hi>; as one <hi>Iervis</hi> a Priest, haunting our Quarters, hath a long time passed under the disguise of a <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mender,</hi> and <hi>Physician.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. There was this Passe-port in <hi>English</hi> amongst the rest, under hand and Seal, dated two moneths space before these extraordinary Faculties granted to him, which probably might be a great motive of the Popes and his Provincials granting him, and his solliciting for, and receiving such ample Faculties, with so many new-coyned dispensations to conceal him from detection.<floatingText type="letter">

<q>Thou seemest, O Prince, not to understand what a monstrous slaughter of people is committed by thee, neither doth rage suffer thee to weigh with thy self what thou hast done; yet must thou know, that from dust we came, and to dust we shall.
