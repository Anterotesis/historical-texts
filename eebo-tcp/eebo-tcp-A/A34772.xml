         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ALL who have the happineſs
to be acquainted with Your
Lordſhip, know how litttle You
love, or want a Dedication; and I
ſhould not have preſum'd to fix Your
<pb facs="tcp:98314:4"/>
Name to this, were there not a kind
of neceſſity for it; but when I reflect
on the Character of my Author, ſo like,
and in ſo many circumſtances agreeing
with Your Lordſhips, where can I draw
ſo exact a Parallel, where could I make
choice of ſo fit a Patron?</p>
                  <p>For whether I conſider the late Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> either in his
publick or private Capacity, in juſtice
to his Memory, I muſt compare him to
Your Lordſhip, being otherwaies unable
to deſcribe him as he deſerves; and in
this, I am ſure, I have outdone the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
tho' I fall much ſhort of it in the
Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may obſerve, he was Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller
general of the <hi>Finances</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
the moſt like to a Lord Commiſſioner of
the Treaſury in <hi>England;</hi> a Station,
Your Lordſhip hath long maintain'd with
ſo great Honour, Juſtice, Integrity,
and Prudence, that You never deſervedly
<pb facs="tcp:98314:4"/>
made an Enemy, nor undeſervedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
a Friend; I may well ſay long,
conſidering the different prevailing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in our Nation; but You have ſtill
preſerv'd Your Intereſt, by the ſame
Merit You acquir'd it; what ever
Changes have happen'd, You have never
deviated from Your own juſt Principles,
and none hath better demonſtrated that
Infallible Maxim, an Honeſt Man is
the beſt Politician.</p>
                  <p>But tho' Honeſty is the beſt, and
ought to be the chief Ingredient in a
Stateſman, there are other extraordinary
Qualifications, Stars of a leſſer Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which ſhine bright in Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
a ſound and ſteady Judgment, a
clear and ready Wit, a quick Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
a perfect Knowledge of Languages,
Foreign Courts and Cuſtoms, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Command of the Paſſions, an eaſie
and affable Behaviour, and a true Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to Buſineſs, without its tedious

forms and incumbrances. 'Tis theſe
Exemplary Vertues that juſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Your Lordſhip to all Good Men,

                  <p>It is very difficult to quit ſo fruitful
a Subject; but I am to remember to
whom I am ſpeaking; and tho' I cannot ſay
enough to my Reader, I muſt not ſay too
much to Your Lordſhip. I will therefore
trouble You no longer, hoping the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>GOD hath ſo viſibly appear'd in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
your Majeſty's Reign, that
I am verily perſuaded your Majeſty
doth in no-wiſe attribute to your
Own good Conduct, thoſe happy Events which
have made your Kingdom ſo Glorious, and
humbled its Enemies. GOD anſwer'd the
Prayers of all your good Subjects, and gave
You to them in a time, when there was little
hope of their being heard; ſince it was not till
after Twenty three Years Barrenneſs, he began,
by the Miracle of your Birth, to declare, He
had choſen you from all Eternity, to be one
of the moſt perfect Works that have been, for
a long time, upon Earth. So certain a Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:98314:6"/>
and ſo generally acknowledg'd by all your
Subjects, ought alſo to be known to
Strangers, that they may be convinc'd, the
Mighty Hand of GOD acteth for you againſt
your Enemies. But ſeeing there is in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all other Courts but a meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance of Piety, while it ſhines ſo
bright in yours, they attribute all your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Proſperity only to your good Fortune,
without lifting up their Eyes to Him who is
the Lord of Hoſts, and without whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Aid,
'tis impoſſible for any one to expect Victory.
It were to be wiſh'd your Enemies had been
ſooner undeceiv'd, and in good time convinc'd,
That it is GOD alone who protects you;
then there had not been ſo much Blood ſpilt
in the War, which you have ſo gloriouſly end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Lives of an infinite Number of
Men might yet be ſpar'd, who ſeem deſtin'd
to periſh in the ſame Quarrel. For your
Majeſty, by having given a Peace to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
hath not quite extinguiſh'd the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of many Potentates, wherewith they
feel themſelves diſquieted. When they ſee what
great Things are done by you, they do but watch
for an Opportunity to be reveng'd; and rather
than they will yield to thoſe Submiſſions which one
of your Miniſters requires from them, 'tis
very likely they will hazard All, to keep All.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98314:6"/>
But, SIR, may I be ſo bold to ask, Whether
all that this Miniſter doth, be any Service
to your Majeſty? I fear you may think the
little good Correſpondence, which hath hitherto
been between us, puts me upon this Queſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on.
The deep Wounds, which your Majeſty knows
better than I, he hath endeavour'd to give
me, by his frequent Addreſſes to your Majeſty,
to make you ſuſpect my Fidelity, may incline
you to believe, That my Reſentments are ſtill
great enough to prompt me to do by him, as
he hath dealt with me. But GOD forbid
that I ſhould be more concern'd for my own
Intereſt, than for your Majeſty's; having no
other aim, but to repreſent faithfully to your
Majeſty how things are. A Great KING,
who hath in his Hands the Government of a
large Kingdom, doth not always know what
his Miniſters do; eſpecially when he gives
them the ſame Authority, which you do to
the Marqueſs of <hi>Louvoy.</hi> Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Faults are uſually imputed to their
Maſter; and if War happen to enſue, How
many People ſuffer for the Guilt of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſon? It ſeems to me, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> was the cauſe that the War
laſted ſo long. 'Tis true, the end of it hath
prov'd glorious to your Majeſty; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid you owe it to his good Conduct:
<pb facs="tcp:98314:7"/>
'Tis evident, that by him the Safety of your
Realm was brought into danger, out of which,
nothing but the Hand of GOD deliver'd
you. He is then anſwerable to all your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for the Blood he hath coſt 'em. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
had your Majeſty been leſs reſpected and
admired, he might have perhaps made you
loſe the Love of your Subjects; for you who
are their Father, ought to be as ſparing of
their Blood, as of your own. Is it not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
very ſtrange, that a Miniſter, who never
ſaw War but in Paint, ſhould pretend to
know more of it than all yonr Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
when your Majeſty can juſtly boaſt of
the beſt in all <hi>Europe?</hi> For where-ever the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> are
nam'd, there is no body but knows that your
Majeſty's Reign (deſtin'd to have in it all
that is great upon Earth) hath two of the
greateſt Generals <hi>Europe</hi> hath ſeen theſe many
Years.</p>
                  <p>Divine Providence, of whoſe Effects your
Majeſty is hourly ſenſible, hath led you out of
thoſe dangerous Ways, wherein another would
have been loſt: Your Piety, which appears in
all your Actions, returns daily Thanks to GOD
for it, who is delighted with your Gratitude.
But ſince every one doth not think, that all
which <hi>here below</hi> comes to paſs, is from
<pb facs="tcp:98314:7"/>
GOD, the Faults of your Miniſter aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Number of your Enemies; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
when he expoſes your naked Breaſt, who
ſhould take moſt care to defend it, they ſhall
at laſt pierce your very Heart. Hence it is,
that ſo many Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> endeavour
to do you all the Miſchief they can; and
would certainly mortally wound you, were it
not impoſſible to do Him any harm, whom
GOD hath ſo viſibly taken into his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>We can alſo ſay, without flattering your
Majeſty, That never was any Prince more
worthy of that Protection. You have all
the Qualities of a Great King, and of a
King truly Chriſtian: If you had any Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in your Youth, you are, Thanks be to
GOD, ſo well come to your Self, that you
only remember 'em to do the greater Penance
for 'em. He that will pleaſe your Majeſty,
muſt live in your Court as if he were in a
Cloyſter, out of which all Vice muſt be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.
If Envy reign there, yet no body is
ſuffer'd to ſhew it: Your Majeſty is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Vertue to all your Courtiers: And
though the Corruption of the Age be ſo great,
that they cannot imitate their Maſter; yet <hi>if
they would pleaſe him,</hi> they muſt ſeem to
do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98314:8"/>
This return of your Majeſty to GOD,
is the Reward of your never having forgot
Him, in what State and Condition ſoever
you were. If through Human Frailty you
have done like a <hi>David,</hi> or many of thoſe
Sinners who are now in Paradice; yet you
never pretended upon that account, to excuſe
your ſelf from rendring to GOD that which
was due to Him. You endeavour'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Pardon, by Worſhipping him as he
ought to be, and by a perfect reſignation of
your ſelf to him; becauſe you know 'tis the
way to incline him to Mercy. No Man can
ſay you have been one Day of all your Life
without hearing Maſs: And though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
King your Father was very pious, he
never could, as you do; refrain, during the
Celebration of that adorable Myſtery; from
talking with thoſe about him, nor from many
indecent Poſtures in which he then uſed to
be.</p>
                  <p>The Fear of GOD, which you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had before your Eyes, made you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reſolve, to let People, for a while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
things of you, which were only ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
rather than clear your ſelf in their
Thoughts, by frequenting the Sacraments.
You forbore coming to them, ſo long as you
<pb facs="tcp:98314:8"/>
thought your ſelf not worthy of them; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
your Weakneſs too great, to perform
the Promiſes you made to GOD. This was a
ſign of the Tenderneſs of your Conſcience,
wherein you are ſo far from being like other
Princes, who affect external Mortifications at
that very time they are privately plunging
themſelves into all ſorts of Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I now ſay of all your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
good Qualities, which make you paſs in
the Opinion of thoſe that perfectly know you,
for the honeſteſt Man in all your Kingdom?
A Truth equally in the mouths of all your
Subjects; and aſſures me, I cannot be guilty
of Flattering you, though your Majeſty were
leſs known. It is then neither Flattery, nor
is it the Gratitude I owe you, for all thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Favours I have receiv'd from your
Majeſty, which make me ſay, There hath not,
for a long time, been ſo Great a King
upon Earth: I ſay it, becauſe I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is true; and nothing ſhall ever make
me change my Opinion.</p>
                  <p>For without mentioning the many Strong
Places you have taken, and the many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
you have obtain'd, where is the Prince,
who after having been ſo ill Educated, hath
better natural Inclinations? I dare not ſay
<pb facs="tcp:98314:9"/>
all that I think in this particular, becauſe I
may be accuſed of Ingratitude to Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> my Benefactor. 'Tis better for
me to be ſilent, and only ſpeak of that which
all the World cannot behold without Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Yes, SIR, I will maintain, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> or the <hi>Alexanders,</hi> more
wonderful Things have been done in your
Reign, than in any of thoſe Great Men's,
whom Antiquity doth ſo much boaſt. Never
did any King go ſo early into the Wars, as
you did; if it be ſaid you did not properly go,
but were carry'd, becauſe the Condition of your
Affairs requir'd you ſhould be ſeen by your
Soldiers on the Frontiers: In anſwer to this,
I only ask, Whether it was not of your own
accord, and not by the Counſel of Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> that you continu'd whole Days on
Horsback; which was the cauſe of that great
Sickneſs, whereof 'twas thought you would have
dy'd at <hi>Calais?</hi> 'Tis well known, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
daily told you, you would certainly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
your Health, by being ſo much fatigu'd.
'Tis alſo certain, he would have hinder'd you
from going to the Fort of <hi>Mardyke,</hi> where
the Air was ſo much infected, and ſo many
were ſick, that he might well be in great fear
for your Majeſty's ſacred Perſon: But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
you then had for all that is Great and
Glorious, made you neglect his Counſel;
<pb facs="tcp:98314:9"/>
ſo that he had reaſon to think, that would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
which he ſo much fear'd.</p>
                  <p>You being then but Twenty Years of Age,
ſome perhaps will ſay, that in what your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
then did, there was nothing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and that many others have done as much.
But 'tis fit it ſhould be known, that more than
Ten Years before, you had been in the Field,
and ſeen ſeveral Sieges, from which for the
ſafety of your Perſon, you were drawn againſt
your will; becauſe you were never better
pleas'd than when you were with your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
to inform your ſelf of a hundred
things, which were then above your Age.
What pity is it, that a Prince born with
ſo great Qualities, had not that Education
which your Majeſty hath given Mon Seigneur
the Dauphin? What Miracles had we not
then ſeen in your Reign? Seeing 'tis a
wonder if a Prince, who hath not had the
help of good Education, doth not heap fault
upon fault.</p>
                  <p>I could make very good Reflections, upon
your Majeſty's having ſo perfectly well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
your ſelf, notwithſtanding you never
had any knowledge of that which contributes
to the compleat Education of a Prince. This
alſo gives me a good occaſion, to ſpeak of all
that your Majeſty hath done, in bringing
<pb facs="tcp:98314:10"/>
Learned and Skilful Men (at your own great
Charge) from Foreign Countries, and by
Eſtabliſhing Manufactures in your own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
So that the <hi>French</hi> have now at
home, that which they were obliged with great
Expence of their Money, to ſeek for abroad;
and what is yet more, this hath your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
done of your ſelf, without receiving the
leaſt light or advice from others.</p>
                  <p>You were Educated very tenderly amongſt
Women; I cannot forbear ſaying ſo, becauſe
it would rob your Majeſty of that Glory
which is your due; when it is known, that
notwithſtanding ſo ill an Education, you are
become that which we now ſee you are. I
have yet a great deal more to ſay of thoſe
many things your Majeſty hath done, which
appear ſo great and ſurpriſing; conſidering
what I have juſt now ſaid of your Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But I paſs that by, to keep my ſelf to
the Subject I have here propoſed. I muſt
tell you with all the Reſpect I owe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that the only thing wherein you can be
blamed, is, that you are too good to, and
put too much confidence in thoſe on whom
you rely in ſome of your Affairs. It is not
to ſhew my own Parts, that I pretend to
find fault with other Mens Actions: Perhaps
I am more ſubject to Faults than they; but
the Zeal I have for your Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
will not ſuffer me to be longer ſilent.
<pb facs="tcp:98314:10"/>
Be pleaſed therefore to let me give you the
Hiſtory in ſhort, of all that hath paſt in
your Majeſty's Reign, and ſhew you wherein
I think you have been ill ſerv'd: Be alſo
pleas'd to let me tell you, by what means I
Imagine you may yet make your Kingdom more
Glorious. I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty to
pardon this Liberty, and to believe I would never
have preſum'd to have ſaid any thing on this
Subject, were it not that I cannot better
teſtifie my Zeal to ſerve your Majeſty. That
which more particularly obligeth me to tell
you my Thoughts, is, That I find
my ſelf daily declining; and that according to
all appearance, I have but a very little longer
time to do you any Service. Curts and Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchings
ſhorten Men's Days; and I have
toil'd enough, ſince your Majeſty was pleas'd
to truſt me with the Management of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
to think 'tis now time to leave my
Place to another. How happy ſhould I be,
if in dying, I could perſuade your Majeſty to
believe, That I am, what all Days of my Life
I have been, with moſt profound Reſpect,</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. Containing a brief Account of the Reign of
Lewis the Great, from his coming to
the Crown, 'till the Year 1649. in which
the War of Paris began.</head>
               <p>DID not your Majeſty know ſo much
better than I do, that what is moſt
neceſſary to make a Kingdom flouriſh,
is a perfect Harmony and Agreement
between all its Members; I would preſume to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98314:14"/>
ſhew here what Care a Prince ought to take,
that there be no Diſcord or Diviſion among 'em:
But ſince this depends upon a right Eſtabliſhment
of Subordination, your Majeſty is better able
than any Man, to order that as it ought to be,
who ſo well underſtand to act the Part of a
King, that 'tis enough to diſtinguiſh by your
Air and Mien, that you was born to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>We ſee then what it is that gives Beginning to
a Kingdom's Proſperity, and what it is continues
it: For if he that is the Soveraign doth not
know, or is not able to do, what he ought, he
muſt then have a Miniſter under him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſame Reſpect which People have for
his Maſter, is not uſually paid to him; thence
ariſe thoſe Canvaſings and Conteſts, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
turn to Rebellions, and ſometimes cauſe
the total Ruin of a Kingdom. The Reign of
the King your deceaſed Father, was full of ſuch
Accidents: The Royal Family was ſo divided,
that the Mother was againſt the Son, and the
Son againſt the Mother; the Brother likewiſe
ſought to deſtroy his Brother and his King.
The other Princes of the Blood ſtood not much
better affected. All which proceeded from his
Majeſty's giving ſo much Power to his Prime
Miniſter, that the Princes thought it was he
that did all, as they had great reaſon to believe;
otherwiſe the Queen-Mother had not been ſo
abandon'd, as to die at <hi>Cologne</hi> in ſuch diſtreſs,
that ſhe had not the one half of what ſhe wanted,
to relieve her Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98314:14"/>
Your Majeſty's Minority was expos'd to the
ſame Inconveniencies, becauſe you were not
then able to direct your Affairs: The Queen
your Mother, when the King died, found them
embroil'd, and in ſo great confuſion, that it was
not poſſible for a Woman to reduce 'em into
order. Your Father, when he died, left no
Prime Miniſter; Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who with
a great deal of Reputation diſcharg'd the Duties
of that Place, had left it vacant four or five
Years: A thouſand People expected to ſucceed
him in it; and tho' all <hi>France</hi> did agree, That
among ſo many, there was hardly one to be
found worthy of the Miniſtry: Yet ſo great a
number of Competitors ſtriving to obtain it,
occaſion'd by your Father's limiting the Queen
his Widow's Power, who ſhould have been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> think our Diſorders
might turn to their Advantage; they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
<hi>Rocroy,</hi> which they believ'd they ſhould
quickly carry, and enter into the heart of the
Kingdom. But God confounded their Pride,
by the loſs of a Battel given them by <hi>Louis de
Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> (then call'd Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien;</hi>)
wherein they were ſo totally defeated,
that they have never ſince been able to recover
their loſs. But without robbing that Prince of
any part of his Glory, we may ſay, That this
ſucceſs was owing to none but God; for had he
not taken your Majeſty into his Protection, the
Enemy might have advanced to the head of a
narrow Way, through which the General muſt
have paſt in their preſence. They might alſo
have fallen upon him, when by the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98314:15"/>
of the Ways he was oblig'd to divide his
Army. But beſide all theſe Difficulties, there
was an apparent danger in giving Battel; for
had it been loſt, the Enemy might have march'd
to the very Gates of <hi>Paris.</hi> But 'tis ſometimes
God's Will, that neither Party ſhall think of
doing that which they ſhould do; and then he
leads thoſe ſtep by ſtep, whom he hath reſolv'd
to protect.</p>
               <p>The happy ſucceſs of this Battel of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> was
follow'd with a Joy that was the more ſincere,
becauſe your Subjects had a tender Love for your
Majeſty, and the Queen your Mother. The
Perſecution ſhe had ſuffer'd, as well as <hi>Mary
de Medicis,</hi> during Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s Miniſtry,
procur'd your Mother a great deal of pity; and
as Pity is uſually accompany'd with Eſteem,
the more unhappy ſhe had been, the more
People reſolv'd to follow her Fortune. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it ought to be obſerv'd, it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with <hi>Mary de Medicis;</hi> for all People ſaw
her departure out of the Kingdom with dry eyes;
no body was concern'd, but her own particular
Servants and Domeſticks. Upon which may be
made this very good Reflection, That Princes
ſoon loſe the Love of their beſt Subjects by their
ill Government. She had ſhewn too much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Mareſchal <hi>d'Ancre,</hi> and his Wife, both
of her own Country, to be pity'd by the People.
And as in <hi>France,</hi> as well as in other Places,
they do not love to obey Strangers, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
murmur'd at it, and left the Court, becauſe
the Queen little regarged their Complaints. The
King your Father alſo grew jealous of their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98314:15"/>
Power, which caus'd the Aſſaſſination of the
Mareſchal, and the tragical end of his Wife.</p>
               <p>However, it was very ill digeſted; and God
be thanked we have not ſeen your Majeſty's
Reign ſtain'd with any thing like it. A King
never doth well to dip his Hands in the Blood
of his Subjects: When they deſerve Puniſhment,
they ought to be legally proſecuted in a Court
of Juſtice; which perhaps ſometimes cannot be
ſafely done, when a Subject becomes ſo great,
that his Maſter hath juſt cauſe to be afraid of
him. <hi>Walleſtein</hi> was ſuch a one; and therefore
the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. was excuſable, for
commanding he ſhould be kill'd. <hi>Henry</hi> III.
had the ſame reaſon to rid himſelf of the Duke
of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> when he was upon the point of uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Kingdom, and ſhutting him up in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</p>
               <p>But, except in ſuch caſes, a Criminal is to be
put into the hands of Juſtice; not only for the
Prince's own ſake, but becauſe it is neceſſary the
People ſhould know that the Perſon is guilty.
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. took this courſe with Mareſchal <hi>Biron;</hi>
for tho' he fear'd, that if <hi>Biron</hi> perceiv'd his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
were diſcover'd, he might raiſe Troubles
in the Kingdom; yet that did not hinder the
King from having a greater regard to what he
ought to do for his own ſake, than for what
might thappen.</p>
               <p>The Queen your Mother, SIR, had done
well, had ſhe taken example by that which befel
<hi>Mary de Medicis;</hi> ſhe had not then brought the
State, as ſhe did, within ſo near being loſt, by the
choice ſhe made of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> to ſucceed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98314:16"/>
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu.</hi> His being a Stranger, made
all your Subjects forget the Obedience that was
due to their Soveraign. It was to no purpoſe
to tell them, He had already done great Services
to the Crown, and was ſtill able to do greater,
becauſe he underſtood foreign Affairs better
than any other Perſon; which indeed is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for a Publick Miniſter. But
they fancy'd theſe Reaſons not ſo good as their
own; nor could they be beaten out of their
Opinion, That he being born a Subject of the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was never to be truſted. And
accuſing the Queen-Mother of being more a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
than a <hi>French</hi>-Woman, they ſeem'd to
repent the Pity they had had for her; which
appear'd in their confeſſing Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
had reaſon to perſecute her; tho' all the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ſhe had endur'd, had no other foundation,
than a pretended private Intelligence ſhe kept
with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> her Brother. But ſo
People might ſatisfie their Paſſion, they car'd
not at what Price they did it.</p>
               <p>I have reaſon to call all that Paſſion, which
was done a little after the Death of the King
your Father; ſince it is certain, that your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
do not alway call Reaſon to their Aid: If
they had, they would have ſeen that the Queen
your Mother was not ſo much to be blam'd as
they thought, ſeeing ſhe had preferr'd, before
others, a Man that was able to keep up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
the Crown had gotten in foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and knew what courſe was to be taken to
meet there with ſucceſs. 'Tis that which all the
World doth not know, tho' it be a thing of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98314:16"/>
very great Conſequence. My Brother, whom
your Majeſty Honour'd with making him Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State for Foreign Affairs, took the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
many times to repreſent it to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
but the Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who hath Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
very contrary to thoſe Great Men's, who
have preceeded him in the Adminiſtration of the
Kingdom, deſtroy'd in a moment all that he
ſtrove to do. But I know not whether the
Marqueſs will always have Reaſon on his ſide,
becauſe he makes uſe of the Strength only of
your own Subjects; which Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
who knows as much as he, did not do, when he
carried the War into <hi>Germany,</hi> made <hi>Catalonia</hi>
and <hi>Portugal</hi> revolt: and led the way to the low'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, tho' your Kingdom be very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and your Majeſty hath a third part at leaſt
increas'd its Strength by your Conqueſts; yet
'tis contrary to good Senſe to exhauſt all its
Forces. Your Majeſty will be better able to
maintain the War, by arming other Princes in
your Favour: But to do that, you muſt treat
them like Soveraigns, as they are, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
as Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> doth, becauſe they are
your Majeſty's Inferiours, they ought to look
upon themſelves as Slaves. Your Majeſty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
knows not what Anſwer he made to the
Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Envoy, who complaining at
the beginning of the <hi>Holland</hi> War, That his
Maſter was no better treated, than thoſe who
were actually in Arms againſt you; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
told him, That it did not become ſuch a
petty Prince as his Maſter, to make ſo great a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98314:17"/>
Noiſe about ſo ſmall a Matter: That your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was not bound to give an account to any
Man of your Actions: And, That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
ſtanding ſo much on his Points, was
the way to loſe the Honour of your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Such great Words, SIR, may imprint on
Mens Minds, a magnificent <hi>Idaea</hi> of your Power:
But ought your Majeſty to be contented with
it? Would it not turn more to your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that your Juſtice ſhould be extoll'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than proclaim the Condition you are in at
preſent to oppreſs your Neighbours. That has
never been the way to enlarge Empires: The
<hi>Romans,</hi> who boaſted themſelves Maſters of all
the World, had more regard for their Allies,
than your Miniſter hath for yours. To ſubject
them, requires more addreſs: 'Tis better Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
to weaken 'em by War, of which let 'em
ſuffer the Inconveniences, but reap none of the
Advantages. Conqueſts are not ordinarily
made for them, tho' they are the Baits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are uſually tempted and drawn in.
They may be wean'd from their part in them,
under ſpecious Pretences: As in the laſt War,
when your Majeſty made the Neighbour-Princes
reſtore the Places they had taken from the
King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and which the Emperour did
not oppoſe, becauſe it was his Intereſt, that thoſe
Princes ſhould not increaſe their Power; and
which was all the Reward he gave them, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his part.</p>
               <p>I know not whether that which I have now
ſaid be a Digreſſion; becauſe it hath carried me
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98314:17"/>
from my Subject: But I could not find a ſitter
place for it than here; and the reflexions to be
made upon it, are of as great conſequence as
thoſe I have yet to make, on the choice the
Queen your Mother made of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
To excuſe her preferring him before others, three
Reaſons were given. The Firſt was, becauſe he
was acquainted with Foreign Affairs; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was, That not being a Native of <hi>France,</hi>
he had no kindred or Relations to enrich; the
Third was, That more People would have been
diſpleas'd and diſſatisfy'd, had he been a <hi>French</hi>
Man. But theſe Reaſons are ſo weak, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they do not much ſway your Majeſty; as
for the Firſt, if Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> knew Affairs
abroad, he was ignorant of thoſe at home, which
were as neceſſary to be known as thoſe that were
Foreign; and indeed, the Inconvenience is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſeeing that which comes neareſt the Heart,
is of much greater conſequence, than that which
lyes remote from it. Beſide, the knowledge of
Foreign Affairs, is not ſo very difficult to be
acquired; the Situation and the State of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
is the greateſt part of it, and by that a
Man ought to regulate himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Second Reaſon is not better, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
for there are a hundred things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt it: A Stranger hath as great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
as any other Perſon, to enrich his Kindred,
in what place ſoever they be: Beſide, he can ſend
for them, when he finds himſelf well ſetled.
Three of his Nephews, and ſeven Neices, who
came quickly into <hi>France,</hi> are an undeniable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of this Truth; and a Miniſter could
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98314:18"/>
hardly have been taken out of any other Family,
wherein there was to be found a greater number
of Kindred and Relations: But a greater Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in the Choice, was, that he being a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner,
and not certain how long he ſhould keep
his Poſt, would be every Day tranſmitting into
his own Country, that which might plentifully
maintain him, in caſe he fell into diſgrace. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
it was not to be ſuppoſed, that a Stranger
could be ſo well affected to <hi>France,</hi> as one that
ſucked in the Love of his Country with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Milk; to which I will add, that ſeeing he
was not Married, nor in a condition ever to be
ſo, he could not look upon <hi>France,</hi> as a Country,
wherein he himſelf, or his Poſterity, could ever
hope to be ſetled.</p>
               <p>The Third Reaſon is much weaker than the
other Two; which was, that when in ſo great a
Kingdom as your Majeſty's, People of very great
Quality and Merit, ſee the Miniſtry put into the
Hands of a Stranger; Who is he, that hath ſo
ill an Opinion of himſelf, as to believe he doth
not better deſerve it, than a Man to whom no
body is related? Whoſe Manners and good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are not known; and to whom, were Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
never ſo much convinc'd of his Merit, they
would not be ſo juſt as to give him his due?
For my own part, I believe the Queen your
Mother had ſome other Reaſons (than thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged)
for her Choice. Perhaps it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
other Pretenders did not make uſe of her
Intereſt to obtain the Place, and conſequently,
foreſeeing they would not thank her, ſhe, for that
Reaſon, made the Choice ſhe did. But whatever
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98314:18"/>
it was, her Majeſty quickly ſaw ſo many new
Troubles break out, that tho' ſhe had been us'd
to the like, in the Reign of the deceaſed King,
yet ſhe was very much ſurpris'd: Their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſeem'd not ſo much to be fear'd, becauſe
among all the Malecontents that openly declared
themſelves, there was neither a Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
or a Prince of the Blood, as there was in the
time of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s Miniſtry: But it was
in this, Men were moſt deceived; for Popular
Commotions are more difficult to be appeas'd,
than thoſe wherein ſome great Perſon is ingag'd;
for he by ſome particular Favour ſeaſonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
on him, is uſually bought off from doing
farther Miſchief; whereas, many Arts are to be
uſed to calm a mutinous Multitude, and eſpecially
when they have taken a fancy to Command.</p>
               <p>The Revolt (of which I ſhall hereafter ſpeak
to your Majeſty) was of this kind; for the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
of <hi>Paris</hi> was concern'd in it, though they
decreed the Queen your Mother, ſhould have the
Tuition of your Majeſty, with a more ample
Power, than that which the deceaſed King by his
Declaration left her; yet this being done by the
ſolicitation of her chief Almoner the Biſhop of
<hi>Beauvais,</hi> who had a great many Friends, and
to whom ſhe had given hopes to be firſt Miniſter,
as ſoon as he ſaw himſelf deceived, and not able
to undoe what he had done, he did all he could
to ſtir up Enemies againſt her. Her Majeſty,
who had a great Soul, and worthy of her high
Birth, thought this was but a Wave which would
break of it ſelf, and whereof ſhe was not ſo
much as to ſeem to take any notice; nevertheleſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98314:19"/>
ſtill aiming at your Majeſty's Grandeur, ſhe gave
Orders to the Duke d' <hi>Anguien,</hi> who after the
Battel of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> had given the Garriſon of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drecis</hi>
great Liberty, by demoliſhing certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
that ſtraighten'd it, to lay Seige to <hi>Thyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
Mareſchal <hi>de Guebriant</hi> who was on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> endeavoured to amuſe the
Enemy, that they might not relieve the Place;
nevertheleſs <hi>Mello,</hi> who had gotten together the
ſcattered Troops of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, joyning with
General <hi>Bek,</hi> reſolved the Place ſhould not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
without Blows: But your Majeſty's Fortune
ſupported by the Duke <hi>d' Anguien</hi>'s Valour,
fruſtrated all their Endeavours, ſo that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
which made ſuch a Noiſe abroad, began to
make your Reign ſo Illuſtrious, that your Allyes,
who fear'd the Death of the deceaſed King,
would make a change in your Affairs, did now
again begin to take Courage.</p>
               <p>It was by your means, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> did not
only keep their Conqueſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
them. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> likewiſe,
by your Aſſiſtance, retook <hi>Trin,</hi> and <hi>Pontdeſture,</hi>
which were in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
But that which gave them more Trouble, was
the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s putting the Crown of
<hi>Portugal</hi> upon his own Head, by the Aid your
deceaſed Father had given him; and ſtill kept it
in ſpite of all <hi>Spain,</hi> by the ſuccours he receiv'd
from you: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no better Succeſs
in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>La Mothe</hi> fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all their Deſigns; ſo that that Province re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
at the ſame time <hi>Portugal</hi> did, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it ſelf againſt all the Power of <hi>Spain.</hi> Your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98314:19"/>
Majeſty likewiſe beat them at Sea, where the
Duke <hi>de Breſsé,</hi> who commanded your Fleet,
ſet upon them in the Port of <hi>Cartagena.</hi> Theſe
Miracles were done in the firſt Year of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,
and loſt none of their Luſtre; but by
the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which
Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had a little too imprudently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken;
and by a Tumult rais'd in <hi>Rovergne,</hi>
which was quickly quaſh'd. That which is yet
more wonderful, is, That your Realm, which
was not very quiet, did not promiſe ſuch favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Events; and that you were alſo obliged to
cauſe the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> to be ſeiſed, who
conſpired againſt your Prime Miniſter: You at
firſt reſolved to have Exemplary Juſtice executed
upon him, and therefore ordered your Court of
Parliament to proſecute him: but you being the
beſt of Men, cauſed all proceedings againſt him
to ceaſe, and you were contented he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
his Crime, only by impriſonment.</p>
               <p>The following Year, 1664. was not altogether
ſo proſperous, at leaſt the beginning of it: For
Mareſchal <hi>Guebriant</hi>'s Army was defeated at <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teling,</hi>
by their fault, under whoſe Command it
remained after his Death. That General, who
towards the end of the preceeding Year, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<hi>Rotuiel,</hi> was there hurt with a Faucon Shot,
whereof he died: Which may put your Majeſty
in mind of how great conſequence it is to you,
to have an experienc'd General; as ſuch a one is
hard to be found, ſo your Majeſty ought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſet a high Value upon him; but likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
others to follow your Example. For is it
not a ſtrange thing to ſee with what Haughtineſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98314:20"/>
Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> treats your Commanders, even
from the higheſt to the loweſt; 'tis with ſo much
Pride, that it diſguſts all Men of any Courage;
and they would certainly deſert your Majeſty, if
their Love for you did not prevail over their
Reſentments. I very well know, when he gives
your Majeſty an Account of things, he very much
Miſ-repreſents them: He makes you believe,
that unleſs your Commanders be kept Humble,
they will not Obey you, and you ſhall never be
ſerved by them as you ought to be: But he is
much in the wrong; For all your Subjects love
you ſo well, that they all blindly obey you. The
Marqueſs, with this Pretence, cloaks all his exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
Ambition; he is very well pleaſed to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
his own Intereſt with your Majeſty's, which
might be of dangerous conſequence to a King,
not ſo Wiſe and Virtuous as you are. It would
be an Inſenſible Uſurpation upon his Authority,
and there needed nothing more to plain the way
to his Throne. Your Majeſty perhaps doth not
know, that to get Preferment, 'tis much better
to be his Creature, than to have Merit; ſo that
he hath a greater Court than yours; and all the
difference between them is, that to meet with
Succeſs in the one, Men muſt Cringe, and make
low Bows; but in the other, it is enough to be
a Brave and an Honeſt Man.</p>
               <p>The great Affairs, which your Majeſty had
then upon your Hands, did not hinder you from
giving Refuge to a Princeſs perſecuted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who made War againſt their
King, and by their evil Deſigns againſt him,
made it evident, they would carry on their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98314:20"/>
to the utmoſt extremity, your Majeſty
mollified his Misforune, by giving a Retreat to
the Queen his Wife; which will not be one of
the leaſt remarkable Paſſages in your Hiſtory;
ſince pity doth not always reign in the Hearts of
Kings, they oftner giving ear to what Policy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts,
than to the Dictates of their Duty. But
I can, without deceiving my ſelf, ſay, that this
Policy is none of the beſt, ſince the ſame Fate
may befal all Soveraigns; and it were better
they would with their Arms puniſh Rebellion:
Then perhaps it would not be ſo frequent as it is
in all Kingdoms. But this is to adviſe what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
it being now the general practice, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quite to undoe, than help an unhappy
Man.</p>
               <p>For an Action ſo acceptable, God ſoon rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
your Majeſty, you made your ſelf Maſter of
<hi>Gravelins,</hi> notwithſtanding all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of General <hi>Picolomini</hi>) could
do to hinder it, your Army kept them from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring
<hi>Germany.</hi> You ſent thither the Duke
<hi>d' Anguien,</hi> who there gain'd the Famous Battel
of <hi>Friburg,</hi> your Troops fighting three Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to get a compleat Victory. The fruit of
your Labours was the taking of <hi>Phillipsbourg,</hi> and
all the places upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> near it. Beſide, you
reconfirm'd your Allyes, who were in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
for what had happened at <hi>Teuteling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had it's Revenge in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi>
where Mareſchal <hi>de la Motthe</hi> was beaten,
in endeavouring to relieve <hi>Lerida,</hi> which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and he forc'd to raiſe the ſiege of <hi>Terragonne,</hi>
which he had inveſted to make a diverſion. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laguier</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98314:21"/>
was alſo reduced, and ſo had been the
whole Province, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Affairs had gone
well in <hi>Portugal:</hi> But having loſt a great Battel
there, they were forc'd to carry ſome Troops
thither, which did ſo weaken them, that they
could do nothing more all that Campaign.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Italy</hi> likewiſe, was not very proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
after ſeveral Ingagements, wherein the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as your Majeſty, met ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with good, and ſometimes with ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>Your Army was forced to quit the Siege of
<hi>Finall;</hi> but you ſucceeded better in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your Rights at <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to affront you in the Perſon of your
Ambaſſadour: The Protection which you
gave to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> from whom the
Pope for his convenience had taken the Dutchy
of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> weighed much with many in that
Country; ſo that by your Medition, Peace
was made with many Princes, who had taken
Part in that Quarrel.</p>
               <p>So many great things were not able to ſatisfie
your Mind: you cut out work for the Emperour,
who endeavoured to do the like to your Allyes;
and ſeeing he made the <hi>Danes</hi> Arm againſt the
<hi>Swedes,</hi> you were not only quit with him, in
ſtirring up the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> againſt him;
but you ſent an Ambaſſador to the two Crowns
to hinder their differences from proceeding any
further: And ſince it was not your humour to give
Counſel to others, which you would not follow
your ſelf, you conſented to treat of a general
Peace at <hi>Munſter,</hi> where ſome were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98314:21"/>
with a reſolution to put an end to ſo great
a work.</p>
               <p>Your mediation was received by the Northern
Crowns, in ſpite of all the Traverſes made by
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to render it ſuſpected,
and your Miniſters finding ſo great a Progreſs
made towards the ending of their Differences,
their Endeavours ſucceeded ſo well, that a Peace
was concluded. The <hi>Sweeds</hi> being delivered
from their Troubles, cauſed by this War; you
ordered Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> whom you had ſent
the Year before into <hi>Germany,</hi> to take upon him
the Command of Mareſchal <hi>Guebrient</hi>'s Army,
and to act in concert with them; but tho' he was
a great Captain, he was defeated at <hi>Mariendall,</hi>
it being impoſſible for him to avoid it. Here
begun the Campagne of 1645. wherein you had
quickly your Revenge, almoſt in all places where
you had Souldiers: You took <hi>Roſes</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
having ſent thither Count <hi>Harcourt,</hi> in the place
of Mareſchal <hi>la Motthe,</hi> whom you caus'd to be
ſeized, not only for the Faults he was guilty of the
former Campagne; but becauſe to excuſe himſelf,
he endeavour'd to blemiſh the Reputation of your
chief Miniſter, whom he accus'd to be the cauſe
of his ill Succeſs, pretending he had let him want
all things: But 'tis not reaſonable, that any
Perſon ſhould juſtifie himſelf at another Man's
coſt; at leaſt, when things are not as clear as
the Day. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavoured to relieve
<hi>Roſes;</hi> but Count <hi>Harcourt</hi> having oppoſed their
Paſſage, while the Count <hi>du Pleſſis Praſlin</hi> was
before it; they tryed to put in Relief by Sea,
but met with the ſame Difficulties, becauſe your
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98314:22"/>
Fleet was there: Your Majeſty (who takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in rewarding Men of Merit) ſent a Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal's
Staff to Count <hi>du Pleſſis.</hi> The taking of
this Town, was follow'd with the defeat of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in the plain of <hi>Livrons,</hi> and the re-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Balaguier;</hi> ſo that after ſo many happy
Succeſſes, all that had gone ill in the former
Campagne, was quite forgot.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> whom you ſent again
this Year into <hi>Germany,</hi> quickly reveng'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne,</hi> by defeating the Enemy at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingue;</hi>
while the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
took the Fort of <hi>Mardyke, Link,</hi> and <hi>Bourbourg.</hi>
Your Majeſty multiplied your Conqueſts, with
adding thoſe of St. <hi>Venant, Lilliers, Armentiers</hi>
and <hi>Bethunes.</hi> You caus'd the Fort of <hi>la Motthe</hi>
to be demoliſh'd, out of which the <hi>Lorrain</hi>
Troops were driven with great difficulty, and
which ſerved them for a place of Retreat, after
committing a thouſand Robberies.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> had again ſignaliz'd the Glory
of your Arms in <hi>Italy,</hi> if he could have kept
<hi>Vigevane</hi> and its Cittadel, which he had taken:
But it was impoſſible for him to reſiſt the great
Efforts the Enemy made to retake 'em. The
Emperour, on his ſide, ſent ſo ſtrong an Army
to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that he re-took all the Places he
had loſt, <hi>Phillipsbourg</hi> only excepted. Perhaps
it had not been done, if the Duke <hi>d' Anguien</hi>
had been at the Head of your Majeſty's Troops;
but he was fallen Sick, and return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi>
Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> in the mean time took <hi>Treves,</hi>
and your Maieſty reſtored it again to its lawful
Prince, whom, after a long Impriſonment,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98314:22"/>
you ſet at Liberty: You have always been a
Sanctuary to the Unfortunate, witneſs the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barines,</hi>
to whom you gave protection, though
all <hi>Europe</hi> thought them unworthy of it, for the
War they had kindled in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was but
juſt then extinguiſh'd: But it was enough when
they were perſecuted to have the Honour of
your Protection; of which the Duke of <hi>Monaco</hi>
being confident, threw himſelf into your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Arms, and quitted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Party,
which till then he had followed.</p>
               <p>The Year 1646, was full of great Events;
your Majeſty took a ſecond time the Fort of
<hi>Mardyke,</hi> which the Enemy had re-taken towards
the end of the Campagne; your Majeſty likewiſe
took <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dunquerque,</hi> which gave ſo
great an Allarm to all <hi>Flanders,</hi> that they thought
themſelves irrecoverably loſt. Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi>
enter'd into the very Heart of <hi>Germany,</hi> which
made the Emperour perceive, it was better to
make a Peace, than to hearken to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who endeavoured to perſwade him, that your
Majeſty, during your Minority, was not able
to bear the Burden of ſo many weighty Affairs,
you had then upon your Hands. Nevertheleſs,
your Miniſter engag'd you in an Enterprize,
for which he ought never to be forgiven; ſince
it was in no wiſe to your Majeſty's Advantage,
and that the publique Intereſt was leſs conſider'd
in it, than his own. He had married one of his
Relations to a Nephew of the <hi>Barbarin</hi>'s, and
this Allyance diſpoſing him to do all he could
for them, he carry'd the War to the Borders of
<hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and cauſed <hi>Orbitelle</hi> to be beſieged:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98314:23"/>
His deſign in this, was to mortifie the great Duke,
the <hi>Barbarin</hi>'s capital Enemy; but this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
having allarm'd all <hi>Italy,</hi> it gave ſuch Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as raiſed the Siege, tho'
your Fleet had repulſed the Enemy's. The
Succeſs which your Arms had at <hi>Piombino</hi> and
<hi>Portolongonne,</hi> did drowne the Memory of this
Loſs; but the Joy for that Succeſs was damp'd,
by the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Lerida,</hi> wherein
Count <hi>Harcourt</hi> had ſpent ſeven Months to no
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Protection which your Majeſty gave to
the <hi>Barbarines,</hi> was ſo great an Advantage to
them; that their Goods which had been ſeiz'd by
the Pope's Order, were reſtored to them. The
Cardinal <hi>Deſté</hi> was alſo ſenſible of the Honour
you did him, in embracing his Intereſt; for
without it, the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> would never
have done him reaſon, who took a pleaſure to
inſult him in the middle of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
You were indeed at that time, the Protector of
the Oppreſſed, which you made appear to the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> in whoſe favour you ſent an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
to the great <hi>Turk,</hi> to diſ-ſwade him from
the War he was about to make upon them: The
Reſpect which the Grand Signior had for your
Majeſty, made him promiſe all things; but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
will prevail over Promiſes, when one
hath to do with <hi>Barbarians;</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> quickly
forgot this, when he ſaw that Republique was
not in Caſe to defend it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Year 1647. was remarkable, for your
Majeſty's then having the Small-Pox, by which
you were in great Danger: But we were ſoon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98314:23"/>
rid of our Fear, when we ſaw the greatneſs of
your Courage; for you ask'd Pardon for one of
your Officers, whom the Queen had commanded
not to come near you, ſhe ſuſpecting you were
infected by him. What a loſs had it been for
<hi>France,</hi> and how great a happineſs for <hi>Spain,</hi> if
your Sickneſs had been Mortal, as 'twas feared?
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> whom, as young as you were, you
daily made to feel the weight of your Arm,
were ſo aſtoniſht, that they ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi>
the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> hoping that the greatneſs
of his Birth, would incite him to out-do thoſe
that had preceeded him in the Government of
thoſe Provinces, and make better Head againſt
your Majeſty: He came into the Country with
a good Army, and re-took <hi>Amentiers, Landrecis,</hi>
and <hi>Dixmude:</hi> But you took from him <hi>la Baſsée,</hi>
and <hi>Lens,</hi> where you loſt Mareſchal <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> who
was there Mortally wounded. Your Majeſty,
who had been the laſt Year on the Frontiers,
came thither again this Year, and inſpired Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
into your Souldiers, by giving 'em great
marks of your Liberality. But the Arch-Duke
hindering you from making any further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
in that Country; your Majeſty was very
well pleaſed with the great Succeſs your Arms
had in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was
forced to accept of a Neutrality, as the Duke of
<hi>Saxony</hi> had done ſome time before; ſo that the
Emperour had at that Inſtant concluded a Peace,
had not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſſwaded him from it;
their Reaſons were, the appearance of ſome
Sparks of the Civil-War, which ſoon after
broke out; but the Miſchief they wiſh'd us,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98314:24"/>
fell more upon them, than upon us; and the
Revolt which hap'ned at <hi>Naples,</hi> put them into
ſtrange Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty ſupported that Commotion,
with all your Forces; and equip'd a brave Fleet
to carry Succors thither: But the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi>
who had thrown himſelf into the Place, acting
there independently from your Majeſty; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi> who did not love him, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to recall the Fleet, without furniſhing him
with the Neceſſaries he wanted: The Cardinal
was inexcuſable, ſince it was a capital Crime
not to lay hold of ſo fair an Opportunity; if
your Majeſty had not been in full Minority,
you had been better ſerved. Notwithſtanding,
the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> maintain'd things with a great
deal of good Fortune and Courage, while the
Duke <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> who had now after his Father's
Death taken the Name of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi>
ſaw the Laurels he had gather'd in <hi>Flanders</hi> and
<hi>Germany,</hi> wither by his ill Succeſs before <hi>Lerida,</hi>
which he had beſieged.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could paſs over in ſilence the Year
1648. a Year! Fatal to our Monarchy! and
wherein, the greateſt part of your Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fail in their Obedience to your Majeſty;
you know the pretence they had for it, were the
many Taxes wherewith they were burdened;
but the real Cauſe was, the Ambition of the
Parliament, which pretended to enlarge its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
they began to examine all that your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
did in your Cabinet, and tho' you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them not to aſſemble about any other
Buſineſs, than to judge and determine the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98314:24"/>
and Law-Suits depending between your
Subjects; yet they regarded not your Commands;
but condemned your Edicts, whereof the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of your Affairs required the publication.
This put the Kingdom into ſo ill a Condition,
that the Arch-Duke took <hi>Furnes, Ettere</hi> and <hi>Lens:</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whom your Majeſty ſent
againſt him, having taken <hi>Ypres</hi> the beginning
of the Campagne, retook <hi>Ettere,</hi> and at <hi>Lens</hi> gave
the Arch-Duke Battel and beat him: This Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
encourag'd your Majeſty to try to ſuppreſs
the Sedition; you cauſed the chief Rebels to be
ſeized at their going out from the <hi>Te Deum</hi>
ſung at <hi>Notredame,</hi> for the Victory; but inſtead
of having, by this brisk Action, the Succeſs
you had reaſon t'expect; it heightened the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
to ſuch a degree, that you had cauſe to be
ſurpriz'd at it: The <hi>Pariſians</hi> took Arms in
Favour of the Priſoners, and having made Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoes
in all the Streets within an Hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of your Pallace, they oblig'd you to releaſe
them. I draw a Curtain over the remembrance
of an Action ſo diſpleaſing to you, and ſo
ſhameful in them; if the Queen could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
ſhe wou'd never have conſented to it;
for ſhe maintain'd it would be ſuch a Blow to
your Authority, as would be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.
I think ſhe was in the right, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this Condeſcention, ſerved only to increaſe
the Boldneſs of the Mutineers; ſo that they
were not long without making new Demands:
However, this did not hinder the Emperour from
concluding a Peace with your Majeſty, who by
having gain'd the Battel of <hi>Sommerhauſen,</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98314:25"/>
him to ſuch a condition, that he and thoſe
that had taken up Arms in his Favour, had been
loſt without it.</p>
               <p>You took care of the Intereſt of your Allyes,
whom the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by their Intriegues, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to ſeparate from you; but what is more
remarkable, you ſhewed your ſelf the Protector
of the Catholick Religion, though all your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes
are Proteſtants, and which might very well
have embroyled you with them. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
minded only his own Intereſts, and quite
forgot thoſe of Religion, which he had many
times, during the War, made a ſhew of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but there is great difference between
Words and Deeds, which teacheth us, that if
we will not be deceiv'd, it is much better to truſt
to the one, than to the other.</p>
               <p>This Treaty, wherein your Majeſty ſhew'd
your ſelf more firm to the Intereſt of your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,
than to your own; procur'd you the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of all the Princes of the Empire, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to look upon you as their Protector: They
did no longer fear the Emperour's bereaving
them of their Liberty, or that for the future,
there would be any more Princes, who like
<hi>Charles</hi> V. would endeavour to ſubject them.
What miſchief hath Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> done, to
trouble a Harmony ſo neceſſary to both Parties?
from which the Emperour could never hope for
any good? It may alſo be ſaid, that this Miniſter's
Imprudence hath been very great; ſeeing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
the juſt Fears all the Empire ought
to have, of his Imperial Majeſty's Power, yet
he hath ſo very ill treated all its Members,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98314:25"/>
that they are now again ready to unite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Majeſty; many Politicians wonder
at it, and ſay, that ſeeing they have more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to fear the Emperour, than your Majeſty,
they will take the wrong ſide, if they joyn again
with the Emperour: But to be of their Opinion,
it ought to be known, what this Miniſter of
yours requires of them; he never ſpeaks to them,
but with a Cudgel in his Hand, and ſince Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
are not uſed to be ſo treated, they think
if Chains are to be avoided, they are thoſe
which are preſented with ſo much rudeneſs.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty carry'd the War into <hi>Italy,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
you had ſo much to do in the Heart
of your own Kingdom: But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having
taken the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> Priſoner, and pacified
the troubles of <hi>Naples,</hi> they made the Duke of
<hi>Modena</hi> riſe from <hi>Cremona</hi> which he had beſieged
after his taking part with your Majeſty: But the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> fail'd in the Deſign they had upon <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi>
where they intended to burn your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Ships, wich were in that Port, and to ſeize
upon the Town, where many of the Inhabitants
held Intelligence with them. Your Majeſty, to
whom this was of extream great Conſequence,
caus'd thoſe that were moſt guilty to be puniſht,
and pardon'd others, that by your Goodneſs,
they might be induced not to fail for the future,
in the Obedience they ow'd you: But the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Attempts of the Parliament, being of very
ill Example to thoſe that were diſ-affected; in
many Places, People loſt all reſpect due to your
Majeſty; ſo that the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
according to the Example of the King your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98314:26"/>
Father, and of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of glorious Memory,
had aſſiſted againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made Peace
with them.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty, notwithſtanding all this, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the War in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> with a great deal
of Reputation; you rais'd the Siege of <hi>Flix,</hi> which
the Enemy had inveſted, and made your ſelf
Maſter of <hi>Tortoſe,</hi> in ſight of the Enemy's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Commanded by <hi>Mello,</hi> who went out of
<hi>Flanders</hi> thither; and had it not been for the
Rebellion of your Subjects, to how great a pitch
had your Glory been rais'd? It was very much
increas'd by the Victory your Navy had in the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> tho' it was much Inferiour to that
of the Enemys; for it conſiſted not of above
twenty nine Veſſels, when they had Forty Two.
Notwithſtanding, this Inequality did not hinder
you from ſinking Three, and had not Night came
on, they had reaſon to fear the loſs of more.</p>
               <p>So many Affairs, and of ſo great conſequence,
were enough to take up your thoughts, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they always tended to the good of your State,
you minded what paſs'd in <hi>Poland,</hi> where the
Glory of your Name fruſtrated all the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Endeavours, to have a King elected that ſhould
be a Friend to their Intereſt: But they were baff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in their Deſign; for <hi>Caſimire</hi> Brother to the
deceaſed, was preferr'd before the Perſon the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> propos'd, for which he was wholly
obliged to your Majeſty.</p>

weakneſs to have longer diſſembled your Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

<hi>Laye;</hi> you cauſed <hi>Paris</hi> to be block'd up by your

<hi>Condé.</hi> This puniſhment ought to have made
the <hi>Mutineers</hi> return to their Duty; but their
Boldneſs equal'd their Diſobedience, and after
they had ſtirr'd up other Cities of your Kingdom
to take their part, they rely'd on their own
Strength to reliſt <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> Scarce one (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Coadjutor himſelf, forgetting his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter)
but rais'd a Regiment againſt you: The
Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who had eſcap'd out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
was likewiſe one of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> mortal
Enemies; the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> Brother to the
Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> alſo took Arms againſt <hi>your
Majeſty;</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> his Siſter,
with the Duke her Husband, fell in with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and ſhe, by her Beauty, drew in the
Prince of <hi>Marſillae,</hi> who had more mind to her,
than to ſignalize his Diſobedience; but this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
LOVE, which blinds Men to that degree,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98314:27"/>
that they know not themſelves, made him forget
that reſpect he always had for <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and
in which he was better inſtructed than others,
becauſe he had an infinite deal of Wit.</p>
               <p>This was not the only miſchief which Love
did <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> the Jealouſie which this Prince of
<hi>Marſillac</hi> had againſt the Husband of the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs,
together with the fear he had his Paſſion
might be diſcover'd, would not let him reſt,
till he got into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he made that
Province revolt, being Governour of it. We
ſee what Springs Love ſets a going, which we
often attribute to Ambition, for want of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things to the bottom; but it is a dangerous
Paſſion, and very much to be condemned, when
a Miſtreſs makes us fail in our Duty to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
to whom we are ſo cloſely ty'd, that we
cannot be unfaithful to him, without being ſo
to GOD.</p>
               <p>The Bloccade of <hi>Paris</hi> had not the Effect <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> expected; and tho' that great City ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
extremely, yet the Parliament continued
ſo great an Averſion to your publique Miniſter,
that they were ſo Bold, as to require his being
ſent out of the Kingdom, before they would
lay down their Arms. This inſolent Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was accompanied with others of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but ſince the Reſolution of theſe Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,
did not anſwer the Hopes they had of
giving Law to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> they had Recourſe
to the Enemies of the Kingdom, to procure
Bread, which they very much wanted; for <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> had ſhut up the City ſo cloſe, that it
was at an exceſſive Price; and without ſpeedy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98314:27"/>
Relief, they were ready to fall into extreme
Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> cannot reflect upon theſe terrible
Marks of Rebellion, without being ſenſibly toucht
with them; and ſeeing it was of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to you, not to ſuffer your Enemies in
that unhappy Conjuncture, to enter into the
Heart of your Kingdom; you did that, which
brought the Parliament again to themſelves;
you ſent a Herald at Arms to make ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
to them, whereupon the Parliament being
aſſembled, they thought in ſome manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
what had been done, in ſending back the
Herald without hearing him; but at the ſame
time aſſured <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> they had refuſed him
Audience, out of the profound Reſpect they had
for you, becauſe they could not pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch a Perſon, as was never us'd to be ſent,
but to Soveraigns.</p>
               <p>This returning to their Duty, gave <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
occaſion to exhort them to do better for the
future, than they had done at preſent; and the
Conjuncture requiring, that you ſhould ſeem not
to reſent the bold Attempts, they had made on
your Authority, you granted a general Amne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to the Parliament, and to thoſe that had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
their Party.</p>
               <p>Your Enemies did not fail to take Advantage
of theſe Diſorders, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom
the King your Father had driven out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for having often fail'd of performing the
many Promiſes he had made him; entred again
into it, and made himſelf Maſter of many Towns;
he was likewiſe almoſt aſſured of retaking <hi>Nancy,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98314:28"/>
from which Marqueſs <hi>de la Ferté</hi>'s Avarice had
diverted all manner of Proviſions: But when he
ſaw that it might coſt him his Head, he quickly
came and caus'd all the Harveſt of Corn and
Fruit thereabout, to be carry'd into it, and
thereby made ſome amends for the Fault he had
committed; upon which <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and all
other <hi>Monarchs</hi> may make this Reflection;
That when a Subject prefers his own private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
before his Prince's, he is not only unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of any Favour; but is likewiſe reſponſible
for all the Evils the People ſuffer: For 'tis plain,
that what they do ſuffer is from ſuch Men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
who care not how they Ruin 'em, to
Inrich themſelves: However, your preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
did not then permit <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> to
take ſuch Order in that Caſe, as at another time
you might have done. Beſide, this Marqueſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himſelf ſo Prudently on other Occaſions,
that his Wiſdom and Courage, in ſome meaſure,
excus'd his Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The Parliament did not ceaſe to purſue
their Deſigns, tho' your Majeſty had had the
Goodneſs to pardon them; yet they were not
altogether ſo bad as the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
who were ſo wicked as to cut off their King's
Head. Your Majeſty was never ſeen to be ſo
angry, as when you heard that News; but the
great Affairs wherein you were then engag'd,
hinder'd you from puniſhing ſo foul a Crime:
You had enough to do to oppoſe the Archduke,
who retook <hi>Ypres</hi> and St. <hi>Venant,</hi> while Count
<hi>Harcourt</hi> was beſieging <hi>Cambray;</hi> but that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
did not ſucceed. Tho' he was oblig'd to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98314:28"/>
quit it, yet he attack'd <hi>Condé,</hi> and took it by
Compoſition. <hi>Maubeuge</hi> open'd her Gates to
him; ſo that the Enemy would not have had
much cauſe to brag, if they had not prevail'd in
<hi>Catalonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Province being ſo remote, that your
Majeſty could not ſend any Troops thither
without a great deal of charge; and no Recruits
going to ſupply the place of thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd
there the Year before, the Enemy took
<hi>Conſtantin, de Salo,</hi> and <hi>de Sirges;</hi> but Count
<hi>Marein</hi> brake their Meaſures as to <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
which they thought to have taken. In <hi>Italy</hi> alſo
your Affairs receiv'd a conſiderable check: The
Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who fear'd the War of <hi>Paris,</hi>
would put it out of your power to give him the
Succours he wanted, quitted your Party; whence
follow'd the loſs of many conſiderable Poſts,
which had coſt a great deal of trouble, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men.</p>
               <p>But it was of much greater importance to your
Majeſty, to ſettle a Calm in your Kingdom, than
to preſerve your Conqueſts which were ſo far
off: Therefore, after you had reduc'd <hi>Paris</hi> to
its Obedience, and ſufficiently provided for the
Frontier of <hi>Piccardy,</hi> which the Enemy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
all your aim was to make <hi>Provence</hi> and
<hi>Guyenne</hi> ſubmit; where there were as great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
as in the Capital City of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
This was happily effected by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
and having alſo the good Fortune to divert
a Storm that was gathering on the Frontier of
<hi>Germany,</hi> where Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> inſtigated by
his Brother, endeavour'd to debauch the Troops
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98314:29"/>
he Commanded, your Kingdom would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
its former Luſtre, if the Prince of
<hi>Condé</hi> had not ſet ſo high a Price on the Services
he had done <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that it was almoſt
impoſſible to ſatisfie him.</p>
               <p>His Ambition could not, without murmuring,
bear his being denied ſome Favours; tho' he had
obtain'd many from <hi>your Majeſty</hi> for his Relations
that had born Arms againſt you; who for that
Reaſon, rather deſerv'd to be puniſh'd than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
It was Prudence however in <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> to conceal your Diſpleaſure for his
Affronts; and there was danger in oppoſing the
Prince; becauſe the great Things he had done,
had got him much Credit in the Army. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
which he alſo kept with the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi>
who all, and every where, declared themſelves
againſt <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> made you Prudently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the Diſtaſte you had againſt him: but
your <hi>Miniſter</hi> having found an <hi>Italian</hi> trick, to
ſow diſſention among his Party, which would
not have been pardonable, were it not to ſecure
the Liberty of your State; you reſolv'd to cauſe
the Prince to be Arreſted, which was executed
with a great deal of Dexterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Your <hi>Miniſter</hi> in the mean time was ſo afraid
you would miſs your Blow, that he kept himſelf
Booted to be gone the very Moment it had fail'd:
But Succeſs having anſwer'd his Hope, he again
took Courage; ſo that there was no queſtion
of preventing the ill Conſequences of ſo bold a
ſtroke; your Majeſty provided againſt 'em, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two things which were abſolutely neceſſary:
The one was to let the People know the true
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98314:29"/>
Reaſons you had to arreſt him. The other was
to march in Perſon where it appear'd he had
moſt Friends, and conſequently where there
was moſt likelihood of any Commotion.</p>
               <p>What an excellent thing, SIR, is Prudence!
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> had already been accus'd of not
acknowledging the great Services a Subject had
done you: Your Miniſter likewiſe paſs'd for a
very ingrateful Perſon, in the Opinion of the
People. He knew, had it not been for the
Prince, he could hardly have ſecur'd himſelf
againſt the Hatred of the <hi>Pariſians</hi> and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
But when the People knew the Prince's
Services had been rewarded, with the Place of
Great Maſter of <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Houſhold, with
the Governments of <hi>Burgundy, Berry,</hi> and
<hi>Guyenne;</hi> with a Grant of the Demeſnes of <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
Stenay,</hi> and <hi>Jammets;</hi> of <hi>Pont de l'Arche,</hi>
and of <hi>Diep,</hi> which he had gotten for the Duke
of <hi>Longueville;</hi> of <hi>Danvilliers,</hi> and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Champagne,</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Conti;</hi> and
a great number of other Favours, as well for
himſelf, as for his Creatures. There was not a
Man but chang'd his Opinion, and loudly declar'd,
That if there were an ingrateful Man in the
World, it was the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Voyage you firſt made into <hi>Normandy,</hi>
and after into <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Guyenne,</hi> pacify'd
thoſe Princes, where the Prince's Creatures,
(ſupported by the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Longueville,</hi> whom you likewiſe cauſed to be
Arreſted) endeavour'd to animate the People
againſt your Majeſty. You did not think ſit to
go your ſelf into <hi>Berry,</hi> where the Danger did
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98314:30"/>
not appear ſo great; becauſe that Province was
ſhut up in the middle of your Kingdom, and
could receive no aſſiſtance from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who watch'd an Opportunity to take advantage
of ſo many Accidonts that ſeem'd favourable to
them. You ſent thither the Count St. <hi>Agnan,</hi>
who kept the Province in Obedience, but had
not Strength onough to drive the Marqueſs <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi>
out of <hi>Montrond,</hi> a ſtrong Place that belong'd
to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How well had <hi>your Majeſty</hi> been pleas'd, could
you ſo eaſily have ſetled things in other places,
which you had reaſon to fear could not be done,
in the midſt of ſo many Troubles that lay ſo
heavy on you, and under which another muſt
have ſunk. Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who retir'd to
the Arch-duke, after he had miſs'd his Blow, came
to <hi>Stenay,</hi> where his Love to the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Longueville,</hi> did not keep him from entring into
the Kingdom, at the head of an Army, which he
had rais'd with the Money lent him by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke,
and with his Miſtreſs's Jewels, which he
pawn'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Metz.</hi> He thought, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this time of Diſorder and Confuſion, he
ſhould be able to get again into <hi>Sedan,</hi> which the
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> his Brother had given to the
deceas'd King, to ſpare his Life in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for his having enter'd into the Treaty of
<hi>Madrid.</hi> He came near the Place, thinking the
Memory of his Anceſtors would have procur'd
him Friends; but every one kept to his Duty;
and ſeeing the Town was well provided, and a
brave Man, with a good Garriſon, commanded
in it, he was oblig'd to turn his Arms another
way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98314:30"/>
If a Man may make any Reflections upon his
Attempt, it ſeems to me not well deſign'd; or
at leaſt that the Inhabitants of the Town would
have done very ill, had they preferr'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Family before <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s;
for thoſe People are unhappy, who are Rul'd by
petty Princes; they having not Forces enough of
their own to ſecure their Fortune, are under a
continual Obligation of being aſſiſted by foreign
Troops; where their Subjects are often expos'd
to the Calamities of War, and are ſometimes a
Prey to one, and ſometimes to another. Which
are not to be fear'd, when People are under the
Government of a Great King, who when any
Storm ariſeth, can quickly allay it.</p>
               <p>It was not only your Frontier of <hi>Champagne</hi>
which was threaten'd, but likewiſe that of <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy:</hi>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> appear'd there with an
Army; and having made themſelves Maſters of
<hi>Catelet</hi> and <hi>la Chapelle,</hi> they attempted <hi>Guiſe;</hi>
but not thinking it fit to loſe Time about it,
they reſolv'd to join with the Arch-duke and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne,</hi> who were enter'd into <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</hi>
Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who knew what was
beſt to be done, advanc'd ſo far as <hi>Ferté Milon,</hi>
with an intention to deliver the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>
out of <hi>Vincennes:</hi> But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> having broke
his Meaſures, by cauſing the Prince to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to <hi>Marcouſſis,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Havre de
Grace,</hi> the Viſcount was oblig'd to return, and
join the Arch-duke, who had taken <hi>Rhetel,</hi> and
ſome other Places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Champagne,</hi> which groan'd under the Tyranny of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who put all to Fire and Sword, took
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98314:31"/>
Arms, and augmented the Army of Marqueſs <hi>du
Pleſſis,</hi> whom <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had ſent to guard that
Frontier. He thought with theſe Succours to have
been able to retake <hi>Rhetel;</hi> and having inveſted it,
the Arch-duke endeavour'd to raiſe the Siege.
This prov'd of great Advantage to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> to
whom the Defeat of your Army would have been
of very dangerous Conſequence. Nevertheleſs, ſince
it was impoſſible for you any longer to ſee your
Enemies in the heart of your Kingdom, you ſent
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> to the Mareſchal; that upon
his own knowledge of your Strength, he might
give order either to fight or retreat. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
who was naturally very fearful where there
was danger, was at firſt of Opinion not to run any
hazard; but the Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
the Cardinal of what ill Conſequence it
would be, to give the Enemy any ſigns of their
Weakneſs, it was reſolv'd in a Council of
War, wherein this Miniſter was preſent, to
fight.</p>
               <p>The Mareſchal <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> having rais'd the
Siege, march'd directly toward the Enemy,
who was now become more numerous by the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Troops. The Fight was ſharp
and obſtinate on both ſides; but God gave your
Majeſty ſo compleat a Victory, that Viſcount
<hi>Turenne</hi> was forc'd to fly only with ſixteen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
being abandon'd by all his Troops; for
the Arch-duke went off one of the firſt, and left
him to ſhift for himſelf. He was very near be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken in ſo long a retreat as he had to make,
and wherein he was ſo hotly purſu'd; but having
defended his Life and Liberty, at their coſt who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98314:31"/>
attack'd him, he ſav'd himſelf in <hi>Barleduke,</hi> into
which when he enter'd, People thought him
very much wounded, being cover'd all over
with Blood; but it prov'd only the Blood which
he had drawn of your faithful Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> heard of this Victory with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Joy; and ſent to Marqueſs <hi>d' Aumont,
d' Hoquincourt,</hi> and <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> each a Mareſchal's
Staff, who had very particularly ſignaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in that Battel. It was to excite others to
follow their Example; for there is nothing
more animates your Nobility, than the Honours
you beſtow on them; and the <hi>French</hi> are of that
Temper, that they will ſacrifice a thouſand Lives
(if they had ſo many) in the Service of their
King, if he give 'em but a good Word, or the
leaſt Preferment.</p>
               <p>'Tis for this alſo, that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is belov'd
by your Subjects; you that have the Secret, even
in refuſing to grant Requeſts, to oblige thoſe
whom you deny, by your manner of denying
them: For a Prince ought to have the Gift of
not only making himſelf to be fear'd, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of making himſelf belov'd. For Fear without
Love degenerates into Diſtruſt; which makes
People ſuſpect, that he who ought to be both
Father and Maſter, will turn Tyrant. And this
Suſpicion is ſo dangerous, that there is nothing
which a King ſhould not do, to keep it out of his
Subjects Minds.</p>
               <p>If the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Party, which he had
in <hi>France,</hi> did your Majeſty ſo much harm upon
the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> it did
you a great deal more in <hi>Italy;</hi> where it was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98314:32"/>
impoſſible for you to ſuccour <hi>Piombino</hi> and <hi>Porto
Longonne,</hi> which fell again into the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
hands. <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> to whom the Preſervation
of <hi>Catalonia</hi> was of great importance, ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> who ſeiz'd Count
<hi>Marcin,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Creature, and
who did all he could to debauch the Troops you
had in that Country. This foreſight ſav'd <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi>
where the Enemy kept intelligence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a great mind to recover that Place. But
the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> being no great Captain,
and the ſtate of your Affairs not permitting you
to ſend him any conſiderable Succours, all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
in that Country, and your Reputation
began to decline in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>However, the Choice of this General was not
to be imputed to your Majeſty; it was a Court-Intrigue
that oblig'd you to prefer him, before
many other Commanders of much greater Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
But there being a Reconciliation made
between your Miniſter, and the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
whoſe eldeſt Son <hi>Mercoeur</hi> was; he was to
have a ſhare of thoſe Favours, which, when the
Accommodation was made, were agreed on.
Beſide, the Cardinal deſign'd to marry one of
his Nieces to him, and therefore thought it
much better to prefer him than another: <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> was then too young to perceive what
prejudice you receiv'd by it, and how dangerous
it is for a Miniſter to prefer his own Intereſt
before his Maſters. But, God be thanked, it
was not long ere our Eyes were open'd in ſo
nice a point; and no Prince ever knew better
than you, to give to all Perſons thoſe Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are ſit for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98314:32"/>
This was not the only Fault which Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi> did. The deſire he had to be the ſole
powerful Man in the Kingdom, made him ſeek
how to amuſe thoſe he made uſe of, to deſtroy
the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi>
Favourite of Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> your
Uncle, without whoſe privity the Prince was
arreſted, from that time never forgave the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
ſo that joining himſelf with others who
envy'd the Fortune of that Miniſter, they all
ſtrove to ruine him.</p>
               <p>The Parliament, who ſought by all means to
augment their Authority, and being perſwaded,
that during your Minority was the propereſt
time to effect it, divers Counſels were held,
wherein they reſolv'd to demand the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and his Brothers,
with the Baniſhment of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin. Your
Majeſty</hi> oppos'd it, with a Reſolution becoming
your great Courage; but Monſieur the Duke of
<hi>Orleans</hi> heading thoſe who deſign'd the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this Miniſter, and all the States of the
Kingdom joining with 'em, you were oblig'd to
grant what they deſir'd, in point of Policy, tho'
it was very much againſt your Will.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> ſeeing himſelf forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Realm, thought to make the Prince of
<hi>Condé</hi>'s inlargment a piece of Merit to himſelf;
he went to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> and deliver'd to him
a Letter under the Privy Signet, antidated before
another which was ſent to ſet him at Liberty:
The Prince who had been informed by <hi>Perraut.</hi>
Overſeer of his Houſehold, (who had leave to
ſee him, under pretence of his Mothers Will)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98314:33"/>
what endeavours had been us'd to get him out of
Priſon, own'd the Cardinal's Civility, which he
ſhew'd in coming himſelf to bring him ſuch good
News; yet it was impoſſible not to ſuſpect all
the Proteſtations he made him of his Friendſhip,
and thoſe humble Submiſſions he uſed in deſiring
the Prince's.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> did not break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any Paſſion againſt him, were it that he
thought him not worth his Anger, or that the
Joy he had for being at Liberty, calmed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments.
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> retir'd to the
Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> and the Prince came back to
<hi>Paris,</hi> where he was received in Triumph,
tho' they had made Bonfires throughout the
whole Town when he was Arreſted. But ſuch
hath always been the Peoples Inconſtancy, that
no body knows how ſo to fix 'em, as to ſecure
their eſteem; but as ſoon as a Man ſteps out of
the way, be it to the Right or Left, they
preſently return to their old Inclination. The
Prince was ador'd by the People, when he fought
with ſo much Reputation againſt the Enemies of
your Kingdom; but loſt their Favour when he
took Arms againſt them: tho' he only obey'd
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Orders in puniſhing their Treaſon,
which was ſo great, that they deſerved to be
treated by him, as the moſt cruel of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>The Parliament paſt divers Sentences againſt
your Miniſter, without at all conſulting <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:</hi>
They caus'd his Library to be ſold by Out-cry,
they ſet a Price upon his Head, and did
many other things of like Nature: which <hi>your
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98314:33"/>
Majeſty</hi> very prudently Diſſembled, becauſe it
had beeen a groſs Fault to have oppos'd a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
which was become ſo violent. <hi>Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
forgave Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his Fault, came to ask Pardon for it:
In the mean time, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> grew
very Powerful; but your Miniſter was Faulty in
not performing his Promiſe, to thoſe who had
taken part with him, in Arreſting the Prince.
Which was not warning ſufficient to the Prince,
to keep him from doing the like. For he began
to deſpiſe, and diſoblige his Friends. Viſcount
<hi>Turenne</hi> was one of the firſt of thoſe who were
ſo treated by him; for having deſir'd the Prince
to give good Winter-Quarters to ſome Troops
which he look'd upon as his own, tho' <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
pay'd 'em, the Prince took no notice of his
Requeſt: The Viſcovnt alſo knew, the Prince
us'd to rally him for his Love to his Siſter, and
made it a common talk among thoſe who were
moſt in his Favour; which touch'd the Viſcount
ſo much to the Quick, that he came to the Queen,
your Mother, and promis'd her, that nothing
in the World ſhould make him fall into the ſame
fault he had committed; and that for the future,
he would do all he could, to blot out the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of it; aſſuring her Majeſty, ſhe might rely
upon his Fidelity.</p>
               <p>He ſaid as much to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and oblig'd
his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> to make you
the ſame Proteſtations: This Example teacheth
us how dangerous Railery is, and how much it
provokes Men of great Courage. But this is a
needleſs Reflexion to be made to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98314:34"/>
who never ſpeaks ill of any body, and when
you ſpeak of your greateſt Enemies, 'tis only of
thoſe Qualities you know commendable in them;
neither will <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſuffer any to ſpeak
evil of others in your preſence, wherein <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> is much in the Right, ſeeing there is
little difference, between evil ſpeaking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
it.</p>
               <p>The Prince did very ill in another thing; He
had aſſured the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the Dutcheſs
of <hi>Cheveruſe,</hi> and the Coad jutor, that for the
future his Intereſt and theirs ſhould be the ſame,
and that the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> ſhould Marry the
Dutcheſs's Daughter. This Promiſe being made
when he was in Priſon, was not thought Valid
by the Dutcheſs, becauſe it looked as if it had
been forced; ſhe therefore came to the Prince,
and releas'd him of it: But he told her, tho' he
was not oblig'd, yet becauſe ſhe treated him in
ſo civil a manner, the thing ſhould be done. Tho'
he was now doubly oblig'd, yet ſuch was his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that he would not be beholding to
any body. He quickly forgot his Obligation,
nor was he ſo Civil, as to do any thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
himſelf of it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who did not
like your Miniſter's being forc'd from you, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all ways to have him return handſomly,
without cauſing any new Troubles in your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
But the averſion which every one had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and the Arreſts that had paſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all Foreigners from the Miniſtry, would have
made it very difficult, had it not been for the
Prince's ill Conduct, which daily increas'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98314:34"/>
preſs'd by the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> paſſionately
in Love with Mademoiſelle <hi>Chevereuſe,</hi> to conſent
to his Marriage, he told him he would not, and that
he would not have him take the Coadjutor's,
the Marqueſs of <hi>Laicques,</hi> and <hi>Caumartin</hi>'s leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Theſe Three often viſited her, and there
needed no more to make the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that what the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had ſaid was
true: He preſently quitted her, in ſpite of his
Love, and ſeriouſly told all the World, how
much he was oblig'd to his Brother, who had
drawn him from a Precepice, from whence he
was falling headlong. This Diſcourſe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Madam <hi>Chevereuſe,</hi> and to thoſe who
were concern'd in it, and wrought more for
the return of your Miniſter, than all that
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> could have done. So true is it, that
Chance produceth many unforeſeen Accidents,
which prevail over all humane Reaſon and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
The Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevereuſe,</hi> whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
was very ſtrong, offer'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to
employ her Friends to facilitate your Miniſter's
return. And now <hi>your Majeſty</hi> being in your
Fourteenth Year, you were declared of full Age,
you went to the Parliament to have the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
regiſter'd, and at the ſame time carried
thither two Edicts, which ſerv'd for marks to
Poſterity of your Piety towards God, and of
your Love to your People. The firſt, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that blaſphem'd God's holy Name.
The other was againſt Duels, which you ſwore
on the holy Bible to ſee exactly executed, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98314:35"/>
you might never be importun'd concerning it; and
reſolv'd never to retract what you had ſworn.</p>
               <p>In this you did not like many others, who in
a few days forget their Promiſes: For, ten or
twelve Years after, ſome conſiderable Perſons of
your Nobility, having fought, contrary to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;
you had made them an Example, had they
not gone out of the Kingdom; but that which
is more remarkable is, that the Pope interceded
with you for them, and offer'd to abſolve you
from your Oath; but the tenderneſs of your
Conſcience would not ſuffer you to grant what
he deſir'd. You thought that when once People
believ'd your Pardon might be obtain'd by
Mediation, thoſe diſorders would never ceaſe,
to which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was fully reſolv'd to put
an end. Beſide, you would not let it be ſaid,
that Recommendation had a greater Power over
you, than Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> could not endure your People
ſhou'd give Law to you, concerning your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s return. You retir'd
a ſecond time from <hi>Paris.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
your Uncle would not follow you, neither would
the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who a few Days after, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
with a Panick Fear he ſhould be Arreſted,
left the City; and being gone to his Houſe at
St. <hi>Maur,</hi> you did all you could to cure him of
this Suſpicion; but becauſe when a Man knows
himſelf guilty, he never thinks himſelf ſecure
from Puniſhment; he went into the Country and
retir'd to <hi>Montrond.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> the
Prince <hi>Marſillac,</hi> and ſome others, at the ſame
time took up their Quarters in <hi>Guyenne:</hi> The
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98314:35"/>
Duke of <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> having ſtir'd up ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in <hi>Poitou,</hi> you had thoſe two Provinces to
reduce, as well as the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
declar'd againſt <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pretence of all theſe Revolts was, that
you would have Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> return, againſt
your Word given to the contrary. But ſeeing
moſt of the Heads of this Party had promis'd
you to conſent to his Return, for Favours done
them; you could not believe that was the true
Reaſon: You plainly ſaw, that Ambition had a
greater ſhare in their Diſobedience, than the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
they had for the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>It was eaſie for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at this time, to
do their Buſineſs: They re-took moſt of the
Places you had conquer'd ſince you aſcended the
Throne: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought the ſafety of
your Kingdom to be of greater Conſequence to
you, than any thing elſe: You ran to the Place
where there was moſt Danger, you went into
<hi>Poitou,</hi> after you had in Perſon reduc'd <hi>Berri,</hi>
where the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had rais'd ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
You declar'd him a Rebel, and a Diſturber
of the publick Peace, with all his Adherents.
But this made none of 'em return to their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and your Authority was ſo little regarded,
that in two Months time, the Parliament wou'd
not regiſter your Declaration; tho' their Intereſt
were different from the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s, and
with whom they did not act in concert.</p>
               <p>The ſtrongeſt Cabal which took part with <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> was that of the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> and the
Coadjutor: But you were neceſſitated to buy
both; which was by giving one the place of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98314:36"/>
Admiral of <hi>France;</hi> and by promiſing the other
you would nominate him for a Cardinal's Cap,
at the next promotion that ſhould happen. You
thought theſe Favours nothing in compariſon of
the Services theſe Men cou'd do you in ſo nice a
Conjuncture; eſpecially in relation to <hi>Paris,</hi>
which had not yet declared for the Prince of
<hi>Condé,</hi> and where they had many Friends.</p>
               <p>Your Preſence in <hi>Poitou</hi> quickly ſuppreſs'd the
Rebellion there; the capital City of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
open'd its Gates to you, and the Cardinal
being come thither to you with ſome Troops
which he had rais'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> you forced the
Rebels to quit the Siege of <hi>Coynac;</hi> you drove
them alſo out of ſome Poſts they had poſſeſt;
but could not reduce 'em in <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> for the
Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who was come thither, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
new Courage into thoſe, who before ſeem'd
diſpos'd to ſubmit to <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Paris</hi> (which went nearer,
your Heart than any thing elſe) ſeeing Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi> return, publickly declar'd for the Prince
of <hi>Condé.</hi> Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
acted againſt <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> tho' he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times ſaid, he was not to be ſuſpected for his
not being at Court. But how cou'd he clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from Suſpicion, who had hearken'd to evil
Counſel all his Life, and alway had near him the
Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> who was enrag'd to miſs the
Cardinal's Cap, which had been ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him. Beſide, Mademoiſolle <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi>
who had a great deſire to be Marry'd, feeding
her ſelf with the hope the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> gave
her, ſhe ſhould have his Son; ſpoke for him to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98314:36"/>
her Father, without making any Reflection, that
ſhe was old enough to be the Mother of him ſhe
had a mind to make her Husband.</p>
               <p>Among ſo many declared Enemies there were
ſome ſecret ones, whom <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt;
but on the contrary, had reaſon to think
them your moſt Faithful Subjects. The Duke of
<hi>Beaufort</hi> for a time was one of this Number,
notwithſtanding all you had done for him and his
Family. But weary of wearing the Foxes Skin,
he put on the Lions, and took the Field againſt
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> The Coadjutor did not declare
himſelf ſo openly, but vex'd to ſee that by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Return, he was never like to
come into his place; did, underhand, all he
could to ruin him, tho' he was ſure it would very
much diſpleaſe <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> The Jealouſie
which aroſe between the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who were both joyntly to
command an Army; gave <hi>your Majeſty</hi> an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to draw near to them, that you might
take ſome Advantage of their diviſion: But the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> prevented you, by paſſing <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito</hi>
through all the Provinces beyond the <hi>Loire;</hi>
and by putting himſelf at the Head of the Army,
where his Preſence was neceſſary to ſettle a right
underſtanding between the two Princes; of whoſe
diſagreement, the only cauſe was their Ambition
to command ſingly and excluſively to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> did all you could to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Prince in ſo long a March, and where
there were ſo many Rivers to paſs; you ſet
guards upon all the Fords, and ſent out many
Parties into the field, which was all you could
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98314:37"/>
do. But ſince all the care in the World is to no
purpoſe, where Men will be falſe and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
<hi>Buſſy Rabutin</hi> let him paſs, ſo that he came
ſafe to his Army, which was then near <hi>Chatillon</hi>
upon <hi>Loin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> who knew not at firſt in what
manner he had eſcap'd, thought to repair this
Blow by a Battel, wherein you hop'd to have the
better. The two Armies join'd near <hi>Bleneau,</hi>
where the Avantguard of yours, commanded by
Mareſchal <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> was ſo ill treated, that
if Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> had not come to his Relief,
your Majeſty, who was at <hi>Gergeau,</hi> had been in
danger of being taken: But his Experience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
placed you Beyond a narrow Paſs, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it with ſo much Courage till Night came
on, that the Prince, who promis'd himſelf an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Victory, could he have paſs'd the Defile;
was oblig'd to be contented with that advantage
he had gotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> was happy, that the Prince had
then ſo great a deſire to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he
thought this new beam of Glory, would procure
him a Reception with ſome kind of Triumph.
'Tis certain that Ambiton was not the ſole cauſe
of this Voyage; and that Love had a great part
in it: For he had given up his Heart to the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Chatillon,</hi> and the deſire he had to
ſee her, made him loſe the Advantage he might
have drawn from this Victory. This was a Fault
which many great Princes commit, and 'tis a
Miracle if they conquer their Paſſion. The Prince
of <hi>Condé</hi> is not the only Perſon that hath been
faulty in this kind, and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> knows, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98314:37"/>
there is a Prince beſide him, whoſe Reputation
is much greater than his, that is fallen into the
ſame Fault. A Man may be in Love, and yet
do his Duty; for tho' it be dificult, yet 'tis but
to remember, that every one hath his Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what he doth, and nothing can ſtop their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
A Prince, who hath care of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
will never ſuffer ſuch hold to be taken of
him; he will rather conquer himſelf for a time,
than give the leaſt Stain to his Reputation: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
an Opportunity once loſt, is not eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd;
whence we are to conclude, that when a
thing can be done, it never ought to be put off
till to Morrow.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Abſence, gave <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> an Opportunity to recruit your Army
with eaſe; ſo that in ſome time after, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in a Condition to be fear'd. The Duke of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> who had wholly declar'd himſelf againſt
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> fearing to be run down, ſent to
his Brother-in-Law the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for his
Aſſiſtance; and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who every Year
hir'd his Troops, conſented to it. He enter'd
<hi>France,</hi> and march'd toward <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> which Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> had beſieg'd. The Place of it ſelf
was not conſiderable, but being defended by a
good Garriſon, it held out longer than People
thought it wou'd; ſo that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
might have come time enough to have reliev'd
it, which much troubled <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ordinary Practice, being more
us'd to Plunder than to Fight, he made ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Marches, that the Place was taken before he
came to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98314:38"/>
Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> in perfect ſpite march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and forc'd him to repaſs the <hi>Seine;</hi>
he encamp'd at <hi>Villaneue</hi> St. <hi>Georges,</hi> where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great diſadvantage, he could not be forc'd
to fight, he pillag'd all <hi>Brie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as well as the plain
Country about <hi>Paris,</hi> for which he had the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> who flatter'd themſelves, he
was come to relieve, and not to Plunder 'em:
But all their Complaints were to no purpoſe;
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who was as much concern'd as they,
ſeeing they cou'd not be ruin'd without your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible of it; endeavour'd to gain the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that he might ceaſe pillaging the
Country: there was ſome appearance of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> having wherewith to
tempt him; for you were poſſeſt of his Country
which you offer'd to reſtore upon reaſonable
Conditions: But he lov'd ready Money, better
than Offers ſo advantagious to him; <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
having granted him a Paſs, he went out of the
Kingdom to their great aſtoniſhment who called
him in: <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> was likewiſe much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd,
not believing a Prince of his Birth, cou'd
act in ſuch a manner, upon ſo baſe an Account:
But Kindneſs to his Children, which he had by
the Princeſs <hi>de Cantecroix,</hi> made him think of
nothing but getting Money, ſeeing he cou'd not
ſettle the Country of <hi>Lorrain</hi> upon 'em, for two
Reaſons; the one was, becauſe it was his Wife's
Inheritance; the other was, he had thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
not by his Wife, and therefore being inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſucceeding him, he reſolv'd to give
them Portions in Money for their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98314:38"/>
The King of <hi>England,</hi> the unfortunate Son of
a more unhappy Father, who was come to ſeek
Refuge and Relief from <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> ſerv'd you
perfectly well in this Treaty, which troubled
you very much, till it was ended: For if the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> wou'd, he might have put Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> hard to it, whom you thought for
ſome time in great danger, becauſe he was come
too near his Camp; but he happily got out of
the Briars by his admirable Conduct, which gain'd
him a great deal of Reputation, as well with the
Enemy as among his own Souldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> having made a good end of ſo
difficult an Affair, gave no leiſure to the Rebels,
and by your Preſence ſo encourag'd your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſaw himſelf, and
his Troops ready to fall into your Hands: For
you purſued him ſo hotly, that he was forced to
poſſeſs himſelf of the Bridge of St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> by
which he thought to avoid a Battel, but <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> having laid a Bridge over the <hi>Seine,</hi> he
ſaw himſelf ready to be attaqu'd in Front and
Rear, he then got under the Walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
march'd round it to get to <hi>Charenton;</hi> Viſcount
<hi>Turenne</hi> who obſerv'd it, follow'd him ſo cloſe,
that he begun to charge his Reer near <hi>Port du
Temple</hi> and <hi>Port St. Martin;</hi> which oblig'd him
to haſten his March, and being come to the
height of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Antoin,</hi> he made uſe
of ſome Retrenchments which Chance afforded
him, they having been made to ſecure the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
againſt the Thievery of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>'s
Troops.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98314:39"/>
There he lodg'd his Foot, in better Order than
the ſhortneſs of the time ſeem'd to permit, and
drew in his Cavalry; he ſent the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
into the City, to perſwade the Citizens to let
in and ſecure his Baggage, and declare for the
Prince: But the Fear the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> had to be pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd,
made them ſhut and place Guards at their
Gates. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> when he ſaw this,
rang'd all his Baggage along the Ditch, and
caus'd Holes to be made through the Houſes,
where he ſaw your Forces advance. <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
was poſted at <hi>Menill</hi> to ſee this Attack,
which would have rejoyc'd your great Heart, had
it been to fight with your Enemies, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Subjects: The Onſet was furious,
and your Troops having forc'd the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> brought up his Canon
to a Place call'd the Throne; becauſe one had
been there erected, to receive <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
when after your Marriage you made your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the City. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> did
all he cou'd to ſuſtain your Peoples Efforts,
who encourag'd by your Preſence did Wonders,
and God, who would not ſuffer the Rebellion
to continue, gave <hi>your Majeſty</hi> an entire Victory;
ſo that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had been utterly loſt,
if <hi>Paris</hi> had not open'd its Gates to him, where
he ſav'd his remaining Troops. Mademoiſelle
<hi>Montpenſier</hi> did the Prince this Service, and
caus'd the Canon to be diſcharg'd upon <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
and <hi>your Miniſter,</hi> who was very near
you.</p>
               <p>This Victory aſtoniſh'd the <hi>Pariſiens,</hi> and
thoſe who were of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Party;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98314:39"/>
                  <hi>your Majeſty</hi> having ſome faithful Subjects in this
great City, who made People ſenſible how much
they had fail'd in their Duty to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> ſo
that they were a long time in ſuſpence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they agree'd to give the Prince that Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he ſo much wanted. This occaſion'd an
Aſſembly, which met two Days after at the
Town-Houſe, where were a great many Perſons,
who, in ſome manner, repreſented the States
general, of whom a Convocation had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and which you had
promis'd, to free your ſelf of their Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
But as you had there your Creatures, as
well as the Prince had his, while they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
what Reſolutions to take, the Mutineers
broke open the Doors, and kill'd ſome of the
Deputies, an only Son of a Councellor of the
great Chamber, a conſiderable quality in that
time, was with ſome others ſlain. This Murder
having caus'd great Confuſion, thoſe of <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s
Party, put Paper in their Hats to be known
by one another; the other Party wore Straw in
theirs, which Mark, ſome of the greateſt Lords
in your Court, were forc'd to wear, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>Paris:</hi> They that put Straw in their
Hats, quickly became the ſtronger Party, and
falling upon thoſe that wore Paper, the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de L' Hopitall</hi> Governour of the City, had
much ado to ſave himſelf. Many were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> who ſtir'd up
this Tumult, and wou'd have charg'd it on Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> to render him the more Odious,
but whether the truth were diſcover'd, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
begun to be weary of diſobeying their Maſter,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98314:40"/>
every one thought of making Peace with <hi>your
Majeſty;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> made Propoſitions
to you, and ſo did the Parliament; but you
found them ſo high, and ſo void of that reſpect
which was due to you; that inſtead of hearing
them, you were ſo angry with the Parliament,
that you remov'd it to <hi>Ponthoiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Action accompany'd with many other of
the like Nature, quite aſtoniſh'd the Mutineers;
the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> nevertheleſs endeavour'd to
warm his Party again, who were ready to leave
him: But the Parliament being upon the
point of turning their backs upon him, as well
as your Uncle the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> he threw
himſelf into the Arms of the <hi>Spaniards. Your
Majeſty</hi> made a prudent uſe of this Conjuncture,
and to unite all Parties, you feign'd to ſend Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi> away a ſecond time, whom many
made the pretence of their Rebellion; ſo that
no longer having a Cloak to cover it, they all
reſolv'd to return to their Duty, provided <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> would grant them a general Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion;
you did not think sit to
refuſe it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Appanage</hi> ſignifies the Portion given to the King of <hi>Franc</hi>'s younger Children.</note> and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
being retir'd to <hi>Blois,</hi> a Town aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
him for part of his <hi>Appanage,
your Majeſty</hi> had now no more
to do, but to return to the Capital City of your
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>You were humbly importun'd to do it by
your Parliament, and in the Name of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
by the Coadjutor; who according to the
promiſe given him, had been made a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
and who came expreſly to wait upon you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98314:40"/>
at <hi>Compiegne; your Majeſty</hi> call'd a Council
there to be advis'd, whether you ſhould not
cauſe him to be Arreſted, to puniſh him for his
breach of Faith, in not performing the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
he had made you: But it was thought sit,
firſt to make a firm ſettlement of your Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and when that was done, you would be
much better able to do what you thought good.
'Tis indeed Prudence to let things ripen, and
to do a thing out of ſeaſon, is to ſpoil all.</p>
               <p>Some blame the Prince, who might have had
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Pardon, had he ſought it in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
manner: becauſe he took a fancy to follow
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s example, who pillag'd and
plunder'd Friends and Enemies without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction;
but it is not to be believ'd, that a
Prince of his Birth and great Mind, cou'd have
any Thoughts unworthy of the one or the other;
yet he ranſack'd the Frontier of <hi>Campagne</hi> as he
went off, and after he had taken <hi>Rhetel</hi> and St.
<hi>Menehout,</hi> he retir'd to <hi>Namur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had there ſome Conference with a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Arch-Duke's, who before he wou'd
let the Prince come to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would give him the Hand. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
made the Prince ſenſible, to what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures
he had expos'd himſelf by his Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but his great Courage not ſuffering him
to heſitate what anſwer to make; he ſent the
Arch-Duke word, that the Honour he had to be
the firſt Prince of the Blood of <hi>France,</hi> had too well
taught him, what was his Right for him, ever to
part with it: He therefore pretended to take
place of the Arch-Duke were he not in the Low-Countries,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98314:41"/>
where he repreſented his Catholick
Majeſty, in that Quality he would give him the
upper Hand when he went to viſit him; but
when the Arch-Duke in his turn came to ſee him,
he expected the ſame. The Arch-Duke was not
pleas'd with ſo haughty an Anſwer, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that after what the Prince had done, there
was no more returning for him into <hi>France;</hi> he
inſiſted upon the Prince's giving him place every
where, to which the Prince wou'd never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
The thing at laſt went ſo far, that he
caus'd the Arch-Duke to be told, that unleſs he
accepted the Offer he made him, he would in
eight Days be gone; and that he was not yet ſo
to ſeek, but he knew very well where to go.
the Arch-Duke was then forc'd to let him have
his Will; but ſeeing it was much againſt the
Arch-Duke's, it ſhew'd the Prince what Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
attend a Man's forſaking his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and going into a Foreign Court, eſpecially,
when a Man is look'd upon as a Rebel, and is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to buy his Protection, whatever the Price
be, he muſt pay for it.</p>
               <p>He had the ſame diſpute with the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> who liv'd for the moſt part at <hi>Bruxells;</hi>
and many times, 'twas thought, they wou'd come
to Blows; but 'twas hinder'd by their Friends,
without undertaking to decide the Difference
about eithers Pretentions; for the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
wou'd not endure any Competition, and the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> cou'd not hear of giving place,
without falling into great Paſſion; but that which
gave him the greateſt Diſtaſte in that Court,
was, that Prince <hi>Francis,</hi> the Duke's Brother,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98314:41"/>
did likewiſe diſpute Precedency with him; which
caus'd ſuch Heats, as were not like to end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fighting: That which moſt anger'd the Prince
of <hi>Condé</hi> was, that the Arch-Duke wou'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
the buſineſs, tho' the Prince pray'd him
to do it, confiding in the Juſtice of his Cauſe.
The Arch-Duke had a mind to mortify the
Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and would not diſoblige Prince
<hi>Francis,</hi> whom he reſolv'd to keep ſtill with
him; eſpecially at that time when he fear'd he
wou'd be gone into <hi>France,</hi> where many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were us'd to gain him.</p>
               <p>See what unexpected Diſpleaſures Men meet
with, when they put themſelves into the Service
of a Foreign Prince; but 'tis otherwiſe, when
a Man ſtays in his own Country, where the Place
due to his Quality, is not only regulated; but it
is alſo the Sovereign's Intereſt, to do nothing to
the prejudice of a Prince of his Blood. 'Tis but juſt
a Man ſhould do Pennance for his Faults, becauſe it
brings him again to himſelf, and there is nothing
which makes us wiſer, than thoſe Mortifications
which we did not expect; they that have the
Wind ſtill with them, run the hazard of never
knowing themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Prince having quitted his party, <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
thought rather of pacifying your Kingdom,
than of driving the Enemy from the Frontiers,
which you flatter'd your ſelf might be eaſily
done, when it was at Peace within it ſelf: The
Province of <hi>Guyenne</hi> was ſtill in Arms for the
Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was in <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
where, as a Prince of the Blood, he was
ſo conſiderable, as to draw many to take part
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98314:42"/>
with him in his Diſobedience; the Count <hi>d'Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
was in <hi>Brouage,</hi> where ill Example made him
play the Tyrant. Great Forces were requir'd
to reduce thoſe People, becauſe of their Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Aſſiſtance: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> conſidering
it wou'd be eaſier to gain them by fair means,
you made the one Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> upon
Condition, he deliver'd up the Place he kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Hands; and granted the other
very conſiderable Terms, if he wou'd quit his
Brother's Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> who had found a way to make
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> return, and to ſettle Peace
in <hi>Paris,</hi> where you had again fixt the Parliament
in its uſual Seat. And having now no more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
Troubles to fear, you did not only
raiſe Forces to ſecure your Frontiers; but
to raiſe your Reputation very much leſſen'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
You had loſt all you had in <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
your Affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> were alſo in an ill Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thoſe in <hi>Flanders</hi> not in a much better
Caſe, and of ſo many Conqueſts, which I have
already mention'd, no more remain'd to <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> but <hi>Arras</hi> in <hi>Campagn;</hi> the Enemy kept
St. <hi>Menehout, Mouzon</hi> and <hi>Rhetel;</hi> upon the
Frontier of <hi>Picardie, Le Catelet</hi> and <hi>Capelle;</hi> in
<hi>Bourgundy, Bellegard,</hi> wherein were the remains
of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Faction. Here was work
enough for a young Prince, who had not yet
the experience of Riper Years; but <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
having prudently begun with that which ſeem'd
to be of greateſt Conſequence; you beſieg'd <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legard</hi>
and became Maſter of it, having thereby
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98314:42"/>
cut off the Head of the Rebellion. You hardly
knew what to do next, ſo much were you preſs'd
on all ſides: The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was enter'd into
<hi>Picardy</hi> where he had taken <hi>Roye;</hi> the Arch-Duke
threaten'd <hi>Campagn,</hi> theſe two Places
were of like Importance to you; but you cou'd
not remedy all at once, the Forces of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were exhauſted; ſo that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was
oblig'd to do things by degrees, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
You march'd to the Relief of <hi>Picardy,</hi>
made the Enemy quit <hi>Roy;</hi> and afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
<hi>Rhetel,</hi> which being taken, you made your
ſelf Maſter of <hi>Mouzon:</hi> In the mean time the
Enemy poſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>Rocroy;</hi> for which
you were reveng'd, by reducing St. <hi>Menehout</hi> to
your Obedience.</p>
               <p>Your Arms in <hi>Catalonia</hi> began to be dreaded;
you took there ſeveral ſtrong Places, and you
had taken the Town of <hi>Gironne,</hi> had it not been
for a Miracle wrought by Heav'n, in favour of
your Enemies: They plac'd on the Rampart a
little Cabinet, wherein were the Reliques of a
holy Biſhop of that City; and preſently there
appear'd ſuch an infinite number of <hi>Flies,</hi> which
fell upon your Army, that all your Cavalry was
aſtoniſh'd at it. The Horſes, not being able to
abide it, broke their Bridles, and run croſs the
Fields, they roll'd themſelves in the Mire to get
rid of the Flies, and many periſh'd; ſo that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Enemy was ready to make uſe of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
they had by ſo favourable an Accident,
it was thought fit to raiſe the Siege.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> you carry'd the War into <hi>Milanez,</hi>
where the Count <hi>de Grancé,</hi> whom you had made
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98314:43"/>
a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> took <hi>Carpignan,</hi> and beat
the Marqueſs <hi>Caracene,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
ſent againſt him.</p>
               <p>You were now oblig'd to acknowledge the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>England,</hi> tho' at the ſame time,
your Kindneſs and Juſtice, led you to protect
him who was the lawful Prince thereof: But the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſought to make an Advantage of
your Averſion to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Uſurpation and were
treating with him to your Prejudice; you had
recourſe to the only means left you, to ſecure
your ſelf againſt the Miſchief they intended you.
You offer'd him your Mediation to accomodate the
differences amicably, which were then between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> of which you were very
willing to ſee an End, becauſe they might have
proved very much to your Enemies Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>This was a great deal for a State which had
been ſo Sick, to be free from Convulſions which
had like to have brought it to its Grave: But as
in long Sickneſſes there are often Relapſes, Count
<hi>Harcourt,</hi> whom <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had made uſe of
to reduce the Rebels to their Duty, became one
himſelf. He found a way to get into <hi>Briſac,</hi>
where the Garriſon being at his Devotion, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to erect a Kind of Soveraignty in <hi>Alſatia,</hi>
if he had been ſtrong enough to ſupport the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did all they cou'd to oblige
him to put the Place into their Hands; but not
offering enough to tempt him, he refus'd them,
and thought of agreeing with the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
who had enough to pay him well; for
there was not a Prince, who had ſo much ready
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98314:43"/>
Money as he; but being an Idolater of it, he
could not reſolve to part with ſo much as Count
<hi>Harcourt</hi> demanded; ſo that the Buſineſs hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long in Suſpence, it came at laſt to nothing,
becauſe the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who diſtruſted him, caus'd
him ſoon after to be arreſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> to whom this Buſineſs appear'd
to be of great importance, as indeed it was;
ſent often to and again to make him return to
his Duty: But ſeeing he cou'd not come to any
Reſolution, you beſieg'd <hi>Beffort</hi> to cut off all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
which he might hope to have from that ſide;
you made your ſelf Maſter of it in the midſt of
Winter; for it is fit the <hi>French</hi> ſhould learn to
make War in any Seaſon, they who under <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> ought to deſpiſe Heat and Cold, and to
habituate themſelves to either: This Conqueſt
joyn'd to the very good Terms you offer'd Count
<hi>Harcourt,</hi> prevail'd with him to accept 'em:
You gave him the Government of <hi>Anjou,</hi> you
let him enjoy all his Eſtate, and his Place of
Grand <hi>Ecuyerr;</hi> he being to deliver up all he
held in <hi>Alſatia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Buſineſs being thus over, and ſo well for
<hi>your Majeſty;</hi> you next thought of re-taking <hi>Rocroy,</hi>
where the Garriſon ſpoil'd all the Country round
about it, under the Command of a Governour
who was not a ſleep, and had learnt his Trade
under the Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> I mean <hi>Montall,</hi> whom
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> hath ſo ſuccesfully employ'd, and
who did you great Service in the laſt War.
But you believ'd the taking of <hi>Stenay</hi> was of
much greater Advantage; and therefore you
march'd your Army thither under the command
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98314:44"/>
of Mareſchal <hi>Fabert:</hi> This General was much to
be valued for his great Fidelity to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
becauſe he was almoſt the only Man, among thoſe
who were Governours of Places, who refus'd
the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Offers, who did all he
cou'd to debauch him out of your Service: But
he reſolv'd not to follow the Example of others,
and kept <hi>Sedan,</hi> which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> put into his
Hands.</p>
               <p>The Prince to whom <hi>Stenay</hi> belong'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
Forces from the Arch-Duke to relieve it.
The Arch-Duke promis'd him, and indeed did
all he cou'd to oblige Prince <hi>Francis</hi> to lend him
his Troops: But becauſe this Place had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
from <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he would not but upon
Condition it ſhould be re-united; to which the
Prince would not yield, and this Buſineſs having
encreas'd the miſ-underſtanding that was between
'em, the Arch-Duke had much ado to keep 'em
from coming to down right Blows. <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
came in Perſon to the Siege, after you had
been at <hi>Reins,</hi> where the Ceremonies of your
Conſecration had been perform'd: <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
was very liberal to your Souldiers, who all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
the Inclination they ſaw you had to War.
While your Forces were before <hi>Stenay,</hi> the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> prevail'd with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
beſiege <hi>Arras;</hi> ſuppoſing, that becauſe this Place
was of much greater conſequence to you, than
the other, you wou'd raiſe the Siege of <hi>Stenay</hi> to
relieve it. But they were deceiv'd in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
it only made <hi>your Majeſty</hi> the more
diligent to take it, and you were no ſooner poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of it, but you made haſt to relieve <hi>Arras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98314:44"/>
The taking of <hi>Arras</hi> was of ſuch importance
to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they neglected nothing to
make themſelves ſure of it: Their Lines were
the beſt that ever was ſeen, and at equal diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they had rais'd Redoubts, by which they
were the more ſecur'd; and not content with
all this Precaution, they had made Holes in the
Ground within, to ſtop the Cavalry: But the
Siege began with an ill Omen; for the Chevalier
<hi>Crequi</hi> who had not yet any great Reputation for
a Souldier; but hath ſince ſo well behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> after making him a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
of <hi>France,</hi> hath given him the Command
of your beſt Armies; threw himſelf into the
Place, at the Head of Five Hundred Horſe.</p>
               <p>This Relief did <hi>Montjeu</hi> great Service, who
commanded within, and who to ſpare his Purſe,
had but an indifferent Garriſon: for in thoſe
Days, <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> not being able your ſelf to
order your own Affairs, the Governors of Places
appropriated to themſelves the Contributions
without rendring any Accompt to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
with which they undertook to defend the Place
wherein they commanded; which was very
inconvenient, for inſtead of maintaining
a good Garriſon, they thought of nothing but
heaping up Treaſure; this <hi>your Majeſty</hi> cou'd
not remedy; but by changing this Cuſtom, and
putting things into the State they are at preſent.
And indeed, as now your Safety is greater than it
was before; ſo you have taken away a Company
of petty Tyrants, who as ſoon as they were put
into the command of any place, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as great as <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98314:45"/>
                  <hi>Montjeu,</hi> who was a brave Man, held out near
two Months, without letting the Enemy get
much Ground upon him: in the mean time,
your Army under the Command of Vicount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
appear'd in view of their Lines, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to intrench, becauſe he fear'd they would
come out and fight him, and that they being
ſtronger than he, he might receive ſome Affront.
It was the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Advice, that they
ſhould go out of their Lines, and fight <hi>Turenne,</hi>
becauſe, ſaid he, they expect the coming of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> with the Troops he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and then they will know how to talk with
us. But the Arch-Duke maintain'd, that they
cou'd not go out of their Lines, without quitting
ſome Out-works which they had taken, and if
they did not quit 'em, the Garriſon would again
beat them out of 'em, which was ſtill the ſame
thing; and therefore they were better continue
their Attaques, and endeauour to take the Town
before <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> ſhould arrive.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Duke's opinion was follow'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
amongſt the Officers that were in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of War, there was none but the Prince of
<hi>Condé,</hi> who durſt contradict him. This gave
Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> time, to put his Army into a
condition not to be inſulted, and to expect the
coming of Mareſchal <hi>Hoquincourt;</hi> who as ſoon
as he came, attack'd the Abby of <hi>St. Eloi,</hi> and
carried it. He lodged there with his Army
round about him, and acting in concert with
Vicount <hi>Turenne</hi> who was on the other ſide of the
Lines, they cut off the Enemies Proviſions, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98314:45"/>
hinder'd all Convoys from coming into their
Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montjeu</hi> ſeeing himſelf ſo near being reliev'd,
felt his courage encreaſe; and having repuls'd
the Beſiegers in two Aſſaults they made upon
one of his Outworks; they were in ſuch conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> thought it a fit
time to ſet upon them in that diſorder. The
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> who foreſaw they could make
no reſiſtance, ſaid to the Archduke, That ſince
he would not believe him at firſt, he hoped he
would now; and ſeeing there was no more
time to be loſt, the only way they were to take
in their preſent condition, was to raiſe the Siege
and fall upon <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> to whom <hi>Turenne</hi>
could give no aſſiſtance. The Archduke ſeem'd
well enough inclin'd to it, and fell into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
diſcourſe of their Retreat; but having
conſulted <hi>Count Fuenſaldagne,</hi> who paſt for a
great Souldier among his Country-men, was by
him wholly diſſwaded from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Louis</hi>'s day being come, which <hi>Viſcount
Turenne</hi> had choſen to make his Attack, he
gave the Signal agreed on with <hi>Mareſchal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quincourt;</hi>
ſo that both having marched, <hi>Viſcount
Turenne</hi> forced the Lines in that part, which
was guarded by <hi>Fernando Solis.</hi> But <hi>Mareſchal
Hoquincourt</hi> miſs'd his way, which gave the
Archduke time to think of Retreating; but <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Turenne</hi> following his blow, beat the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers</hi>
in their Quarter, which was next to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſeeing the diſorder, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to a little Rivulet, which ſeparated his
Quarter from the reſt; and there making head
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98314:46"/>
againſt <hi>Vicount Turenne,</hi> and <hi>Mareſchal Hoquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
who had now joyn'd him, he gave the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
and the Troops he had brought out of
<hi>France,</hi> time to retreat in good order; his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
never the leſs ſuffer'd very much in their
Retreat with the Prince, who was the laſt man,
and which he managed with ſo much prudence,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> admired him; among whom
he got very great credit for ſo brave an action.</p>
               <p>The Enemy's Cannon and Baggage fell into
<hi>Your Majeſties</hi> hands. You went to the Cathedral
Church of the City, and there gave God thanks
for the Victory he had given you; for you ſtill
attributed all things to him like a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
believing that your good conduct, or the
force of your Arms could do nothing without
his aid. The taking of <hi>Queſnoi</hi> was the fruit
of this Victory, and therewith ended this proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
Campagne.</p>
               <p>Your Conqueſts were likewiſe increaſed in
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> by the taking of <hi>Villafranca</hi> and <hi>Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerda;</hi>
from whence the Enemies continually
made Inroads into <hi>Rouſillon;</hi> but you did not
make the ſame Progreſs in <hi>Italy,</hi> tho' you ſpared
nothing on that ſide, to ſignalize the Glory of
your Arms. For the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
you in great Expences, under pretence
of his maintaining correſpondence with <hi>Naples,</hi>
and that he ſhould no ſooner appear but that
whole Kingdom would riſe; yet came back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking any thing but <hi>Caſtellamar,</hi> which he
was forced to quit.</p>
               <p>This Enterprize however gave <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
Reputation, tho' the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavour'd in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98314:46"/>
that Country, to make people believe you were
a Prince that could not eaſily get out of that
confuſion, into which the Civil Wars had caſt
you; tho' you now ſcarce feel the effects of it,
having put all things into ſo good order every
where; for it is not only on the Frontiers that
you have eſtabliſh'd your power; but you have
likewiſe done it in the heart of your Kingdom,
where there remain'd but two things to be done,
and which appear'd very preſſing and abſolutely
neceſſary. The one was, ſo to ſettle again the
Power and Authority of your Miniſter, that he
might meet with no more ſuch Strokes as had
like to have tumbled him quite down. The other
was, to puniſh thoſe, who under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Friends betray'd you.</p>
               <p>You did the firſt, by marrying his Eminencies
Nieces, to ſuch great Lords, that the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in your Court, were engag'd to preſerve him;
one of his Nieces was married to the Duke of
<hi>Mercoeur,</hi> and another to the Prince of <hi>Conti.</hi>
This begot a great deſire in the greateſt and
moſt Eminent Men about you, to court the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who were not yet old enough to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and who might pretend to any thing, after
their other two Siſters had gotten Husbands of
ſuch Quality.</p>
               <p>As to the Puniſhment of thoſe who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
you, you made that Exemplary in the
Perſon of Cardinal <hi>de Rets;</hi> whom you caus'd
to be Arreſted; but becauſe the regard you had to
his Character, would not permit you to puniſh him
according to what your Juſtice requir'd, you
therefore only reſolv'd to take from him his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98314:47"/>
Arch-Biſhoprick, which gave him by the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, ſo much Power over the Clergy,
as to be able to engage them in Factions prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to your Service; you propos'd to him a
Reſignation of his Biſhoprick into the Hands of
the Pope, and that then he ſhould have his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Monſieur <hi>Bellievre</hi> firſt Preſident of the
Parliament, who was ſent to him to let him
know <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Pleaſure, was his Friend,
but none to your Miniſter; ſo that inſtead
of counſelling him to accept of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
he advis'd him to the contrary; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he ſpoke to him as a Friend, and not as
one ſent from the Court.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing this Magiſtrate had the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of being one of the Honeſteſt Men in <hi>France,</hi>
and a Judge of as great integrity, as hath been a
long time in Parliament. It will not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to give <hi>your Majeſty</hi> a Character of the
Man; 'tis very true, that he was an Honeſt Man,
and incapable of doing a baſe thing; however,
I can ſay, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did your ſelf no good
when you prefer'd him; if he were a Vertuous
Man, his Vertue was very Auſtere, and would
never conſider the neceſſitie of your State: He
affected the Name of being a Man for the Publick
Good, which kept him without any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
from acting conjunctly with <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> for the Good of your Affairs: He was
alſo of ſo high a Spirit, that if Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>
had ſent for him, unleſs it were in <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
Name, he would not come; and then if your
ſelf were not upon the Place to tell him what
your Pleaſure was, he would not ſtay; yea,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98314:47"/>
ſuch was his Pride, that he could not endure his
Eminence ſhould think, there was any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſhould never put ſuch frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
untractable Men, at the Head of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
which have already done enough to
convince you, that you ought never to let them
have a Preſident, that will joyn with them to uſurp
upon your Authority. Nothing is of greater
Conſequence to your Kingdom; and when there
wants ſuch a Head, you ought to prefer a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
who will be a Curb to them. Your Parliament
hath already Power enough not to covet more,
and that which I have before ſaid of them, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the War of <hi>Paris,</hi> is a ſufficient Reaſon
for you to ſet Bounds to their Power: But
the Inclination you always had to reward your
Servants, joyn'd with the neceſſity wherein you
then were, made you take the firſt comer,
who offer'd to repair his ill Fortune, who before
had the Place, and whoſe extream Poverty you
could not ſee without bluſhing, being not then
in a Condition to help him; ſo that you permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this Magiſtrate to treat with his Predeceſſor,
which nothing but the Miſery of the times
could excuſe: For I can aſſure <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> it
may occaſion many Inconveniences, as your ſelf
will confeſs, when you conſider, that they who
arrive to Places of Honour, for which they
think they have no Obligation to their Maſter,
are never ſo ſubmiſſive to him, as they are, who
for the Places they hold, depend ſolely on
him.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Rets</hi> took his Friend's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98314:48"/>
becauſe there is nothing ſo grievous to a
Man, as the loſs of his Liberty, he thought to
procure his, by feigning to hearken to what was
propoſed: He ſent <hi>your Majeſty</hi> word, he was ready
to ſign a blank Reſignation, but when that was
done, ſince the Price offer'd for it, was what depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only upon the Cardinal, whom he could not
truſt; he would be glad to know before hand, what
aſſurance you would give him he ſhould have his
Liberty. Your Majeſty, who acted with great ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but would not be trick'd; gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that you left it to his choice, to take
ſuch Meaſures as he beſt lik'd; and that you
would be contented, provided you might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure:
So that now the matter being left to him
to reſolve, he agreed with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that
if you would let him out of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> he would
remain under the Guard of Mareſchal <hi>Meilleray,</hi>
who had marry'd one of his Relations, till the
Pope had accepted his Reſignation.</p>
               <p>He was conducted to <hi>Nantes,</hi> where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
was, whoſe Vigilance he deſign'd
to deceive, becauſe he well knew, that the
Pope, with whom he dealt underhand, to make
him refuſe that which the Cardinal ſeem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
would not fail to declare himſelf againſt
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> The Mareſchal, who was a good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Man, and did not think the Cardinal a double
Dealer, commanded that he ſhould not be kept
too cloſe, but ſome Liberty ſhould be allow'd
him, ſo that the Guards let him go daily out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Baſtion,</hi> and did not keep the Door by
which he went to it; but he, who thought of
nothing but eſcaping, got a Rope made of Silk,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98314:48"/>
of the heighth of the Baſtion, and his Phyſician,
who was with him, holding it, he let himſelf
down by it, and got away upon a Horſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
brought thither. Some thought his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to foment new
Diſorders; but his Horſe falling on the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Nantes,</hi> which is very bad, he fled to
<hi>Machcoul,</hi> a Caſtle which belong'd to the Duke
of <hi>Rets,</hi> his Brother.</p>
               <p>Mareſchal <hi>Meilleray</hi> prepar'd to go thither and
beſiege it; which made the Cardinal go thence
to <hi>Belliſle.</hi> The Mareſchal would likewiſe have
follow'd him, if <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would have given
him leave; but one Reaſon of State why you
would not permit him, was, becauſe you fear'd
that the Mareſchal, who was very powerful in
that Province, would not keep it for you;
and that after your Endeavours to put things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
good Order, you your ſelf might be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of new Diſorders.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing it had been a kind of braving <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> to have ſtay'd in your Kingdom, after
he had been ſo unhappy to incur your Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Rome,</hi> from whence, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to return, till he had given you the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
you expected. Indeed, it concerns the
Majeſty of a great King, not to ſuffer a Subject
to beard him, but to reduce him to his Duty;
otherwiſe it would be an Example to others of
dangerous conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> knowing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had
not well recover'd their Rout at <hi>Arras,</hi> haſten'd
to take the Field; where after having taken <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drecis,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98314:49"/>
Condé</hi> and St. <hi>Guillain,</hi> the Arch-Duke
was ſo allarm'd, that he thought every Moment
you would attack him in <hi>Bruxells,</hi> the fear of it
made him employ ten thouſand <hi>Peaſants,</hi> to
make a kind of Fortification about it, and 'tis
for <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Reputation Poſterity ſhould
know it; becauſe it cannot but take notice,
that after the Arch-Duke had made you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in your Capital City of <hi>Paris,</hi> you ſhould
do the like by him in ſo ſhort a time, and that
you muſt be a great King to do ſuch Miracles:
But what I can ſay, is, That you forget nothing
which is for the publick good of your Kingdom,
and that then you knew as well how to Treat,
as to make War.</p>
               <p>It plainly appear'd in the Treaty you made
with Prince <hi>Francis,</hi> whoſe Deſign you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
by his letting the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> who
manag'd all his Affairs, fall into your Hands at the
Rout of <hi>Arras:</hi> For inſtead of thinking he was
taken Priſoner by chance, you concluded it to be
a premeditated Contrivance, which made you
ſtand ſo ſtiff upon the Propoſitions that Lord
then made. Who ſtill pretended all that he
ſaid was from himſelf, without having any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Prince his Maſter: But even from
his Feign'd Story, your Majeſty rightly judg'd
neceſſity oblig'd him to treat with you, which
ſhew'd you a prudent, and well advis'd Prince,
ſeeing to conclude only from appearances, is
the way to be deceiv'd in all a Man doth.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſh'd, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had been
able to be preſent in all your Armies, as well as
in that of <hi>Flanders;</hi> you then had ſeen with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98314:49"/>
your own Eyes, in what manner things went;
you might then have weigh'd all Enterprizes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you gave your conſent to their being put in
execution; but ſeeing your knowledge of Places,
and your Enemies Forces were but imperfect,
you met with a check in <hi>Italy,</hi> of which only
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s eaſineſs can be accus'd.</p>
               <p>He was ſo faſt tyed to his own Country, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Wealth and Honours he had
heap'd in <hi>France,</hi> which ought to have made him
forget it; that he endeavour'd to get a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
there, for the Siſter of the Princeſs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> but of all thoſe that
preſented themſelves, he lik'd none ſo well as the
Duke of <hi>Modena.</hi> This Allyance the Cardinal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
ſo conſiderable to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> as if he had
no other end, than drawing in this Prince to eſpouſe
your Intereſt; ſo that he prevail'd with you, to give
the Duke the command of your Army in that
Country, jointly with Prince <hi>Thomas;</hi> and theſe
two Generals being joyn'd, broke the Marqueſs
of <hi>Caracene</hi>'s Meaſures, who deſign'd to ſurprize
<hi>Regio;</hi> which ſo rais'd their Courage, that they
thought themſelves in a condition to beſiege <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie:</hi>
But they were forc'd to quit the Siege,
which had very much leſſen'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
if that which happen'd elſewhere had not
repair'd your Reputation; for beſide that which
you did in <hi>Flanders,</hi> your Army in <hi>Catalonia</hi> did
not only preſerve its Conqueſts; but enlarg'd
'em: For it ſeis'd upon <hi>Cap-daquiers,</hi> and being
enter'd into the <hi>Campourda,</hi> put all under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
home to <hi>Gironne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fault whereof your Miniſter was guilty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98314:50"/>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> was not the only one of which his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
may be accus'd; he was very fond of a
Maxime, which no body but himſelf approv'd,
and which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſuffer'd, becauſe you had
ſo much confidence in him; he employ'd in all
your Affairs two Perſons inſtead of one, which
was always the Ground of perpetual jealouſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em, and which muſt neceſſarily produce
very ill Effects: For two Men with equal Power
and Authority, look upon one another as two
Enemies, tho' they ſeem not to do it, and they
will never let ſlip an Opportunity of doing one
another an ill turn; they are never better pleas'd,
than when one of them doth a Fault; and they
commonly ſuborn People to procure each other's
Ruine. To redreſs this, is very difficult; but
'tis abſolutely neceſſary for the good of your
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> is far from liking this Maxim;
you know, that the moſt perfect Government is,
that which comes neareſt to GOD's; and
therefore you give abſolute Power, to thoſe
that act under your Orders: 'Tis enough, that
they render you an Account of what they do;
but you do not put Perſons in equal Ballance one
with another, if you did, you ſhould be ſure to be
but ill ſerved; for if they that have Commiſſion
to do a thing, do it not with all the Authority of
their Maſter, they are always ill obey'd: Beſide,
if two Perſons have Power to command the ſame
thing, one uſually croſſeth what the other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes;
their differing in Opinion, produceth
this Effect, as well as the Jealouſie which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em; ſo that we ought to conclude a State
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98314:50"/>
is ill govern'd, where there are ſo many Maſters.
We likewiſe ſee, that Monarchical Government
is counted the moſt perfect, and that the beſt
Policy'd Republicks are thoſe, where there is
the leaſt Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Whatever was the matter, this Diſorder
reign'd in your Revenue, and in your Armies;
you know that in <hi>Italy</hi> there were two Generals;
in <hi>Flanders</hi> likewiſe, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> was
pleas'd this Year, to joyn two Men together,
whoſe Humours and Inclinations, were quite
contrary to one another's; I mean, Viſcount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
and Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
agree, and who alſo had lately quarrel'd.
The Mareſchal took out of the Viſcounts Hands
a Priſoner, under pretence of exchanging him
for one of his Men taken by the Enemy; but in
truth it was to hang him, in revenge for a <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer</hi>
in <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Service, whom they had
put to Death. The Mareſchal had reaſon to do
it, and no body can ſay the contrary; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
no <hi>Lorrainer</hi> would take Arms to ſerve
you; but <hi>your Majeſty</hi> will confeſs, that Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> had juſt cauſe to complain of the
Mareſchal's abuſing his Credulity, and tho' it
concern'd your Service, yet there is no Pleaſure
in being made an Inſtrument to the bringing a
Poor Man to the Gallows.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Generals, whoſe Army conſiſted of
Thirty Thouſand Men, reſolving to imploy it in
ſome glorious Enterprize, thought none greater
than the beſieging of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> each took his
Quarter oppoſite to one another: <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
inſtead of expecting every Moment to receive
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98314:51"/>
News of the Town's being taken, heard that
<hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the Arch-Duke's room,
was marching with the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who always us'd to
be cautious and ſtand upon his Guard, was now
in ſo good a Poſture, that <hi>Don John</hi> to ſucceed
in his Deſign, thought the beſt way, was to fall
upon Mareſchal <hi>de la Fertè</hi>'s Quarter. <hi>Turenne,</hi>
who ſpent a great deal upon Spyes, acquainted
the Mareſchal with it, and offer'd to ſend ſome
Troops to help him to repulſe the Enemy; but
his Jealouſie would not let him accept the Offer,
ſo that <hi>Don John,</hi> tho' he did not find him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided,
yet he fell upon him with ſo much
Advantage, that he defeated the Mareſchal, and
took him Priſoner: <hi>Don John</hi> would have gon
on, and attack'd Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Quarter;
but he was ready to receive him in ſo good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he ſaw he had to do with another gueſs
Man than the Mareſchal: <hi>Turenne</hi> retreated to
<hi>Queſnoy,</hi> where he ſtay'd to expect thoſe that
fled, and kept ſo good a Countenance, that <hi>Don
John</hi> durſt not offer him Battel; but thought it
better to take the Town of <hi>Condé,</hi> which <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
could not relieve; but to repair that loſs,
he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Capelle,</hi> which <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> had no opportunity to re-take, ſince you
loſt it.</p>
               <p>Another, not ſo couragious as <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
would have been very much troubled with the ill
Succeſs of this Siege, and would have vented
his anger upon the Priſoner; but you did not
only appear unmov'd in this reverſe of Fortune;
but took it upon your ſelf to juſtifie the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal's
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98314:51"/>
Conduct, whoſe Ranſome you alſo pay'd;
for you are always bountiful to them that ſerve
you, and the greater their Misfortunes are, the
more conſideration you have for 'em.</p>
               <p>You were not ſo ill treated by Fortune in <hi>Italy</hi>
this Year, as you were the laſt: Your Army,
commanded by the Dukes of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> and <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
took there the Town of <hi>Valence,</hi> in ſight of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, who durſt not come to a
Battel. In <hi>Catalonia</hi> you likewiſe maintain'd
the Honour which your Arms had there acquir'd,
ſo that the Luſtre of your Crown, obſcur'd that
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and every one ſtrove to be your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
               <p>Indeed, you forgot nothing to make your ſelf
conſiderable, and the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> your antient Allyes,
falling out among themſelves, you, by your
Mediation, happily ended their Differences: For
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> knows, that nothing is to paſs in
<hi>Europe,</hi> without your taking notice of it; and
that ſuch great Princes as you, ought ſo to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their Authority, that no body may take
Arms, without their conſent.</p>
               <p>You receiv'd into your Dominions the Queen
of <hi>Sweeden,</hi> who had reſign'd her Crown to her
Couſin-German; ſhe was extremely pleas'd with
the Reception you gave her; but you were not
ſo with her Proceedings; for in one of your
Royal Houſes, ſhe caus'd one of her principal
Officers to be aſſaſſinated, who it ſeems had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
her; they who pretend to penetrate into
ſecrets, believe there was ſome Myſtery between
them; and that the Gentleman's Indiſcretion,
was the cauſe of his Misfortune: Diſcourſes ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98314:52"/>
much to the Diſhonour of this Princeſs, with
the little ſatisfaction you had in what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
put her upon parting ſooner than ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
ſhe went to <hi>Rome,</hi> the place ſhe had
choſen for her Retreat, and there having abjur'd
her Religion, ſhe found, that there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Diſguſts in a private Life, which People,
who never taſted any before, would never have
expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> about this time, was ingag'd in
ſo nice a Buſineſs, that you never met with the
like, ſince you aſcended the Throne.</p>
               <p>I mean that of the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> a Sect ſo much
the more dangerous, becauſe it cover'd it ſelf
with the Cloak of Piety: It was condemn'd at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and then you thought you were not to
tolerate it in your Dominions; ſo that you
would not permit thoſe to ſtay, who would not
ſubſcribe to the Pope's Decree: But their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being ſtrong, tho' they were out of your
Kingdom, they kept intelligence with ſome in
it; all <hi>Paris</hi> was full of their Books, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ran ſo eagerly to read 'em, that they ſaid,
<hi>Rome</hi> was miſtaken in condemning 'em: Their
manner of Living, wrought much upon the People
in their Favour; for they did nothing, in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but what tended to Perfection; and all
that could be objected againſt their Doctrine,
was, that they made the Gates of Paradiſe too
narrow: It was indeed dangerous to hear 'em;
for their Words were perfect Honey to purify'd
Souls, and thoſe were hardly able to return
from their Errours, whom they had once
thrown into Deſpair: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98314:52"/>
you were not concern'd to enter into a
thorough examination of ſuch matters, kept
cloſe to the Pope's Decree, and order'd the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne</hi>
to confute their Writings, which were
Publick: They took great Pains to do it; but
ſome Doctors refuſing to ſubmit to the Opinion
of others, conformable to what had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
at <hi>Rome,</hi> they were expell'd the Colledge,
which was approved by <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> becauſe
'twas the only way to ſuppreſs the Schiſm, which
was ready to break out.</p>
               <p>Indeed, a Wiſe and Prudent King, ought to
cut off the Current of all Innovations, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in matters of Religion, whereof the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
are always greater than in other things;
unleſs it be done, there can be no ſafety either
for Kingdoms, or Conſciences; and it would
be in the Power of every falſe Zealot, to make a
Religion according to his own Mode; he would
not fail of having Diſciples, provided he carry'd
things to extremity; for the Mind of Man, is of
that Temper, that at firſt ſight, he finds himſelf
taken with great Reſpect, for thoſe things,
which he thinks moſt perfect, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that when they are carry'd to ſo high a
Pitch, they are far above the reach of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Frailty, to which there ought ſtill ſome
regard to be had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> ſoon after, undertook the Siege
of <hi>Cambray;</hi> and tho' it were with your uſual
Prudence, and therefore might hope for good
Succeſs; yet your Conduct was forc'd to give
place to Fortune; the Enterprize wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon Diligence, and <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> made
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98314:53"/>
account your Lines ſhould be perfected, before
the Enemy, who was a pretty way off, ſhould
have notice of it; but the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who
unluckily took a review of his Troops, the Day
after yours, encamp'd before the Place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Horſeback, when the News was brought
him, he preſently March'd, and ſo well took his
time, that he paſs'd through your Army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being known; after which you were oblig'd
to raiſe the Siege; but reſolving to repair this
Affront by ſome conſiderable enterprize, you
beſieg'd <hi>Montmedi.</hi> The Enemy's Army full of
Pride for that which had happen'd to you at
<hi>Cambray,</hi> flatter'd themſelves, they could give
you the like Check before <hi>Montmedi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who was their Hero,
was pray'd to undertake the care of it; but Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> who obſerv'd him, having
march'd Night and Day, with a Party of the
Troops which he commanded, and Mareſchal <hi>la
Ferté,</hi> whom you had charg'd with this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
being in a good Poſture, tho' his Lines
were not yet finiſh'd: The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> durſt
not undertake the Attack; ſo that you reduc'd
this ſtrong Place under your Obedience. Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>Turenne</hi> went and rejoyn'd his Army,
after the departure of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who,
as great a Captain as he was, could not hinder
<hi>Turenne</hi> from taking St. <hi>Venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> ſaw that; he with
<hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> went and beſieg'd <hi>Ardres,</hi>
hoping, that Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> would either quit
his Enterprize, or let him finiſh his, without
giving him any Trouble: The Prince thought he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98314:53"/>
ſhould ſooner do his Work than <hi>Turenne;</hi> becauſe
St. <hi>Venant</hi> was defended by a good Garriſon, and
that there was ſcarce any body in <hi>Ardres:</hi> But
Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> who knew that one of the beſt
Qualities in a General, was not to loſe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time, us'd ſuch Diligence, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the Enemy to Capitulate two days ſooner
than the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> imagin'd; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
march'd againſt the Prince; who having notice
of it, was half Mad; for had he given the Prince
but four Hours time more, he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of <hi>Ardres:</hi> being juſt ready to
ſpring a Mine, which had done all that he could
deſire, and then there was no appearance the
Governour could have held out longer; but he
knowing he was ſo near being reliev'd, refus'd to
hearken to any Capitulation. The Prince, not
being ſo ſtrong as <hi>Turenne,</hi> reſolv'd to raiſe the
Siege, which was no little Honour to the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
whoſe Diligence had made the Prince
fail both of relieving <hi>Montmedi,</hi> and of taking
<hi>Ardres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to loſe any time, is ſo neceſſary a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in a General, that without it, no Man can
ever hope to be a good Captain: For in War,
ſome times All depends upon an Inſtant, and he
that knows not how to make uſe of it, doth not
deſerve any great Eſteem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turenne</hi> did not yet end his Campagne, he
likewiſe took <hi>La Motthe au Bois,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Forts upon the Canal of <hi>Bourbourg,</hi> after
which he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Mardik.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which paſs'd in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be told, were it not convenient it ſhould
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98314:54"/>
be known, that the Reaſon why <hi>your Majeſty</hi> made
no more Conqueſts there, was, becauſe you
thought it enough, to keep thoſe you had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
The Country which is divided from <hi>Rouſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
and <hi>Cerdaigne,</hi> by a Chain of Mountains of
a prodigious Heighth, and whoſe Avenues are ſo
narrow, that two Men can hardly paſs in Front,
ſeems to be made for another Soveraign, and it
would be to force Nature, to unite them under
one Government; ſo that <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
your ſelf with the Bounds, which God
ſeem'd to have ſet between your Kingdom, and
that of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> you reſolv'd not to
enter into his, but only to let him ſee, you had
Troops ſufficient to guard your own; ſo that
all which afterward paſs'd, was only ſome light
Skirmiſhes, (which caus'd little alteration) till a
Peace was concluded.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who commanded in this
Country the laſt Year, ſeeing there was now lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Honour to be gotten by him there, pray'd
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> leave, to go and ſupply the Place
of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was dead: You granted
his Requeſt; but it had been much better for
his Reputation, to have ſtay'd in <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> than
to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> and be forc'd to raiſe the Siege
of <hi>Alexandria de la Paille,</hi> which he had joyntly
undertaken with the Duke of <hi>Modena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would know, why you met
with more ill turns of Fortune in that Country,
than in any other; 'tis eaſie to give <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
a Reaſon for it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> look upon the
<hi>Milanez</hi> of very great Conſequence to them,
the loſs of which, would certainly draw after it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98314:54"/>
other Places they poſſeſs in that Country; ſo
that whenever they are attack'd, they uſe all
imaginable means to relieve them: Beſide, the
Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> do not ordinarily Pray for you,
when your Armies come amongſt 'em: They are
very well pleas'd with your Protection, but do
not care for your Neighbourhood. It is enough
for <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to have a Door open to help
'em in time of need, and if you ſuffer no body,
eſpecially <hi>Spain,</hi> to meddle with 'em, you ſhall
ſtill be in great Reputation among 'em: All then,
which I think you ought to do in that Country,
is to continue the Allyance which you have
with the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> with whom, a good
Correſpondence is not only neceſſary for the
keeping of <hi>Cazall;</hi> but likewiſe of <hi>Pignerol:</hi> That
of other Princes is of no uſe to you, but may
prove prejudicial, by making others believe,
you have great Deſigns upon their Liberty;
and therefore may put them upon entring into
a Confederacy againſt you. I know, that at this
time <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is in ſo great Reputation, that
a League of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> againſt you,
would turn to their Confuſion, if it were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Forces of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> muſt take heed, the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes do
not ſerve for Trumpets to other Potentates,
who are Jealous enough of your Majeſty, and
would readily joyn to interrupt your Proſperity.
Beſide, you muſt do all you can, to avoid allarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> of whom you have more need than
you Imagin; for ſhould they recall the Troops
they lend you, it would deprive you of a
Strength you cannot ſpare: To which I may add,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98314:55"/>
that in ſuch a Revolution, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
may leave you, and then by his Defection, your
Frontiers, which are not fortify'd on that ſide,
will ſuffer very much.</p>
               <p>I know very well, that when a Prince reſolves
to make War, he ought not only to think, by
what means he may ſucceed; but alſo, what
is like to be the Sequel and End of it. I conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
know, that the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> are too
well advis'd, to declare themſelves againſt <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> from whom only they can hope for
help, when they are oppreſs'd, and againſt whom
they cannot arm any other Potentates; but thoſe
of whom they ought to be extreamly jealous:
To which Branch ſoever of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
they addreſs themſelves, they have reaſon to
fear it; for that of <hi>Germany,</hi> pretends they are
Feudataries of the Empire, of which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
holds the Reins, and conſequently ought to
command them. That of <hi>Spain,</hi> hath upon 'em
the right of Convenience, which is as good a
Title as any other; ſo that to which ſide ſoever
they turn, they will find it much ſafer for 'em
to maintain Friendſhip with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> than to
addreſs elſewhere; but then <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ought
to perform your Part, becauſe, when People ſee
themſelves neglected, their Reſentment of it
will not alway permit them to Reflect on what
they ſhould do; and the Deſire of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd,
is ſometimes ſo deeply rooted in their
Hearts, that they will buy Vengeance at any
Rate.</p>
               <p>Amidſt ſo many important Affairs, which
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> had on all ſides, your Mind was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98314:55"/>
the leſs ſet, upon all that might procure the
eaſe and quiet of your Subjects; there was not
a Year paſs'd, wherein you did not publiſh ſome
good Laws; among which, I cannot forget
that excellent Edict, which did forbid all Pages
and Footmen to wear Swords. You commanded
that it ſhould be ſo exactly obſerv'd, that thoſe
Diſorders which before daily happen'd, begun to
ceaſe; your People were alſo very much oblig'd
to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> for delivering them from the
troubleſom Importunitys of Beggars, of whom
Idleneſs, for the moſt part, made ſo great a
Multitude, (who would rather beg than work;)
that no body in any place could be quiet for
'em, the Streets were full of 'em, as well as the
Churches, where People could not ſay their
Prayers, without being every Moment inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by 'em. You commanded, that they
ſhould be ſhut up in the Hoſpital General; your
Edict concerning it, made the Deaf to hear,
the Dumb to ſpeak, and the Lame to walk;
this Law wrought more Miracles, than ever
were ſeen done at one time under the Goſpel;
it was an intolerable Abuſe, to ſee ſo many Idle
People lying in all Paſſages upon Bundles of
Straw, with Limbs, to appearance, Diſtorted
and out of Joynt, to move Compaſſion; yet,
when they were to be ſhut up, were all Sound and
Streight, and could work as well as others.</p>
               <p>The League, which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> made with
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> procur'd you the Year following
the Service of their Ships, to beſiege <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
which you inveſted both by Sea and Land: <hi>Don
John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> came to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98314:56"/>
relieve it; their Army had in it a new Rebell,
upon whom <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had heap'd many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
but he cover'd his Ingratitude and Breach
of Faith, with pretending he had cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
againſt your Miniſter; it was Mareſchal
<hi>Hoquincourt;</hi> he endeavour'd to make the Town
of <hi>Peronne,</hi> whereof he was Governour, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for that Party, into which he had thrown
himſelf; but the Fidelity of his Son, and of the
Inhabitants, kept the Place for <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Importance of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> oblig'd the Eenmy
to hazard all, rather than ſuffer it to be loſt; ſo
that being come to view the Lines, Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi>
went out, and gave them Battel: Your Troops an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
the hope you had conceiv'd of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and having beaten the Enemy's Army, the
Town Render'd it ſelf to your General; you came
your ſelf thither, to put it into the Hands of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, according to the Treaty made
with them, were to have it; which you were
neceſſitated to do, to keep them from joyning
with your Enemies; but it was a vexation to
you, to ſee ſo fine and conſiderable a Town,
fall into any other Hands but your own: You
contented your ſelf with requiring a Condition
to be made good, which was very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Catholicks, they being thereby allow'd
to enjoy their Liberty of Conſcience, contrary to
the practice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their own Country;
but the neceſſity which oblig'd you to give them
the Poſſeſſion of the Town, oblig'd them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to yield to ſo juſt a Demand.</p>
               <p>The Defeat of the Enemy before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to you a Door to greater Conqueſts;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98314:56"/>
                  <hi>Gravelin, Bergues, Furnes, Dixmude, Menim,
Oudenard, Ypres,</hi> and ſome other Places, fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Dominion; for which Succeſs, your
Peoples Joy had been much greater, had it not
been leſſen'd by the fear of loſing you; for it
was about this time, you were ſo ſick at <hi>Calais,</hi>
that it was believ'd you could not recover.
Great was the Grief of your Court and Army,
every one was in ſuch a Conſternation as
cannot be expreſt; you only appear'd every
Day the ſame, endeavouring to Comfort the
Queen your Mother, and the Cardinal, who
ſtood deſpairing at your Bed's ſide. You were
at laſt given over by all your Phyſicians, ſo that
the laſt Remedy thought of, was to give you a
Vomit, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho not then in uſe, was ordered
by a Man, expreſly ſent for from <hi>Abbeville,</hi> upon
the Reputation he had, for having done many
great Cures: You were thought to be ſo near
loſt, that there were two or three of your Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
who complemented Monſieur your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
upon his being in ſo fair a way to ſucceed
you: Indeed the Curtains of your Bed were
drawn, and it was believ'd, you were ſo near
dead, that your Almoners were ready to begin
the <hi>De Profundis:</hi> But at that very Inſtant, you
gave ſome Signs of Life; ſo that People ſeeing
they were miſtaken, they gave you the Vomit,
which you would not take, till you had ask'd
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> whether he thought it wou'd
cure You.</p>
               <p>He told you, he hop'd it might; which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
you, that you drank it all at a Draught,
and without making any Face: You had that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98314:57"/>
day a hopeful <hi>Criſis,</hi> and People begun to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome Change, which made the Man, in
whoſe Hands you were, give you another Doſe,
which perfected the Cure. <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> Youth
contributed very much to it, as it doth in all
kinds of Diſeaſes, you ſo perfectly recover'd
your Health, that a Month after, it could not
be perceiv'd that you had been Sick.</p>
               <p>The Loſs which your People fear'd of <hi>your
Majeſty's</hi> ſacred Perſon, made the Queen your
Mother, Earneſtly deſire to Marry you. The
Queen's Inclination, as well as your own, was
to the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> which Allyance had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a general Peace, and alſo given <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
a Princeſs of exemplary Vertue, whoſe
Beauty was not to be deſpis'd. But the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who fear'd this Match might one day
bring them under your Dominion, becauſe ſhe
was the preſumptive Heir of their Kingdom,
ſhew'd ſhuch an horrible Averſion to it, that
you were oblig'd to caſt your Eyes on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Savoy. Your Majeſty</hi> went to <hi>Lions</hi> to
ſee her, and conclude the Buſineſs. The
Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> came with her Daughter to
meet you, and you were ſo well pleas'd with
the young Princeſs, that the Dutcheſs her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was over-joy'd, thinking ſhe could never
expect a greater Happineſs: All your Courtiers
likewiſe believing it was a done buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to look on the Princeſs, as ſhe that was to
be their Queen. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> foreſeeing
that if this happen'd, all <hi>Flanders</hi> would fall
under <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Power, and after that you
would force them to reſtore <hi>Navarre,</hi> which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98314:57"/>
they ujuſtly kept from you, they ſent <hi>Pimentel</hi>
to <hi>Lions,</hi> with Power to break this Marriage,
and propoſe that of the Infanta.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> acquainted the young Princeſs
with this Propoſal, and withal told her,
that the Inclination you had for her, made you
leſs ſenſible of this News, than you ſhould have
been at another time. But theſe Words,
how ſincere ſoever they were, not being able to
comfort her, ſhe return'd to <hi>Turin,</hi> very
much afflicted for miſſing ſuch a Fortune.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> having perſonally conferr'd
with <hi>Pimentel,</hi> made a rough Draught of the
Treaty of Peace, of which Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>
would have all the Honour: He went to the
Frontier of <hi>Spain,</hi> where his Catholick Majeſty
on his Part, ſent <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> his prime
Miniſter; their Conferences were held in the
Iſland of <hi>Phoſants,</hi> upon the River <hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi>
which ſeparates <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Dominions from
the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s; and there having agreed
all that <hi>de Lionne</hi> and <hi>Pimentel</hi> had left to be
done; <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſent Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont</hi>
to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to demand the Infanta of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which Ceremony being over, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were to precede the Marriage, you
came to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> with a Magnificent and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Court, after having puniſht the Inhabitants
of <hi>Marſcilles,</hi> who took a very ill time to rebel,
when you were ſo near having a Peace; <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> there eſpous'd the Infanta, and pardon'd
the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> to whom you reſtor'd all
the Places and Governments which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Rebellion. The greateſt part of your
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98314:58"/>
Conqueſts you ſtill kept by this Treaty; but
you were to reſtore all <hi>Lorrain,</hi> excepting only
a High-Way, which was to remain to you in
Soveraignty, to go into <hi>Alſatia;</hi> and the Dutchy
of <hi>Bar;</hi> which was ſtill to continue under <hi>your
Majeſty's</hi> Subjection.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Fear, whereof I have
already ſpoken, <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> in that Particular,
gave them all the Satisfaction they could deſire;
you renounc'd your Succeſſion to <hi>Spain,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Terms, and with all the Clauſes that
Crown requir'd; ſo that having given your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Peace, after ſo long a War, you thought
of nothing but of letting them enjoy it, and of
enjoying it your ſelf.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Containing what paſt ſince the Treaty of the
Pyrenes, to the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle.</head>
               <p>BEfore <hi>your Majeſty</hi> came back to <hi>Paris,</hi> you
ſtay'd a while at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> to give the
Inhabitants of that great City, time to prepare
for your Reception. The Entry they made for
you, was ſo Stately and Magnificent, that in the
Memory of Man, never was any thing ſeen like
it: <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſtopp'd, when you came into
the Suburb of St. <hi>Antoin,</hi> where was erected ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Throne, that it was fit only for you, and
the Queen your Wife; you there receiv'd the
Compliments of the Supream Courts, and of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98314:58"/>
whole Body of the City; after which you went
to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> preceded by your Nobility, and
in the midſt of ſo great a Concourſe of People,
that it look'd as if all <hi>France</hi> had come together
to admire <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amidſt ſo many things, wherewith <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
could not chuſe but be very well pleas'd,
you apply'd your ſelf, as you us'd to do, to the
Government of your Kingdom, and taking care
of your Allyes, as well as of your own People;
you pacified a great Difference which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
between the two Northern Crowns, and
which had produc'd a cruel War. All <hi>Europe</hi>
was likewiſe ready to be engag'd in it; ſo true
is it, that a little Spark will kindle a great Fire:
But you, by your Prudence having quench'd the
Flame, found your ſelf daily in a better Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to enjoy the Repoſe, which by your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
you had acquir'd.</p>
               <p>I had not yet the Honour to be known by <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> tho' upon the Death of Monſieur <hi>Roy,</hi>
chief under Secretary to Monſieur <hi>Tellier,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State for the War, I was by him put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Monſieur <hi>Roy</hi>'s Place, to keep it for Monſieur
<hi>Villacerf,</hi> a Relation of his and mind, who was
not then of Age to execute it; after which, I
enter'd into the Service of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin;</hi>
when I was with him, I had the Honour to ſpeak
to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> but it being only as you were
paſſing by, and to anſwer ſome Queſtions you
ask'd me, it might perhaps have been a long
time before I had been known to you, if the
Cardinal, who found himſelf daily dying, had
not recommended me to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> as a Man,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98314:59"/>
who very well underſtood your Revenue, and
was able to diſcover their Frauds who had the
Adminiſtration of it.</p>
               <p>Two Things made him ſay this Good of me
to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> the one was, The Abuſes
which were really committed by thoſe who
manag'd your Revenue. The other was, The
good Order into which I had brought his own
Affairs, which he had truſted to my Care. I
know not whether I may not put two other
Things into the Account; the one was, The
Hatred he bore to Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Finances</hi> ſignifie all Taxes and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys whatever paid to the King to make up his Revenue.</note> 
                  <hi>Finances,</hi> with
whom he had ſome Words a few
Days before, and who was a very
proud Man, becauſe he had been the
Parliaments Attorney General. The other was,
becauſe the Cardinal ſaw himſelf on the Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of
his Grave, which made him think of quitting the
World, and all its Grandeurs. Whatever it were, it
was <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Pleaſure to have ſome private
Conference with me, wherein I was ſo Happy,
to give <hi>your Majeſty</hi> Satisfaction: <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
then commanded me to draw you up ſome large
Memoirs of that, wherewith I had the Honour
to entertain you; which I did the next Day, and
with which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſeem'd very well pleas'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who
complain'd he had been ſacrifis'd in the late
Treaty, came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he us'd all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Endeavours, to have the Treaty alter'd, in
thoſe Articles which concern'd him: But after
all that he had done in your Father's Life time,
and in your Reign; for which he had his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98314:59"/>
taken from him; there was little appearance
he would ſucceed. Indeed <hi>your Majeſty</hi> judg'd
with a great deal of Reaſon, by what had paſt;
it was not ſafe to take his Word for the future;
ſo that you rejected all he propos'd, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
to him, he muſt reſt ſatisfy'd with what had
been done. When he ſaw this, he apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Cardinal's weak ſide, and propos'd to
him a Marriage of one of his Neices, either
with himſelf, or with Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
feigning he was not yet fully reſolv'd,
whether he ſhould Marry again or no; for the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Nicolle</hi> was then Dead, and his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
now would be much firmer, and more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
than that was, which during her Life,
he had made with the Princeſs <hi>de Cantecroix.</hi>
The Propoſition was ſo much to your Miniſter's
Advantage, that it made him forget <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's</hi>
Intereſt; wherein he was very much to be
blam'd, becauſe he, upon whom a Prince relys
in all his Affairs, ought to prefer them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that can be propos'd, for his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Benefit. I have lately in my own Caſe,
put this Rule in practice; for a very good
Match being offer'd to me for my eldeſt Son, it did
not move, or at all tempt me, becauſe it conſiſted
not with <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Service.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> knowing that by his
Addreſs, he had put his Buſineſs into a fair way,
feigns himſelf in Love; becauſe he found the
Cardinal had more mind his Niece ſhould Marry
him, than his Nephew; for he thought thereby
to gain time, and to put in practice ſome new
Invention: To this piece of Diſſimulation, he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98314:60"/>
adds another, to deferr the propos'd Marriage:
He pretended he was Sick; but this feigned Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
did not hinder him from purſuing the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of his Buſineſs; he engag'd the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> in it, deceiving him firſt; ſo that he very
faithfully promoted the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who indeed was a Prince
of great Sincerity, and whoſe great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Soul would never have ſuffer'd him to be
inſtrumental in deceiving any body; this Duke, I
ſay, believing the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to be a Man
of his Word, acted for him with as much Zeal,
as he could expect from ſo noble a Prince; and
the Cardinal knowing him to be a Man, upon
whoſe Honour and Faith he might rely, put ſo
much Confidence in him, that he ſign'd a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Name, much more to the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Advantage, than that which
paſt in the Iſle of <hi>Pheſants.</hi> The Cardinal now
expected his Niece ſhould be Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
either by being marry'd to the Duke himſelf, or
to his Nephew Prince <hi>Charles:</hi> But the Duke,
who glory'd in never performing any thing he
promis'd, and having obtain'd all that he could
deſire, diſclaims what was promis'd by the
Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which was, that he ſhould Marry
the Cardinal's Niece preſently after the Signing
of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>It may, perhaps, be thought Strange, that
this Cardinal, who was ſo very cunning, did not
cauſe the Treaty to be ratify'd by the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> before the performance of that which
the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> promis'd in his behalf. But
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98314:60"/>
the Reaſon was, becauſe your Miniſter would
not have <hi>your Majeſty</hi> know, what was the Price
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was to pay for this new
Treaty, which was ſo much in his Favour: So
that for being too Crafty, the Cardinal was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
which teacheth us, that there is no
truſting Men of a certain Character, and that
too much Cunning ſometimes doth Men more
Harm, than leſs would do.</p>
               <p>There was Reaſon to think, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
who was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and conſequently loving
Revenge, as all that Nation do, would never
pardon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and in the Poſt
the Cardinal was, it was almoſt impoſſible, but
he ſhould meet with a very fit Opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reveng'd. But having now taken his Bed, he
was to think of Things of much greater Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
which was, to render an Account to
God. It was his Cuſtom, to make every one
pay him, and he to pay no body: The Account he
was to make up with Heaven ſo much perplexed
him, that he fell into great Convulſions; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
in the Condition he was, he ſhould ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
nothing if he told the Truth, he confeſs'd
he had robb'd <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and your People.
Mr. <hi>Joly,</hi> Curate of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the Fields,
who was his Confeſſor, told him he could not
give him Abſolution, unleſs he made Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which, as Rich as he was, was more than
he could do; and beſide, he lov'd his Wealth ſo
well, that he could not find in his Heart to part
with it. He had run a Riſque of dying, without
being abſolv'd, if <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had not had the
Goodneſs to make a Gift to him of all he had
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98314:61"/>
taken from you. Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> ſatisfy'd himſelf
with the Declaration <hi>your Majeſty</hi> made to that
purpoſe, which ſo quieted the Cardinal's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that he dy'd much more peaceably than
he would have done without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> that very Night, came into
your Cloſet; where you ask'd me, whether the
Cardinal had not hid ſome Effects, and the Place
where I thought they might be: I told <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> all I knew, and you ſeis'd upon what
was of great value; but yet left a great deal to
his Niece <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> whom he made his Heir,
upon Condition, that her Husband ſhould bear
the Name and Arms of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which gave
great diſtaſt to all the Princes of the Blood;
but <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who was alway very kind to
him, continued it after his Death; for you
would let no body touch any thing of that which
he left to his Niece.</p>
               <p>All <hi>France,</hi> now fix'd their Eyes upon <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> to obſerve how you would behave
your ſelf, being, upon the Cardinal's Death,
left to your own Conduct: For tho' by what you
had done before, it appear'd by a thouſand
Things, you wou'd one Day be a Great King;
yet the ill Education you had had, with your
having been alway, if I may ſo ſay, under the
Ferule of that Miniſter, made People doubt,
whether you had been guided by your own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
or by his Dictates. Beſide, as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity
of our Nation, doth not incline us to
have any great eſteem for that which looks Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Dull; there were a great many who
found fault with your looking ſo Grave and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98314:61"/>
in all your Actions; they could not believe
that a Prince of your Age, could be ſo Wiſe;
eſpecially in a Court where there were ſo many
weak Heads, who without making the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,
ſaid all that they thought.</p>
               <p>But I made a contrary Judgment of <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
by the firſt Conference I had the Honour
to have with you; you weigh'd all things ſo well,
that I was perſwaded, the Advantages of a good
natural Diſpoſition, very much prevail over
an ill Education. It was not long e're all your
Subjects were of my Opinion; eſpecially when
they ſaw you knew ſo well how to Act the
King. You obliged them to pay as much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to you, as they had taken Liberty, under
your Miniſter Cardinal <hi>Mazarin;</hi> the juſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
and ſo much to the purpoſe, which you
gave to thoſe Ambaſſadors that reſided in your
Court, begot a great Opinion of your Wiſdom;
ſo that in a little time, Foreigners, as well as the
<hi>French,</hi> were undeceiv'd, in ſome Diſcourſes that
had paſt to your Prejudice. The leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
are enough to make People ſpeak ill of a
Prince upon the Throne; but a Multitude of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and conſiderable Actions full of prudent
Conduct, are requir'd to give him Reputation;
which teacheth Princes, that they ought always
to do Good, when Occaſion requires it. Every
one hath his Eyes upon 'em to give them their
due, according to their Actions, whether Good
or Bad.</p>
               <p>But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had nothing to fear upon
that Account: I can bear Witneſs to Poſterity,
that you did an Action, worthy of immortal
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98314:62"/>
Glory. As I have already ſaid, you were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
among Women, and you fell in Love
with the Eldeſt of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s four
Nieces, then at Court; you lov'd her ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
that they, who had not the Honour to
know you, believ'd your Paſſion would make you
forget your Duty to your ſelf. This Niece,
fomented your Paſſion cunningly enough; and
every day, more and more to enflame you, us'd
thoſe Arts, which crafty Women practiſe, who
are proud of their Conqueſts. But <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
inſtead of running into the Snares ſhe laid for
you, conſented ſhe ſhould be Marry'd; and ſaw
her part, notwithſtanding all her tender Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and tho' your own Heart told you, you
were cruel to your ſelf, in reſolving not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
(in the Condition you then were,) the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all the Pleaſures of this Life.</p>
               <p>This Victory over your ſelf, was follow'd by
another relating to the ſame Perſon: The Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
which ſhe had taſted at Court, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
alſo, the Remembrance of <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
which ſhe could not blot out of her Mind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made her not live ſo very well with
her Husband, ſhe quickly return'd into <hi>France.</hi>
Many believ'd, that ſhe had great Hopes, that
the Fire which had been ſo quick and ardent,
would be eaſily rekindled: She was therefore
returning to Court, with full Sailes; but <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> having Notice of it, ſent a Courrier to
tell her, ſhe muſt retire into a Monaſtery. I
know very well, Sir, I have antedated the time
when this paſt; and to do things in order, I
ſhould not have ſpoken of this, in this Place;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98314:62"/>
but the connexion which is between this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
and the other I have mention'd,
would not ſuffer me any longer to forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; I do not undertake to write your Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in due Method therefore this Tranſpoſition
may be pardon'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> having no confidence in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
and unquiet Humour of the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> and fearing he might enter into
Cabals, which might be to your prejudice;
you deſign'd to Marry his Nephew, Prince
<hi>Charles,</hi> who was right Heir to the Dukedom of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> to ſome Perſon in <hi>France:</hi> His
Father, who ſtay'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> was raviſh'd
that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had ſo good Intentions for his
Son, whoſe Uncle, without you, could never
be brought to do him right. He propos'd to you
his Son's Marrying Mademoiſelle <hi>Montpenſier,</hi>
and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> conſented to it, becauſe it was
indifferent to you, what Lady he choſe, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he put it out of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to do you any miſchief. Mademoiſelle, who
had willingly hearkend to the Propoſal that had
been made her of the Duke <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> who
was then but a Boy; was much more pleas'd
with this of a Handſom Prince, and of an Age
more ſuitable to hers. She grew ſo much in
Love with him, that ſhe became jealous of her
Siſter, whom the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could have
better lik'd, had ſhe not been deſign'd by <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> for another; you had indeed promis'd
her to the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> eldeſt Son to the
Duke of <hi>Florence;</hi> who not long after Marryed
her. She, and the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> tho' both
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98314:63"/>
knew they were not born for one another, could
not refrain from being often together; and the
Prince, growing daily more and more enamour'd
of her, gave her a Picture which he had from
Mademoiſelle <hi>Montpenſier.</hi> The Vanity which
all Women have to boaſt of their Conqueſts,
eſpecially when they think they can vex a Rival,
made her diſcover what the Prince had given
her, tho' it concern'd her very much, to have
kept the thing ſecret. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> did not
like it, and ſhe being to go ſo ſpeedily into <hi>Italy</hi>
to be married, it was not fit her Husband ſhould
ſuſpect her guilty of any amorous Intriegue;
but all thoſe Reflections did not hinder her
from making this falſe ſtep. So true is it, that
Youth, Prudence, and Love, very ſeldom keep
Company. Mademoiſelle <hi>Montpenſier</hi> no ſooner
knew this, but ſhe broke with Prince <hi>Charles;</hi>
his Father, who was extreamly troubled that
his Son ſhould miſs in all reſpects ſo conſiderable
a Match, did what he could to bring the Buſineſs
about again; but Mademoiſelle, whoſe high
Spirit, was anſwerable to the greatneſs of her
Birth, deſpis'd all the Promiſes which were made
to appeaſe her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would not force her, tho' you thought
this Marriage neceſſary for the good of your
State. In the mean time, Prince <hi>Charles</hi> having
loſt ſo good a Fortune by his own Fault; ſome
body propos'd to him the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
newly become a Widow, and who was
very Rich: Were it that the Prince could not
forget the Dutcheſs of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> or that the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
had ſome Defects, he did ſo little reliſh the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98314:63"/>
Propoſition, that he could not make one Step
towards her.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who could not part
with his Dukedom, was much troubled, that
his Nephew ſhould marry Mademoiſelle <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier;</hi>
tho' it appear'd 'twas a thing to which
he had given his conſent: But knowing his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Nemours,</hi> he preſs'd him
to marry her, purpoſely to clear himſelf from
the Suſpicion <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had, of his playing a
Thouſand Tricks to hinder the other Match
with Madam <hi>Montpenſier:</hi> But the more Pains
he took to bring him to it, the further was
Prince <hi>Charles</hi> from it; yet he felt in himſelf an
Inclination for Mademoiſelle <hi>Nemours</hi> the
Dutcheſs's deceas'd Husband's Niece, who had
ſomewhat more than her Aunt to engage the
Prince; ſo that at laſt he became ſo entirely
hers, that he quite forgot the Dutcheſs of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany.
Your Majeſty,</hi> being told of it by
the Prince's Father, who at firſt did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of this Match, becauſe he valued Wealth
more than Beauty; <hi>your Majeſty</hi> made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to it, and there was no Qeſtion of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> do the ſame: But the
little diſpoſition he had to give him his Eſtate,
made him make a thouſand Excuſes; which <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> finding very frivolous, and without any
Foundation, you told the Duke, if he did not
take a Reſolution conformable to your Will, and
to Reaſon; the thing ſhould be done, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
him any further. This Declaration was
like a Clap of Thunder to him, and believing it
was impoſſible to prevail with <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98314:64"/>
altar your Reſolution; he offer'd to declare
you Heir to all his Dominions, if you would
grant him the Honour of your Protection againſt
his Nephew.</p>
               <p>His Deſign in making this Propoſition was to
deceive <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and having cunningly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated,
that his Nephews Right and Title to the
Dukedoms of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> was not ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſtabliſh'd, but that he could diſpute it with
him; and quoting ſome Precedents, to prove
the <hi>Salique-Law</hi> was ſtill in force in his two
Dutchies; <hi>your Majeſty</hi> treated with him, and
left the Proſecution of the Marriage with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle
<hi>Nemours,</hi> which wanted nothing but
Conſummation, all the Ceremonies having been
perform'd by <hi>Proxy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how Intereſt ſometimes works upon great
Souls, as well as upon thoſe of meaner Quality;
which yet is not ſo pardonable in them, becauſe
they ought to have more care of their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than of their Fortune, which is already
great enough, not to purchaſe new Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with the loſs of their Honour. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
of Things dubious, let juſtice ſtill
carry the Cauſe, and let no man think to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Title by force, which cannot ſupport it
ſelf. That of which I am now ſpeaking, was
of this Nature, and it were to be wiſh'd, <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> had ſeriouſly conſider'd it: You would
then have ſeen, that this was only a Bait thrown
out, the better to deceive you, and alſo that
this Treaty contain'd ſome things in it, which
render'd the Execution of it impoſſible, as I ſhall
hereafter plainly ſhew <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98314:64"/>
This Buſineſs, of which I have ſpoken all in a
Breath, becauſe I was ingag'd in it, by mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Deſign to marry Mademoiſelle
<hi>Montpenſier</hi> to Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> ought not (to do
things in order) have been plac'd here; but the
Excuſe I made before, muſt ſerve me again,
without making any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> having declar'd in all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
I had with you, the great Deſire you
had to do ſomething effectually toward the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of your Kingdom; call'd for thoſe
Memoirs that had been drawn up in Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi>'s time concerning it: The ſuddain
Death of that Miniſter having prevented the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it himſelf: You found, in thoſe Papers,
many things, againſt which you had reaſon to
object; becauſe the time which had paſt ſince
that Cardinal's Death, had chang'd the State of
Affairs; and that which was good under his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
was not ſo now: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> made
choice of the Good, and left the Bad; wherein
you ſhew'd ſo much Judgment, that I can never
enough commend you.</p>
               <p>You reſolv'd to make the<note n="*" place="margin">Farmers of the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</note> 
                  <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans</hi>
render again what they had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd;
for, abuſing your Minority,
they had fill'd their own Coffers, by
emptying yours. You intended to begin with
their Maſter, who was, as you thought, moſt
faulty; I mean the Superintendant of the <hi>Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
whoſe Abuſes I had diſcover'd to <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
and who was himſelf ſo conſcious, that to
avoid the Puniſhment he deſerv'd, he thought
of ſaving himſelf by a greater Crime. To that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98314:65"/>
purpoſe, he had bought <hi>Belle Iſle</hi> of the Family
of <hi>de Rets,</hi> where he intended to ſtand upon his
Guard againſt <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> having by Penſions,
made ſeveral Governours of Provinces, and
Frontier Places, of his Party; of which a Draught
was found amongſt his Papers, when he was ſeiz'd;
ſo that if Juſtice had been done upon him, he
ſhould have been brought to a Scaffold.</p>
               <p>The Place which he had in Parliament, made
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> think it dangerous to proſecute
him, till he had quitted it. You perſwaded him
to part with it, under pretence, that all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of State, being ſince the Death of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
in his Hands, his Place in Parliament
would be now of little worth to him. <hi>Fouquet</hi> ran
into the Trap, and having ſold his Place to one
of his Friends, you went into <hi>Britany,</hi> and there
had him arreſted. At the ſame time you ſeiz'd
upon <hi>Belle Iſle:</hi> The thing was executed in the ſame
manner your projected it, and having appointed
Commiſſioners to try him, you caus'd him to be
proſecuted.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Tellier</hi> was his capital Enemy; but
his trimming Politicks would not let him act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. He begun to be jealous of <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's</hi>
ſhewing me ſo much Favour, and as he
would not have been diſpleas'd if you had not
put ſo much confidence in my Services; ſo he
would, if he could, have made the Proſecution
of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> paſs for Injuſtice. See how
they, who deſire to paſs for Wiſe Men in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
yet cannot diſſemble, when they think
their own Intereſt is at ſtake; ſo that to judge
of Things rightly, a Man muſt not do it raſhly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98314:65"/>
by appearances: A Prudent Man ought to ſtay
till ſuch Accidents happen, as uſe to move Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Paſſions; for 'tis then we are to make a
Judgment of Mens Wiſdom, and not where that
which paſſeth doth not concern 'em; for then
'tis no wonder if they appear inſenſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> erected a Court of Juſtice, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how the Farmers of your Revenue had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
themſelves; which drew upon me the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
hatred, becauſe the number of thoſe who
had robb'd <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> was ſo great, that half
<hi>Paris</hi> was concern'd in it, either by themſelves, or
by their Friends and Relations. Indeed, the
prodigious Wealth of thoſe Blood-ſuckers of your
People, was ſo great, that they were ally'd to
moſt of the Conſiderable Military, or Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
They had alſo brought the Sale of all Places
to ſo exceſſive a Price, that no body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were able to buy: <hi>Fieubet</hi> offer'd for the
Attorney-General's Place, ſixteen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Francks.</hi> That of a Chief Judge, was not leſs
worth. That of a Maſter of Requeſts, was valued
at a Hundred and ten thouſand Crowns. A ſimple
Councellor of Parliament's Place, at two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and I know not how many thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>I very plainly foreſaw what effect this would
have againſt me; and that it would be ſaid alſo,
there was no Faith in <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who after
People had ſerv'd you with their Purſes, you
paid your Debts with exceſſive Taxes, and
ſent ſuch People to Hoſpitals, who before had
liv'd as handſomly as any in <hi>Paris;</hi> tho' the
baſeneſs of their Original, was an infallible Proof
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98314:66"/>
that they had gotten their Wealth by Rapine;
and conſequently, there was no Injuſtice in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them to diſgorge it: But there was a great
deal of difference between what was done du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your Minority, and what you did your
ſelf: The one requires, that a Prince ſhould
make good his Word, otherwiſe he would find
none to ſerve him in his neceſſity, whence would
happen greater Inconveniences, than any humane
Prudence would be able to remedy: So that a
Prince would be very ill advis'd, who ſhould by
his ill Conduct deprive himſelf of that Aſſiſtance,
which ſooner or later he ſhall be ſure to want:
For tho' he may Reign but a little time, yet
thoſe Things may fall out, wich he could not
foreſee, let his Management be never ſo frugal:
They may ſometimes be of ſuch conſequence,
that the funds which he hath provided, are not
ſufficient to help him. There ought to be no
greater a Proviſion of Ready Money, than what
is proportion'd to the running Caſh of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
otherwiſe, a Prince would bring his own
Revenue to nothing, by rendring his People una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to aſſiſt him with their Purſes, the Prince
himſelf having all the ready Money in his own
Hands.</p>
               <p>A Conſequence ſo dangerous obligeth a Prince
to keep his Word; but yet he ought not to let
his Farmers get ſo exceſſively, as to ruine his
People and himſelf too: for 'tis manifeſt, if he
doth not manage his Affairs like a good Father
of a Family, he will be oblig'd to lay Tax upon
Tax. The Farmers on their ſide, muſt not
think to grow vaſtly Rich in a ſhort time: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98314:66"/>
then it will be no Injuſtice to Fleece 'em,
whereas, when their Gain is moderate, they
are ſuffer'd to enjoy the Fruit of their Labour.</p>
               <p>After theſe Remarks, I return to what I juſt
touch'd upon before, when I ſaid, there was
great difference, between what a Prince doth
himſelf, and that which during his Minority is
done by his Miniſter; for if his Miniſter hath
miſmanag'd, and not taken care of his Affairs,
he is not bound to approve of thoſe Faults he
committed; for a Prince ought not to be in a
worſe Condition than a Private Man, who can
help himſelf againſt that which his Guardian
hath done prejudicial to his Intereſt. Beſide,
the People having uſually an irreconcilable Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt thoſe that Farm the publick Revenue,
'tis a Pleaſure to them to ſee 'em loſe ſome of
their Greaſe: To this I add, that the time of a
Prince's Minority being commonly troubleſom,
and his Coffers charged with a great many Debts;
he cannot take an eaſier courſe to pay them, or
that which will make leſs noiſe; becauſe it
toucheth none but ſome particular Perſons, and
the generality is ſo far from being diſcontended,
that they rejoice at it; becauſe they had rather
the Prince ſhould have their Subſtance, than thoſe
wretches, who in Fattening themſelves with it,
often do the People a thouſand Injuries.</p>
               <p>By this way of proſecuting the <hi>Partiſans, your
Majeſty</hi> paid a vaſt number of Debts; and in
the mean time, God bleſſed your Marriage with
a Son, who inherits his Father's Vertues, <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> hath taken ſuch care of his Education,
that joyn'd with his natural diſpoſition, it muſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98314:67"/>
be a wonder if he prove a Prince leſs perfect than
your ſelf.</p>
               <p>About this time, you marry'd Monſieur your
Brother, to a Princeſs of <hi>England;</hi> he took the
Title of Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> after the Death of
Monſieur your Uncle, who left no Male Iſſue.
This Allyance maintain'd a good Correſpondence
between <hi>your Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who after
the Death of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> in the Year 1658. found
his Son <hi>Richard</hi> ſo unfit to ſucceed him, that
they ſet their Lawful King again upon the
Throne. About that time fell out an Accident
in that Country, which had like to have ingag'd
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> in a new War: Your Ambaſſador
having ſent his Coaches to meet the <hi>Sweediſh</hi>
Embaſſador, who was to make his Publick Entry,
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador, that his Coach might go
before yours, hir'd Men to cut the Traces of your
Embaſſador's Coach, ſo that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had
what he deſir'd: But his Triumph laſted not long;
for <hi>your Majeſty</hi> being juſtly incens'd againſt
what he had done, demanded Satisfaction of the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſeem'd a while Deaf before
he would yield to what you requir'd: But <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> having commanded your Embaſſador at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> to tell the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> unleſs he
gave you the Satisfaction you expected, there
muſt be a Rupture between the two Crowns.
The fear the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
Arms, made him not only diſclaim what his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
had done; but alſo declare it was not
his Intention to diſpute precedency with <hi>your
Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:98314:67"/>
This Declaration was made by the Marqueſs <hi>de
la Fuentes,</hi> his Catholick Majeſty's Miniſter, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in your Court, in Preſence of other Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
and Miniſters who were alſo there; and
their Maſters were by them certify'd, this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was ended to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Satisfaction.
After this, you ſuppreſt the Place of Collonel-General
of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, vacant by the
Death of the Duke <hi>d' Epernon,</hi> who had carry'd
the Authority of this Place ſo high, that he
ſeem'd to have almoſt a mind to conteſt it with
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> pretending to diſpoſe of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in the Infantry, without excepting ſo
much as the Companies of your Guards; which
was of ſuch Conſequence, that it might have
been the Cauſe of many Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>You made many excellent Regulations among
the Souldiery; ſo that they became ſubject to
Diſcipline, which before they were not; for ſuch
Diſorder reign'd among 'em, that there was as
many Maſters as Captains; eſpecially in the old
Corps, where they were ſo far from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Authority of Collonels, that they
would hardly ſubmit to that of a General. You
likewiſe poſitively Commanded that all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſhould have what they wanted; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before they went almoſt naked, and in the
ſame Company one was Cloath'd in Grey, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Blue, Red, or any other Colour; you
Order'd they ſhould have Shoes and Stockings,
and that every Companies Cloaths ſhould be all of
one Colour. This other Princes lik'd ſo well,
and thought ſo neceſſary, that they have all ſince
follow'd your Example; and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> may
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98314:68"/>
boaſt, that all the Souldiers in <hi>Europe,</hi> owe to
you the Conveniences they now enjoy.</p>
               <p>But you have not done any thing ſo much to
their Advantage, as the taking away from their
Captains the Power of trying them for their
Crimes; becauſe the impunity which they hop'd
for, encourag'd them to commit many Diſorders.
Certainly, there is nothing more unjuſt, than to
leave the Puniſhment of an Offence, to them
whoſe Intereſt it is to ſave the Offender: and
'tis well known, that a Captain, who muſt give
money for a Souldier, in the room of one that is
Caſhier'd or Hang'd, is ſeldom ſo great a Lover
of Juſtice, as to buy it at his own Coſt.</p>
               <p>This Reformation among your <hi>Partiſans</hi> and
Souldiers, preceded all others; becauſe you
look'd upon it, to be the Foundation of all ſure
and ſolid Government; rationally concluding,
that when you were Powerful in both, all the
reſt, without meeting with any difficuly, would
do well of it ſelf. For certainly, a Prince that hath
Money and a good Army, is not only ſure of his
own Peoples Reſpect, but of his Neighbours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
'Tis that which gives him Reputation, and
without which a Kingdom cannot Flouriſh. So
likewiſe a Prince who takes care of his Affairs,
will make it his chief Buſineſs to gain Reputation;
wherein he will find more Advantage, than in
making himſelf fear'd by unjuſt Enterprizes, tho'
they ſhould meet with Succeſs: For the one draws
upon him the Enmity of all other Princes,
when the other procures him their Reſpect and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem:
When a Kingdom hath many Enemies,
it ſooner or later receives ſome deadly Blow, all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98314:68"/>
ſtriving againſt it: Whereas, when its Power is
founded upon Right and Reaſon, it hath always
faithful Allyes, who will never fail to aſſiſt it in
time of need. A Prince therefore, who is well
advis'd, ought not to undertake any War that is
unjuſt; for if nothing but Ambition puts Arms
into his Hands, his old Friends preſently become
his Enemies; for which they are not to be blam'd,
ſince their ſafety is no greater than others. Yet
this Truth, as Evident as it is, and from which
Princes ſhould never depart, is not always the
rule of their Actions: A corrupt Miniſter often
endeavours to inſinuate other Maxims, and inſtead
of taking good Heed, they miſtake the Shadow
for the Subſtance: I am troubled that this may be
ſaid of <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> but becauſe you are to fear
Flatterers more than declared Enemies, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to be none of the firſt Number; but will in
due time make it appear, that Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi>
abuſing the Credit he hath with you, hath advis'd
you to do that which is directly contrary to your
Intereſt, and hath ſtirr'd up a world of Enemies
againſt you: For tho' the proſperous Condition
wherein you now are, keeps them yet ſilent;
nevertheleſs, to make good what I have ſaid,
there needs no other Proof, than the Anſwer which
the Baron <hi>Delval</hi> made to your Miniſter Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur
<hi>Louvoy,</hi> when ſhewing him the <hi>Arſenal</hi> at
<hi>Douay;</hi> he ſaid, if ever <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had a
War, this would make a brave Noiſe. I believe
it anſwer'd the Baron, and I am ſure, ſuch a
Noiſe, as will awaken all <hi>Europe.</hi> I think there
is no need of explaining this Anſwer to <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> it ſufficiently expounds it ſelf; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98314:69"/>
could more ingeniouſly reproach <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
for the many Enemies your Miniſter hath
rais'd againſt you. I know his Enterprizes have
been proſperous, which keeps him ſtill in your
Favour; but upon ſerious Reflection, <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
will find, it had been a thouſand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for you, you had never been ſo Powerful,
and that you had been much happier had you
been quiet: For now your Mind muſt be ſtill ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with the Intriegues, which you know are
daily hatching againſt you in Princes Courts,
heretofore full of Affection toward you; but as
things now ſtand, inſtead of concurring with
you for your Safety, there is not one but is now
to be ſuſpected by you.</p>
               <p>If <hi>your Majeſty</hi> be not ſenſible enough of theſe
Truths, that you may be fully convinc'd of 'em,
I beſeech you to call to Mind that which happen'd
in the Year 1662. and compare it with what
hath paſt ſince; and you may thereby judge,
what Power, Juſtice ſupported by a good
Reputation, had over thoſe, who were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
to bow: And I believe, if the like
ſhould fall out now, Satisfaction would not be ſo
ſpeedily given you; the hope of being aſſiſted
by your Enemies, would encourage People to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
and oppoſe you, and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would
be oblig'd by actual Arms, to obtain that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
which in thoſe Days coſt you but a
Threat to make uſe of 'em. I might likewiſe
mention what happen'd to your Embaſſador at
<hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the Corſes of the Pope's Guard
ſhew'd ſo little Reſpect, that to Revenge ſome
of their Comrades, who had been ill treated
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98314:69"/>
by your Embaſſador's People, they affronted him
in his very Palace. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Crequi</hi> his
Wife, was likewiſe in danger of her Life; for
in her Return out of the Countrey to the City,
they ſhot at her, as they had at her Husband, ſo
that ſhe had a Page kill'd, and ſome of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
wounded: The Tumult, at laſt grew ſo
great, that they both left <hi>Rome,</hi> and went to
St. <hi>Quirico;</hi> of which, when <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had
notice, you ſent your Complaint to the Pope,
who, encourag'd by ſome Cardinals that were no
Friends to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> ſeem'd to approve what
the Corſes had done; but you firmly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
reſolving to have Reparation for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
Ambition having no part in the Quarrel;
the Pope's Quality did not hinder you from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Satisfaction; and tho' his Holineſs did
not think you would have puſh'd things on ſo
far, yet becauſe you demanded nothing but
what was juſt, it was agree'd, that the Corſes,
who always us'd to guard the Pope, ſhould not
only be caſhier'd, but a Pyramid ſhould be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereon ſhould be inſcrib'd in golden Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
what Satisfaction had been given you: His
Holineſs alſo conſented, that Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi>
ſhould come into <hi>France,</hi> and pray <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
to accept this Reparation, and to forget what
had paſt.</p>
               <p>Behold an Effect and Proof of what I have
been ſaying; and as I have already obſerv'd, I
very much doubt, ſhould the like happen now,
whether <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would meet with the like
Satisfaction. I have already given you Reaſons
for it, to which I will only add, that Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98314:70"/>
is as neceſſary for a Prince among his own
Subjects, as his Neighbours; for Power is not
founded upon Force and Injuſtice; his Subjects
may Fear him, but they will never Love him,
and by Fear without Love, he will never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
his Ends: The one without the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
does more Harm than Good; Fear conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
no longer, than People ſee the Prince
in a Condition, to make all bow and ſubmit to
his Pleaſure; but as ſoon as his Fortune changes,
they preſently deſpiſe him. On the contrary,
tho' Fortune changes, Love doth not; and the
more unfortunate a Prince is, the greater Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are us'd to reſtore him to the Proſperity
he hath loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> who ſo Gloriouſly ſupported
your Intereſt in Foreign Countries, did that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Frontier, which was of very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to you; you bought the Town of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for Two Millions and Two
Hundred Thouſand Livers, which you gave for
it, and thereby ſafe-guarded your Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Treaty which you made with the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſo much diſpleas'd his Nephew, that
leaving a Ball, where he danc'd with <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> he got out of the Kingdom, and went
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he thought the Pope would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe
his Intereſt. But his Holineſs deſiring to
be excus'd, he went to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
gave him a Retreat; at which you were
not troubled, becauſe you had nothing to do
with him to make good your Title. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
his Preſence was neceſſary to the Treaty,
becauſe of the expreſs Terms in it, that it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98314:70"/>
ſhould be ratify'd by him, and all the Princes of
the Family. You went to the Parliament to
have it regiſter'd; but <hi>your Majeſty</hi> fearing you
might meet with oppoſition, becauſe there was
a Clauſe in the Treaty that all of the Family
were to be acknowledged Princes of the Blood,
and capable of ſucceeding to the Crown, in caſe
the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> ſhould come to fail, you
went thither with your Regiment of Guards,
which conſiſted of Three Thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>The Reſpect which was paid to your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
was the Reaſon why <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was not
told that this Treaty wanted other Solemnities
to make it valid; for it was not the Parliament's
Buſineſs to examine it, but the States of the
Kingdom, to whom it belong'd to chuſe a Maſter
when they had none: And it was this Clauſe I
meant, when I ſaid it was an invincible Obſtacle
to your Deſigns. For beſide this Difficulty,
there were many others, among which the moſt
conſiderable was, that which concern'd other
Foreign Princes, now naturaliz'd and ſetled in
your Kingdom, who would receive Wrong by
it; paticulatly the Houſe of <hi>Longueville,</hi> which
pretends the States of the Kingdom heretofore
declar'd, that for a Reward of the Services done
by the Count <hi>de Dunois</hi> to the Crown, it ſhould
belong to that Family, whenever the Throne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Vacant. The Dukes and Peers, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would not give Place to any of theſe <hi>Lorrain</hi>
Princes, were alſo a great Obſtacle to this Affair.
Nevertheleſs, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> flattering your ſelf,
that you ſhould effect this Buſineſs by your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
preſs'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> according to this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98314:71"/>
Treaty, to put into your Hands the Town of
<hi>Marſall;</hi> and becauſe he doubted what Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
take, you threatned by Force of Arms
to make him do it. But notwithſtanding all your
Threats, he continued irreſolute, and you went
towards <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with ſo great a number of
your Nobility, that never were ſo many ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at one time: You found the ſecret of
making People pay that Reſpect which was due
to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> by the Favours you ſo ſeaſonably
beſtow'd, and which engag'd a great Number of
Gentlemen to wait on you, who in the time of
your Minority, would not have taken the Pains
to have gone out of their Doors. Your Court ſhin'd
brighter than ever it had done, and the more,
for the many Blue Ribbands you made, which
were no little Ornament about your Perſon.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, you alſo created a great many
Dukes and Peers, wherein you ſhew'd a great
deal of Policy; for moſt of the Grandees, who
had no mind to this Dignity, kept cloſe to <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> to avoid the like Reward.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who at his Return
thought to find you the ſame you were in Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s time, was much ſurpriz'd to ſee
you ſo different from what he thought you. He
look'd ſo little in <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Preſence, and
you took ſo little notice of him, that ſcarce any
body would believe when they ſaw him, this was
the Famous Rebel that had been ſo much talkt of.
But you took Pleaſure to mortifie him at his firſt
coming, to make him leave his Proud Humour,
of expecting to be every where Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98314:71"/>
If you made the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> tremble,
I need not ſay his Example taught others not to
depart from that Duty, which by their Birth
they were oblig'd to pay <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> All Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
appear'd in your Preſence with a Reſpect
that added Luſtre to your Royalty; and gave it
quite another Figure than it had in the time of
which I have already ſpoken. The Deſire every
one had to pleaſe you, made People apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to that which before they ſcorn'd to do.
All the young Gentlemen of good Families, liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves either in your Company of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers,
which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had again ſet on
foot, or in your Regiment of Guards; and ſeeing
you took delight in all that look'd like War,
which your greateſt Enemies cannot deny, you
ſpent a great part of your time in diſciplining
this Company; ſo that If I may make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
which perhaps ſome will not like, I
will preſume to ſay, never did any <hi>Spaniſh Jennet</hi>
better perform the Exerciſes of Manage under a
skilful Rider, than this Company did every
thing that was commanded by <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this I can yet ſay more, which others
obſerv'd as well as my ſelf, and by which a Man
might judge, what you one Day would be able
to do; ſeeing you did it in your Youth. What
could thoſe Seven or Eight Hours together ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſtay'd in the Court of the
<hi>Louvre</hi> exerciſing that Company in the depth of
Winter? But the Application wherewith you
would in time to come do your Duty, and that
you would deſpiſe both Heat and Cold, when
you deſign'd to get Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:98314:72"/>
But yet it cannot be ſaid, this was a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
Humour in <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> becauſe you
took the like care of all that concern'd your
Royalty. I have already ſaid, <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
commanded me to bring you Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s
Memoirs; the eſteem you had for the Memory
of that great Man, and your own ſincere Piety,
without Oſtentation, inclin'd you to perfect
what he had ſo happily begun; which was the
extirpation of all the Hereticks in your Kingdom.
But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> knowing that it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to paſs from one Extreme to another, you
have by little and little ſo prepar'd things to
ripen, that in Twenty Years time the Work
may come to Perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> Preſence brought the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> to a fix'd Reſolution, he having agreed
to the Terms upon which he was to deliver the
Town of <hi>Marſall</hi> to <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> You came
back from <hi>Metz</hi> in ſo little time, that the Poſt
could not make more haſte; you having order'd
the beſt running Horſes in your Stables to be
laid on the Way: Every one took the Liberty
of enquiring why <hi>your Majeſty</hi> made ſuch Haſte,
and as there are always ſome that gueſs right,
what you intended to keep ſecret, was preſently
talk'd of all the Town over. Which ought to
teach Princes not to undertake any thing which
they would not have People know. For they
cannot with all their Power keep Mens Curioſity
from prying narrowly into all their Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> being pleas'd with my Services,
I took the Liberty to lay before you all that
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had deſign'd for the Glory of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98314:72"/>
your Realm. There was nothing of ſo great
importance in his Papers, as Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but neither could be maintain'd without
making your ſelf ſtrong at Sea, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Work: To me you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the care of this, as well as of your
Buildings, wherein there were great Diſorders;
I acquitted my ſelf in both to the beſt of my
Power. In the mean time <hi>your Majeſty</hi> having
thought ſit to attempt ſomething on the Coaſt of
<hi>Gigeri,</hi> the Succeſs whereof promis'd great
Advantage to the Trade of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and to
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Reputation in that Country; you
caus'd ſome Troops to paſs into <hi>Provence,</hi> where
Veſſels lay ready to receive 'em. They were
ſafely Tranſported, and Landed almoſt without
any Oppoſition made by the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> But the
chief Commanders, on whom you rely'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken ill Meaſures, the Buſineſs miſcarry'd,
tho' well deſign'd, and better digeſted: For 'tis
not enough for a thing to be ſo well order'd in
Council, as that none can object againſt it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be likewiſe well executed. So that a
Prince cannot take too much care, to make a
good choice of thoſe he employs, ſeeing his
Reputation depends upon it; eſpecially when
his Enterpriſes lie ſo far off, that he is not able
to remedy the Faults that are there committed.</p>
               <p>Some would make me believe, that Monſieur
<hi>Tellier</hi> was not well pleas'd with that free acceſs
I had to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Perſon, nor with my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truſted with what concern'd the War: He
would have had <hi>your Majeſty</hi> chuſe more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
Officers, in whoſe Hands the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>neſs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98314:73"/>
would have proſper'd better; but tho' I have
heard ſuch Reports, I will do him right, and I
had rather attribute that which happen'd at <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geri</hi>
to Fate, which ſometimes ruines the beſt
laid Deſigns; rather than wrong Monſieur <hi>Telli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>'s
Reputation. To make that Misfortune yet
greater, the Veſſel upon which the Chief Officers
of the Regiment were embarqu'd, was ſo Leaky
that it ſunk, which extreamly troubled <hi>your
Majeſty.</hi> My Enemies, who muſt be many after
that which I have ſaid, would have imputed the
Misfortune to my Fault, pretending that I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Overſight of the Marine Affairs ought
to have taken care the Veſſel had been good; but
it having been viſited by experienc'd Shipwrights
before it was put to Sea, <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who doth
Right to all the World, was not at all diſpleas'd
with me. The Fault was that the Ship had not
for a long time been in Service, which doth
Veſſels more harm, than if they were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at Sea.</p>
               <p>This ill News, becauſe it came after that
which is better, did not make that impreſſion,
which otherwiſe it might have done upon <hi>your
Majeſty's</hi> Mind. You were pleas'd with the
good News you receiv'd out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where
your Arms had acquir'd you no little Glory, and
where without them the Emperour, who had
already receiv'd a Check, had been totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated:
For when the right Wing of his Army
had been beaten by the <hi>Turks,</hi> which gave
them hopes of an entire Victory, your Troops,
which were in the Left, charg'd ſo bravely, that
they trod down all that oppos'd 'em, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98314:73"/>
by their making a Stand, renew'd the
Fight, they beat the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſhewing ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
and Courage, that the Emperour, inſtead
of returning them Thanks, grew Jealous of
'em; and inſtead of reſolving to improve the
Victory, which had caus'd a great Conſternation
among the <hi>Turks,</hi> he made a precipitate Peace;
as if he had been afraid your Trops would have
taken his Crown from him.</p>
               <p>Theſe two particular Events, of good and bad
Fortune, hinder'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> from mounting
to that high pitch of Glory where you now are.
The excellent Order which you ſetled ev'ry
where throughout your Kingdom, which was
ſtill ſenſible of the Abuſes which in Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Time had crept into it, are an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Proof that you were a great King. You
reform'd the Order of St. <hi>Michel,</hi> which before
that of the St. <hi>Eſprit</hi> was the Reward where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Kings your Predeceſſors honour'd the
greateſt Men in their Kingdom; but was ſo
little eſtem'd after the Inſtitution of the other,
that all Sorts of People were indifferently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
into it; and at laſt became like the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Star, which in time was ſo deſpis'd,
that one of your Predeceſſors, to make it more
Vile and Deſpicable, beſtow'd it upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the City Watch. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolv'd to reform this Abuſe, eſpecially
becauſe the Order of St. <hi>Michel</hi> is joyn'd to that
of the St. <hi>Eſprit,</hi> and that the Knights of this laſt
Order, could not be receiv'd into it, unleſs
they had been before of the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:98314:74"/>
However, I muſt ſay that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did not
ſo throughly purge it of the mean Perſons that
were in it; but that ſome ſtill remain. For it
is the inevitable Misfortune of all Princes, that
when they rely wholly upon others, it would be
a wonder if Favour or Faction ſhould not prevail
againſt Juſtice. Therefore if Princes would
have things done according to their own dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
they ought to overlook thoſe they depute
to ſee their Pleaſure perform'd. For if they
truſt wholly to their Fidelity, 'tis the way to
have their work but half done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> for the good of your Kingdom
Incorporated likewiſe a Company for the Trade
of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and indeed a Kingdom cannot
flouriſh ſo long as that Trade is driven by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
It ſhould be taken out of the hands of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were ſuffer'd by your
Predeceſſors to be the ſole Maſters of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
This Eſtabliſhment very much diſpleas'd
thoſe two Nations, who were ſo jealous of one
another, that after ſome coldneſs they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to quarrel. 'Tis Intereſt that ſets all People
together by the Ears. After ſome flaſhes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
followed Thunder, and after a Breach, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> came to an open War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> offer'd to both your Mediation,
that things might go no further; but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
who pretend to the dominion of the Sea, and to
impoſe Conditions upon all others, ſtood ſo ſtiff
upon their Points, that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought your
ſelf oblig'd to take the part of your Ancient
Friends, againſt the Old Enemies of your Crown.
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> put out a Fleet at Sea in favour of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98314:74"/>
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and equipp'd another at the
ſame time againſt the <hi>Algerines.</hi> The Duke of
<hi>Beaufort,</hi> who commanded it, having receiv'd
your Orders, fought the <hi>Algerines</hi> with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that he beat them twice in three Months;
he took ſeveral of their Ships, among which was
the Admiral: This Advantage wrought a good
Effect among thoſe Barbarous People; who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to leſſen your Reputation, by what
had happen'd at <hi>Gigeri.</hi> But that which increas'd
their Terrour, was your ſetting out new Ships
on the Ocean, and in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which
made all <hi>Europe</hi> think, that in a little time you
would be in a Condition, not only to diſpute the
Empire of the Sea with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but with
any other Nation whatever. Beſide, theſe Ships,
which conſiderably increas'd your Fleet, you had
Magazines full of Stores, Materials and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
you wanted no Seamen or Pilots, ſo that
it was thought you intended to diſpute that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
which belongs only to him that is
ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend to magnifie my ſelf by what
I have ſaid; tho' I have done the beſt I could in
it. To ſpeak the truth, I muſt confeſs this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was not mine, I did but finiſh what Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> firſt began. I know it was he that
put the King your Father upon augmenting his
Power at Sea; or I ſhould rather ſay, to make
himſelf known there: For before him, all his
Predeceſſors, even <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h.</hi> himſelf, had
not one ſingle Ship. But this Project was but
lamely carried on, under the miniſtry of that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98314:75"/>
great Man; ſo that it may be truly ſaid, the
Glory of it was reſerv'd for <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did two things,
very much for the good of your ſelf and People;
and which the deceaſed King your Father at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
in vain. You reduc'd Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and thoſe of the Long Robe, to perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
You did the one under the pretence of
Juſtice; the other by your abſolute Power: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentlemen, by the licentiouſneſs of the times,
had uſurp'd ſo much Authority, that they were
in their Provinces like ſo many petty Tyrants,
and made all tremble under 'em. The Judges
in thoſe Provinces, who were bound by the Duty
of their Places to oppoſe ſuch Innovations,
did not dare to do it, in a time when they fear'd
to be run down. Beſide, they were unwilling to
concern themſelves; for People commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their private Intereſt, before the publick
good. They were afraid to conteſt with thoſe
petty Kings of the Country, ſo that they ſtirr'd
no more, than as if all that paſt had been indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to 'em. But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> who thought
your ſelf oblig'd not to ſuffer ſuch Abuſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
none but you could pretend to Supremacy;
being bound to protect your Subjects, and ſecure
them from Violence; <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> I ſay, not
being any longer able to ſuffer what was dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to your Authority, and ſo contrary to
the Peace of your People, you Eſtabliſht the
<hi>Grands-jours,</hi> that is a certain number of Juſtices
in every Province, where they were to take
Cognizance of thoſe that were guilty of vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Many were Impriſon'd, others ran away,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98314:75"/>
and ſome having been puniſh'd by demoliſhing
their Caſtles, or by the loſs of their Heads, you
got the love of all your People, who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
freed from Slavery by your Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Behold how a wiſe and a judicious King, doth
at one and the ſame time his own and his Subjects
buſineſs. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> did not tell them, that
what you did was as much for your own ſake
as for theirs; but on the contrary, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
they ſhould believe all you aim'd at, was
only to deliver 'em from Oppreſſion. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
as they would have thought you had not
merited much from them, ſo certainly this was
the way to meet with no oppoſition from the
common People; for could the Gentry have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them you had other deſigns, it was to
be fear'd they might have mutually aſſiſted each
other; which perhaps might have given <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> trouble. When a King would leſſen the
Power of his Nobility, he muſt irritate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People againſt them; which is not difficult,
becauſe Noblemen are naturally inclin'd to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer,
'tis eaſy therefore to make the Multitude
Jealous of 'em. Now ſeeing the Nobility can be
ſo eaſily humbled, they ſhould renounce all kind
of Cabals, eſpecially ſuch wherein the People
are engag'd: For the Nobility ought to believe,
they have no Enemy greater than the Common-People,
what Countenance ſoever they carry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
'em: Tho' the People may in appearance
ſhew them Reſpect, yet they are in continual
fear of their Lording it over 'em, from which
they ſtill ſeek to be freed. Undeniable Truth
makes it evident, that their Intereſts are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98314:76"/>
repugnant to one another's, which plainly
proves, that the Nobility cannot hope for any
Advantage, but from a perfect Union with their
Prince; whoſe Intereſt likewiſe 'tis to uſe them
well: They ought alway ſo to agree, that 'tis
not poſſible to divide 'em. The Foundation of
this Union ought to be perfect Obedience on the
Subjects part, and a juſt Retribution on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's;
they ought to do their Duty, and he
muſt do his.</p>
               <p>The other thing which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did for
your own and your Peoples Good, was to take
away the Abuſe crept into the Sale of Places of
Judicature; grown to that heighth I have already
mention'd; which was the Reaſon why thoſe that
had Places were ſo Proud; and why many, made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous
by paying Intereſt for the Money they
borrow'd to buy their Offices, did not ſcruple
the ſelling of Juſtice. This was a nice Buſineſs,
becauſe what Regulation ſoever <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
made, they were, to ſpeak properly, both Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Parties; for they were to regiſter the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict:
But if a Man were to judge what would
be done now, by what had paſs'd heretofore;
there was no likelihood the thing would ſucceed;
becauſe this would be a conſiderable Prejudice
to them, by leſſening the value of their Places;
when ſome Years before they rebell'd only for
retrenching their Wages. But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Parliament, accompanied with Four
Thouſand Men, as ſoon as you preſented to
them the Edict, they not only Regiſter'd it, but
alſo gave <hi>your Majeſty</hi> Thanks for the care you
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98314:76"/>
took to reform the Abuſes which were crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend to perſwade <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
that theſe Thanks were given you willingly;
for I believe they were a little forc'd, and
that the Four Thouſand Men you had with you,
did more contribute to the Parliaments Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
than any eſteem they had for your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
However, this ſerves to let all Princes
know, that there are proper Seaſons to cauſe
their Will and Pleaſure to be obey'd; and that
at other Times 'tis dangerous to require it.
They muſt therefore undertake no more, than
they have Strength to perform; for their being
born Soveraigns, is not enough to enable them to
command abſolutely, they are more than others
ſubject to the Viciſſitude of Times; and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hath as much Power over them, as over
the meaneſt of all their People. A Prince
ought likewiſe to be very Prudent, becauſe the
Failings of a private Man, can at moſt but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
himſelf and his Family; but when a
Prince doth ill, he ſometimes involves his whole
Realm in ſuch fatal Conſequences, as can never
be remedy'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> endeavour'd again to ſtir up
new Troubles in the Church; which oblig'd the
Pope to condemn their Doctrine a Second Time.
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> follow'd his Example, and ſhew'd
the more Circumſpection in this Affair, becauſe
you ſaw the Conſequences of it might be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Some Perſons of the beſt Quality in your
Court, had ſuffer'd themſelves to be ſeduc'd, as
well as ſome Religious Societies, whoſe Heads were
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98314:77"/>
ſo full of it, that you were forc'd to employ your
Royal Authority, to bring 'em again to their
right Senſes. They ſuffer'd very much, before
they could reſolve to acknowledge their Errour;
So true is it, that People are very obſtinate in
Matters of Religion, and there is nothing more
dangerous, than Conteſts about it, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Devotion.</p>
               <p>The Clergy by your Command aſſembled at
<hi>Ponthoiſe,</hi> as well to remedy this Abuſe, as to
take neceſſary Reſolutions concerning other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of great Importance then before 'em. They
were extreamly pleas'd with the Piety where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you enter'd into their Intereſts; which
likewiſe procur'd you the Eſteem of your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
becauſe there is nothing gives a Prince
more, than his rendring to God that which is
his due.</p>
               <p>Many things contributed to celebrate your
Name both at home and abroad. One ſingle
Ship of yours fought with ſo much Reſolution
againſt Thirty Three <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Galleys, that they
left the Veſſel, not being able to take it. The
Succours which you ſent to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> againſt
the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who had attack'd 'em,
kept 'em from receiving an Affront: For tho'
their State in it ſelf was more Powerful than his,
yet after the Peace they made with <hi>Spain,</hi> they took
more care to maintain their Trade, than the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
they had gotten by their Arms; and there
fore they were in a much different and weaker Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than they had formerly been. People are
very much deceiv'd, that think their Strength
conſiſts in Riches; they are indeed needful to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98314:77"/>
make a State Powerful; but 'tis an Army that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s more neceſſary, and without which it cannot
ſubſiſt. A Country ought to have Souldiers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to defend its Frontiers, and likewiſe to
keep its Neighbours in Awe: For if they ſee
a Country ſo weak, that they may without
Fear invade it; 'tis Folly to truſt to their Promiſes
or Treaties. If People will live in Peace, they
muſt take care not to be deſpis'd; the Richer
and more Flouriſhing any People are, the more
jealous they ought to be of their Safety: For
there are ſo many who will envy their Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that ſome of their Neighbours will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to rob 'em of what they have.</p>
               <p>It was about this time, that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to employ Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy,</hi> to whom you
had granted the Reverſion of his Father's Place.
He was ſo rough-hewn, and ſo little inclin'd to
Buſineſs, that Monſieur <hi>Tellier</hi> deſir'd <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
not to trouble your ſelf any more, with
one that was never like to come to Good: He
was ſo given to his Pleaſures, that his Father
look'd upon him as a Son more like to ſpend
the Eſtate he had gotten, than to add any thing
to it by his Induſtry. But <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> having a
very great Kindneſs for Monſieur <hi>Tellier</hi>'s Family,
told him he muſt have a little Patience, what
was not done in One Day, might be effected in
Two; and therefore you did not deſpair but
ſome good might be done with his Son; that Youth
was to be indulg'd and reclaim'd by Kindneſs,
and not by Threats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> took Pains to frame and faſhion
him; and, as it muſt be confeſt, notwithſtanding
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98314:78"/>
what I have already ſaid, and ſhall ſay hereafter,
the Man hath many good Qualities; ſo it
ought to teach us, that time is to be given to
Men, as to Fruits to ripen: Whoever haſtens
things too faſt, rather ſpoils than brings 'em to
Maturity. There are ſome, whoſe Parts advance
ſo ſlowly, that it would turn their Brains to
endeavour to make 'em underſtand any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time; they muſt be brought to it by
Degrees, without uſing the leaſt Violence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
'tis not to be thought Men can be preſently
made fit for buſineſs, eſpecially Youth, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure Pains, and loves nothing but Pleaſure.
Application to Buſineſs comes not till the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be form'd, and 'tis then we inſenſibly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate
our ſelves to it, and afterwards think it
little or no trouble. 'Tis Buſineſs makes Men;
as the common ſaying is, Forging makes a
Smith.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> did not at firſt much love
taking Pains; yet had the ſame Faults, which
thoſe have that grow Proud of their Services,
he grew jealous of all thoſe to whom <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
was pleas'd to ſhew any Kindneſs, more
particularly of me, who had the Honour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
often with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> as ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of your <hi>Finances</hi> and Buildings: For <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> who is great in all Things, did then
build at <hi>Verſailles</hi> and at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> of
which I was to give you an Account every
Week, and ſometimes every Day, becauſe you
often chang'd ſomewhat in your Deſign, which
I was to ſee done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:98314:78"/>
But becauſe Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi>'s Employment
did not require his conferring with <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
ſo often in times of Peace, as when you were
engag'd in an actual War; he did all he could by
the Counſel of his Father, to perſwade <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
to begin a War: he took an Opportunity to
do it upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
much about this time. He told <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
that ſome Provinces in the Low-Countries
were fallen to the Queen your Wife, according
to the Cuſtom of thoſe Places, which made her
Heir to her Brother <hi>Don Balthazar,</hi> who, had he
liv'd, was to have ſucceeded his Father, before
his Catholick Majeſty now Dead.</p>
               <p>This was the Gilded Pill the Marqueſs offer'd
to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and knowing you would not
ſwallow it, unleſs he cover'd the Poiſon it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
with the Shadow and Colour of Juſtice:
He therefore did not ſpeak of it, as a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon the Succeſſion of the King your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law,
which you had ſo ſolemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
by the <hi>Pyronean</hi> Treaty; but he diſguis'd
the Buſineſs under the Name of <hi>Don Balthazar,</hi>
making <hi>your Majeſty</hi> believe it had no relation
at all to your Renunciation. Which was an
Artifice very groſs, for Prince <hi>Balthazar</hi> had no
Right to ſucceed his Father, till his Father was
Dead; nor had the Queen your Wife any Right
to ſucceed Prince <hi>Balthazar,</hi> but what was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imaginary; becauſe he died before his Father.
That Law alſo with which Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi>
kept ſuch a ſtir, in Favour of Daughters ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
before the Children of a Second Bed,
ſignified nothing to the purpoſe: For had Prince
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98314:79"/>
                  <hi>Balthazar</hi> ſurviv'd his Father, you had ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
renounc'd all claim to that whereto the
Queen your Wife could pretend any Right, that
you could have no Colour of Title to it, unleſs
you would declare your ſelf a Perjur'd Perſon to
all the World. But this ſuppos'd Succeſſion to
<hi>Don Balthazar;</hi> your Martial Humour, and the
deſire of perpetuating your Name, put you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what was not ſo much to be blam'd, becauſe
it ſeem'd neceſſary to be done for your Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
before you began a War. You caus'd
the Lawyers to conſult what Title you had to
the Succeſſion which you claim'd in Right of
your Queen: The Perſon you ſent to theſe Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
was Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who was too much
concern'd, to bring any Opinion againſt what he
had maintain'd to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> thoſe Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
therefore, whom the Marqueſs had feed,
maintain'd by long, but very weak Arguments,
that <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Renunciation was abſolutely
null, and not at all binding; becauſe it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the conſtitutions of your Kingdom; which
are, that the King may make void what he hath
done, and relieve himſelf againſt it, as if it had been
done in perfect Minority. They chiefly inſiſted
upon the pretended Prejudice they ſaid you had
done to the Dauphin your Son, by the Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;
and enlarg'd themſelves upon this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument, that neither Divine or Humane
Laws did permit, any Fathers to diſpoſe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own Fancy) of their Sons Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
concluding, that this alone nullified all that
you had done, and conſequently you had Reaſon to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98314:79"/>
purſue your own and your Son's Right by force
of Arms.</p>
               <p>But there were many things to be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all this. The firſt was, That it would be
dangerous to ſet the Crown upon ſuch a Foot,
that there could be no ſecurity in treating or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
with it: For if 'tis ſufficient to ſay <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> is always a Minor, what Truſt or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
can any body put in your Promiſes? Or
when a War is once begun, what way can be
found to end it? This Argument is ſo full of
Reaſon, and may be carried ſo high, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all thoſe who maintain ſuch pernicious
Maxims. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> is too knowing, to want
any Inſtruction in a Matter ſo clear and indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
I will not therefore trouble you with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but ſhew that they by whom you are ſo ill
advis'd, give juſt Occaſion to the whole World,
to accuſe you of intolerable Ambition; which is
ſo ill a Character, that it turns your ancient
Friends into Enemies, and indiſpenſibly ſtirs up
all Princes againſt you: For who can ever think
himſelf ſecure againſt your Injuſtice? Or who
will truſt a Prince, whoſe Word is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in Peace or War? People are not ſafe in
either; in the one, they are in perpetual Diſtruſt,
and in the other in continual Perplexity, not
knowing what to fear.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were tranſacting, the
Queen your Mother dyed; who, had ſhe liv'd,
would have been very much troubled, to ſee a
Peace broken, upon which ſhe had ſet her Heart.
You oblig'd the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> to make Peace
with the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> but you found it more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98314:80"/>
to bring the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> tho one would have
thought by the Mortifications you had given him,
he would have been more flexible.</p>
               <p>This Duke, who was a Riddle to all Mankind,
came after the Buſineſs of <hi>Marſall</hi> to <hi>Paris;</hi> where
he ſeem'd to have ſo little Sence of the ill condition
of his Affairs, that he would have marry'd a mean
Citizen's Daughter, that was one of Mademoiſelle
<hi>Montpenſier</hi>'s Domeſtick Servants; and the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was ſo far advanc'd, as to come to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Marriage: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted,
by his Friends, to interpoſe your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Authority to hinder the Match.</p>
               <p>The Duke's Relations had again recourſe to
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> in another Buſineſs of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but ſomewhat leſs Shameful; becauſe the
Woman he courted was the Daughter of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> being extremely angry,
that the Duke would ſo diſhonour himſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Maid's Father not to ſuffer his
Daughter to marry him. The Duke at laſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> would not let him marry ſo
Diſhonourably in your Dominons, went to ſeek
a Miſtreſs in his own; where he marry'd the
Daughter of Count <hi>Appremont;</hi> ſhe was hardly
Thirteen Years of Age, and he above Threeſcore.</p>
               <p>Having gratify'd his Love, his next Buſineſs
was to ſatisfie his Ambition, which would not
ſuffer him to live quiet a Moment. He begun
to make Levies, under pretence that the Elector
<hi>Palatin</hi> committed hoſtilities upon his Frontiers.
<hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> by your Authority, appeaſing that
Diſorder, he had no other Pretence to continue in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98314:80"/>
Arms; yet his Falſhood ſtill readily furniſh'd him
with another; as oft as <hi>your Majeſty</hi> gave him
Reaſons, why he ought to prefer your Frienſhip
before all other Conſiderations. Your Envoy
often diſcours'd him upon that Subject, and told
him that ſince he had ſo often abus'd <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's</hi>
Patience, it was to be feard <hi>you</hi> would
deal with him as he had deſerv'd. But he ſeem'd
to be, or indeed was inſenſible, or did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what had paſt: For he could not reſolve
to do what <hi>your Majeſty</hi> requir'd of him; tho' he
knew there was not any Body in all <hi>Europe</hi> that
could take his Part, and ſave him from being ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd,
if <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſhould once fall upon him.</p>
               <p>While this Buſineſs was in agitation, <hi>Louvoy</hi>
doubled his Endeavours, to perſwade <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
to undertake the War of <hi>Flanders;</hi> whereof
he pretended the Succeſs muſt be Infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> were engag'd in a
War, wherein <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had taken part with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> more out of Pollicy, than any real Intention
to aſſiſt your ancient Allyes. For if you reſolv'd to
conquer the Low Countreys, it was not likely
this Allyance would continue long, becauſe the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were highly concern'd, not to ſuffer a
Potent King to become their Neighbour: So that
what you had done in taking their part, was only
to keep up the Quarrel the longer between them
and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that it ſhould not end, unleſs
you were call'd in to the making up a Peace; for
your Deſign was to know what paſs'd, that you
might not take falſe Meaſures.</p>
               <p>Indeed your Conduct was ſuitable to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and the Succours you lent the <hi>Dutch,</hi> were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98314:81"/>
neither proportionable to your Forces, nor to the
Promiſe you made them, of doing your utmoſt
to enable 'em to beat their Enemies. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
your ſelf for 'em; but they beginning to
ſuſpect the great Preparations you made, thought
it better to make a Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than
to proſecute the Advantage they had, and which
gave them a proſpect of greater, after that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Diſaſter which befel the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Three Parts of the City of <hi>London;</hi> which
caſt the Inhabitants into ſo great a Conſternation,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> if they pleas'd might have done
their Buſineſs. Nevertheleſs, you did yours;
for you drove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the Iſland of
St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s, and took from them the Fort
they had built; but reſolving no longer to delay
the War of <hi>Flanders,</hi> you went thither in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
at the Head of a brave Army.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſufficiently frighted, and
not without Cauſe; for <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had taken
care (ever ſince the Peace of the <hi>Pyrenées</hi>) to
keep your Troops in as good Martial Diſcipline,
as if they had been continually in the Field.
You caus'd them to be frequently muſter'd, you
caſhier'd all that were unfit for ſervice, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
thoſe who had Liſted themſelves in
your Guards, on purpoſe to be free'd from
paying Taxes; this Reform went ſo high as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
many of whom were never in Service, and
were much fitter for a Court, than to look an
Enemy in the Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turenne</hi> commanded this Army under <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> and the Confidence you repos'd in him,
made you prefer him before all others to teach
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98314:81"/>
you the Art of War, wherein you look'd upon
him as the moſt experienc'd in all your Kingdom.
Therefore to reward his Services, and to let all
the World ſee how great an eſteem you had of
his Conduct and Courage; you declar'd him
Camp Mareſchal General of your Armies, a little
before the Peace between the Two Crowns; a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
that ſet him above all the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi>
and which in ſome manner reviv'd the Place of
Conſtable, which was ſuppreſt after the Death
of the Duke <hi>de Lediguieres,</hi> who was the laſt that
enjoy'd it.</p>
               <p>The Confidence which you had in this great
Man, diſpleas'd Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> whoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
was already grown to that heighth, as not
to be willing <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſhould conſult with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
body but himſelf: But he had many bitter

                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſometimes ſtay'd till Noon ſhut
up with <hi>Turenne,</hi> while <hi>Louvoy</hi> waited in your
Antichamber. This begot in him that Hatred
which he always had for <hi>Turenne,</hi> and which
hath been often prejudicial to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
as I ſhall make appear in the ſequel of this
Diſcourſe. Upon which be pleas'd to permit me
to make a Reflexion, which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> will
find very Juſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is nothing ſo
dangerous, as the giving too much Credit to Men
puft up with Pride and vain Glory. The Reaſon
is, becauſe ſuch Men ſtill envy the Reputation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deſerve for their good Counſel, and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
every thing which proceeds not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
wiſhing nothing ſhould proſper, rather
than the Glory of it ſhould be attributed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98314:82"/>
So that a Prince cannot be too reſerv'd
and cautions in the choice of a Miniſter; for tho'
he ſhould find in him all the Qualities requiſite
for ſo great an Employment; yet if he hath not
that of preferring the Publick, before his own
Private Intereſt, 'tis vain to expect any good
from him. To perform the Duty of a Publick
Miniſter, a Man ought to be Proof both againſt
Love and Hatred, and do nothing but for the
Publick Good. What is done for other ends,
may prejudice his Maſter, whoſe Service re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that his Miniſter ſhould not be ſubject to
any Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> upon <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> approach,
blew up the Fortifications they had made in a
new Place, which they called <hi>Charleroy.</hi> So that
in leſs than Eight Days, they demoliſh'd all that
which with Prodigious Labour they had been
building a Year, at the Expence of more than
Three Millions. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> reſolving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Fortifications they had begun, to keep
a Paſs upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> where this Place is ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
made your Army work ſo hard,
that in Three Weeks the Place was made defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible.
After this you went on, and in ſo ſhort
a time as is almoſt incredible, you took the
Towns of <hi>Aoth, Tournay, Douay,</hi> and the Forts
round about it. <hi>Oudenard</hi> and <hi>Aloſt</hi> likewiſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to your Arms, while the Mareſchal <hi>d'
Aumont</hi> took in <hi>Armentieres, Bergues, Furnes,
Dixmude</hi> and <hi>Courtray.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
haſten'd to clap up a Peace; but <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
keeping on your Way, beſieg'd <hi>Liſle,</hi> wherein
were Four Thouſand Men, all regular Troops,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98314:82"/>
and Ten times as many Burghers, able to bear
Arms; which made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> believe you
could not take the Town, having call'd to their
Relief Count <hi>Marcin,</hi> who commanded their
Army: He drew near the Place to fall upon
you, and thought you ſo weaken'd as to be eaſily
beaten; but <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> having in a little time
taken the Town, ſo totally defeated <hi>Marcin,</hi>
that he was forc'd to ſave himſelf on Foot
through a <hi>Mariſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Victory promis'd you more; the Seaſon
not being yet far advanc'd: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
was ſo ſet upon returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> that you
contented your ſelf with what you had done.</p>
               <p>There is a Time when a Man will prefer his
Pleaſure before his Buſineſs; which however
much leſſens his Reputation: For the leaſt fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Life of a great Man, is a Stain which
clouds the Glory and Luſtre of his Actions.
But who in this World is free from Faults? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they proceed from a Paſſion to which
Heroes are uſually more inclin'd than other
Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> Succeſs augmented your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Reputation, who became ſo proud of your
Favour, that he did all he could to ruine me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was juſt to me, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his Endeavours; and in truth <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
was bound to protect me, ſince it was for
you alone I expos'd my ſelf to the Hatred
of the People. I had advis'd you
ſome Years before to ſuppreſs a
a part of the Rents of the<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Town-Houſe</hi> like the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hotel
de Ville;</hi> which were eſtabliſh'd on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98314:83"/>
ſo ſmall a Conſideration, that the very Arrears
they demanded, exceeded the Principal they
were bought for: So that one might properly
ſay, there was Money due to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of your being in Debt. But ſeeing it
would have made thoſe People deſperate who
were concern'd therein, had <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
that Fund, which you might have done
with very great Juſtice, you reſolv'd I ſhould
only fright them to retrench thoſe Rents, that
they might not be ſo chargeable to <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
for the future. But People will be blind,
where their Intereſt is concern'd, for I was like
to be torn to Pieces by the Multitude, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
being one Day with the Chancellor,
ſome of 'em were ſo bold to threaten me. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
I was willing to hear what they had to
ſay, that I might know their Names, and <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> might cauſe 'em to be impriſon'd, which I
thought would keep 'em in Awe. However, they
continu'd to inſult me every Day; ſo that my
Deputies, who were more terrify'd than I, did all
they could to perſwade me to meddle no more
in the Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Zeal I had to ſerve <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> made
me take little notice of my Servants Fear, which
was ſo great, that one of them, who was a very
induſtrious Fellow, but guilty of beeing a little
too much given to Wine, which was his greateſt
Fault, ſtarted one Night out of his Sleep, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
ſome of the <hi>Hotel Ville</hi> Men were come to
cut his Throat. The Fumes of the Wine had
ſo clouded his Brain, that he did not perceive
his Fear proceeded only from a Dream; ſo
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98314:83"/>
that he put all my Houſe into an Uproar, which
frighted my Wife and Children; I awak'd with
the Noiſe he made, and had I believ'd my Wife
and Servants, I had run out of the Houſe to ſave
my ſelf: But thinking it fit to know firſt what
was the Matter, I quickly perceiv'd it was but a
Drunkard's Viſion, ſo that my Houſe was quiet
again. Next Morning I turn'd him away, becauſe I
reſolv'd not to keep him after he had caus'd ſuch a
diſturbance in my Family; eſpecially, after I had ſo
often told him, if he did not mend, I would not
keep him any longer. But there are ſome things
to which People are ſo addicted, that they cannot
leave 'em if they would, eſpecially when they
are become habitual. Drinking is one of thoſe
Habits, which the older a Man grows, the more
ſubject he is to it; the Reaſon is, becauſe the
Natural Heat decaying, he fancies that Wine
gives him new Strength, whereas the exceſs of
it takes away that which he hath yet left: The
cauſe is not the ſame in Mens Inclinations to
Women, which for a natural reaſon cannot be
ſo great when Men grow Old, as when they
are but Five and Twenty. Of all the Paſſions
wherewith Men are Troubled, I know none ſo
dangerous as this; beſide, how little doth it
ſute with thoſe, who find themſelves totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by Age. Whence we ought to conclude,
that we muſt endeavour from our very Infancy
to conquer this Inclination, eſpecially, when we
conſider it renders a Man unſit for every
thing, and conſequently is to be truſted in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:98314:84"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> doubting that your Neighbours
would grow jealous of your Conqueſts, made a
League offenſive and defenſive with <hi>Portugal;</hi>
which by the Succours you lent, kept it ſelf
from falling again under the Dominion of the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> of which they often complain'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Peace; becauſe <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by one of the Articles of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi>
Treaty, not to give <hi>Portugal</hi> the leaſt Aſſiſtance.
But 'tis in vain to Promiſe ſome things, which
Men when they promiſe know they can never
perform; and which are always to be reckon'd
in the Number of thoſe Things, which are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to the Intereſt of a Crown. So that
<hi>Whatever Allyances are made between neighbouring
States, their Promiſes laſt no longer, than they are
for the Common and Publick Good.</hi> There is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
ground therefore to depend upon 'em, and
they that do, deceive themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had always miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Deſigns againſt <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> was by
your Precaution render'd utterly unable to put
'em in execution. You made him (much againſt
his Will) lend you his Troops to aſſiſt you in
your Conqueſts. This made him endeavour to ſtir
up the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt you, who envy'd
your Proſperity, and enter'd into a Treaty with
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweeden,</hi> to compel
you to make a Peace; into which the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to enter, to be in a Condition to make
you fear him: He demanded his Troops again,
to come and take Winter Quarters with
him, under pretence of defending his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
that were environ'd on both ſides by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98314:84"/>
the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that he might diſpoſe of his
Troops as he pleas'd; but you were as cunning
as he, and would not let them go out of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
which made him try to debauch 'em.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſeem'd to take no notice of it,
becauſe you had Buſineſs of greater concern on
your Hands; therefore narrowly watching thoſe
Troops, to hinder 'em from deſerting, you went
in the ſharpeſt Seaſon of Winter into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> being well aſſur'd of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, becauſe the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
treated with the Marqueſs of <hi>Hienne,</hi> who
was Governour there. A thing not to be blam'd,
it being Wiſdom and Prudence in a Soveraign,
to ſpare the Blood of his Subjects as much as 'tis
poſſible; and therefore when it coſts him nothing
but Money to get the Keys of a Town, he is
much better advis'd than they, who venture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Thouſand Mens Lives for it, and yet often
receive a Baffle, and go without it: For let a
Prince's Forces be what they will, Succeſs doth
not always anſwer his Expectation; ſo that 'tis
a certain concluſion, that when a Man hath found
out a ſure way to do his Buſineſs, he muſt not
ſcruple to put it in practice. I except Poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Aſſaſſination; two things which are ſo
baſe, and ought to be ſo far from the Thoughts of
a Prince; that there can be nothing more
ſhameful and diſhonourable to him.</p>
               <p>The War which you maintain'd, did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you from taking care to ſee Juſtice done to
your Subjects: You oblig'd your Parliaments to
follow the <hi>Code</hi> Civil and Criminal, you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98314:85"/>
ſome about it before your departure for
<hi>Flanders,</hi> it being a Work that would very much
ſhorten Proceedings in Law-Suits. Some Judges,
who did not find their Account in it, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it would be in this, as it us'd to be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Caſes, where Penalties are threaten'd, but
ſeldom exacted; they took their Liberty to do
as their Fancy led 'em; but <hi>your Majeſty</hi> being
inform'd of it, ſuſpended them from their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which Puniſhment ſo ſcared others, that
they learnt to be Honeſt and Wiſe at other Mens

               <p>
                  <hi>YOur Majeſty</hi> now thought it a fit time to
make Peace, that thoſe Potentates who
envy'd your Proſperity might not become your
Enemies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having conſented by the Treaty
of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> that you ſhould keep your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
reſtoring to them the County of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>
you became more Powerful in <hi>Flanders</hi> than
ever you had been.</p>
               <p>You caus'd ſo many Places to be fortify'd,
that your Neighbours wonder'd how a Kingdom
of no larger extent than yours, could do ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things at once: For tho' theſe Fortifications
coſt a prodigious Summ; yet you went on
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98314:85"/>
with your Buildings both at the <hi>Louvre</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles.</hi>
Beſide, you bought ſo great a Quantity
of Rich Furniture, Antiquities, Jewels, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
all Things which expreſs the Magnificence
of a Prince, that it may be ſaid, your Predeceſſors
were but little men compared to you: You
caus'd a Coat to be made, which you wore at the
ception of Embaſſadors, the Diamonds upon it,
and on your Hat, were
valued at more than<note n="*" place="margin">Sixteen Millions of Livres computed, At 12 Livres to the Pound Sterling, amounts to One Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Three Hundred Thirty Three Thouſand Three Hundred Thirty Three Pounds Six Shillings and Eight Pence.</note> Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Millions, and the
Gallery before the aſcent
to your Throne, through
which People were to paſs,
was ſo full of Rarities and
Vaſſas of Maſſy Silver, that
it might well be thought you had made a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that was in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to ſhew your
Grandeur. The Matter or Subſtance of which
theſe Things were made, was not ſo much to be
conſider'd, as the Workmanſhip; every thing
was ſo curiouſly wrought, and by ſuch admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Artificers, that the Faſhion coſt more, than
the Matter whereof it was made.</p>
               <p>People will wonder that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> in this,
differ'd ſo much from your Father, who car'd ſo
little for Things of this kind, that Strangers who
went to ſee his Royal Houſes, wonder'd that ſuch
a Prince as he, ſhould have no better Furniture;
but you did not all this out of a vain Expenſive
Humour; but that you knew what People would
think of it: For all that is Splendid and Great
begets Admiration; of which Princes have
ſometimes as much need as of Power: For there
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98314:86"/>
is nothing makes 'em more reſpected, which
they ſeldom fail of, who know how to ſet a Value
on themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> likewiſe gave Order, that your
Tables ſhould be furniſh'd ſuitable to the State of
ſo great a King. You had choice and plenty of
all Things, and yet your Expences were leſs than
they were before, becauſe you would not ſuffer
your Servants to cheat you, as they us'd to do.
You did not think it beneath you, to ſee that
your Liveries ſhould be new, and chang'd every
Year, to prevent their Abuſes, who made them
ſerve beyond the limited time, to put the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into their own Pockets.</p>
               <p>So that all your People begun to have ſo great a
Reſpect for your Reign, that it was now no more
a Queſtion, whether <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſhould go your
ſelf to the Palace to ſee Edicts regiſter'd. You
thought it enough to ſend them by any body
next at hand; a Thing which will aſtoniſh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
conſidering what I have here before ſaid:
But it was your Reputation that did all this, and
you made your ſelf obey'd, without uſing the
leaſt Rigour.</p>
               <p>When Things are once ſetled upon a good Foot,
they will then go well of themſelves, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
much Pain about 'em: Which ought to
teach all People whoever they be, to put their
Affairs into good Order and Method; without
which they can never go well. This likewiſe
muſt be done at firſt, and as ſoon as Men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
employment; for if they ſtay till they find
their Buſineſs goes ill, then the caſe will be
the ſame, as it is with neglected Buildings that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98314:86"/>
are falling into decay; for by not putting in
one ſingle Stone in time, they perhaps come to
be ſo paſt all Repair, that of neceſſity they muſt
be pull'd down and new built, to the great
Charge and Prejudice of the Owner. How
much therefore is every Man concern'd to be a
good Husband?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> having concluded the Peace,
made Three Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> the Marqueſs
<hi>Bellefonds, de Crequi,</hi> and <hi>Humieres.</hi> The <hi>French</hi>
Gentry, who were always pleas'd with being in
Arms, having now nothing to do on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
asked <hi>your Majeſty</hi> leave to go to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Candy,</hi> which had a long time been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
by the <hi>Turks: Your Majeſty</hi> gave them
leave, and appointed the Duke of <hi>Feuillade</hi> to be
their Commander in chief. But becauſe the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
did not do their part in aſſiſting the
<hi>French</hi> to raiſe the Siege, they were never the
better for thoſe Succours. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
fell out with the Duke of <hi>Feuillade,</hi> who ſo
deſpis'd the General, that he often affronted
him to his Face. The <hi>French</hi> return'd without
doing any thing that was conſiderable, ſo that
the <hi>Turks</hi> hop'd to be Maſters of the Town in
a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Diſcouragements given
by the Duke of <hi>Feuillade,</hi> the Relief of the
Place was of ſuch importance to all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi>
and ſo much deſir'd by <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that you
ſent the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> with ſome regular
Troops, convoy'd by a Squadron of your
Fleet, commanded by the Duke of <hi>Beaufort.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> landed his Troops, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98314:87"/>
the continual Fire the <hi>Turks</hi> made
with their Canon. As ſoon as he had reſted his
Forces, and ſent out to view the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp,
they made ſo brisk a Salley, that all gave way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'em: But a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magazine of Powder by
chance taking Fire, and the <hi>French</hi> thinking it
a Mine ſprung on purpoſe, they were ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they retreated. The <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving
their Fear, charg'd them, and cut off ſome of
their Heads, which ſo increas'd the Confuſion of
the reſt, that ſeveral Perſons of note were kill'd;
of whom the only Son of Mareſchal <hi>de Faber</hi> was
one, becauſe he was never ſeen after the Fight,
nor found among the Dead, nor was the Duke
of <hi>Beaufort</hi> ever heard of, who very imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
went a Shore, againſt the Duty of an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
which is to fight at Sea only, and never to
quit his Ship, unleſs it be when 'tis ready to ſink.
This Expedition having had no better Succeſs
than <hi>Feuillade</hi>'s, you gave <hi>Navailles</hi> but an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
which made thoſe that were preſent in
the Action, lay all the Fault of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
upon him; tho' it did not appear there
was any Reaſon to blame the Duke, ſince 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for a General to foreſee ſuch an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as this was, or to rally Troops ſeis'd with
a pannick Fear. But it being difficult to juſtifie a
Man's ſelf at Court, eſpecially when a Miniſter
is at his Back, or he is not well with the Ladies,
<hi>Navailles</hi> was ordered to retire.</p>
               <p>The Place held out but a little while longer;
but it was ſo ſhatter'd and beaten with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
that the <hi>Turks</hi> were forc'd to rebuild it.
There hath not been known a more memorable
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98314:87"/>
Siege, wherein ever paſs'd more warm or
braver Actions: None can compare with it
for the length of the Siege, or for the Number
of Men kill'd on either Side: For it laſted many
Years, the Beſiegers loſt before it a Hundred
and Twenty Thouſand Men, and the Beſieg'd
near Thirty Eight Thouſand.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signior was not at all pleas'd with
the ſuccours <hi>your Majeſty</hi> lent the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and
therefore ſent a Chiaous to expoſtulate the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to renew the Treaty of Commerce
that had ſtill been between the Two Nations:
but <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had too much Courage to follow
the Example of ſome of your Predeceſſors, who
ſuffer'd <hi>Sultans,</hi> ſometimes to ſend them rough
Complements; for you ſilenc'd the Chiaous, as
ſoon as ever he begun to talk higher than became
him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Peace which <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
ſetled in <hi>Europe,</hi> by the laſt Treaty concluded
at <hi>Aix la Chapelle;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> daily
went on arming, becauſe he thought thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
who were againſt it, yet would not
ſuffer him to be quite ruin'd. That which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
him, was the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were become
Rich and Powerful, did no longer keep any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
or comply with <hi>your Majeſty. Van Bennin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
often ſpoke of the Strength of the united
Provinces, intimating, that they could not ſuffer
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> to diſturb the Peace of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
His boldneſs came to that height, that
he caus'd a Medal to be ſtamp'd, alluding to the
Miracle of <hi>Joſuah</hi>'s ſtopping the Courſe of the
Sun; thereby deſigning to pique <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:98314:88"/>
who had taken the Sun for your Device, and
knew that <hi>Van Beningen</hi>'s Name was <hi>Joſuab:</hi> It
was plain, that he meant he had ſtop'd your
Courſe, by the Treaty he had oblig'd you to
make. In the Medal (which was very well
done) was his own Picture, about it were theſe
<hi>Latin</hi> Words, <hi>in conſpectu meo ſtetit Sol.</hi> From
whence the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> concluded, he
might venture to provoke you. But <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
having receiv'd notice of what the Duke did,
you ſent to tell him that if he were not Wiſer,
he would find himſelf deceiv'd; and if he forc'd
you once more to ſeize upon his Country, he
ſhould never come into it again: You therefore
requir'd him preſently to diſarm, and that you
allow'd him but Six Weeks time for the doing
it.</p>
               <p>This Meſſage ſent in ſuch plain and impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Terms, aſtoniſh'd the Duke. Nevertheleſs,
endeavouring to cover his ill Intentions under a
ſpecious pretence, he told <hi>your Majeſty</hi> he was
not yet ſecure againſt the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> who
from time to time made Incurſions upon his
Frontiers, and therefore pray'd you to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the Buſineſs. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> knew very well
it was but a feign'd Excuſe; however, becauſe
what he demanded ſeem'd but Juſt, <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
ſent an Act of Guarranty both to him, and to
the Elector <hi>Palatin;</hi> whereby you promis'd to
aid either, in caſe any one of them ſhould
preſume to break the Treaty made between 'em.</p>
               <p>The Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> acquieſc'd preſently; ſo
that the Duke, having now nothing more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
was forc'd to obey you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98314:88"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> ſeeing no appearance of any
Broyls on that fide, deſir'd nothing more, than
to be reveng'd on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whoſe Inſolence
you could not digeſt. The Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy,</hi>
that wiſh'd for nothing but War, preſs'd you
to it, by repreſenting to you the Ingratitude of
thoſe People, who had ſo particular an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to you; not mentioning what they ow'd to
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. and to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. your Father and
Grandfather, without whoſe Aſſiſtance they had
never been able to make Head againſt the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> But had they had no more to do,
than to ſhew they were Ungrateful, it had not
been difficult; for whatever Obligation one
State may have to another, yet no People are
bound to put a Rope about their Necks. They
therefore had done nothing, but what might
by honeſt Policy be juſtify'd, when they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
you from conquering the reſt of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
But the Caſe was not the ſame as to thoſe other
Cauſes of Complaint you had againſt them, and
for which no body can excuſe 'em.</p>
               <p>Whatever was the Cauſe, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
reſolv'd to make the <hi>Dutch</hi> repent, as ſoon
as you could find an Opportunity. You com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to fill your Coffers, which by your
late prodigious Expence; were quite drain'd,
tho' your Revenues had been conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and many extraordinary Courſes had
been taken, that rais'd a great deal of Money.</p>
               <p>But I muſt confeſs, I did <hi>your Majeſty</hi> but ill
Service, in the Buſineſs of enquiring who were
Gentlemen, and who were not; and if ever the
like Inquiſition be made in your Reign, or any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98314:89"/>
of your Succeſſors, care ought to be taken to
follow my Example: For Affairs of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
muſt not be put into the Hands of <hi>Partizans,</hi>
whoſe only Buſineſs being to get Money, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
true Gentlemen who have none to give 'em,
and ſubſtitute Plowmen in their Places, if they
have ready Money to buy the Priviledge they
have to declare whom they pleaſe Noble. This
is an Abuſe not to be ſuffer'd, and which will
loſe <hi>your Majeſty</hi> the Love of your Gentry,
when they have juſt Reaſon to complain, that
the Perſecution they ſuffer, is not to diſcover
who are Ignoble and no Gentlemen; but to pick
the Pockets of thoſe who really are ſo. It is
much better ſuch an Inquiſition ſhould be made
by your Attorney-general and his Subſtitutes,
and that you ſhould appoint Receivers, into whoſe
Hands the Fines of ſuch as are found and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to be no Gentlemen ſhould be paid, and
by them brought into <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Treaſury.
If this Courſe were taken, <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be reproached, with delivering up Widows
and Orphans to Blood-Suckers; but all you
do will appear Juſt; then you will find a great
many Gentlemen of a new Impreſſion, who owe
their Gentility to their Money. So that after
having bought a Quality which doth not belong
to 'em, 'tis but reaſonable to make 'em pay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more for their Uſurpation, becauſe <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> is oblig'd to puniſh all thoſe, who make
uſe of Ill means to obtain their Ends.</p>
               <p>The Command <hi>your Majeſty</hi> gave me to fill
your Coffers, made me think of an Edict which
appear'd profitable to the Publick, and really is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98314:89"/>
ſo, if it be ſeriouſly conſider'd. It was to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
a Controul upon all Acts and Proceedings
in Law Courts, to prevent the Tricks and Cheats
heretofore practis'd in them by Antedates: And
tho perhaps it might not keep Sergeants from
playing the Knave, becauſe by this Controul they
might render their Declarations and Falſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more Authentick; yet all imaginable Care
was taken againſt it, by obliging them to get
Witneſſes to teſtifie all they did; which I think
was a certain Remedy againſt any ill that could
happen by Antedates. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> finding it
very Reaſonable and Juſt, eſtabliſh'd this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
throughout the Kingdom, tho' in many
Places it met with oppoſition; whether from
Judges that did not like it, for Reaſons I do not
underſtand, or that it diſpleas'd ſome particular
Perſons, whoſe Genius did not reach ſo far, as
to underſtand of what conſequence things are to
them: But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was forc'd to do them
good againſt their Wills.</p>
               <p>That which I thought very ſtrange, was, that
the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> were in this guilty of
a Fault; for which, tho' <hi>your Majeſty</hi> pardon'd
the whole Body; yet you thought fit to puniſh
the Particular Member who was moſt culpable;
that the Puniſhment of one might ſerve for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to the reſt; there would otherwiſe be ſtill
Danger of relapſing into the like Offence. The
Matter of Fact was this; That Parliament had
given Judgment that a Horſe ſhould be reſtor'd,
which had been ſold for the Payment of a Fine,
Order'd by the Edict to be levy'd on ſuch as
offended againſt it. Now this was a very inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98314:90"/>
Sentence, becauſe it did indeed nullifie the
Validity of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Edict, or at leaſt ſo
little regarded it, that it was in a manner to
ſay, no body ſhould ſubmit to it unleſs he
pleas'd. But ſeeing in ſuch Caſes, nothing
ought to be done imprudently, leſt <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's</hi>
Authority be made uſe of to no purpoſe; I
caus'd the firſt Preſident to be told, who had
not medled in the Buſineſs, that if the Sentence
they had paſs'd were not revok'd, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be all Fin'd; which it was his Intereſt, as
Preſident, to prevent, and on whom the Fault
would be laid, tho' he were Innocent. I wrote
likewiſe to your Attorney General, and to your
Advocates, without whoſe Knowledge the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
had paſs'd, that they ſhould take better
heed another time to do their Duty; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a little reprov'd 'em, the firſt Preſident aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
the Parliament in his own Houſe, where
the Farmer-general of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Demeans
was by my Order preſent: He deſir'd to ſpeak,
and the Aſſembly having given him leave, he told
them, That no Reparation could be made for
the Fault they had committed, but by a Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sentence that had been given. I was
indeed deſirous to ſpare <hi>your Majeſty</hi> the trouble
of puniſhing them: Beſide, when a Miniſter
can ſave the Appearances, and not bring his
Maſter's Authority into diſpute, 'tis Prudence in
him ſo to do.</p>
               <p>The Parliament would fain have ſhifted off
this Affront, by propoſing many Expedients,
whereby they thought to have ſaved their Credit.
But the Farmer ſtuck cloſe to his Propoſition,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98314:90"/>
ſo that the Parliament, to avoid the puniſhment
due to them, revok'd the Sentence they had
paſt.</p>
               <p>I did not acquaint <hi>your Majeſty</hi> with this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
till it was ended, becauſe when I took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me the Adminiſtration of your Revenue,
you declar'd you would truſt to my Fidelity in
all things relating to my Function. And indeed,
whoever you chuſe to execute that Office, his
Authority muſt be abſolute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe, he can
never diſcharge the Duty of his Place. <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> in Affairs of this Nature, ſhould conſult
none but ſuch as are of your Council; for if
you call in Judges of Courts to adviſe you, I
dare ſay you will be ſufficiently abuſed. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
underſtand nothing of the Buſineſs,
but will be ſure to perplex it; they will ſtart
a Thouſand Difficulties about the Point of a
Needle, which by all means is to be avoided,
becauſe in the <hi>Finances,</hi> all the Secret is Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>To prove it, I will mind <hi>your Majeſty</hi> of
that which I ſuppoſe you cannot but remember:
You made Monſieur <hi>de la Reinie</hi> Governour of
<hi>Paris,</hi> and that this great Capital City of your
Kingdom, (which for its Beauty, Grandeur and
Wealth, deſerves to be the Metropolis of the
whole World) might be better govern'd than
formerly it had been; I ſay, Monſieur <hi>Reinie,</hi>
who by his Place, was to have the Particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
and Overſight of all that paſt in it;
would have oppos'd my requiring Security for
a Duty belonging to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> which was
to be paid for Scoops to clear Boats of Water:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98314:91"/>
He fancy'd, becauſe it concern'd the Fiſh-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and other ſuch clamarous People, it would
raiſe a Tumult. His Fear was not to be blam'd,
becauſe he meant well; but he was miſtaken,
for no body ſtirr'd, and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had the
Duty quietly paid.</p>
               <p>I could quote many Examples of this nature
whereby <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would ſee, that ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Underſtanding reacheth no farther than
their Trade; and the reaſon is, becauſe their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
are falſe, they fancy Bugbears in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing, and fight with their own Shadows;
they think that in your <hi>Finances,</hi> 'tis as in a Law-Suit,
a Man ought to be always upon his Guard,
againſt the Subtelties of a litigious Petty-fogger.
They deceive themſelves more than others, and
rather than they will depart from their Maxims,
they will conſent the Government ſhould be
turn'd upſide down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> approved of all I did, relating
to the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi> You ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under the Privy Seal to diſplace the Preſident
of the Bench, who paſt the firſt Sentence; and
gave a Penſion of Two Thouſand Livers, to the
Premier Preſident who paſt the Second: For
Reward and Puniſhmeut ought to go an even
Pace, to encourage thoſe that do Well, and to
terrify thoſe that do Ill; otherwiſe there would
be no ſuch thing as Emulation or Reſtraint, both
abſolutely neceſſary to make a State flouriſh.</p>
               <p>Yours hath flouriſh'd ſo much, that the very
ſound of your Name kept the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
from being elected King of <hi>Poland,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he might have been. That Nation choſe a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98314:91"/>
Soveraign contrary to their uſual Cuſtom, and
againſt the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, which
they reſolved rather not to obſerve, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who would have been
diſpleaſed, if the choice had fallen upon that
Prince.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> appear'd very
Penſive, and I taking the Liberty to ask why
you were ſo; you did me the Honour to open
your Heart, and tell me there was ſomething a
brewing againſt the Peace of your Kingdom;
and that there was a Man whom you did not yet
know, but whoſe Deſcription had been ſent you
out of <hi>England,</hi> that went into all Courts, where
under pretence of preſerving the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he ſtirr'd up all Princes againſt you.
That out of <hi>England</hi> he was gone to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Kings, to perſwade them to enter into the
triple League. That this deſerv'd Exemplary
Puniſhment; but you knew not how to take
this Fellow and make an Example of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you thought no Prince would deliver him
up, and therefore you reſolv'd to ſurprize and
take him by force; which appear'd impoſſible,
every one being jealous of his Liberty, it would
expoſe thoſe whom you employ'd in it to too
much danger. Beſide, you ſaid, you knew not
whom to truſt, in an Affair of ſuch Conſequence
that ought to be kept Secret, and which you
had communicated to no body but my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I ask'd <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> whether the Man of
whom you ſpoke were a <hi>French</hi>-Man; you told
me he was, and it was that which made you ſo
very angry. I could not blame your Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98314:92"/>
but ſaid, my Opinion was, that <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> could do well to acquaint Monſieur <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
with the Buſineſs, who knew better than
any body, who were Men of Courage and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
and that he could chuſe ſuch, as would
undertake to ſeize this Man, and bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> or if that could not be done, they
ſhould kill him. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſaid, you would
not have him kill'd, becauſe before you puniſh'd
him, you would willingly know his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
believing he had many; but that in every
thing elſe, you would follow my Counſel, which
you approv'd of, becauſe you were confident
that Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> would be faithful to you,
tho' he were a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> for he was not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till about two or three Months after.</p>
               <p>I took the Liberty to pray <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> you
would ſay nothing of the Buſineſs to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Louvoy;</hi> becauſe I knew his Spleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> might perhaps prevent
the Deſign's taking Effect; which was enough to
let <hi>your Majeſty</hi> know, I did not think Monſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> ſo well affected to your Service, but that
for his own Private Ends, he might forget the
Publick Intereſt. <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> underſtanding
what I meant, promis'd not to ſay a Word to
any body; but yet reprov'd me for judging ſo ill
of my Neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> kept your Royal Word, and ſaid
nothing of what had paſt to any but Monſieur
<hi>Turenne;</hi> who appointed Five Officers to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Buſineſs. And ſeeing <hi>your Majeſty</hi> knew
where the Man in queſtion was, and what he had
been doing, the Officers went into <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:98314:92"/>
where he had newly arriv'd; they ſeiz'd him as he
was travelling from one Place to another, and
brought him into <hi>France;</hi> having very prudently
avoided the danger they were in if they had been
taken. You put him into the Hands of Juſtice,
to be immediately proſecuted.</p>
               <p>This miſerable Wretch was a Cittizen of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>
and a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and tho' he was taken as it
were in the Fact, and by the Proofs againſt him
muſt conclude, that what he had been doing was
diſcover'd; yet he would not confeſs a Syllable,
nor anſwer to any thing that was ask'd him; ſo
that he was Tried and Condemn'd. When he ſaw
that he was to dye a ſhameful Death, God ſo forſook
him, that he reſolv'd to kill himſelf; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome Pieces of Glaſs in the Dungeon where
he was, he with the Glaſs made a ſhift to cut off
his Privy Parts, hoping to Bleed to Death, and
avoid the Puniſhment which he was condemn'd
to ſuffer. His Keeper coming into the Room,
and ſeeing him look very Pale, ſuſpected what he
had done, and found the Glaſs he had hid. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Notice given to your Judge of it, he was
broke upon the Wheel within Two Hours
after.</p>
               <p>This was the end of this Miſerable Man, who
indeavour'd in thoſe Courts to which he went,
to cover his Crime with Zeal for Religion; and
tho' People do not think they can be deceived
in the Profeſſion they make of it, becauſe they
verily believe 'tis the certain way to Salvation,
eſpecially when they have been educated in it;
yet it is certain, their Religion, doth oblige them
to be obedient to their Soveraign, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98314:93"/>
other Princes to make War againſt him;
becauſe both Divine and Humane Laws condemn
it. So that we ſee Religion is commonly made
a Cloak to cover Mens Crimes, as it was in this
Caſe; wherein all that was done, did plainly
proceed from a falſe Zeal, ſeeing it was follow'd
by a deſperate Action, wherein there appear'd
ſo little of God, that he who attempted it, muſt
neceſſarily be forſaken by him.</p>
               <p>I have been a little the larger upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Circumſtances whereof are perhaps of
no ſuch great Concern to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſo particular a Relation. But I am glad
of this Occaſion to mind <hi>your Majeſty</hi> of all that
paſt; that I might at the ſame time tell you,
the Perſons employ'd by Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> did
you a piece of Service great enough, to have
been better conſider'd by Monſieur <hi>Louvoy.</hi> But
he being angry that this Buſineſs was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acquainting him with it, he became ſo much
the Officers mortal Enemy, that he caus'd
them to be caſhier'd one Year after another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
divers pretences, and at laſt treated <hi>Brique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maut</hi>
a Collonel of Horſe ſo ill, that to avoid
his Perſecution, he quitted his Country, and
went to ſeek an Employment under the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> It is impoſſible that <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> ſhould know every thing that is done
in your Kingdom, having ſo many weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to look after, and therefore ought not to
be troubled with things of little Moment. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> being often abus'd, I
deſire you ſhould know it, becauſe it concerns
your Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:98314:93"/>
While this paſs'd, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
that ſince it was the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s
Intereſt to live in Amity with you, he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
all occaſions of giving you Diſtaſt; and
that he could no longer retain the Suſpicion he
had, that you would take his Country from him;
yet inſtead of dealing ſincerely with you, he
grew jealous of your endeavouring to get his
Nephew out of the Emperour's Hands, believing
ſtill it was to keep him in awe.</p>
               <p>His Trouble was ſo great, that tho' the thing
did not ſucceed; yet without conſidering what
would follow, he begun to fortifie <hi>Chaté,</hi> and
<hi>Epinal,</hi> contrary to the Treaty he had made with
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> He was likewiſe ſo bold, as to
take away the Poſts upon which were plac'd <hi>your
Majeſty's</hi> Arms, for a Teſtimony of your Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
there, which he would by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Beſide, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> knew that he rais'd
Forces in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that he ſtill kept up
thoſe Regiments which he pretended to disband.
<hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> being no longer able to bear this,
ſent the Marqueſs <hi>Fourilles</hi> into his Country,
where he miſs'd but a Quarter of an Hour of
taking the Duke; who, as ſoon as your Troops
appear'd, had notice given him time enough to
get on Horſeback, and being conſcious of what
he had done, ſav'd himſelf in the Mountains of
<hi>Voges,</hi> where not thinking himſelf ſecure, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
your Diſpleaſure, he went wandring up and
down, ſometimes not daring to tell who he was.
A ſtrange condition for a Prince to be brought
to, who might have liv'd at his own eaſe, if he
had been Wiſer; which ſhews us, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98314:94"/>
there is between the Fortune of a Wiſe
Man and a Fool's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> then took Poſſeſſion of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which made little reſiſtance, and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd
the Places you ſuſpected, you acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> with thoſe juſt Reaſons
you had for what you did; becauſe you thought
he would endeavour to make the Empire jealous
of you, and conſequently take Arms againſt you.
You proceeded in this manner to prevent his
evil Deſign, and that <hi>Europe</hi> might not attribute
that to your Ambition, which was but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of your Juſtice. Thus all Wiſe and Prudent
Princes uſe to do; for ſhould they be ſilent, and
not juſtifie themſelves, the World would ſay,
they knew themſelves to be Faulty, or that they
preſum'd upon their Power, and would not
vouchſafe to give any Account of thoſe Actions,
which might be juſtly ſuſpected; eſpecially,
when they carry Two Faces, and Ambition ſo
plainly diſcovers it ſelf, that People muſt be
blind not to ſee it.</p>
               <p>The Duke, after having been ſome time a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive,
retir'd to <hi>Collen,</hi> where he ſtay'd brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new Miſchief againſt <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> and, in
perfect ſpite to you, counſell'd the Town to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a <hi>Dutch</hi> Garriſon. He likewiſe treated
with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to let them have ſome Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had ſtill on Foot, giving the command
of them to Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> his Son, by the
Princeſs of <hi>Cantecroix,</hi> to whom he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have given <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and diſinherited his
Nephew.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:98314:94"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> who had now more mind than
ever, to make War with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſeeing
the Duke not ſatisfied with what he had done,
but ſtill endeavouring to league the Princes of the
Empire againſt you; you ſent Miniſters thither
to counter and oppoſe all his Deſigns; and
knowing that nothing could be a greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to you, than the breaking of the Triple
League, which ſtill continu'd; you drew near to
<hi>England,</hi> upon pretence of viſiting the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which belong'd to you on the Sea-Coaſt,
and when you were there, Madam the Dutcheſs
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> being now not far from <hi>England,</hi>
was ſo deſirous to ſee the King her Brother,
that ſhe ask'd <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Leave to go thither.
You could not refuſe her, all Things being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concerted between you; particularly, that
when ſhe was with her Brother, ſhe ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to draw him off from the Triple League,
and perſwade him to eſpouſe your Intereſt. She
carry'd with her a very pretty Woman called
Madam <hi>Kerouel,</hi> who had done all ſhe could to
make <hi>your Majeſty</hi> in Love with her; but her
Stars being averſe to your liking her ſo well as
ſhe wiſh'd, ſhe deſcended to content her ſelf
with the Conqueſt of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
whoſe Weak Side was the Fair Sex. The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who knew his Conſtitution, had
Madam <hi>Kerouel</hi> gloriouſly dreſt, and to make
her Shine the more, preſented her with fine
Jewels. The Dutcheſs took her time, when her
Brother was in a good Humour, to make her
Propoſitions. Madam <hi>Kerouel,</hi> by her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs's
Order, very dextrouſly ſlides into the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98314:95"/>
Room, and promis'd the King, ſhe would come
back to him, as ſoon as your Siſter-in-Law
was return'd into <hi>France,</hi> if he would grant
what her Miſtreſs deſir'd. Thus did this Prince
ſacrifice the <hi>Dutch</hi> to his new Paſſion, renounc'd
the Triple League, and took new Meaſures with
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> to humble that Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs de <hi>Vitry,</hi> whom at the ſame
time you ſent into <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the Quality of your
Embaſſador extraordinary, prevail'd alſo with
his <hi>Swediſh Majeſty</hi> to quit the Triple League,
he being as much in Love with your Money, as
the King of <hi>England</hi> was with Madam <hi>Kerouel.</hi>
Every thing contributed to your good Fortune
and Satisfaction. The Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> who
had a good while been your Friend, endeavour'd
to make the <hi>Dutch</hi> recall the Garriſon they had
in the Capital City of his Electorate, which was
very difficult; becauſe the Inhabitants pretended
to a greater Power there than the Elector; which
is the Reaſon they are ſtill jealous of him. But
while this was a doing, your Siſter-in-Law the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> dyed in an Hour's time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe had drunk a glaſs of <hi>Succory-water.</hi> This
ſudden Accident, conſidering her Conſtitution,
which in all appearance was very good, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with her Youth, made many ſuſpect ſhe
did not dye a natural Death; ſhe her ſelf ſaying
before ſhe dyed, that ſhe was poyſon'd. This
was thought Probable, becauſe your Brother
the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> kept a ſort of People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, who made it their Buſineſs to make
him jealous of her. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> did all you
could to find out the Truth of the Matter: For
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98314:95"/>
as you were concern'd to puniſh ſo foul a Crime,
if it had been prov'd, ſo you had Reaſon to fear
it might have made a Breach between <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
and the King of <hi>England.</hi> Beſide, it was
neceſſary to ſearch this Buſineſs to the Bottom,
to diſcover from whence this Poyſon came,
whereof the Conſequences were very dangerous.
Eſpecially, when many begun to talk of the like
Accidents in <hi>Paris,</hi> where People every Day
dyed ſuddenly, which could not be imputed to
any Natural Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> caus'd the Dutcheſs's Body to be
open'd by your Surgeons, your Phyſicians were
likewiſe ſent for, to declare their Opinions in
the Preſence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſador, whom
you had alſo deſir'd to be there. But tho' they
narrowly inſpected all her Entrails, they ſaid,
they ſaw nothing upon which to ground a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of her being poyſon'd; but it will be very
difficult, to make Poſterity believe the Truth of
their Report.</p>
               <p>Whatever was the Cauſe of her Death, yet
the King of <hi>England</hi> was ſatisfied with what <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> did to make a Diſcovery of the Truth,
and continued his Reſolutions to humble the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
Your Brother the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now a Widdower, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought of
marrying him again into <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſecure
to your ſelf the Friendſhip of ſome Prince of
the Empire. The Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very fit for your Purpoſe, and <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
making her your Choice, you negotiated the
Match with her Father. There was but one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
againſt it, which was difference of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98314:96"/>
but the Rub being quickly remov'd, both
ſides agree'd upon the Marriage Terms.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> likewiſe promis'd to
joyn with <hi>your Majeſty</hi> in abaſing the <hi>Dutch;</hi>
while you ſet upon them on your ſide, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to attack them on his; ſo that they ſhould
hardly be able to defend themſelves againſt both.
But in ſuch a Caſe, I do not comprehend the
Policy of a little Prince, who is ſo blind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he ſhall ſhare with a greater in the Spoils
of an Enemy, whoſe wealth is ſo great, that
every Body envies, and is ſtill contriving to
get it. They muſt come to an Account ſooner
or later, where he that is ſtrongeſt will be ſure
to give Law to the weaker.</p>
               <p>I find this ſtill practis'd, tho' 'tis dangerous
for a weak Prince, to intereſt one that is very
Powerful in his Affairs. When the Princes to
whom appertain'd the Succeſſion of the States of
<hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Cleves,</hi> call'd in to their Aſſiſtance
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Emperour ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Succeſſion, and could never be brought to
reſtore it, but by down right Blows. For an
Example of another kind, let what paſt in the
War I am now about to ſpeak of be remember'd;
Would the Emperour ever part with <hi>Phillips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
tho' he promis'd before he took it, that
as ſoon as he was Maſter of it, he would reſtore
it to the right Owner, who is the Biſhop of
<hi>Spire?</hi> 'Tis great weakneſs in any Prince, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon one that is greater than himſelf.
<hi>France</hi> is not freer than others, from Injuſtice of
this kind; ſo that Princes, who are not very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ought to have a Care how they truſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98314:96"/>
with thoſe that can talk to them like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and that make their own Intereſt the only
Rule of their Actions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> when they ſaw themſelves
threaten'd on all ſides, were in ſuch a Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that may better be imagin'd than deſcrib'd.
There was likewiſe ſuch a Diviſion and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among 'em, that the Conſequences of it were
more to be fear'd, than the Danger wherewith
they were threaten'd from abroad. They had
not yet conferr'd any Authority upon the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> becauſe applying themſelves wholly
to Trade, they thought of nothing but making
it flouriſh in all Parts of the World; ſo that
their Power and Strength was reduc'd only to
that which they had at Sea, taking little or no
Care to keep up any Forces at Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John de Wit,</hi> Penſionary of <hi>Holland,</hi> was at the
Head of the Common-Wealth, a Man very well
vers'd in the Government of it. But tho' he
had many good Qualities, which his greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
cannot deny him; yet he was guilty of
that Fault whereof I have already ſpoken; which
was, to prefer his own Private Intereſt before
the Publick. He reſolutely oppos'd the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi>'s being inveſted with any Power or
Authority, becauſe his Father had been ill trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Prince's Father, who kept him for ſome
time in Priſon. But ſeeing no State can long ſubſiſt
without credit and Reputation, and that which
this Commonwealth had, conſiſted only in their
Riches and Strength at Sea; ſome of the Wiſeſt
Heads propos'd reſtoring to the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
the ſame Power and Authority which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98314:97"/>
his Predeceſſors formerly had in the Government.
The Reaſon they gave for it was, That they ought
to have a Soveraign, whoſe Name carry'd ſome
Stroke in Foreign Countries, where <hi>de Wit</hi> was
known but to ſome particular Perſons, who
look'd upon him as a very good Merchant, but
no great States-Man. That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
was an othergueſs Man, whoſe Anceſtors brave
Actions ſpoke for him; that he was near of Kin
to moſt of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> which
would facilitate making Allyances with them.
That he was Nephew to the King of <hi>England,</hi>
which deſerv'd their Conſideration in the preſent
Juncture; the Prince being thereby capable of
warding off <hi>England</hi>'s Blows, and of managing
their Intereſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons at laſt prevailing with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Part, ſupported by the Prince, and by all
thoſe that were Friends to his Family; he was
declared Stadholder; that is to ſay, Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and Governour of the Country. <hi>de Wit,</hi>
who openly oppos'd it, becauſe the Common-wealth,
upon the Death of <hi>William</hi> II. had paſt
a Decree, that thoſe Places and Powers which
that Prince enjoy'd, and which conſiſted in being
Stadholder and great Admiral, ſhould never
more for the Future be conferr'd upon one ſingle
Perſon. <hi>De Wit,</hi> I ſay, ſeeing himſelf like to
be diſcarded, us'd his Endeavours to have this
Decree executed, and to croſs the Prince all he
could.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> on his Part, made it
his Buſineſs to deſtroy <hi>de Wit</hi>'s Cabals, whom he
hated the more for being ſo Inſolent, as to think
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98314:97"/>
himſelf the Prince's Equal; and he had Reaſon,
for there is nothing more provoking to a Perſon
of great Birth, than to meet with a Miniſter,
who ſo much forgets himſelf, as not to pay his
Superior the Reſpect that is due to him. 'Tis
what is unpardonable, and in any Government
but a Republick, he that is Supream ought to
take notice of it, and in a prudent Manner pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
it; if he do not, the evil Conſequences of
it may fall on himſelf; for if a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be Injur'd or Affronted, and his Prince will
not take cognizance of it, nor reſent it; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
becomes the Object of the injur'd Perſon's
Hatred; who becauſe he hath not Right done
him, may perhaps ſtir up great Troubles, which
a little thing will do, and the leaſt neglect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hath very ill conſequences. A Prince,
nevertheleſs, is oblig'd to take his Miniſter's
part againſt all the World, otherwiſe no body
would care to ſerve him, eſpecially in ſuch a
Poſt, wherein 'tis impoſſible for a Man not to
create Enemies. But then a Prince ought
to weigh things, and do according to what
Juſtice requires of him; he ought to make a
right Judgment of what his Miniſter doth, and
to diſcern whether he acts out of Zeal for his
Service; or abounding in his own Senſe, doth
things out of mere Humour and Caprice.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Containing that which paſt from the War of
Holland, to the Treaty of Nimmeguen.</head>
               <p>THeſe Reflexions I have laſt made, having
interrupted the Courſe of the Relation I
was giving <hi>your Majeſty</hi> of your great Actions, I
now begin again where I left off. After you had,
as I have already ſaid, declar'd War againſt the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> you quickly invaded their Country.
They had recalled their Troops from <hi>Collen,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which, in their Room, enter'd Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men of the Circle of <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> Your
Army was in all Reſpects very Formidable;
ſo Brave and Numerous a one had not been ſeen
a long time; and to ſhew your Power, the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was at the Head of another
almoſt as great, beſides a flying Camp which was
commanded by the Count <hi>Chamilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had no mind to ſtay for
you in <hi>Collen,</hi> he went out of it the laſt Year,
for you had ſent ſome Troops to Winter in
that Country, into whoſe Hands he was afraid
to fall. He retir'd to <hi>Francfort,</hi> where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to make new Levies, believing that this
War made ſo near the Empire, would create
you ſo many Enemies, that he ſhould quickly
meet with an Opportunity to ſhew his ill Will
to <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> But nothing could ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you; in leſs than a Month, yout took For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fortify'd Towns, one of which could here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98314:98"/>
have held out a whole Year, againſt a
conſiderable Army. But your Conqueſts, I ſay,
rais'd you new Enemies; the Emperour ſent an
Army againſt you, to which the Marqueſs <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
joyn'd his Troops. They pretended to
make the Princes of the Empire repent their ſo
far taking your part, as to let you have Winter
Quarters in their Country, but all they could
do, was but to augment <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Glory,
ſince inſtead of repulſing you, Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi>
drove them into the Country of <hi>Mark,</hi> where he
quarter'd all the Winter.</p>
               <p>A little before this great Action, your
Troops paſt the <hi>Rhine</hi> by Swimming, which
caus'd ſuch a Conſternation among your Enemies,
that you were within a little of being Maſter of
<hi>Amſterdam.</hi> But a Burgh-Maſter of the Town,
by giving Counſel to open the Sluces, and let in
the Sea, rather than ſubmit to any other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
ſaved the City. Nevertheleſs, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to extremity, they ſent <hi>your Majeſty</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of Peace, which the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
who had been Wounded in paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
advis'd you to accept. All your Generals were
of the ſame Opinion, and their reaſon for it
was; becauſe the Emperour and the Elector of
<hi>Brandenburgh</hi> having already declar'd themſelves
againſt you, there was no doubt, but the whole
Empire, allarm'd by your Conqueſts, would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
follow their Example. But Marqueſs
<hi>Louvoy,</hi> who pretended that he alone knew more
than all theſe great Men put together, perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were brought ſo
low, that they could never riſe again; and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98314:99"/>
therefore you ſhould accept of no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
than their acknowledging themſelves
to be your Subjects: To which they muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
yield, becauſe they were not able to bear
the payment of what the Princes (who declared
for them) demanded for the Succours they lent
them. He perſwaded <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to ſtrike
while the Iron was hot, and not to take other
meaſures by making Peace; and if <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
did let ſlip this Opportunity, you could never
while you liv'd expect the like.</p>
               <p>To make good what he ſaid, he pretended
he had Intelligence from ſeveral Perſons in the
Country: And <hi>your Majeſty</hi> confiding in him,
becauſe all the ſecret Diſpatches went
through his Hands, ſent back the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Embaſſadours, who were come into your Camp
to offer you very good Conditions. And tho'
they came again a few Days after with much
better. Terms, yet your Miniſter, who was not for
Peace, becauſe his private Gain was ſo great by
continuing the War, kept things from coming
to any Concluſion. The Inhabitants of the
<hi>Hague</hi> in the mean time Maſſacred <hi>John de Witt,</hi>
who had ſent thoſe Embaſſadours to you, but
they were recal'd ſoon after his Death.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach Men never to refuſe good
Terms in hopes of better; and that it is not
prudence to make an Enemy deſperate. Beſide,
Affairs ſometimes change their face in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and therefore we ought not to let things
cool, but come to a Concluſion while they are
warm. Which ſhould have been done in this
caſe, becauſe <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had declared you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98314:99"/>
this War only to humble the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
You ſufficiently humbled them, in forcing them
to offer you ſo much as they did; and in not
pretending to more, you had made it appear,
that Correction, not Conqueſt, was your deſign.
But proceeding ſo far as you did, procured you
new Enemies, ſo that you ſee how much you
were obliged to Monſieur <hi>Louvoy.</hi> I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the great Hatred he bore me, was
one reaſon why he gave <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſuch ill
Counſel. He foreſeeing the continuance of the
War would be prodigiouſly Expenſive, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
that in a little time I ſhould not be
able to find Money enough, to defray the vaſt
Charge <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would be put to, to maintain
it; I ſhould then be diſgraced, and loſe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of your Favour.</p>
               <p>But this was not the only fault Monſieur <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
committed this Campaign, it was he that
was the cauſe why the City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> did not
open its Gates to <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> For after you
had put a Garriſon into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> the Marqueſs of
<hi>Rochefort</hi> was ſent to Command there. This
General of a new impreſſion, was guilty of ſo
great a fault in not ſeizing upon <hi>Mayden,</hi> that
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> goodneſs is to be admir'd, you did
not puniſh him with the loſs of his Head. You
know the reaſons why Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this General; they were the ſame with thoſe
that made him ſo bold, as to deſire <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
to make Madam <hi>Freſnoy</hi> a Lady of the Bed-Chamber,
to the Queen. She was Wife to one of
the Marqueſs's Deputies, and he the Son of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
by the Daughter of a little Deputy in the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98314:100"/>
Poſt-Office. When all the World knows, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the greateſt Quality, even Dutcheſſes,
would have thought it a great Honour to have
had the place. I wonder he was not aſham'd to
recommend a Woman of no better Reputation
to a place ſo near a Wiſe and Virtuous Princeſs,
ſuch things are never to be pardon'd, but give me
an occaſion to admire <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> refuſing, by Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi>'s
perſwaſion, to accept of a Peace; put all <hi>Europe</hi>
into Combuſtion. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were more
concerned than the Emperour or the Electour
of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> to keep you from Conquering
<hi>Holland;</hi> took the Field to favour the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s Deſigns. They joyn'd with him, and
had you not been ſo cautious as to gain <hi>Count
Marſin,</hi> who Commanded the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they
had defeated the Duke of <hi>Duras,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
your Flying Camp after Monſieur <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milli</hi>'s
Death. But <hi>Marſin</hi> purpoſely kept the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo long from paſſing the River <hi>Roer,</hi>
that he gave the Duke time enough to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>A Naval Combat accompanied theſe great
Events, to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Glory; for your Ships
which joyn'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet came ſo ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in to their Aſſiſtance, that otherwiſe the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> had been beaten. The <hi>Dutch</hi> who did
not think <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was ſo much to be fear'd
at Sea as by Land, were ſurpriz'd with this
Action, which gave them another Idea of your
Power, and was one of the reaſons why they
made ſuch Applications to <hi>your Majeſty</hi> for a
Peace. They ſaw they were like to ſpeed no
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98314:100"/>
better with you at Sea than at Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſir'd an Accommodation, rather than
expect uncertainties that might deceive
them.</p>
               <p>The end of this Campaign prov'd more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> than the beginning. The
Enemy beſieg'd <hi>Charleroy,</hi> when <hi>Montall</hi> the
Governour of it was gone to <hi>Tongres,</hi> which he
thought they deſign'd to attaque: But he got
again into <hi>Charleroy</hi> with a Squadron of Horſe,
and made the Enemy raiſe the Siege.</p>
               <p>All theſe happy Succeſſes made ſome envy
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> whom you had no deſign to moleſt.
Many took part with the Enemy againſt
you, but the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> reſolv'd to ſtand
Neuter, and would not declare againſt you;
but employ'd the Money which <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
gave him, to Levy new Troops. The Duke of
<hi>Hanover</hi> promis'd you to do the ſame, but as I
ſhall preſently ſhew, he was (much againſt his
will) kept from making good his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> having thus order'd your Affairs
in that Country; as ſoon as the Spring came on,
you laid Siege to <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> which you took in
thirteen Days after opening the Trenches; tho'
the Enemy look'd upon it as a Rock that would
break all your Deſigns. From thence you went
into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to hinder the Duke of that Name,
who joyn'd with your Enemies, from drawing
that Country into his Party. You caus'd the
Capital City to be fortify'd, which was not then
Tenable, and after you your ſelf had ſeen the
Works begun, you went into <hi>Alſatia</hi> to give
ſuch Orders, as in the preſent juncture you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98314:101"/>
thought neceſſary. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> took in ſome
places there, which properly belong'd to the
Inhabitants themſelves, according to certain Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
obtain'd from their Emperours; and
tho' after the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> you did not
think fit to meddle with them; yet your ſafety
now obliging you to take another Courſe, you
preſently cauſed them to be demoliſh'd.</p>
               <p>It concern'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to do it; for the
Emperour had a ſecond time ſent an Army into
the Field, to oppoſe your Deſigns. Viſcount
<hi>Turenne</hi> fac'd 'em, and twice offer'd 'em Battel;
but <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who Commanded the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Army, declined Fighting, and Encamp'd
ſo ſtrongly, that <hi>Turenne</hi> could not force him
to an Engagement. They lay obſerving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
both endeavouring to gain the Biſhop
of <hi>Wirtsburg,</hi> who had not yet declar'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Bridge which he had upon the <hi>Mein</hi>
was not to be ſurpris'd, becauſe it was ſo near
the Capital City, and was of conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to both Parties. Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf ſure of the Biſhop, becauſe he had
promis'd him to let no body paſs, which was all
that Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> deſir'd; he provided Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
at <hi>Waxtheim,</hi> in caſe he ſhould be
oblig'd to ſtay there any time; but when he
thought himſelf ſafe, relying on the Promiſe
which had been made him, the Biſhop treated
with <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who paſs'd the Bridge, took
<hi>Waxtheim</hi> and all your Proviſions.</p>
               <p>It requir'd extraordinary Conduct and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in General <hi>Turenne,</hi> to get out of the
Straits, whereinto this breach of Faith had
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98314:101"/>
brought him. Nevertheleſs, like a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
long experienc'd in the Trade of War,
he Poſted himſelf very advantageouſly, and made
a new collection of Proviſions, hoping to break
<hi>Montecuculi</hi>'s Meaſures. But the five Villages,
wherein were his new Magazins, being all at a
time ſet on fire, and burnt, he was now in a
worſe condition than before, by the Biſhop of
<hi>Wirtsburg</hi>'s Treachery.</p>
               <p>I cannot conceal from <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> what
was ſaid in your Army upon this ſtrange Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
I dare not ſay, I believe what I have to
tell you; it is ſo terrible and ſurpriſing, that
you your ſelf cannot but tremble with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to hear it. But tho' perhaps I ſhould do
well not to ſpeak of it, yet how can I keep from
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that which you are ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to know? All your Army believ'd, thoſe
Villains, who burnt your Magazins in the five
Villages, were employ'd by Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi>
becauſe his hatred to <hi>Turenne</hi> encreas'd daily.
That which caus'd the ſuſpicion, was this Great
Man's ſaying at that very time; the Enemies
which your Majeſty had out of your Kingdom
were not ſo much to be feared, as thoſe you had
in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſeized upon the City of <hi>Treves,</hi>
whoſe Elector had boldly enough declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you, by delivering up to your Enemies
<hi>Coblents</hi> and <hi>Hermeſtein. Montcouculi</hi> paſt the
<hi>Rhine</hi> at the firſt of thoſe places, and having
joyn'd the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> they laid Siege to
<hi>Bonne:</hi> A place, tho' not very conſiderable, yet
they were three weeks before they could make
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98314:102"/>
themſelves Maſters of it. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> knows
the Reaſon, why you ſuffered the Place to be
taken, without ſtriking a blow to relieve it;
and if credit may be given to the Officers of
your Army, and to ſome others, who have the
Honour to be near <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> this was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trick of Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi>'s, to keep
Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Reputation from growing too
great.</p>
               <p>The Campagn ended with making the
Biſhop of <hi>Wirtsburg</hi> repent his breach of Faith,
<hi>Turenne</hi> ruining a very fine Caſtle of his, having
firſt burnt all the Moveables and Furniture,
without ſuffering the Souldiers to plunder or
take any thing, that the Biſhop might not under-hand
buy his Goods again of them; who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſell what they get, for the tenth part of
its value, and then the Biſhop would have been
no great loſer; for in truth he could not be
puniſhed enough, becauſe when ſuch Men as he
break their words, they deſerve to be very
ſeverely dealt with. But it muſt likewiſe be
confeſt, that Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> on his part was
too credulous, to believe a Perſon that in
reſpect of his Birth was not to be truſted, and
who might be preſumed to be rather <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi>
Enemy, than your Friend.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, the Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> turn'd
his back upon you, under pretence that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as much by your Troops, as if he had
been your declared Enemy: Which was not
in <hi>your Majeſties</hi> Power to redreſs, becauſe
the Imperialiſts were privately trucking to have
<hi>Phillipsburg</hi> deliver'd to them. So that there
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98314:102"/>
was a neceſſity of drawing your Forces near to
cover it. The taking of <hi>Bonne,</hi> and the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi>'s taking of <hi>Narden,</hi> through the
Cowardiſe of the Governour, for which he was
exemplarily puniſh'd; were two Misfortunes that
contributed very much to the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>'s
deſerting you: For you were forced to abandon
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who
Commanded on that ſide, in the place of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>Rochefort,</hi> whoſe incapacity obliged you to
quit that Frontier, had much ado to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Army. But having done it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Opinion of many, who concluded
he muſt needs ſuffer very much, in ſo long a
March as he had to make, he took care to guard
that which is called <hi>French-Flanders,</hi> upon
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeemed to have a deſign.</p>
               <p>While this paſt, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was accepted by all Parties, to end this
great difference. There was a Congreſs at
<hi>Collen,</hi> where they met from all parts; but the
Preliminaries, as is uſual in ſuch Caſes, being
very long; there was no appearance things would
be ſoon Accommodated. In the mean time,
your Fleet ſtill joyn'd with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> beat the
<hi>Dutch</hi> three ſeveral times this Campagn, and
was ſo far from loſing the Reputation you had
got the Year before, that your Fleet very much
increas'd it, by the Courage and Reſolution it
ſhew'd in thoſe three Naval Combats: There
was nothing deciſive on either ſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your Conqueſts gave cauſe of jealouſie to
your Allies, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> begun to think of
leaving you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:98314:103"/>
But <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did all that was Humanly
poſſible to be done, to preſerve their Allyance.
You provided a Wife for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive
Heir to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> This
Prince had ſo many Miſtreſſes in five or ſix
Months time, that one would have thought he
would have Marry'd all the World. The firſt
he had, was Mademoiſelle <hi>d'Elboeuff,</hi> upon which
account, he ſent my Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi>
who conferr'd with me about it. According to
the Orders I receiv'd from <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> I was
very deſirous that the buſineſs ſhould take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
becauſe I had a great value for that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:
But my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> the then <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Embaſſador, and my Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> falling
out, the miſ-underſtanding between them, broke
off the Match.</p>
               <p>After Madam <hi>d'Elboeuf,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Mary
Anne</hi> of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> came upon the Stage; and
the Buſineſs was carry'd on ſo far, that <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
Signed a Contract with Commiſſioners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by the Duke of <hi>York</hi> for that purpoſe. I
had Orders to write to Madam the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> to come and be preſent at her
Daughter's Marriage; but when every body
thought the buſineſs ſure, it quite broke off,
upon ſome Ill Things reported of the Lady; her
Enemies pretended ſhe had certain defects which
I never perceiv'd. Whatever it were that was
ſaid of the Princeſs, a mean Perſon whom ſhe
had diſobliged, was thought to be the Author
of it. So true is it, that a very little Enemy
may ſometimes do a great deal of Miſchief,
againſt which the beſt fence and remedy, is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98314:103"/>
never prepenſly and with ſet purpoſe, to do to
any body the leaſt harm. A Rule ſeldom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by Princes and Great Men, who take ſuch
a liberty of ſaying what they pleaſe, that many
times they let fall words, which they would
give a great deal to recall. But when an Injury
is once done, it can never be undone, and
wounds given by the Tongue are incurable.
'Tis an Offence which Brave Men will reſent the
longeſt day of their Life, and will certainly be
revenged, unleſs God turn their Hearts. But
thanks be to God, this is a Vice whereof <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> is not guilty; for as you ſay little, ſo
you always ſpeak to the purpoſe, and without
ever reflecting upon your Neighbour. To your
Honour be it ſpoken, I can alſo ſay, that you
know not what 'tis to be Angry. I have lived
at Court full Forty Years, and Five and Twenty
of them, I have had the Honour to be near
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> in which time I can ſafely Swear,
I never ſaw you but once a little mov'd. It was
when Monſieur <hi>Werthamont,</hi> who, tho' a ſevere
Sentence had paſt upon him for ſeveral Crimes,
was yet ſo bold, as to come into your Preſence.
I obſerved <hi>your Majeſty</hi> grew Red with Anger,
and the Tone of your Voice when you told him
he ſhould come no more to Court, was not like
that wherewith you uſed to give your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
at other times.</p>
               <p>The Marriage of the Princeſs <hi>Mary Anne</hi> fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the Reaſon I have hinted. That of
Mademoiſelle <hi>Crequi,</hi> who hath ſince married
the Duke of <hi>Tremouille,</hi> came next to be talk'd
of. It was ſaid her Father was very Rich, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98314:104"/>
had made his Fortune while he was Embaſſadour
at <hi>Rome;</hi> where others uſe to undo themſelves.
But the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Crequi</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
not to give ſo much, as a Match of ſuch
advantage for their Daughter requir'd, they loſt
by their Covetouſneſs, that which others would
have bought with their Blood.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> at laſt pitch'd upon the
Princeſs of <hi>Modena;</hi> to whom Monſieur the
Cardinal her Uncle had left a Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Franks, which I had in my Hands. This
Marriage was without any difficulty concluded,
to the Satisfaction of both Parties.</p>
               <p>From what I have ſaid, the Leſſon which a
Prince ought to learn, is, that he ſhould ſtill ſo
well manage his Affairs, as never through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to do any thing unworthy of his Birth.
For tho' <hi>Mademoiſelle Crequi</hi> were a Woman of
Quality, yet ſhe was not a Perſon ſuitable and
conſiderable enough for a Prince, who was ſo
near ſtepping into the Throne of <hi>England.</hi> But
yet I know, without looking very far back into
the Hiſtory of that Nation, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
two Wives, who were not of a better Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
perhaps of not ſo good: But there is a
great deal of difference between what Love
doth, and that which is done with deſign, and
after mature deliberation. The two Caſes are
quite different, and tho' there may be faults in
both, yet whoever doth an imprudent thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
and wilfully, is more to be blam'd,
than he, who in what he doth is not Maſter of
himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:98314:104"/>
Seeing I am now diſcourſing of Marriage; I
will not leave the Subject, till I have given <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> an account of ſomewhat whereof I
lately boaſted. I told <hi>your Majeſty</hi> that I did
refuſe a conſiderable Match offer'd me for my
Son. It was <hi>Mademoiſelle Bournonville,</hi> now the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Noailles.</hi> The Propoſition was made
to me by her Father, who ſent me word it
ſhould be upon ſuch advantageous Terms for my
Son, as ſhould likewiſe ſatisfie me. Civility ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
me not abſolutely to refuſe what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and therefore I thank'd him for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he did me; but when we came to treat
further concerning it, he requir'd that I ſhould
endeavour to prevail with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
him to the Government of <hi>Paris,</hi> which
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> had taken from him, becauſe he
was ſo great a Friend to Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi> and
had alſo behav'd himſelf ſo ill, that tho' he had
for ſeveral Months liv'd in a Houſe near the
very Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> without ever coming to
pay his Reſpects to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> when he was
in very good Health, and daily made Merry
with his Friends that came to viſit him; yet
he made <hi>your Majeſty</hi> believe he was troubled
with Vapours, which would not ſuffer him to
go any where out of his Houſe. But the Feaſts
he made, and the pleaſant Life he led, giving
his pretence the Lye, and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> being
inform'd of it, thought fit to uſe him as you
did. I thank'd him for the Honour he intended
my Son, but I thought it better to loſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of ſuch an Allyance, rather than to run
the hazard of <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:98314:105"/>
Tho' <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had to do with ſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
yet you took care to ſecure the Peace of
<hi>Italy,</hi> which was upon the point of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd,
by the difference which happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Republick of
<hi>Genoa.</hi> But by interpoſing your Authority, <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> prevail'd with both Parties, to accept
of your Mediation, and you brought both to an
Agreement.</p>
               <p>You had the ſame work to do over again in
<hi>Poland,</hi> upon the Death of the new King there
without Children, who had Marry'd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
Siſter; before ſhe was Marry'd, the
Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was in Love with her, and it
was ſaid if ſhe might have had her will, ſhe
would have preferr'd him (tho' he had loſt his
Country) before the King and Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi>
Whatever was the matter, ſhe made ſo great a
Party for him in the Kingdom, that every body
thought he would have been choſen King. The
<hi>Poles</hi> were ſo little ſatisfy'd with the Deceas'd
King, that they were inclin'd to revive the Law
which was againſt chuſing a King of their own
Nation. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſeem'd to approve the
reviving of this Law, by your endeavours to
have the Eldeſt Son of the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi>
preferr'd, before the Prince of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> In the
laſt Election you were for the Old Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
the Father, with whom then ſtood Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Prince of
<hi>Condé.</hi> But becauſe the <hi>Poles</hi> then objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Duke, as being too Old, and his Age
now being greater than it was then, <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
to pleaſe them, now propos'd the Son in ſtead
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98314:105"/>
of the Father, and ſpent a great deal of Money
to get him Elected; which, if not, might at that
time have been prejudicial to your Affairs. But
tho' the Prince of <hi>Newburg</hi> was not choſen;
yet by the Addreſs of your Embaſſadour, the
Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was likewiſe put by, and a
Native of <hi>Poland</hi> preferr'd before all the Princes
propos'd. For <hi>John Sobieſcki,</hi> great Marſhal of
<hi>Poland,</hi> was made King, which very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
your Enemies, they imagining he would
be a Friend to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> becauſe he had
Marry'd a <hi>French</hi>-Woman, who was the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Marqueſs <hi>d'Arquyen,</hi> Captain of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Swiſſes,</hi> of your Brother's Guard.</p>
               <p>You had need of this Aid, againſt the Deſigns
of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who fancy'd you would
never come off with Honour, in the War you
had begun. The Emperour poſſeſs'd with this
Opinion, did two things which were mightily
cry'd down by all People, not tranſported with
Paſſion againſt you. One was the ſeizing upon
Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Furſtenburg</hi> in <hi>Collen,</hi> who
was <hi>Abbé</hi> of <hi>Stravelo,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Collen</hi>'s
Plenipotentiary; under which Character he could
not be ſeized, without violating the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The other was the taking away by force,
Fifty Thouſand Crowns wich <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had
in the City, and which for the ſame reaſon ought
to have been Sacred. But becauſe the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria</hi> had a mind to obſtruct the Peace, and
could find no better Obſtacle; it paſt over all
other Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>William</hi> was firſt carry'd to <hi>Bonne,</hi>
where he had Ten Hours Conference with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98314:106"/>
                  <hi>de Grana,</hi> Governour of the Town. Who
reproach'd him with being born a <hi>German,</hi> yet
had in ſeveral Occaſions, which he particularly
named, betray'd his Country. Which Prince
<hi>William</hi> deny'd, but own'd he had ſerv'd <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> after he had many times endeavour'd
to deſerve the Emperour's Favour, but could
never obtain it. From <hi>Bonne</hi> he was Conducted
to <hi>Newſtat,</hi> where the Emperour reſolv'd to
have him put to Death in Priſon, after a private
Sentence paſt againſt him, where only a few
Perſons were preſent, who Condemn'd him to
be Beheaded. But <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who beſide all
your other good Qualities, hath that of diving
into the moſt ſecret Councils of your Enemies,
found a way to ingage the Pope's Nuncio, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to the Emperour, that he ought not in
ſuch a manner to put a Church-Man to Death.
The ſcruple being eaſily put into the Emperour's
Head, he ſtopp'd the Execution, and caus'd him
to be remov'd to another Priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> complain'd to the Court of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi>
of the Violence offer'd to the Perſon of
Prince <hi>William;</hi> and at the ſame time demanded
Reſtiſtution of the Fifty Thouſand Crowns that
had been taken from you. But receiving no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
Anſwer to either, you recall'd your
Embaſſadours who were ſtill at <hi>Collen:</hi> The
other Princes did the like, ſeeing after what had
been done, there was no more ſafety for them,
than for Prince <hi>William.</hi> But ſince they that
are ſtrongeſt, are ſtill thought to have moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
on their ſide; your Enemies liſted ſo many
Troops, that few were of Opinion, <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:98314:106"/>
would ever be able to make Head againſt
'em. The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was of that mind,
and therefore quitted your Party. The Elector
of <hi>Collen</hi> would have done the like, if the Biſhop
of <hi>Strasburg</hi> had not diſſwaded him. But when
People thought you could not but ſink under the
weight of ſo many Enemies, you attack'd <hi>Franch-Conté,</hi>
to which you had offer'd a Neutrality.
The <hi>Swiſs</hi> who had concern'd themſelves in the
Negotiation, were angry with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for
refuſing what you offer'd; and therefore guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Frontiers, to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from
being aſſiſted by their Allies. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> went
into <hi>Franche-Conté</hi> in Perſon, and there did that
which was never before known to be done at the
taking of any place. You cauſed Canons to be
hoiſted up, and planted upon Mountains ſo
very high and ſteep, that a Man could hardly
clamber up; by which you became Maſter of
<hi>Beſanſon,</hi> that your Enemies thought impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>The Conqueſt of this Province, gave <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> new ſtrength, of which you had need
enough in the condition you were in. For the
King of <hi>England</hi> was in a manner forced to a
Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by his own Subjects, who
were more jealous of your Conqueſts than
others. But the King of <hi>England</hi> ſtill left his
Troops in <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Service. They were
ſome Regiments, of which the moſt conſiderable,
was called the Royal Regiment, Commanded
by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> Some of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were very inſolent, ſo that one of them
gave ill Language to one of Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi>'s
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98314:107"/>
Grooms, who to go the nearer way croſt their
Camp. Your Miniſter, who expected Reſpect
ſhould be paid to his very Liveries, put this
Officer under a Guard, whereupon the others
Mutiny'd. But ſeeing the Marqueſs had not the
ſame Power over the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that he had over
your Troops, he was obliged to releaſe the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer;
this was ſome Mortification to Monſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi>'s exceſſive Pride. A Miniſter, or any
Perſon, of greater or leſs Quality, might well
be aſhamed to take a Servant's part againſt a
Gentleman, unleſs the ill uſage of the Servant;
were intended for an Affront to the Maſter.
One of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Captains was of a more
phlegmatick Temper, who ſeeing his Coachman
that uſed to drive him, luſtily cudgel'd; when
next day the Perſon that beat him came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelf, by ſaying he knew not whoſe Man
he was, the Captain told him he was obliged to
him, and ſhould be more, if all the Men he
kept, had but ſo good a hand as he, for then
People would be more afraid of his Men than
they were.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Franche-Counté</hi> being thus reduced, <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> reſolved to have it better Fortified.
Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy</hi> pitched upon an Engineer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Combes,</hi> a Man of good Skill and Experience,
having given Proofs of his Ability in <hi>Holland,</hi>
where he had been imploy'd in Fortifying ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places. But the Marqueſs reſerved <hi>Beſanſon</hi>
to be Fortified by Monſieur <hi>Vauban,</hi> which ſo
diſſatisfied <hi>Combes,</hi> that he took the liberty to
tell Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> he had been a chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and therefore 'twas an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98314:107"/>
to him, to have another put over his Head.
But the Marqueſs, whoſe Temper is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd
without reply, ſent him to the <hi>Baſtile;</hi>
where he was ſo cruelly treated, that he was
ſhut up in a Chamber three days without a Bed.
The Man, who thought he had not deſerved ſuch
ill uſage, took it ſo to Heart, that he fell Sick,
and Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> about eleven days after,
going to ſee him, ask'd whether he would be
wiſer for the future? <hi>Combes</hi> ſaid he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to think of now, which was, to give
God an Account of his Actions, being in a little
time to leave the World. Tho' your Miniſter
preſently gave him his Liberty, yet in three
days after he dyed. Which ought to Teach
Men never to make too ſevere an uſe of their
Authority, eſpecially to Men of Courage; who
ſeldom refuſe to obey, but where they think
their Honour concern'd. And in ſuch Caſes, if
they be faulty, they ought in a friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to be advis'd, and not Corrected with too
much Rigour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> great Succeſs, made your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
ſo very bold, that he every day begg'd
new Favours of you. He obtain'd an Order
from <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that I ſhould yearly furniſh
him with Forty Millions, to defray the Charge
of the War, and to Account for it to none but
your ſelf. The Account was given in a ſingle
ſheet of Paper, which one would think, not big
enough to contain the ſeveral Items of ſuch a
Summ. I do not believe 'tis by this alone, he
hath got that prodigious Eſtate, which ſome ſay,
is greater than many Soveraigns have. All the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98314:108"/>
Regulations he hath made during this War,
which under ſpecious pretences have render'd
your Officers poor; were I believe intended
more for his own Profit, than <hi>your Majeſty's,</hi>
you gratified him ſo many ways out of your
Officer's Pay, that in perfect diſtaſt, many of
them quitted your Service.</p>
               <p>Yet this did no more ſatisfie his Avarice, than
did <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> granting him the Foreign
Poſts, which amounted to a vaſt Summ by his
Exorbitant Taxing of Letters, whereof the
leaſt paid as much again as it uſed to do in
Monſieur <hi>Noveau</hi>'s Time. He begg'd a Patent
to have the ſole power of Licenſing People to
keep Hackney, Stage, and Hired Horſes, upon
which he laid an Impoſition. Not content with
this, he obtain'd a Priviledge for thoſe that
kept ſuch Horſes, to be free from Quartering
of Souldiers, for which Exemption, ſome gave
him a Hundred Crowns; not that they got ſo
much by their Horſes, but becauſe Quartering
of Souldiers was ſo great a burthen to them,
that whatever they paid to be freed from
it, yet they thought they had a good
Bargain.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs became at laſt ſo great a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
that he did whatever he pleas'd, without
any body's daring to contradict him: Every one
ſtrove to ſhew him Reſpect, and all Favours
paſſing through his Hands, it was a ſhame to ſee
what baſe and ſervile Bows and Cringes were
made to him by the greateſt Perſons in your
Kingdom. For my own part, I was too Stiff
to worſhip him. Finding the Forty Millions
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98314:108"/>
which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> order'd me to pay him,
ſuch an infinite Charge to your People, and that
a greater Burden was yet to be laid upon 'em
to anſwer other Expences, I began to examine
how ſo vaſt a Summ could be laid out. As ſoon
as I caſt my Eye upon the Accompt, I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
a conſiderable Cheat, of no leſs than Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or Sixteen Hundred Thouſand Crowns a
Year. I muſt ſpeak likewiſe of the Abuſes
practis'd in the Years 1673. and 1674. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Routes oppointed for the marching of
Souldiers from Place to Place. To be but one
of your Miniſter's Lacquies, was Merit enough
to have had Five or Six of them. Several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
were likewiſe ſetled in <hi>Paris,</hi> to diſpatch,
as 'twas pretended, <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> own Affairs;
where nothing could be done without ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
ſo that if theſe Abuſes had continued any
long time, Forty Millions would not have been
ſufficient to anſwer the Charge of theſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> heard what I had to ſay
concerning theſe Abuſes, and thought fit to
name Commiſſioners to inquire into 'em. They
who were the greateſt Criminals ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and thoſe that were ſeiz'd, not being
able to ſpeak ſo pertinently as others, were,
upon payment of their Fines, let out of Priſon.</p>
               <p>This was a Buſineſs bad enough, to have ſtopt
the Carier of your Miniſters good Fortune; but
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> drawing from it Supplies to ſupport
the War, which was ſo much his care; he had
Opportunities to be heard in his own Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſaved himſelf, by laying the Blame
of all that had been done upon your Officers:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98314:109"/>
So that there are lucky Conjunctures, when
things ſhall be forgotten, which at another time
would be puniſht with ſeverity. It is alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that Men in great favour ſhall paſs for
innocent, when others who are leſs culpable ſhall
be ruin'd and undone. But this is an Evil
that hath long reign'd in the World, and looks
as if it would continue much longer, before
any Remedy be provided againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi>
forſaking your Party, oblig'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to
quit all your Conqueſts in <hi>Holland,</hi> excepting
<hi>Graves</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> You drew out all your
Garriſons, and made up a good Body of an Army,
which was what the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had ſome
time before advis'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to do; but
Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> continually oppos'd it. In the
mean time, Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> when he had ſhut
up all the Paſſes of the County of <hi>Montbelliard,</hi>
by which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> deſign'd to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the County of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> having no more
to do on that ſide, marched back again into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
where he took <hi>Germeſſeim,</hi> and caus'd it
to be demoliſh'd; thereby taking away the
hope which the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> had, that this
Place ſhould ſtreighten and keep the Garriſon
of <hi>Phillipsbourg</hi> from deſolating his Country. He
then went towards the <hi>Rhine</hi> and paſt it, to fight
the Imperial Army, to which were now joyn'd
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s and the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s
Troops: He found them ſo advantageouſly
poſted, that he muſt run a great Riſque in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to force them; but conſidering it would
be an affront to him, to come ſo far and then
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98314:109"/>
retreat, and alſo if he ſtaid longer, the Enemy
would be ſtronger than he, by the Duke of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonvill</hi>'s
coming up to them: Conſidering, I
ſay, what Reſolution ſoever he took, he had a
great many Difficulties to grapple with, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to do that wherein there was moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which was to fight. However, it muſt
be confeſt, we have a great deal of reaſon to
ſay, that in Battels God only is the Giver of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
ſeeing without him, it was impoſſible, in
this Action, for your General to have come off
with Honour. He was in the firſt place oblig'd
to force the little Village of St. <hi>Seim,</hi> into which
the Enemy had put their Infantry: There was
no coming to it, but through Defiles guarded
by their Dragoons; but he overcame all thoſe
Difficulties with ſo much eaſe, that had his
Troops been the beſt that ever were in <hi>Europe,</hi>
yet they could never have done what they did,
unleſs God had fought for him. They routed
the Dragoons and took the Village; they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
advanc'd againſt the Horſe thro' narrow
Lanes, beat 'em, and put 'em into ſo great a
Fright, that they never thought themſelves ſafe,
till they had paſt the <hi>Necker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Victory coſt <hi>your Majeſty</hi> dear; for
you loſt in the Fight a great many good Officers,
that might have done you great Service: You had
ſo much to do, and in ſo many Places at once, that
to direct and order what was fit to be done, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſuch a Head as yours. Count <hi>Souches,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the greateſt part of the Imperial Forces,
enter'd into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and joyn'd with the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> whoſe Army conſiſted of Threeſcore
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98314:110"/>
Thouſand Men, and that part which remain'd in
<hi>Germany</hi> grew ſtrong in a little time, by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which came to it from all ſides; ſo that they
were ſcarce ſenſible of their late loſs. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
was oblig'd to provide for the Safety of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi>
where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made a ſhew of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſomewhat. But that which moſt troubled
you, was, that the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who being now
Maſters at Sea, by the King of <hi>England</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
you, threaten'd the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy</hi>
and <hi>Britany;</hi> where the Alarm was ſo great,
that one would have thought all had been loſt:
But after roaming to and fro they attempted to
ſurprize <hi>Belle Iſle,</hi> where they receiv'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe;
which oblig'd them to retire, and then
landing upon the Iſland of <hi>Noirmouſtier,</hi> they pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd
it, and exacted a Summ of Money from
ſome of the beſt Houſes, which they threatn'd
to burn if it were not pay'd them. This Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which look'd as if it would have ſwallow'd
up your whole Kingdom, ending thus in doing
ſo little, they went to ſeek for better Fortune in
<hi>America,</hi> imagining that when you had ſo much
to do at home, you could take care of nothing
there. But they having beſieg'd St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
met with ſo great reſiſtance, that it holding out
till the Seaſon was too far ſpent to keep the Sea,
they were forc'd to raiſe the Siege.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> after
the Battel of St. <hi>Seim,</hi> came back on this ſide of
the <hi>Rhine</hi> to joyn a part of his Army he had
left there to make the more haſte: but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Enemy was to be re-inforc'd, he
re-paſs'd the River to fight them a Second time,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98314:110"/>
before they ſhould grow too ſtrong for him:
But they retreated over the <hi>Mein,</hi> under the
Canon of <hi>Francfort,</hi> the General following them ſo
cloſe, that he charged their Rear in paſſing the
River, and cut off near Eight Hundred of their
Men: But not being able to force them out of
that Place, he return'd back to deſtroy the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
<hi>Palatin</hi>'s Country, which very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
the Elector; eſpecially the burning ſome
Villages, tho' without the General's Order; it
being in truth done by the Souldiers, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to be reveng'd upon the Country, for
barbarouſly murdering ſome of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades.</p>
               <p>The Elector, in his Paſſion, ſent by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
a formal Challenge to Viſcount <hi>Turenne;</hi>
but he was too prudent a Man to accept it;
but made him this anſwer, That having the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to command <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Army, he
could do nothing without your Orders; as to
the Elector's complaints againſt him, they were
without ground, for had the Elector's Subjects
not dealt ſo cruelly with <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Souldiers,
they had never thought of burning their Houſes.
That he did not refuſe the Honour the Elector
did him, in offering to ſight with him, provided
each of them were at the Head of an Army, and
then he hop'd he might do <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſome
Service.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts having ſtaid long enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Canon of <hi>Francfort,</hi> to reinforce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the Recruits which were ſent them
from ſeveral Princes of the Empire: Viſcount
<hi>Turenne</hi> found their Army ſtronger than his own,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98314:111"/>
ſo that he entrench'd himſelf between <hi>Landau</hi>
and <hi>Weiſſemberg.</hi> When the Imperialiſts ſaw
him retreat, they took their turn to follow him,
and came to <hi>Mentz</hi> where they pretended to
paſs the <hi>Rhine:</hi> but the Eleſtor of that Name,
with whom <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had taken meaſures,
would not do as the Biſhop of <hi>Wirtsburg</hi> did,
but pray'd 'em to ſeek a Paſſage ſomewhere elſe.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army remain'd all
this while encamp'd, and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> wonder'd
at it, not being able to gueſs why he attempted
nothing, with ſo conſiderable a Force. The
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> obſerv'd him, but being much
the weaker, he thought fit to entrench himſelf,
and not to fight, but when he ſaw an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeeing all your
Troops imploy'd, either to make Head againſt
him, or to obſerve the Imperialiſts, whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
would in a little time be Sixty Thouſand
Men, by the joyning of Marqueſs <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
who was already on his March; gave Order
for the beſieging of <hi>Graves,</hi> by <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> an
Officer who had gotten ſome Reputation againſt
the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> when that Prelate was
of your Party. Count <hi>Chamilli,</hi> younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to him of whom I have made mention,
commanded in the place, and defended it ſo
well, that <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> had time enough to catch
cold before it. The Garriſon made frequent
Sallies, ſo that at three Months end, he was not
much farther advanc'd, than he was the firſt
Day; tho' he had promis'd to give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Town in three Weeks.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeem'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98314:111"/>
to deſign entring into <hi>France,</hi> which he thought
eaſier to do, than to begin a Siege in ſight of
your Army, which would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
it without coming to Blows. The
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in order to his Deſign began
to march, and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> follow'd him,
and fell on his Rear ſo rudely, that he kill'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Three Thouſand Men, made as many
Priſoners, and took his Baggage and ſome of
his Canon, before he could recover himſelf, or
well know what was to be done: The Country
which was full of Hedges and broken Ground,
made by Torrents of Rain, offer'd the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> an advantage, which he could not
have met with in an open Plain: He threw his
Infantry into theſe Poſts, which hindred <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> from advancing: But the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé</hi>
was ſo eager in preſſing ſtill forward, that he
did things, which another would have thought
impoſſible. He had a great many Men kill'd,
and had himſelf Three Horſes ſhot under him;
ſo much did he hazard his Perſon, by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to give warmth to the Action: But by
the great reſiſtance made by the Enemy he was
ſtill repuls'd, till night came on, and parted
the Combatants, both attributing to themſelves
the Victory. But there was no colour for the
Enemy to pretend to it, becauſe that which
makes a Victory, is to remain Maſter of the
Field, to have the pillaging of the Enemy, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Priſoners, and ſeveral other things not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be ſpecified. All this fell out on <hi>your
Majeſty's</hi> ſide, but nothing of it on theirs; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
perhaps the Enemy might boaſt, that the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98314:112"/>
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> loſt as many Men as they, and
it may be a greater number of Officers.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be confeſt, that the end of this
Battel did not anſwer the beginning, which
could not be more to any General's Glory:
But the deſire he had to get all, made him loſe
more than he imagin'd, and till that very Day,
it could not be decided, which of the Two,
the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> or Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> knew
moſt, in the Trade of War. Many were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt
in the Prince's Favour, and thought the
Prize due to him, but others now began to be of
another Mind, and gave it to his Rival.</p>
               <p>This Battel however ſpoiled the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>'s
Deſign; who now thought no more of
entring into <hi>France.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who
did not love the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> was very
much pleas'd with what had happen'd; becauſe
it gave him an Opportunity, of doing the Prince
ill offices to <hi>your Majeſty:</hi> So that ſince this
Campaign, he hath not been any more imploy'd,
and I believe never would have been again at
the Head of an Army, if Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> had
not been kill'd the following Campaign; there
being then a kind of neceſſity, that a General
of Reputation ſhould ſucceed in his Place.</p>
               <p>As Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> knew how to do a great
deal of Miſchief to his Enemies, ſo he was able
to deliver his Friends out of Danger, and thoſe
that were ſo happy to have his Protection; as
appears by what he did for Monſieur <hi>Bret,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General of your Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where
his Vanity and Imprudence made him commit a
Fault, which deſerv'd exemplary Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:98314:112"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> ſome time ago ſent him into
that Country, and left him there ſome prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Years, with the chief command of your
Army, becauſe then there appear'd no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Enemy. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having ſent
thither the Duke of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> a General of
Reputation, with a part of their old Troops;
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought fit to ſend againſt him
Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> not inferior to him, and who
had often engag'd him, when they were both in
<hi>Portugal.</hi> This was ſome mortification to a
Man ſo Vain as Monſieur <hi>Bret,</hi> who was now
but a Lieutenant General; which not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bear, he did ſo raſh a thing of his own
Head, that none but Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy</hi> could have
ſav'd him. The Enemy, after having taken
<hi>Bellegard,</hi> which gave them entrance into <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon,</hi>
came and encamp'd within Canon ſhot of
your Army, which ſo diſpleas'd Monſieur <hi>Bret,</hi>
that he gave them Battel while his General was
yet in Bed, and without expecting any Orders
from him: But he was beaten to the purpoſe,
and if Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who wonder'd at his
Boldneſs, had not by his good Conduct repair'd
his Fault, <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Army had been totally
defeated. Your Cavalry, which without view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ground, he had engaged among Pits and
Places broken with currents of Water, were
many of them cut off, and <hi>Rabliere,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, was taken Priſoner, with other
Officers of note: Thoſe that came off, were in
no condition to have made any conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
all that Campaign, if that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98314:113"/>
elſewhere had not oblig'd the Enemy to
return again into <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meſſina,</hi> the Capital City of the Kingdom of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> having a long time complain'd of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
and Tyranny of their Viceroys, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
often inform'd the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> thereof,
without receiving any redreſs; they reſolv'd
one day to try, whether they could ſhake of
their Yoke, and after having made themſelves
Maſters of the Haven, and one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Forts of the Town, they all cryed Liberty.
That Word tickl'd the Ears of the Multitude,
who, againſt reaſon, often think they ſhall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Condition by changing their Maſter;
and made above Sixty thouſand Men take Arms.
The better ſort of Citizens, conſidering it was
impoſſible to reſiſt their Soveraign any long
time, unleſs they were ſupported by a Power
able to aſſiſt them; conſulted what was beſt for
them to do; whether to addreſs themſelves to
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> or to have recourſe to the <hi>Turk.</hi>
They were not long deliberating on the choice
they were to make, thoſe that had a little care
of their Religion, declar'd, that in all reſpects,
their beſt and moſt juſtifiable way would be,
to implore <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> help, and ſend Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to requeſt your Protection.</p>
               <p>The Offers their Deputies made you, were,
that they would deliver themſelves up to <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> upon Condition you would treat them
better than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had done: Whereupon
you aſſembled your Council, who finding it
would be of great advantage to you, to lay hold
of this opportunity to cut out work for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:98314:113"/>
on that ſide; the Deputies had aſſurance
given them, that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would aſſiſt them
with all your Forces: But it was not thought fit
you ſhould accept of the Soveraignty which
they offer'd you, but that it would be better to
endeavour to turn their Government into a
Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>You ſent back the Deputies with fair promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which at the ſame time you effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
by giving order to the Marqueſs <hi>Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir</hi>
to take ſome of your Men of War, and
Convoy to <hi>Meſſina</hi> ſome Veſſels loaden with
Proviſions, of which they had great need, and
which came very ſeaſonably to them; for they
began to be in extream want. The rebelling of
Subjects againſt their Soveraign, is a buſineſs
which ſhould be well conſidered before it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
'tis always attended with ſuch ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
that were they not bound by their
birth and allegiance to be faithful to him, yet
their own intereſt ſhould oblige them to it.</p>
               <p>But as Subjects owe their Soveraign perfect
obedience, ſo the Soveraign on his part, ought
not to uſe his Subjects like Slaves, nor lay heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
burdens on them than neceſſity of State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
Otherwiſe they will quite ſink under
their load, or elſe like a reſty Horſe will kick
againſt the Spur, as it happens when we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to break and tame a young Horſe, all at
once, without uſing him by degrees to inſenſible
correction.</p>
               <p>The revolt of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> render'd the Enemy's
Victory in <hi>Rouſillon</hi> of little or no advantage to
them; for being obliged to leave that Province,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98314:114"/>
and go where there was moſt danger, their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
gave <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> an opportunity to drive
them next year quite out of the Country, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Caſtle of <hi>Bellegard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſgrace which your Troops receiv'd in
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> was ſo largely recompenced by the
proſperous ſucceſs of your Arms, the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> that <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
had all the reaſon in the world to be well
pleas'd. Your Army had twice triumph'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> and tho in the Battel
of <hi>Seneff</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> loſt many brave
men, yet it produc'd a very good effect. One
thing I forgot to ſpeak of till now, which was
of great advantage to you, the Baggage of
Count <hi>Monteri,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
was taken in that Battel, and ſome Papers
found which diſcover'd a Conſpiracy that was
hatching in your Kingdom, to deliver up certain
places upon the Coaſt of <hi>Normandy;</hi> they at
leaſt made mention of ſome ſuch thing, but for
my own part, I cannot believe there was really
any ſuch Conſpiracy, the perſon ſuppos'd to be
chief in it, and all his Accomplices, were people
of ſo little credit, that I rather think it was a
trick to get Money from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by one
not worth a Groat, and who was up to the ears
in debt.</p>
               <p>The principal Conſpirator was the <hi>Chevalier
de Rhoan,</hi> who was a very handſom well made
man, but ſo extreamly debauch'd, that he loſt
the good opinion <hi>your Majeſty</hi> once had of him;
he us'd all his Relations, and his own Mother ſo
ill, that ſhe not long ago complain'd to <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:98314:114"/>
that he had robbed her, and many times
after that ſo abuſed her, that ſhe was about to
pray <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to do her the favour, to ſend
him to the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> To compleat his imprudence,
he parted with his place of chief Huntſman of
<hi>France,</hi> by which he ſubſiſted; ſo that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to live, he did that of which I am now
ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs concern'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> too much
to be neglected; for had he deſign'd nothing
but the getting a little Money, yet he deſerv'd
to be puniſh'd, that it might not be an ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to your Subjects. Whatever it was he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> order'd he ſhould be ſeis'd,
and ſent to the <hi>Baſtille;</hi> and the Major of your
Guards went to <hi>Rouan</hi> to take one of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
called <hi>Lautremont.</hi> The Major ſurpriz'd
him in his Bed, and though he ſhould have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
brought him away bound Hand and
Foot, yet becauſe he had ſome acquaintance
with him, he gave him leave to go into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
where he had two Piſtols ready Charged,
one he fired upon the Major, but miſs'd him;
one of your Guards that went with him, ſhot
<hi>Lautremont</hi> with a Muſquetoon through the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
which diſpleas'd <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> becauſe he
being kill'd, you could not come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſeveral things, which you hoped he
might have confeſt; for it was he that was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with the management of the whole Intrigue,
and who had ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi> a School-maſter
that was a Stranger, and had a Lodging in the
Suburbs of <hi>St. Antoine;</hi> this Fellow would have
run away, but you gave Order that he, the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98314:115"/>
                  <hi>Marchioneſs de Villars,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de
Preaux,</hi> ſhould all three be ſeiſed.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Chevalier de Rhoan</hi> had known what
paſs'd, he certainly would not have confeſt any
thing; for no body but he that was kill'd at
<hi>Rouen,</hi> knew that he was in the Conſpiracy.
When the School-maſter was examin'd, he ſaid,
what he had done was by <hi>Lautremont</hi>'s directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Marchioneſs de Villars,</hi> and the <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
de Preaux</hi> likewiſe ſaid, they knew nothing.
But he that Interrogated the <hi>Chevalier de Rhoan,</hi>
by promiſing him <hi>Your Majeſties</hi> Pardon, made
him confeſs that none but he knew any thing of
the buſineſs; which promiſe being made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any order from <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> you did not
think your ſelf oblig'd by it; ſo that the <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
de Rhoan</hi> was condemn'd to have his Head
cut off. He beginning to think matters did not
go well with him, becauſe for ſome days he was
not ſuffer'd to have a Knife at Table, which
was formerly allow'd him, he pray'd that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bourdalouë</hi> the Jeſuit might come and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
him.</p>
               <p>In two and twenty years he never received
the Sacrament, but now on the ſudden became
ſo alter'd, that no body would have thought
him the ſame man. He was very penitent, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and with great reſignation ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to God's will; ſo that when the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
came to bind him, and ask'd whether he
ſhould take off a Ribband from his Coat to do
it? he ſaid no, take a Rope, for ſo great a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as he was, could not be too rigorouſly uſed.
He ſhew'd ſo many ſigns of Humiliation, that he
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98314:115"/>
drew tears from the eyes of divers Spectators.
Being come out of the <hi>Baſtille</hi> to the place of
Execution juſt before it, he ſtood ſtill, and ſhew'd
ſo much courage, that many pitied his ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Before he mounted the Scaffold, he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Father <hi>Bourdaloué,</hi> whether any body had
taken care to comfort his Mother; he beg'd her
pardon in a very paſſionate Letter he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to her; he ſpoke a few words to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
<hi>de Villars,</hi> and to the Chevalier <hi>de
Preaux,</hi> who were to ſuffer with him. Then
ſtretching out his neck to the Executioner, he
cut off his head at one blow.</p>
               <p>His body was carry'd in a mourning Coach to
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, where it remain'd till it was remov'd
from thence to the Abby of <hi>Souars,</hi> where he
deſired to be buried. The Marchioneſs <hi>de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>
and the Chevalier <hi>de Preaux,</hi> were likewiſe
executed; and after them the Schoolmaſter, who
was hanged; a warning to all that waſte and
ſpend their Eſtates, never thinking what ſhall
become of them; and when God hath forſaken
them, make no ſcruple of committing any kind
of Wickedneſs. Let Libertines alſo learn, who
live as if there were no God, that there will
come a time when he will ſuffer them to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hands of Juſtice, and they ſhall then
know, tho' too late, how much miſtaken they
have been, in not ſerving him, whoſe Grace
given to them as it was to this Perſon of whom
I have now ſpoken, can only make them Happy.</p>
               <p>I now return again to tell <hi>your Majeſty</hi> what
paſs'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
having beſieg'd <hi>Oudenard,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:98314:116"/>
march'd to relieve it: But the Imperialiſts not
coming to aſſiſt the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as they
were to have done, he was forc'd to raiſe the
Siege, and leave Count <hi>Souches,</hi> with whom he
was ſo much diſpleas'd, that he complain'd of
him to the Emperour; charging him with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cauſe, that the Affairs of the Campaign
had no better Succeſs. The Emperour, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> would not for ſome
time ſee General <hi>Souches;</hi> but he, after a while,
finding an Opportunity to juſtifie himſelf, was
again reſtor'd to the Emperour's Favour.</p>
               <p>The Siege of <hi>Graves</hi> laſted till now, and there
was no likelyhood that it ſhould end, having
ſtill ſome Out-Works which were not taken.
Beſide, the ill Weather was now coming on; ſo
that there was little hope of reducing a Garriſon,
which without receiving any Relief, had been the
Death of ſo many Men: For <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> had the
ill luck ſtill to be beaten, in all the Salleys made
by Count <hi>Chamilli.</hi> But for a greater Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to him, one of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Colonels of
Seventy Years of Age, came purpoſely from
<hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and carry'd away the beſt part of the
Fruit he hop'd to reap by taking the Town.
When <hi>your Majeſty</hi> withdrew your Forces from
<hi>Holland,</hi> you demanded a great Summ of Money
of them, and the Towns which could pay down
but part of what you requir'd, gave you Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to be ſecurity for the reſt. Theſe Hoſtages
were in <hi>Graves</hi> as in a Place of Safety, and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benhaut</hi>
who had beſieg'd it, made account, that
by taking it, he ſhould ſave <hi>Holland</hi> a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Summ for which they were ſtill account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98314:116"/>
He had good ground to believe he ſhould
not be deceiv'd in his Expectation, becauſe <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remond</hi>
and <hi>Venlo</hi> which belong'd to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
hinder'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> from relieving the
Place. But <hi>Melin Meſtre de Camp</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
came, as I have already ſaid, with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> paſt through <hi>Rabenhaut</hi>'s
Guards, enter'd the Town, took away the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages,
and went back to his own Garriſon, by
the ſame way he came.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Rabenhaut</hi> hereby loſt ſo much of his
Reputation, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had not
that eſteem for him he had before; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
he muſt not rely upon him for the taking
the Town. The Prince therefore, with ſome
Troops he had drawn together out of <hi>Flanders,</hi>
went to <hi>Graves</hi> himſelf, and became Maſter of
the Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Graves</hi> being fallen into the Hands of the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Campaign ended on that
Side; but continued ſtill with a great deal of
Heat in <hi>Germany.</hi> The great Force which the
Enemy power'd into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> did a little aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
your Miniſter Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afraid the Province could not be ſav'd, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> to give Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to leave it, and go to ſome other Place,
where his Preſence was more neceſſary.
This was a Pill which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> could not
well ſwallow; and to loſe a whole Country at
once, which had coſt you ſo much Blood to
conquer, was very hard to be digeſted. But
Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy</hi> repreſenting to you the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of it, and that otherwiſe you would loſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98314:117"/>
                  <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whither the Duke of that Name was
marching, with great hopes to enter again into
it; you conſented that General <hi>Turenne</hi> ſhould
be recall'd; but he knowing things were not in
ſo ill a Condition as they were thought to be,
ſent Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> word, that ſome body
muſt have given <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ill Counſel, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
you to take ſuch a Reſolution. That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Place, ſaw better than others, how
things were, and therefore prayed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
a Letter to you, which he had done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Honour to write, wherein he had given
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſuch Reaſons for changing your
Reſolution, that he hop'd you would do it as
ſoon as you had read his Letter.</p>
               <p>Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy</hi> thought it great vanity in
this General, to believe he knew more than he,
and without ſhewing his Letter to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
ſent him new Orders, expreſly the ſame with
the firſt. This great Man ſuſpecting that <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> was not privy to theſe repeated Orders,
and that if his Letter had been deliver'd, you
would have done him the Honour to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
it; he reſolv'd, before he would do
what was commanded him by the ſecond Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to write again to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> and ſent
the Letter to Cardinal <hi>Bouillon</hi> his Nephew,
to be by him ſafely deliver'd. The Confidence
which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had in the Wiſdom and
Prudence of this General, as ſoon as you had
caſt your Eyes on his Letter, made you conclude
that Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> had not given you good
Counſel, and that you were beſt to follow
your General's Advice, and not your Miniſter's:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98314:117"/>
You therefore wrote a Letter with your own
Hand to Viſcount <hi>Turenne,</hi> wherein you told
him, that you referr'd your ſelf wholly to his
Judgment, and that he ſhould uſe his own
Diſcretion, to do what he thought beſt.</p>
               <p>This was Vexation enough to your Miniſter,
whoſe Cuſtom it was to be Abſolute; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
he knew more than any Man, concluded
if things fell out ill, as he had predicted, Viſcount
<hi>Turenne</hi> muſt then loſe the good Opinion <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> had of him, and conſequently you
would for the future confide wholy in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs:
But he reckon'd without his Hoſt, and
found that the General preſerved both <hi>Savern</hi>
and <hi>Hagenau,</hi> which the Enemy beſieged one
after another. He likewiſe broke the Deſign
they had upon <hi>Briſac,</hi> which they had begun to
ſhut up ſo cloſe, that it being in great want, they
hoped they ſhould quickly have it without
blows. Tho' theſe Actions were very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet they were the leaſt wherewith the
General ended this proſperous Campaigne; for
feigning to go and take Winter Quarters in
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> he Marched through by-ways, and fell
unexpectedly upon the Enemy, who had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
the better to ſubſiſt; and went on beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them one after another, till they made a
ſtand at <hi>Turquem;</hi> but he likewiſe drove them
from thence, and forced them to paſs the
<hi>Rhine.</hi> He took from the Inhabitants of <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
what Effects they had abroad, becauſe
they let the Enemy paſs over their Bridge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Promiſe they made him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:98314:118"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> who doth not uſe to let any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of this Nature remain unrewarded, ſent the
General the very next day after he came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> a Hundred Thouſand Crowns in <hi>Louys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ors,</hi>
and gave him many other marks of your
Favour. You ſent Marqueſs <hi>Louvoy</hi> to him, to
ask his Pardon for many things, for which the
General had juſt cauſe of Complaint againſt
him. Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> upon this occaſion
Treated him, as we ſee a great Maſtiff uſes to
do a little Cur; he heard his Complement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing him any reſpect, or ſign of Anger,
and ſent him away with an Anſwer, which 'tis
ſuppoſed did not pleaſe him. The Prince of
<hi>Condé</hi> came to ſee Monſieur <hi>Turenne,</hi> and to
know of him what paſt at this Enterview.</p>
               <p>Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> having given an Account of it
to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who had no reaſon to love
<hi>your Miniſter;</hi> the Prince pray'd Monſieur <hi>Turenne,</hi>
that they might go both together to undeceive
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> in many things which poſſeſt you
with ſo good an Opinion of him. Viſcount <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
promis'd the Prince he would, but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Tellier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> having notice of it, came to the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and beſeech'd him to pardon
his Son, who ſhould for the future pay him all
the Reſpect he could deſire; ſo that pacifying
the Prince by fair Promiſes, he prevented his
Son's Ruine; which had been inevitable, if
theſe two Great Men had reſolved it. For it
was an eaſie thing to have demonſtrated to
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that many things wherein Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> made you believe he had done you
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98314:118"/>
great Service, would upon Examination have
appear'd, to deſerve quite another Name.</p>
               <p>As for Example, I may put into that number,
the change Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> perſwaded <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> to make, in the Hoſpitals which were
Erected for ſuch as had the Leproſie; and to
convert the Revenue which belonged to thoſe
Houſes, into Rewards for ſuch as Served you in
your Wars. I preſume to tell <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
when you have ſeriouſly conſider'd it, you muſt
be convinced, your Power doth not extend ſo
far in things of this Nature: Theſe Foundations
are Works of Piety which you are oblig'd to
maintain: I know very well it hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
theſe Hoſpitals are of no uſe, becauſe
'tis now ſaid the Leproſie, for which theſe Houſes
were intended, is the effect of meer Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and not an incurable Diſeaſe, as People here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
believed. But be it, or be it not ſo, yet
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> is not Authorized to ſeize the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and give it to whom you pleaſe. If you
can diſpoſe of it, the moſt you can do is,
to Aſſign it to ſome other Hoſpitals, or ſo to
convert it, that it may anſwer the Founder's
Intention; for to give it to People, who make
uſe of it to gratifie their Paſſions, is what Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts
do not allow.</p>
               <p>I doubt, whether you can legally unite it, to
the <hi>Hotel Royal des Invalides,</hi> which you have
cauſed to be built ſo Magnificently, and have
laid out ſo much Coſt and Charge upon it, that
it ſeems to be intended rather for a Palace, than
an Hoſpital for Maimed Souldiers. <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
is oblig'd to provide Maintenance for them
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98314:119"/>
out of your own Revenue, and not out of what
properly belongs to others; it would be in ſome
ſort a ſhame to do it, ſeeing you would loſe the
Glory of ſuch a Noble Eſtabliſhment, could it
be ſaid you had built it at another's Coſt, and
not at your own.</p>
               <p>The Year 1675, was no ſooner begun, but
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought of ſecuring a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> which the Enemy had
cut off towards the end of the laſt Campaign,
by taking <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Dinant:</hi> Which was done
by the Imperialiſts, when they ſeparated from
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army; and which made
him deſire to re-take <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> To this end
he prevail'd with the Emperour, to ſend Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Baden</hi> to <hi>Leige,</hi> a Canon of that Church,
who under pretence of Reſidence, endeavour'd
to make the Town declare for the Emperour;
which would have very much favour'd the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Siege of <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> His Eminence found
the Town very well diſpoſed to do what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and I muſt tell <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>Louvoy</hi> was the cauſe of it: He had upon
ſeveral occaſions diſcontented the Citizens of
<hi>Leige,</hi> who were formerly well enough affected
to him, he had often cauſed the Houſes which
they had out of the Town to be pillag'd, which
was done in ſpite, becauſe one day paſſing by
the Town, one of the Canons railed at him,
and ſpoke ſo loud that Mounſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> heard
him.</p>
               <p>But the Count <hi>d'Eſtrades,</hi> who took care of
<hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Affairs, prevented the Cardinal
of <hi>Baden,</hi> by Treating with the Governor of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98314:119"/>
the Citadel, who deliver'd it up into his Hands.
The good Succeſs of this Negotiation, having
put it out of the <hi>Leigeois</hi> Power, to do the
Miſchief they intended; Cardinal <hi>Raden,</hi> who
had nothing more to do in the Town, deſired a
Paſsport from the Count <hi>d'Eſtrades,</hi> for his ſafe
return into <hi>Germany;</hi> but making uſe of it to
carry away Arms with him, the Governour
made that a pretence to ſtop the Cardinal and
his Train. All <hi>Europe</hi> accus'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> of
breach of Faith, in making your ſelf Maſter
in this manner of the Citadel of <hi>Leige;</hi> but
how eaſily can you clear your ſelf, and ſhew
what reaſon you had to do it: For his Eminence
had done the ſame thing, if you had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him, as appear'd by his Papers that
were ſeiz'd, of which ſome were kept, that
made mention of all the Cardinal had been
brewing. This ſo ſilenc'd all thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to blaſt <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Reputation,
that there was not a word more ſaid of the
matter.</p>
               <p>This great Affair being ended in the manner
I have mention'd; <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> beſieged <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi>
when you had taken it, you cleared all the
<hi>Meuſe</hi> from that Town to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> by taking
the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Huy.</hi> From thence
you went and beſieged <hi>Limbourg;</hi> the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> made a ſhew as if he would Relieve it,
but not doing it, you became Maſter of it, and
Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> return'd again into <hi>Germany,</hi>
to make Head againſt <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
had ſent into that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:98314:120"/>
Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> had not now ſo great Forces
to deal with, as he had the Year before, for
you had contrived a diverſion in the <hi>North,</hi> by
the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s declaring War againſt the
Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi>
was to ſecond the <hi>Swede</hi> with an Army of
Fifteen Thouſand Men, to keep thoſe in awe
who had a mind to aſſiſt the Elector: But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<hi>Wrangell,</hi> who Commanded the <hi>Swediſh</hi>
Army, being gain'd by his Maſter's Enemies,
did not Execute the Orders which were given
him; ſo that the Duke of <hi>Hanover</hi> durſt not
declare himſelf. Nevertheleſs, this made the
Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> recal his Troops from
the Imperial Army, whereupon, the Marqueſs
<hi>de Vaubrun,</hi> one of your Lieutenant Generals,
took <hi>Dachſteim</hi> in the abſence of Viſcount
<hi>Turenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> believing, that by the King
of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s declaring War, he had made amends
for the Fault he committed, in diſſwading <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> from making a Peace, ſo much to your
Advantage; thought of nothing but continuing
the War now kindled in ſo many different
places. The <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> being in very great
diſtreſs, and beginning to cry <hi>Miſerere,</hi> you
ſent <hi>Vallavoir,</hi> with a ſecond Convoy of Corn,
which he had the good luck to conduct ſafely to
'em, tho' the <hi>Spanyards</hi> way-laid him in his
paſſage, with Forces much ſuperiour to his.</p>
               <p>I know not what made <hi>your Majeſty</hi> change
your Modeſt Reſolution concerning the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes:</hi>
You accepted the Soveraignty which at
firſt you refus'd, and ſent thither, in the Quality
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98314:120"/>
of your Vice-roy, the Duke <hi>de Vivonne,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of your Gallies, Brother to <hi>Madam Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan:</hi>
Who becauſe he was her Brother, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> prevail'd to have him preferr'd to
that Command, tho' there were many other
Competitors much ſitter for it. He was indeed
very ſucceſsful at his firſt coming to <hi>Meſſina;</hi>
for he enter'd the Haven in ſpite of the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi>
and took from them a Veſſel of fifty
Guns. He reduced ſome Forts which the
<hi>Spanyards</hi> ſtill kept, and taking the Field, he
drove 'em out of all the Poſts they had within
four Leagues round the Town. That done, he
went abroad again, made a Deſcent upon <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi>
and brought thence a conſiderable Booty.
But when there was moſt need of his doing
ſomewhat to the purpoſe, he ſlept upon his
good Fortune, which occaſion'd many Plots and
Conſpiracies againſt him; however, 'twas his
good Luck, to be deliver'd from 'em all.</p>
               <p>Viſcount <hi>Turenne</hi> being come to his Army,
found it in a very good Condition, by what
Marqueſs <hi>Vaubrun</hi> had done, for ſince the taking
of <hi>Dachſteim,</hi> they had plenty of all Proviſions;
and being eager to Signalize themſelves, he
paſs'd the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and offer'd <hi>Montecueuli</hi> Battel,
which he refuſed. He could not force him to
fight, becauſe he was ſo Advantageouſly Poſted,
but having tryed all ways, he at laſt reduced
him to ſo great a ſcarcity of Victuals and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
that <hi>Montecuculi</hi> muſt have certainly been
forced to decamp firſt, and then <hi>Turenne</hi> would
have fall'n upon him; but advancing to the
top of a Hill, to take a view of the Imperial
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98314:121"/>
Army, he was unfortunately kill'd with a Canon
Bullet.</p>
               <p>This ſad Accident chang'd all things in an
inſtant; ſo true it is, that an Army without a
General, is like a Body without a Soul. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuculi,</hi>
who was making the beſt of his way,
when he knew in what a Conſternation your
Forces were by the Death of Monſieur <hi>Turenne,</hi>
returns again to charge 'em. The Lieutenant
Generals who Commanded, thought of nothing
but repaſſing the <hi>Rhine.</hi> While they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
what courſe to take; a Souldier ſaid a
very pleaſant thing. General <hi>Turenne,</hi> crys the
Fellow aloud, us'd to Ride upon a Pied Horſe,
take the Bridle, and but lay it on his neck, he
will know better than our Commanders where
we ſhould go. But Count <hi>de Lorge</hi> conducted
the Army ſafe over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> after having given
the Enemy Battel; who thought to have made
a much better hand of it.</p>
               <p>The Merit of this great Man, made <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> very ſenſible of his loſs, which will
every day appear greater, by the want you will
find of him. But it was otherwiſe with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy,</hi> who when all <hi>France</hi> mourn'd for
his Death, he and his rejoyc'd. I certainly
know what I tell <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is true, and if he
could have hinder'd his being ſo Honourably
Buried, he would have done it. His Funeral
Pomp was very great, and I know no body but
your Miniſter that ſpoke againſt it. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of thoſe Great Things he had done, is ſo
deeply Ingraved in the Hearts of your Subjects,
that it is hard to ſay, whether he was moſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98314:121"/>
Eſteem'd or Beloved. He did not only deſerve
to be commended for thoſe his Military Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
which are the Glory of a Hero; but
for all other Moral and Chriſtian Vertues ſo,
rarely to be found in one Perſon.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was upon the <hi>Moſelle,</hi>
with his own Troops, and thoſe of <hi>Lunenbourg,
Munſter,</hi> and ſome of the other Confederates,
and having heard of this Accident, laid Siege to
<hi>Treves;</hi> where <hi>Vignori</hi> an old Souldier Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
Of whoſe Experience the Prince of
<hi>Condé</hi> (under whom he had Served all his Life)
aſſured <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> He was not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
at the Siege, knowing Mareſchal <hi>Crequi</hi>
was marching to his Relief; but while he was
giving Orders on Horſeback, his Horſe fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a clap of Thunder, threw him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from a Baſtion, of which he dyed in a few
days. This fatal Accident made the Mareſchal
haſten his March; fearing that <hi>Vignori</hi>'s Death
might ſo diſhearten his Souldiers, as to deliver
up the Town. But the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſav'd
Monſieur <hi>Crequi</hi> the labour of advancing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and met him at <hi>Conſarbrik,</hi> where the
<hi>Sarre</hi> and <hi>Moſelle</hi> join. The Duke paſt the
River, where the Mareſchal, if he pleas'd, might
have taken the advantage of charging part of his
Army, before the reſt could have got over:
But neglecting it, I know not for what Reaſon,
nor perhaps he himſelf, he was ſo ſoundly beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
that all his Troops, ran ſome one way, and
ſome another, and he narrowly eſcaping, with
four more, got into <hi>Treves;</hi> where, in perfect
deſpair, he reſolv'd to bury himſelf in defence
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98314:122"/>
of the Place, tho' it was of no great importance.
Indeed, the reſiſtance he made, was ſo much
greater than the Enemy expected, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him very good Terms; but reſolving not
ſo much as to talk of yielding, a Captain of
Foot called <hi>Boisjourdan,</hi> told the Garriſon they
had nothing to do with the Mareſchal's deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that tho' he had a mind to periſh, yet
they were not bound to follow his Example.
Some were of his Opinion, and told the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,
the Place was not in a Condition to hold
out any longer; but his Paſſion not permitting
them to ſay any more. <hi>Boisjourdan</hi> Treated with
the Enemy, and let 'em into the Town. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>Crequi</hi> ſaved himſelf in the Church,
where he reſolved with ſome Officers, who did
not approve of what <hi>Boisjourdan</hi> had done, to
ſtand it out; but ſeeing the Enemy preparing to
force 'em, they told the Mareſchal, <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
and all <hi>France,</hi> would blame his deſperate Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and at laſt perſwaded him to yield at
diſcretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> in truth was not pleas'd with
what he had done, and would have been leſs
ſatisfy'd if his deſperation had carry'd him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But knowing what was done by <hi>Bois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jourdan,</hi>
was an ill Example not to be endur'd,
you cauſed him to be ſeized, and he and ſome
of his Companions were Condemn'd by a
Council of War to be Beheaded. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was Executed at <hi>Metz</hi> in the preſence of
the Garriſon: No body pitying him, becauſe
no Souldier can be a Man of Honour, who is
guilty of Diſobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:98314:122"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> after theſe ill Succeſſes, had
reaſon to fear the Enemy would enter into
<hi>France;</hi> but your Prudence prevented it, by
raiſing a Jealouſie between the Princes of the
Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi>
the Princes, maugre all the Duke could ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to return to their Country. 'Tis the Fate
of Confederates never to agree, what one will,
the other will not, and it would be a Miracle
to ſee them hold together, while they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Intereſts; which is the Reaſon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
ſo ſeldom proſper.</p>
               <p>After the Death of Monſieur <hi>Turenne, your
Majeſty</hi> fearing the Enemy would prevail in
<hi>Alſatia,</hi> you ſent thither the Duke <hi>de Duras,</hi>
whom three days after his Uncle's Death, you
had made a Mareſchal of <hi>France.</hi> You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
the ſame Honour on ſome other Officers,
and Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> ſo far prevail'd with you,
as to let Marqueſs <hi>Rochefort</hi> be one of that
number, tho' he had done nothing more than he
had before to deſerve it. The others were the
Count <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> whom
you had recalled from his Baniſhment, Count
<hi>de Schomberg,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Vivonne,</hi> the Duke
<hi>de la Feuillade,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg.</hi>
But becauſe the Duke <hi>de Duras</hi> had not ſo much
Experience as his Uncle, you gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whoſe Reputation
only was of great advantage to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
in the preſent conjuncture.</p>
               <p>The Enemy having paſt the <hi>Rhine</hi> at the
Bridge of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> (the ſecond time this
Town had falſify'd their Promiſe to you) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98314:123"/>
they ſhould preſently take <hi>Hagenau;</hi> but
the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> having oblig'd them to
raiſe the Siege, they attacqued <hi>Saverne,</hi> which
they thought to carry with more eaſe. But
their Succeſs there was the ſame they had at
<hi>Hagenau,</hi> ſo that this Campaign, which at firſt
threatned <hi>your Majeſty</hi> with a turn of Fortune,
ended ſo little to your diſadvantage, that <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> had no cauſe to fear on that ſide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sweeds</hi> came not off ſo well. They were
at laſt advanc'd into the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>'s
Country, where they took ſome Poſts of
no great conſequence; but they went on ſo
ſlowly, that they ſeem'd to act in concert with
the Elector; he taking as little care to oppoſe
them. But the Elector knowing that the King
of <hi>Sweden</hi> being preſs'd by <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> would
at laſt act more vigorouſly againſt him, made
haſte out of <hi>Holland,</hi> where he then was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his own Country; and had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
as ſoon as he arriv'd, to rout the <hi>Swedes</hi>
at a Paſs called <hi>Felbeling.</hi> They loſt there the
greateſt part of their Cannon and Baggage, a
blow they could not recover, during that Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne.
The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who with the
Princes of the Family of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> took part
with the Elector, had now an opportunity to do
his own buſineſs. They all at one time fell upon
the <hi>Swede,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> in the Iſle
of <hi>Rugen,</hi> and ſome other of his Frontiers. And
finding little reſiſtance any where, the King of
<hi>Denmark</hi> beſieged and took <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Port upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:98314:123"/>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> having now more Reaſon than
ever, to be ſenſible of the ill Service Monſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> had done you, in perſwading you not to
make Peace; accepted of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s
Mediation, which he offer'd to all the Princes
engaged in the War, in order to make an end
of it. They all conſented as you did, and ſent
their Plenepotentiaries to <hi>Nimeghen,</hi> where
yours arriv'd firſt. The <hi>Spanyard</hi> till now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
moſt averſe to the Peace; but the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Meſſina</hi> had brought down his Pride, and
he fear'd that you would become Maſter of the
whole Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> as you already were of
the Capital City, and of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> where the
Duke of <hi>Vivonne</hi> had plac'd a Garriſon. This
laſt Town was not conſiderable for its ſtrength,
but being a Retreat for your Shipping, was of
great advantage to <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> on the other ſide were grown
weary of the War, which was a very great
Charge to 'em, by the Subſidies they had paid
to thoſe Princes who came to their aſſiſtance.
Beſide, they began to think they were not ſo
much concern'd in the War, <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
having quitted their Country, and there was
now no more to be conſider'd, but the Intereſts
of the Emperour, with thoſe of the Princes of
the Empire. But thoſe being ſo different, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
the Peace; ſince it is certain they had
leſs reaſon to diſtruſt <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> than their
own Party. For as the Emperour's Power which
he inſenſibly increas'd, gave great cauſe of
Jealouſie to all the Princes; ſo the Emperour
on his part, could not be well pleas'd, to ſee
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98314:124"/>
them maintain a good Correſpondence one with
another, and often confer together concerning
their Intereſts, without calling him to their
Councils.</p>
               <p>Things being in this condition at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Year 1676, Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who
had ſtill a Spleen againſt me, about the buſineſs
of the <hi>Routes,</hi> endeavour'd to be even with me
in an Affair relating to the <hi>Finances,</hi> wherein he
ſuſpected I had been tampering. But I made it
appear to <hi>your Majeſty</hi> as clear as the day, that
I was no way concern'd in it, and that if any
thing had been done which could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<hi>Damarets</hi> my Nephew was to be called to
an Account for it; who had had the ordering of
the whole buſineſs. I told <hi>your Majeſty</hi> at the
ſame time, I would not be anſwerable for him,
knowing him to be a dangerous Perſon where
there was any thing to be got. I never truſted
him he was ſo Covetous, yet I was one of the
firſt he endeavour'd to deceive. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
was much more kind to him than he deſerved;
you gave him a Hundred Thouſand Crowns,
in the firſt buſineſs he undertook for you; but
there are ſome People ſo inſatiable, that ſhould
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> give 'em half your Kingdom, they
would not be contented. However, you were
ſo gracious to him, as to paſs all by for my ſake,
which is not the only thing for which I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to <hi>your Majeſty.</hi> Tho' I can ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
boaſting, I never had recourſe to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be pardon'd for defrauding or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> I have always endeavour'd
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98314:124"/>
to walk uprightly, and I deſie any Perſon to
accuſe me of the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Heir of one Named <hi>Friois,</hi> by Nation a
<hi>Swiſs,</hi> who had got a very conſiderable Eſtate
in your Kingdom, could teſtifie what I ſay,
were he call'd to it. <hi>Friois</hi> dyed very Old, and
was never Married. The Perſon of whom I ſpeak,
as Heir to him, claimed what he left; but was
oppos'd by one that Farmed <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes,</hi>
who pretended a Title to it in <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s
Right, becauſe <hi>Friois</hi> was a Baſtard: So
that according to the Law of your Kingdom,
all he had got belong'd to him that had got the
King's Title. This Conteſt, put them upon
making Friends. He pretended Heir to the
<hi>Swiſſe,</hi> thinking he could find no body that
could do him more Service than my ſelf, offer'd
me Two Hundred Thouſand Francks, if I would
ſtand by him. I told him, no Sum, were it never ſo
great, could tempt me to do any thing that was
unjuſt; ſo that ſeeing he could do nothing with
me, he addreſs'd himſelf to ſome very near
Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who for that Summ (divided
among 'em,) did his buſineſs. <hi>Villacerf</hi> and
<hi>Pouange</hi> had Twenty Thouſand Crowns apiece;
<hi>Stouppa,</hi> and a certain Man whoſe Name I have
forgot had the reſt. The Farmer of <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s
<hi>Demeſnes</hi> made his Complaint to me, and
pray'd me to inform <hi>your Majeſty</hi> what wrong
had been done him; but I found <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
ſo prepoſſeſt, that it was impoſſible for me to
do any thing for him.</p>
               <p>I know many other Caſes, wherein there
hath been the like prevarication; and <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:98314:125"/>
may be aſſur'd, that during the War,
there hath been a baſe unworthy Trade of Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vacant Places, even ſo low as Enſigns. This
hath made one <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of a pittiful
Scrivener ſo Rich, that he thinks himſelf a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
for Perſons of the beſt Quality. 'Tis by
the like abuſe, <hi>Charpentier</hi> and <hi>Bynot</hi> his Brother-in-Law,
are become ſo wealthy; tho' one but
the Son of a little Townſman of <hi>Compeigne,</hi> and
the other the Son of a Sergeant of <hi>Tonnere.
Your Majeſty</hi> may make bold with theſe Mens
Purſes when you have occaſion for Mony, and
need not fear any body will find fault with it.
The one will throw up whole Companies he
hath ſold, and the others will diſgorge the
Blood of entire Corporations, wherewith they
have fatted themſelves. The poor Village of
<hi>Courtiſoux</hi> in <hi>Champaign,</hi> whoſe Wealth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
only in Cheeſes, hath for ſeveral Years
given <hi>Charpentier</hi> three thouſand Livers, <hi>per an.</hi>
to free them from Quartering Souldiers: But
when they could no longer pay him ſo great a
Summ, and deſired an Abatement; he forgot
their Preſents, and order'd Souldiers in their
paſſage, to Quarter upon 'em.</p>
               <p>I might fill this Paper with the like Abuſes,
yet ſhould never have done. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
knows it was not long ſince I ſhew'd how you
were cheated, in what was appointed to defray
the extraordinary Expence of the War. Where
you were made to pay one Regiment twice, by
a ſecret Compact between the Commiſſary and
the Treaſurer. I know very well this cannot
be directly charg'd upon Monſieur <hi>Louvoy;</hi> but
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98314:125"/>
as he is bound to Anſwer for thoſe that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
by him, ſo 'tis he, and not I, that is to
ſuperviſe them. My place finds me work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and I deſire no new Imployment. 'Tis
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> is concern'd, and your People,
upon whom the burden of all theſe diſorders
falls; becauſe 'tis from them you expect Mony,
when your Exchequer is empty. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give you a particular Account of theſe
Frauds, 'tis impoſſible for me to do it, without
depriving my ſelf every Night of four or five
Hours ſleep, which are abſolutely neceſſary for
my Repoſe, after I am quite wearied with more
Buſineſs than I am able to bear. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
I hope will reflect on what I have ſaid
when you think fit, in the mean time, I return
again to the proſecution of your Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Spoil which the Garriſon of <hi>Phillipsbourg</hi>
made in the Elector <hi>Palatin</hi>'s Country, oblig'd
the Emperour (to be rid of his continual impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,)
to keep that place block'd up all the
Winter; and promis'd him to take the Thorn
quite out of his Foot, by beſieging it in the
Spring, which no body durſt undertake while
Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> was alive. The Count <hi>de
Lorges</hi> importun'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to beſtow the
ſame favour on him, that you had upon his
Brother, and ſo many others whom you have
Honoured as I have already ſaid, with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal's
Staff of <hi>France.</hi> He brought to your
Account the Service he did <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> in
conducting your Army over the <hi>Rhine</hi> after his
Uncle's Death, and the long time he had ſerv'd
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> You had no great mind to grant
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98314:126"/>
his Requeſt, not but that you thought him a
Man Brave enough, and that he very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
his Trade: But having a ſmall Eſtate,
you thought he would be unable to ſupport the
Dignity of his Title. Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> who
look'd upon him as the Nephew of a Man he
never lov'd, did him ill Offices, believing he
would never be his Friend. When I perceiv'd
it, and that your unwillingneſs to grant Count
<hi>de Lorge</hi>'s Requeſt, was only for the Reaſon I
have now mention'd; I told <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> if
the Count would make Love to <hi>Fremont</hi>'s
Daughter, and had but her Father's good Word,
I would undertake he ſhould certainly get her.
Now to do him effectual Service, I threatned
<hi>Fremont</hi> under-hand, to have him queſtion'd
concerning ſome Affairs, and how he came to
be counted the Richeſt Man in all <hi>Paris.</hi> This
frighted him, and knowing he had need of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
he hearken'd to the Propoſition made
by Count <hi>de Lorge;</hi> upon condition he was
firſt made a Mareſchal of <hi>France.</hi> I acquainted
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> with what was like to happen in
Count <hi>Lorge</hi>'s Favour, ſo that you being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
this Marriage would much better his
Condition, you gave him the Staff he ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſired. He then Married <hi>Mademoiſelle
de Fremont,</hi> who brought him ſo great a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he bought with ready Mony, the
Captain's Place of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Guards. He
alſo Treated for the County of <hi>Quintin,</hi> which
is one of the moſt conſiderable Eſtates in all
<hi>Brittany;</hi> the Yearly Rent whereof amounts to
Fifty Thouſand Livers. And as Fortune, when
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98314:126"/>
Men begin to be Happy, heaps upon 'em her
Favours; ſo it fell out in this caſe, for he of
whom this Land was bought, who was to have
his Debts diſcharg'd, and a great Penſion paid
him during his Life, died in a ſhort time after,
ſo that Mareſchal <hi>de Lorge</hi> had a very good
bargain.</p>
               <p>What I had contributed to his good Fortune,
made Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> keep him out of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this Campaign, tho' he had behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
much better than Mareſchal <hi>Rochefort,</hi> who
did not Execute his Orders, to put Men and
Proviſions into <hi>Phillipsbourg. Your Majeſty</hi> knows
what a Fault he committed in endeavouring it,
and that he dyed with grief for having fail'd in
the attempt; which was more for want of
Courage than Conduct. This ſhould teach us
never to be exalted too high, leſt our Heads
turn, and our Fall be the greater. A Man may
get that Reputation in an inferior Poſt, which
perhaps he would loſe in a higher. Prudence
prompts us to meaſure our Ambition, by the
knowledge we have of our ſelves; otherwiſe
to our own ruin we may find there was Truth

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> open'd this Campaign with the
taking of <hi>Condé,</hi> which was follow'd by that of
<hi>Bouchain.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> drew near
your Army in order to their relief, but did not
think it ſafe to attack you, with an Army ſo
much inferiour to yours. After the taking theſe
two Places, you return'd to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> leaving
the greateſt part of your Army under the
Command of Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg.</hi> The reſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98314:127"/>
you ſent to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
was there at the Head of the Emperour's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and at laſt beſieged <hi>Phillisbourg;</hi> which
made ſo good a defence, that the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
had as much time as he could wiſh, for
the relieving it.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſat down before
<hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> where the Commander in chief (as
the Governour of <hi>Phillipsbourg</hi> had done) ſo well
perform'd his Duty, that Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg</hi>
gave Mareſchal <hi>Humieres,</hi> time enough to form
the Siege of <hi>Aires.</hi> For which he lent him part
of his Troops, but recalling them again when
the Siege was ended, he Marched directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> ſo that there had been a
bloody Battel, if the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had
loſt ſix weeks time, and ſix or ſeven thouſand
Men at this Siege, had not thought fit to
quit it.</p>
               <p>This proſperous Succeſs of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
Arms, made the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſick of the War; but
that which troubled them more, was, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
that befel them the beginning of this
Year at <hi>Meſſina.</hi> They had ſent into thoſe Seas
the Famous <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> who from being at firſt
but a common Sailer, was now preferr'd to the
chief Command of their Fleet. Never was a
Man more fam'd upon the two Seas, he came
off ſo bravely in all Engagements, that his very
Name was enough to make his Party Victorious;
but your Fleet got the better of him. About
three Months after, not thinking himſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
beaten, he try'd a ſecond Engagement,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98314:127"/>
and was worſe handled than at firſt, for he was
not only beaten, but received a wound, of
which in ten days after he dyed at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe two Victories, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> could
deſire nothing more to compleat your Glory,
and continue your Protection to the <hi>Meſſineſes,</hi>
than to have had the like happy end of all
your Enterpriſes in <hi>Germany.</hi> But the Duke of
<hi>Luxembourg</hi> met with ſo many difficulties there,
that having tryed a hundred ways in vain to
relieve <hi>Phillipsbourg;</hi> he quite abandon'd the
deſign. So that after a Siege of more than three
Months, the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had never
yet commanded in chief, had the pleaſure of
reducing ſo ſtrong a place. But he was like to
have met his Death in the midſt of his Triumph,
for the Bridge by which he was to enter into the
Town, as he was paſſing over it, fell under
him: Which, Report ſays, was contriv'd by
ſome of the Greateſt Perſons in the Emperor's
Court, who ſeeing him in ſo much Favour, had
reſolv'd to deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> continued the War, but unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
loſt <hi>Elſembourg, Lanſcron, Chriſtianſtat,</hi>
and ſome other places. And tho' they had an
advantage over Major General <hi>Duncan,</hi> and a
Victory at <hi>Lunden,</hi> yet were they never the
better for it.</p>
               <p>Fortune was conſtant to none but <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
The City of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> fell into your Hands the
next Campaign, tho' it was one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and defended by a good
Garriſon. If you would have taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
you might have put all to the Sword;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98314:128"/>
but your Clemency became an Advocate for
thoſe poor unhappy People, and you freely gave
'em both their Lives and Goods, when they did
not expect to have ſaved either. After this,
you attack'd <hi>Cambray</hi> and St. <hi>Omer</hi> at a time;
which oblig'd you to divide your Forces, ſo
that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> thought now or never
was his time to do ſomewhat. He advanc'd as
far as <hi>Caſſel,</hi> where he was defeated by Monſieur
your Brother: After which <hi>Cambray</hi> and St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
did not long hold out; <hi>your Majeſty</hi> having
done all this before the time other Generals uſe
to take the Field, your Reputation (which
was already very great throughout all Europe)
was now exalted to ſo high a degree of Glory,
that you were look'd upon as the greateſt Man
in the Univerſe</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whoſe great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Soul did rather emulate than envy your
brave Exploits; redoubled his Courage, and came
to your Frontiers at the Head of a gallant Army.
Having taken <hi>Mouzon,</hi> a Place of no defence,
he ſent a Detachment over the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> which
put the Province of <hi>Champagne</hi> into a Fright,
but did them no great harm: For this Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
durſt not go far from their Army, nor
their Army follow the Detachment, Mareſchal
<hi>Crequi</hi> being advanc'd in order to obſerve 'em.
But 'tis not ſo eaſy a thing to enter into an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Country, for a General muſt conſider,
whether he can go out again when he pleaſes;
eſpecially when he hath no Places near to retreat
to, nor Neighbours from whom he can expect
any aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:98314:128"/>
However, the Prince of <hi>Lorrain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of entring again into his own Country, to
which he now pretended a greater right than
before, by the Death of his Uncle, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a little after the taking of <hi>Treves.</hi> But ſince
this depended upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who
had promis'd to march into <hi>France;</hi> he waited for
the Effects of that Promiſe, to regulate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
his own Attempts. The Prince of <hi>Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge</hi>'s
hope was grounded upon <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
way of proſecuting the War: You had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Troops, but made uſe of them with that
Judgment and Prudence, that tho' the Enemy's
forces were more numerous than yours, yet
every Year you added ſome Town to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
which you did by keeping your Troops
together all the Winter; whereas the Enemy
was oblig'd to ſeparate theirs, and quarter them
in places ſo remote from one another, that they
could not come together, when you open'd the
Campaign. Taking this courſe, you did your
Buſineſs early in the Spring, and then ſending
a Detachment into <hi>Germany,</hi> you acted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Part in <hi>Flanders</hi> all the reſt of the
Campaign.</p>
               <p>It was upon this account, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
reſolv'd ſo late in the Year to attempt the Siege
of <hi>Charleroy.</hi> I have already told <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
why he had ſuch a mind to this Place: But he
had now another Reaſon, he pretended if he
took it, he could march into <hi>France</hi> when he
would, tho' he was much miſtaken in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
for upon notice that Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg</hi>
was marching directly to him, and that <hi>your
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98314:129"/>
Majeſty</hi> was preparing to follow, he ſtay'd for
it her, but rais'd the Siege.</p>
               <p>Upon this Check given to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſaw he could no longer
depend upon him, but fruſtrated of his hopes,
he quitted <hi>Mouzon,</hi> and march'd back again up
the <hi>Rhine:</hi> Mareſchal <hi>Crequi</hi> followed him, and
after divers Encampments on both ſides, they
came ſo near together at <hi>Kokesberg,</hi> that there
paſs'd a very hot Skirmiſh between 'em. The
Emperour's Cuiraſſiers handled <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
light Horſe very rudely; but your Guards <hi>de
Maiſon</hi> had the ſame advantage over them; ſo
that both Armies fled before, and purſu'd the
Enemy in half an Hour's time.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> judging by this little
Tryal, that it was better to go into Winter-Quarters,
than to ſtay longer in the Field,
retreated farther back into <hi>Germany.</hi> Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>Crequi</hi> made a feignt, as if he would have
done the like; but marching back again, he
attack'd and took <hi>Fribourg,</hi> before the Prince
could come to relieve it.</p>
               <p>You beat the Enemy in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and ravag'd
that Country every Year. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt
there the Battel of <hi>Pouille:</hi> Nor could they do
any thing at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> tho' they diſtributed a
great deal of Money, in hopes to have 'em cut
the Throats of your Garriſon. Your finiſh'd this
proſperous Campaign, with the taking of St. <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>
which ſo abated the Courage of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
that tho the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Daughter, and promis'd
by that Match to make <hi>England</hi> declare for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98314:129"/>
them, yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> had more mind than ever,
to make Peace.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> had ſerv'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſo
well in all your Enterprizes, and was become ſo
great a Favourite, that I was no longer able to
ſtand againſt him. When Chancellor <hi>Seguier</hi>
died, I was a Competitor with Monſieur <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>'s
Father for that Place, which he did all he
could to obtain for him, I got my ſelf to be
made an Advocate, A Qualification requir'd in
the Perſon that hath that Office; but <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
to reconcile us, gave it to Monſieur <hi>d' Alligre</hi>
Councellor of State, tho' his great Age and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
render'd him incapable to execute it;
ſo that his Son officiated for him: But he was of
ſo odd a Humour, that no body car'd to have any
thing to do with him. <hi>D' Alligre</hi> dying, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Tellier</hi> and I renew'd our Conteſt, which
laſted not long on my Part; for <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
commanded me to quit my Pretenſions, and
gave that honourable Office to Monſieur <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Marriage wrought a
real Change in <hi>England;</hi> it begot ſuch conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
debates, that the King of <hi>England</hi> was in a
manner forc'd to ſign a League againſt <hi>your
Majeſty:</hi> He re-demanded his Troops, which
(not being able to refuſe) you ſent back to him.
But by ſo long a way about, that Monſieur <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
had time to debauch the greateſt part of
'em. For inſtead of ſuffering them to imbarque
at <hi>Calais,</hi> or ſome Port near their Country, he
choſe one that was fartheſt off; pretending that
his Britanick Majeſty had no juſt cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98314:130"/>
becauſe no particular place was nam'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
your Treaty with him. Which may ſerve for
a Leſſon to all publick Miniſters, when they
treat with a foreign Prince: For if the leaſt
thing be omitted in their Negotiation, they
may be ſure it will be made uſe of againſt their
Maſter; and when a Fault is once done, 'tis too
late to think of mending it.</p>
               <p>This Change in <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Affairs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
you to quit <hi>Meſſina;</hi> where there was no
longer any ſafety for your Troops: For if the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> joyned their Forces with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it
was impoſſible to reſiſt them. This was what I
long ago foreſaw, and I took the liberty to tell
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that you would be neceſſitated to
augment your Fleet, by building more Ships:
but Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who would, if he could,
have deſtroy'd the Marine Eſtabliſhment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
oppos'd it; pretending two Reaſons for
it. The Firſt, That no cauſe of Jealouſie was
to be given to <hi>England.</hi> The other, That your
Kingdom was not able to ſupport ſo great a
Charge. He made uſe of the ſame Pretence,
to diſſuade <hi>your Majeſty</hi> from the making a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
upon the Coaſt of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which you
will want, in caſe you ever have a War with
<hi>England:</hi> For if your Ships at any time ſhould
receive much Damage, where ſhall they find a
Retreat? 'Tis a long way out of the Channel to
<hi>Breſt</hi> and <hi>Rochefort,</hi> which ought to be ſeriouſly
conſider'd by <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not long ago I gave you my Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſuch a Port. The Bay of <hi>Colville,</hi> ſeems
a Place to have been expreſly deſign'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98314:130"/>
for it. I thought <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> when you
had heard my Reaſons was ſo well ſatisfied, that
you would preſently have given order to begin
the Work. But I ſince underſtood that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> put by the Buſineſs, tho' ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for the good of your Kingdom,
inſinuating that the Place I have mention'd, was
not ſo ſit as I repreſented it: And that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why I did ſo much commend it, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I was willing to oblige the Houſe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon,</hi>
to which my Son was ally'd; whoſe
Lands lying near the Place, and they having the
King's Lieutenancy in that Country, it would
both increaſe their revenue, and augment their
Credit.</p>
               <p>What Poyſon there is in Malice, and what
dangerous Effects it doth produce, I leave <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> to judge. But it ſeems very difficult
for a great King, who ſees with other Mens
Eyes, to defend himſelf againſt the Artifice of
thoſe that would deceive him; eſpecially, when
they have done him ſuch Services, as may incline
them to think their Intention is good. I know
but one way for a Prince to ſecure himſelf in
ſuch caſes, which is to truſt no body; but ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to examine things himſelf, and rather be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place to ſee what is done, than be deceiv'd
by being too credulous; for in truſting a third
Perſon, there are many Inconveniences. There are
few Princes but muſt rely upon a Miniſter in moſt
of their Affairs; and tho' it is not ſo in <hi>your
Majeſty's</hi> Court, where there are two or three
Perſons, who will not bend and ſubmit to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi>'s Authority; yet for certain, there
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98314:131"/>
is a ſecret Jealouſie ſtill retain'd in the Heart
which commonly works the very Effects that
are fear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> Prudence, which never forſakes
you in the reverſe of Fortune, ſeem'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe:
you were not at all daunted with the
Change of his <hi>Britanick Majeſty;</hi> but on the
contrary rather made it ſerviceable to you, in
bringing the <hi>Dutch</hi> to a Peace. You put ſuch
Jealouſies into their Heads, that they wrote to
their Embaſſadors, they ſhould endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all Difficulties that would obviate a
Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> knowing that the way to make
them more deſirous of it, was to terrifie them
by ſome new Conqueſt; you beſieg'd the City
of <hi>Gand,</hi> which made little reſiſtance. You
knew ſo well how to blind your Enemies, by
pretending to attack ſome other Place, that the
Town was in a manner taken, before they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
your Deſign. You afterward made your
ſelf Maſter of <hi>Ypres,</hi> and of Fort <hi>Lewen;</hi> which
by its advantageous Scituation, was thought
impregnable: But was ſurpriz'd one clear Night
by the Garriſon of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and taken by
Scalado.</p>
               <p>Such proſperous proceedings ſhould in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
have made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as deſirous
of a Peace, as the <hi>Dutch;</hi> But they knowing
that what had paſs'd in <hi>England,</hi> had already
made <hi>your Majeſty</hi> quit <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and inferring
from thence, the League they had made with
that Crown, would do Miracles in their Favour;
they endeavour'd to keep the <hi>Dutch</hi> from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98314:131"/>
a Peace; but <hi>your Maieſty</hi> remov'd all
thoſe Obſtacles, by a piece of Policy which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
will admire. You concluded a ſeparate
Peace with <hi>Holland:</hi> But before the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> was inform'd of it, he concluded, if he
fell upon your Army, which then block'd up
<hi>Mons,</hi> and could give it a Blow, he ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the concluſion of the Treaty; he very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
charg'd your Troops; The Duke of
<hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who had heard the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and imagin'd the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
knew it, relying upon it, was not in ſuch a
Poſture of Defence, as he ſhould have been, ſo
that he and the Intendant had like to have been
taken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Emperour were, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, ſo happy as to come to an accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> but the Northern Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were unwilling to reſtore to the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> what they had taken from him. <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> oblig'd them to it by the Treaty you
had ſign'd; in conſideration of which, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
<hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and ſeveral
Places to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> from whom you had
lately taken <hi>Puicerda.</hi> Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
who was this Year come again into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
where he made no better a Campaign than
he did the Year before; becauſe Mareſchal <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi>
not only prevented his deſign of retaking <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg;</hi>
but beat a party of his Troops in the
Plain of <hi>Rhinfield,</hi> took <hi>Sekinghem, Offembourg,</hi> the
Fort of <hi>Kell,</hi> burnt the Bridge of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and
did ſo many other Exploits in that Country, as
made him paſs for another <hi>Turenne.</hi> The Prince of

                  <hi>Lorrdin</hi> I ſay, was comprehended in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Treaty, by which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to reſtore to him his Country; but under
ſuch hard conditions, that rather than ſubmit to

This Princeſs, who would have been

to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> he kept a Woman, and as ſome ſay,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98314:133"/>
caus'd her Uncle to be drown'd, becauſe he was
againſt their living ſo ſcandalouſly together.
<hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> who will ſuffer no ſuch Diſorders,
commanded me to ſend and Exempt of your
Guards to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> to bring away the Woman
to Priſon, who was ſupected to be acceſſary to
the drowning of her Uncle; but he had ſent her
into <hi>England;</hi> ſo that the Exempt came back
without her.</p>
               <p>This was a Leſſon, one would have thought,
might have made the Son wiſer. But Examples
are ſometimes to very little purpoſe, unleſs we
have diſpoſitions in our ſelves to make good uſe
of them. This Prince, tho' he Married a very
handſome diſcreet vertuous Woman, yet car'd
very little for her, and manag'd all his other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
ſo imprudently, that by his own fault, he
loſt a very great fortune. The Family of <hi>Guiſe</hi>
was extinct by the death of the laſt Duke of that
name, who was the Son of a daughter of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Duke of <hi>Orleans, your Majeſty's</hi> Uncle.
Madam <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Heireſs to the deceaſed Duke,
was an old Princeſs never marry'd, and being a
very good Woman, had a mind to revive her
Family. She caſt her Eyes upon Prince <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court;</hi>
a Friend of hers, but who was more a
Friend to the Prince, having given her a
very good Character of him: So that ſhe ſold
him the Dutchy of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> whereof the yearly
Rent amounted to Forty Thouſand Crowns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
other Lands: He not being Maſter of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
enough to pay for it, ſhe acquitted him of
a Million. But inſtead of giving his Friend
Thanks, who had done him ſo great a Kindneſs;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98314:133"/>
he began to ſpeak ill of him to the Princeſs,
who judging by his horrible Ingratitude, what
an unworthy Man he was, undid all all ſhe had
done, having by contract reſerv'd to her ſelf,
a Power of Revocation. Thus we ſee, what
great Fortune Men ſometimes loſe by their own
Folly. But to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Praiſe be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
you gave the Duke of <hi>Main</hi> better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
when you preach'd Gratitude to him, on
the like Occaſion, when Madam <hi>Montpenſier</hi>
gave him the Principality of <hi>Dombes,</hi> and the
County of <hi>Deu:</hi> Two as conſiderabe Eſtates as
any in <hi>France;</hi> whereof, one alone coſt Seven
Hundred Thouſand Crowns. Certainly, there
can be no Fault in Man, greater than Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and if it be ſo great in a Private Man,
'tis much more in a Prince, who ought to
have a generous Soul, and a Diſpoſition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to do Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> whoſe Power was become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
greater, by the advantageous Peace
you had made: began a war in your own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
which neceſſity had for a while kept
back, the Circumſtances of your Affairs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you not to diſturb the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> of whom
you long ago reſolv'd to purge your Kingdom;
but you went on with this Work, firſt by taking
away the Chambers of the Edict, eſtabliſh'd in
the Parliaments of <hi>Tholouſe, Bourdeaux,</hi> and
<hi>Grenoble.</hi> Your Reputation was great enough
now to venture upon many things, which you
durſt not attempt before. You caus'd Maſs to
be ſaid in <hi>Geneva,</hi> which had never been done
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98314:134"/>
ſince the Year 1535, when the Prieſts were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of that Town.</p>
               <p>There are certain times more proper than
others, to give ſucceſs to what one undertakes;
and it is in chuſing ſuch times, that a Prince
ſhews his admirable Prudence. A Prince cannot
expect abſolute Submiſſion to his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
till he hath magnified his Name, by ſome
great Actions; and he ought to know, that
ſometimes his Reputation will do him more
Service, than his Power.</p>
               <p>The Neutrality which the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
obſerv'd during the War, coſt <hi>your Majeſty</hi> a
great deal of ready Money. Beſide, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
the Dutcheſs his Wife, that Monſeigneur
the <hi>Dauphin</hi> ſhould marry their Daughter: But
ſeeing a Prince ſhould always take care before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what he promiſeth, becauſe he muſt never
break his word; you ſent to enquire whether
this were like to be a ſit Match, and whether
this Princeſs's Perſon and good Qualities did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſo good a Husband. But finding nothing
to diſcourage you from deſiring this Allyance, a
good Education, a great deal of Wit, and in
appearance, great reſpect for <hi>your Majeſty</hi> and
the Dauphin; who tho' he were not above
Nineteen Years of Age, yet you reſolv'd no
longer to defer marrying him; you ſent my
Brother who had been one of your Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries
at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to
conclude this Match; and you were ſo impatient
to hear whether ſome Obſtacles were remov'd,
which he met with, becauſe her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were dead, that you ordered him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98314:134"/>
Courier upon Courier, to bring <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> Intelligence how things went. He who
was firſt ſent to give you notice the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
was ſign'd, went, as was uſual, to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Pompone,</hi> Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, which Place you beſtow'd on him, when
he leaſt dreamt of it, and for which he was
oblig'd to Monſieur <hi>Tellier,</hi> who fearing you
would have given it to Cardinal <hi>Donzi,</hi> or to
the Preſident <hi>de Mêmes,</hi> who both ſtood for it;
and that their Merit would have eclips'd his
Son's, who was not yet in his full Luſtre. He
therefore imploy'd his Credit with <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi>
in Favour of Monſieur <hi>Pompone;</hi> ſince
which, Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> hath been ſtill deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to unite this Secretaryſhip to his, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>your Majeſty</hi> he ought to do the Buſineſs
of both, and that the Secrets of the War, and
of Foreign Affairs, ought to be in the Hands
of one Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> had the Goodneſs to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to me, what had paſt. Whereupon I took
the Liberty to ſay, that it did not become Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> to be ſo Ambitious: That it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
by what he deſir'd, he had an itch of
commanding others, which perhaps another
Monarch wou'd not like. That by his Carriage
he gave People occaſion to think, nothing cou'd
ſatisfie him, till you had put your Crown upon
his Head; and that if I were in your Place, I
would give him ſuch an Anſwer, as ſhould teach
him to know himſelf ſo well, as never for the
Future to make the like Requeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:98314:135"/>
In this Condition were things, when my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſent me a Duplicate of the Letter he had
written to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> but which Monſieur
<hi>Pompone</hi> had not yet deliver'd, becauſe he was
in the Country looking after his Building. I
complemented <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> thinking I ſhould
tell you nothing but what you already knew;
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> anſwer'd, Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> had
given you no notice of any thing, and that you
wonder'd at it. When Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and would have excus'd his Fault, <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> told him he might go home again, ſince
he had ſo much Buſineſs of his own, and that you
would put another in his Place, that ſhould take
more care to do his Duty: And at the ſame
time ſent for me, and told me that you wou'd
give Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi>'s Place to my Brother.
I thank'd <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> and diſpatch'd a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
to <hi>Munick,</hi> to acquaint my Brother with
the good News.</p>
               <p>I know very well, what a Story ſome made
of this Buſineſs It was ſaid, I held Intelligence
with my Brother, and that I receiv'd a Letter
from him, before Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> had any,
and that we play'd him this Trick to get his
Place. But I appeal to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knows than any Perſon whatever, the Truth
of all that paſs'd in this Affair.</p>
               <p>This Favour which <hi>your Majeſty</hi> did me,
was a new Subject of Jealouſie for Monſieur
<hi>Louvoy.</hi> But not daring publickly to ſhew his
Malice till he had a fit Opportunity; he ſoon
met with one, at leaſt he thought it ſuch,
ſeeing he did not fail to ſpeak againſt me to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98314:135"/>
                  <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> you daily went on with the
Works at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> or to ſay Truth, you were
re-building it new from the Ground: For you
had twice pull'd it down, to build it according
to a new Model that had been given you.
But tho' it be not uſual to ſee a Floor fall in a
new built Houſe, there did one ſink, which
alarm'd the whole Court, every one being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
frighted. Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> made a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Noiſe about it than any body elſe, and I
knew he indeavour'd to perſwade <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
that I was not ſo Honeſt as I ſhould he, in my
Overſeer's Place of your Buildings. That I
and the Workmen agreed together, or elſe it
was impoſſible <hi>your Majeſty</hi> could be ſo ill ſerv'd.
As you did me the Juſtice not to believe it,
ſo you had the Goodneſs not to tell me
what he had ſaid; but being inform'd of the
Diſcourſe he had with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> I was
quickly even with him, in telling you; that if to
prove a Man a Knave, who had the overſight of
others, there needed no more, than to ſhew
that thoſe who were employ'd by him, did not
do their work well. Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> was more
faulty than I, for he had ordered many Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to be erected, which were no ſooner fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
but under ſpecious Pretences were pull'd
down again; and that in many of your Garriſon
Towns, it was obſerv'd, things were done and
undone, without ſeeing any neceſſity for it.
That <hi>your Majeſty</hi> knew that I had done nothing
but by your Command, and that I never in my
Life propos'd of my ſelf, the pulling down any
Building. That Builders and Workmen had
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98314:136"/>
play'd the Knaves, could not be deny'd, but I made
them, at their own Charge, build up again, not
only what had fallen down, but that alſo which
ſhould be found defective. And it were to be
wiſh'd, the like would be done for <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
in all Places where Faults may be found: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
at <hi>Tournay,</hi> where the Engineers have
done nothing well. They made a Ditch much
wider than it ſhould have been, but he that ſet
them to Work, never found fault with them,
till <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſpoke your ſelf of it: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of doing what was neceſſary, and mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt Fault, they committed a Second
much worſe, by making a <hi>Fauſebray</hi> in the
Ditch, which render'd the whole Fortification
ſo defective, that unleſs all were new done,
the Place would never be worth any thing. My
Brother, to whom you gave the Government
of it, and who underſtands theſe things better
than I do, can teſtifie what I have told <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:</hi>
By which you may conclude, that If I am
Faulty, your Miniſter is much more than I am,
who believes he knows much more than Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Vauban,</hi> and all the Engineers in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that was to precede the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
being now agreed on, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſent the
Duke <hi>de Crequi,</hi> Firſt Gentleman of your Bed-Chamber
to <hi>Munick,</hi> to carry the Marriage Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to the Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> They ſhew'd
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> magnificence, and dazl'd the Eyes
of all her Brother's Court. To whom the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
ſent his Procuration, who as his Proxy eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed
the Princeſs. She parted to come for
<hi>France,</hi> and being arriv'd at <hi>Scheleſtat,</hi> ſhe there
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98314:136"/>
found the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to
whom <hi>your Majeſty</hi> had given the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Houſehould. She receiv'd their
Reſpects in ſo proud and haughty a Manner,
that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Richelieu</hi> wrote me that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day, if ſhe had known what ſhe had now
ſeen, ſhe would have pray'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi> ſhe
might ſtill have waited on the Queen your Wife,
as ſhe did before. All the Court, and eſpecially
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> had ſo great an Opinion of this
Princeſs, that I durſt not tell you what had been
written to me: I thought it beſt to ſtay till you
your ſelf had ſeen her, which would be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
becauſe you had fix'd a Day to go and
receive her in <hi>Champagne.</hi> You and your Queen
went near Fifty Leagues to meet her; but I
know not whether <hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought your
ſelf paid for your Pains, ſince it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for you not to obſerve this Princeſs's Pride,
of which the Dutcheſs of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had given
me Notice. For my own Part, I ſaw it but too
well; when I had the Honour to pay my
Reſpects to her, ſhe ſcarce vouchſaf'd to hear
what I ſaid, and I ſhould certainly have been
more troubled, if I had known ſhe had treated
Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> any better. But I my ſelf was
a Witneſs, with what coldneſs ſhe receiv'd him
and all other Perſons of Quality. <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi>
whoſe Prudence is to be admir'd in all things,
ſome Days after begun to praiſe the Queen your
Wife, and ſaid in her preſence, ſhe had ſo
gain'd the Love of all the <hi>French,</hi> by her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
and and ſweet Diſpoſition, that they lov'd
her better than they did you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:98314:137"/>
The <hi>Dauphineſs,</hi> who had Wit, knew well
enough that this diſcourſe was intended for her.
But it being very difficult to reform thoſe Faults
which are natural to us, ſhe could never bring
her ſelf to that affable and gracious Air, which
gains the Hearts of the <hi>French</hi> Nation; and
which they value a thouſand times more than
they do any other thing.</p>
               <p>This Marriage follow'd that of Mademoiſelle
<hi>de Blois,</hi> a very beautiful Princeſs, in whoſe
Praiſe I ſhould be large, were it not that
ſome would ſay, I thereby deſign'd to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my own Wife, who had the Care of her
Education. She marry'd the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi>
the Son of him of whom I have already ſpoken,
who died about the Year 1666. and was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> which Government <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> afterward beſtow'd upon the Duke <hi>de
Vernevil,</hi> who was very old, ſo that this young
Prince hoping after the Duke's Death, you
would gratifie him with it, behav'd himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dutifully to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> but did not treat
the Princeſs his Wife ſo well. I took the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Order, to tell him of it.
You ſaid, he ought to ſet a greater Value upon
ſo beautiful a Princeſs, and whoſe Wit was
equal to her Beauty. But the ill Company he
kept, made him deaf to all I repreſented, which
ſo much diſpleas'd <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> that when the
Duke of <hi>Vernevil</hi> died, you gave his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Duke of <hi>Main.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhews us, that in a Court virtuouſly
govern'd, men muſt be virtuous if they expect
Rewards. No Man ſhould value himſelf upon
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98314:137"/>
the greatneſs of his Birth, nor upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he naturally ought to have. A Monarch
regards neither, who as <hi>your Majeſty</hi> regulates
all his Actions according to Merit and Juſtice.
In ſuch a Court as yours, a Perſon of great
Birth, who doth not do his Duty, is leſs regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
than another; becauſe he hath been better
taught. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> will know all that he doth,
and of what he is capable, which is the Reaſon
why <hi>your Majeſty</hi> makes ſo little Account of
ſome Perſons, who by the Rank they hold in the
Kingdom, one would think ſhould make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Figure, than at preſent they do. But 'tis a
difficult thing to be both Young and Wiſe:
When the Prince I now ſpeak of, ſhall come to
riper Years, I will undertake, that <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
will be better pleas'd with him. No young
Perſon is free from Faults, and the deceas'd
Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who died like a Saint, was
guilty of more than his Son. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
againſt the Follies of Youth; I can give
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> a Proof of it in my own Family:
be pleas'd to caſt your eyes upon my Son, I have
been many times forc'd to treat him very ill,
without being able to do any good upon him;
nothing but time wrought his change, ſo that he
would have put me out of all patience, if I had
not had enough to wait till his underſtanding
grew riper.</p>
               <p>It was in this year, that <hi>Monſieur Fouquet</hi> died
at <hi>Pignerol,</hi> whom you condemn'd to perpetual
impriſonment, inſtead of the Baniſhment to
which he was ſentenced. He bore his diſgrace
with a conſtancy, which could never be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98314:138"/>
from a man who in the midſt of the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
affairs of his place, mingled all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
I ſhould rather ſay, all the Debaucheries
of Youth; but God gave him the Grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
himſelf, and die a good Chriſtian. Whence
we ought to conclude, that God knows better
than we what is fit for us; and that we are not
ſenſible of our own wants, when we murmur
againſt Providence; ſince we oftner loſe our
ſelves in proſperity than in adverſity; but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſo corrupt, that we would have the way
to Heaven ſtrew'd with flowers, inſtead of the
thorns we meet in it.</p>
               <p>The Peace was already become a burden to
<hi>Monſieur Louvoy,</hi> tho' it were ſo lately made,
that people ſcarcely had had time to reap the
fruits of it. He advis'd <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to make
your ſelf Maſter of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> and <hi>Caſal;</hi> but
ſeeing he knew that to attempt it, would again
Arm all <hi>Europe,</hi> he ſent perſons he could truſt
to both thoſe places with Bills of Exchange for
very great Sums, in hopes to ſucceed in their
Negotiation.</p>
               <p>While this was tranſacting, <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to ſend your Fleet againſt the Corſairs of
<hi>Tripoli,</hi> under the Command of <hi>du Quêne,</hi> who
was another <hi>de Ruiter.</hi> Eight of their Ships not
being able to recover the Port from whence
they came, retreated to <hi>Chio,</hi> where they thought
themſelves ſafe, becauſe that Iſland was under
the protection of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> with whom
they believ'd <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would never willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have any Quarrel. But <hi>du Quêne</hi> knowing that
by the Treaty of Commerce, which you had
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98314:138"/>
made with the <hi>Turk,</hi> he was not to give any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
to thoſe Pyrates, he fell upon 'em and beat
'em to pieces with his Cannon. This boldneſs of
<hi>du Quêne</hi> occaſion'd great trouble to your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
at the Port, where he was very ill trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and had been us'd much worſe, had he not
pacified the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> with very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Preſents. You had no mind to conſent to
it, yet knew there was a neceſſity for it, when
you conſider'd your Dominions were too far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from his, to make him ſenſible of your
Power. Beſides, if you had not prevented what
he threatned, you might have loſt the advantage
you made of the <hi>Levant</hi> Trade; ſo that a Prince
is as much obliged as a private man, to have a
regard to his intereſts, which are often of ſuch
conſideration, that he is in prudence bound to
diſſemble many things.</p>
               <p>The ſecret Negotiation concerning <hi>Strasbourg</hi>
and <hi>Caſal,</hi> had all the ſucceſs <hi>Monſieur Louvoy</hi>
could wiſh. Theſe two conſiderable places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
themſelves into <hi>Your Majeſties</hi> hands,
without ſtriking a blow. But though they made
ſo great an addition to your Power, that it
ſeem'd you now made all <hi>Europe</hi> tremble, yet I
know not whether I may Congratulate <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> upon it, ſeeing it hath done that which
I predicted, when I told <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Envoy of <hi>Spain</hi> gave your Miniſter,
when he ſhew'd him your Magazine at <hi>Douay.</hi>
This bold ſtroke hath awaken'd all thoſe that
are jealous of your glory, and they will be glad
of an opportunity, to do you all the miſchief
they can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:98314:139"/>
                  <hi>Du Quêne,</hi> after the Exploit he did at <hi>Chio,</hi>
became ſo terrible to the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> that
he forc'd them to beg peace of <hi>Your Majeſty.</hi>
The year following he chaſtis'd the <hi>Algerines,</hi>
and Bombarded their Town, to ſhew all the
Barbarous people on that Coaſt, how great was
your Power. The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez</hi> ſent
Embaſſadours to deſire your Amity, the Treaty
you made with him was of great advantage to
your people, who begun to drive a Trade in the
<hi>Levant,</hi> of which all other Nations became jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>This among all Polititians, paſt for an effect
of that prudence, which I have always obſerved
in <hi>Your Majeſty;</hi> but they never yet underſtood,
what made you give credit to thoſe flatterers,
who begun to embroil you with the Pope.</p>
               <p>The difference begun about ſo ſmall a matter,
that to ſpeak freely, 'tis not worth a man's pains
to mention it. <hi>Madam</hi> the Ducheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi>
your Aunt, whoſe Marriage was conteſted by
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> while he liv'd, and never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
till your Majeſties reign; made a Vow
if ſhe could get off from that affair with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to build a Religious Houſe in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and to perform it, founded one at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne.</hi>
She brought young Ladies from her own
Country, who by virtue of a Bull from the
Pope, ſetled themſelves there, and choſe among
themſelves an Abbeſs every three years. The
firſt and laſt Abbeſs was ſtill the ſame perſon,
who being much belov'd by the Ducheſs, they
to pleaſe her, at every three years end, Elected
the ſame again till ſhe died.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:98314:139"/>
She died in the year 1673, and my Wife who
ſometimes went to this Covent, never ſeeing but
the ſame Abbeſs, deſired me to pray <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
to beſtow the place upon one of our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> without examining any more
than I did, whether the nomination belong'd to
you, granted my requeſt; but ſhe for whom I
had made ſuit, met with oppoſition when ſhe
came to be received by the Nuns, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it was their right to chuſe a Superior. Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which reigns more in Covents than abroad in
the world, ſuggeſted to them, that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their intereſt to ſuffer any but one of their
own Houſe to be Abbeſs, ſeeing all of them one
after another, might come to be preferr'd to that
Dignity. But ſhe whom <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> had nam'd,
being at laſt thought by them a very fit perſon,
having many good Qualities, not ſo eaſily found
in another, they all agreed to receive her, ſtill
ſaving to themſelves their right of Election.</p>
               <p>This good Woman had lived but three years
Abbeſs, when <hi>Monſieur Louvoy</hi> beg'd her place of
<hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> for a perſon that was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to him: You gave him a grant of it, but ſhe
being of a quite different temper from her that
died, ſo frighted the Nuns, that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of uſing <hi>Your Majeſties</hi> and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
of <hi>Paris</hi> authority, to get her Inſtall'd.
The Pope in the mean time did not only refuſe
his Bulls, but ſent a Brief to the Nuns to chuſe
another Superior; which ſo piqu'd the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
that he councell'd <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to condemn
and cancel the Bull. The Parliament which is
ever ready to extend their Authority beyond all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98314:140"/>
legal limits, paſt ſuch a Vote as the Archbiſhop
deſir'd. The Pope thunder'd againſt this Vote,
and things grew to that heat, that the Parlia-paſt
another Vote, by which the Nuns were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd
to quit their Covent, which was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſtrange rigour. The Parliaments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in paſſing this Arreſt, was that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ow'd almoſt as much as it was worth, and
therefore it was fit to keep it from undoing a
great many people, by running deeper in debt.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing almoſt happen'd at the Abby
of <hi>Longchamp,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de Feuillade</hi>
would have made one of his Siſters Abbeſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the will of the Pope; but <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
having ſeen the Records of the Abby, by which
it appear'd that the Kings your Predeceſſors
had granted the Nuns the right of Electing their
Superior; you ſuffer'd 'em to enjoy it, without
any further diſturbance. The Pope was much
diſpleas'd with what had paſt at <hi>Charonne;</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, leſs matter would have provok'd
him to raiſe troubles in your Kingdom; but
<hi>Your Majeſties</hi> Reputation was now arriv'd to
that heighth, that his Holineſs fearing the event
of things, diſſembled his reſentment, reſolving
nevertheleſs to ſhew it to the purpoſe at a more
ſeaſonable opportunity.</p>
               <p>He was very angry with the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Paris,</hi> who inſtead of pacifying him, incens'd
him more by that which at <hi>Rome</hi> was look'd on
as a direful encroachment on the Authority of
the Holy See; tho' call'd by another name at
<hi>Paris,</hi> and other parts of the Kingdom. The
Pope's Nuncio being fallen ſick in the <hi>Fauxbourg
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98314:140"/>
St. Germain,</hi> where he dwelt, inſtead of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Pariſh Prieſt to give him the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſent for a Monk to confeſs him, and give
him the<note n="*" place="margin">A Term in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Sacrament, which is given to People at the point of death.</note> 
                  <hi>Viaticum.</hi> The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
proſecuted the Monk and his
Covent for coming without his
leave to the Nuncio, who dying
'twas thought the Archbiſhop
would not permit him to be bury'd in Holy
ground, ſo great was his fault for not applying
himſelf to his Paſtor; but he was at laſt Interr'd
in the place he himſelf had appointed, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he ſhould firſt be carry'd to his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Church.</p>
               <p>In 1677. there aroſe another difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Holineſs and <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Benefices in the Dioceſſes of <hi>Alet</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers;</hi>
to which you claim'd a right by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the <hi>Regale;</hi> which being oppos'd by thoſe
two Biſhops, you made uſe of the Civil Power
to make good your Nomination. Theſe Biſhops,
who liv'd very Pious Lives, and were an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to all the Clergy, laid open their Caſe to
your Council, who took no notice of it; but ſo
far approv'd of what <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> had done,
that the Biſhops were forced to write to the
Pope. His Holineſs having referr'd the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the buſineſs to a Conſiſtory, diſpatch'd
a Brief to <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> whereby he exhorted
you to deſiſt from an attempt wherein you were
engag'd by evil Counſel; but the Archbiſhop
who did not love the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for not
being diſpos'd to give him a Cardinal's Cap, ſo
far perſwaded <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> you were in the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98314:141"/>
right, that you anſwer'd the Pope according to
his advice.</p>
               <p>The Pope ſent you another Brief, wherein he
anſwer'd the Reaſons you gave him; but the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who would have been glad
of a Schiſm to have made himſelf greater than
he was, perſwaded <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to ſeize the
Temporalties of the Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
might force him to a Submiſſion. But this
Biſhop who led a much better Life than the
Archbiſhop, with a true Apoſtolick Zeal, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
maintain'd the Rights of the Church;
which ſo vex'd the Archbiſhop, that he prevail'd
with <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to have him arreſted, after
which he thought he ſhould meet with no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and that when the Shepherd could no
longer watch over his Flock, he might do what
he pleas'd. But he was much miſtaken; for
thoſe Clergy-men who were of the Biſhops Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and all of the Chapter, made uſe of
their Authority to maintain the right for which
their Biſhop was impriſon'd. The Archbiſhop
of <hi>Paris</hi> declar'd War againſt 'em; and having
diſpers'd 'em by Exile or Impriſonment, the
Pope, who had ſent <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> divers other
Briefs, to which Anſwers were return'd not a
jot more ſatisfactory than to the firſt, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the Biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> whom the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
had perſwaded to act as Metropolitan, and
cancel ſeveral Decrees made by the Grand Vicars
that took part with their Biſhop. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
at laſt proſecuted the buſineſs with ſo
much heat, that after he had procured a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt one of the Grand Vicars, to have
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98314:141"/>
his Head cut off, he ſet upon the Pope, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> to have his Briefs examin'd,
wherein he pretended were Expreſſions that
ſtruck at your Royal Authority, and which were
againſt the Liberty of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>If <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would have taken my advice
in this affair, as well as in that of your Finances;
I would freely have told you my opinion. Which
is, that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> will never get any thing by
falling out with his Holineſs. But as this buſineſs
was above my reach, ſo you conſulted none but
Men of the Myſtery, and parties concern'd;
moſt of them gave advice, from which poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will think they can never clear themſelves.
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> by their advice in 1681, called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
an Aſſembly of Prelates, to examine the
Popes Briefs; they met the firſt time at the
Archbiſhop's of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the number of ſeven
Archbiſhops, and thirty Biſhops, they choſe for
their Preſidents the Archbiſhops of <hi>Paris</hi> and
<hi>Rheims,</hi> both of them very able men; but upon
this occaſion, there was not ſo much need of
Science as Sentiments of Religion.</p>
               <p>The others who made up this Aſſembly, were
moſt of them of the ſame mould, and ſo devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Will and Pleaſure, that if
you had commanded them to preach the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
inſtead of the Goſpel, they would certainly have
done it; that which was to be debated was no
ſooner propos'd, but down went the Pope, and
all of the Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers</hi> Party. This Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſtretch'd the <hi>Regale</hi> much further than was
intended by <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> and to their greater
ſhame, writ a Letter to you in ſo particular and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98314:142"/>
odd a Stile, that one would hardly believe it
came from Men of Parts; as there were ſome
among them.</p>
               <p>But their Complaiſance and their Paſſion
went ſo far, that after examining the Briefs,
they fell to diſputing the Pope's Authority;
which they ſo curtail'd and circumſcrib'd, that
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra Montanes</hi> look'd upon their deciſion
to be the foundation of a Hereſie. Nevertheleſs
the Parliament, (which for a long time hath
done nothing but what <hi>your Majeſty</hi> commands
them) Regiſter'd it as a fundamental piece, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Archives of the Crown: it was alſo
Inroll'd in the Records of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and the
Univerſity, whereof ſome members of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion, deſiring the matter might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again
debated, were expell'd by Letters under
the Privy Signet.</p>
               <p>This new way of proceeding, hath yet done
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> little good or harm, your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
being now ſo great, that the Pope dares
not contend with you; but the more powerful a
Kingdom is, the more ſubject it is to Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſo that 'tis to be fear'd one may ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
The Pope who hath hitherto defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
only with the Pen, when he ſees an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
may hereafter make uſe of the Sword. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
gentler courſes might have been taken, to
maintain <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Rights; and if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſhew his Authority to all
<hi>France,</hi> had reſolv'd to perſecute thoſe Biſhops
whoſe Pious and Exemplary Lives were a ſecret
reproach to his own, (in no wiſe conformable to
his Character) he ſhould at leaſt have forborn to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98314:142"/>
perſecute his <hi>Head;</hi> whom he ought to obey.
But he thought to repair all, by adviſing <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> to extirpate Hereſie; as if <hi>Calvin</hi>'s were
more dangerous than that he endeavour'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce:
Certainly if his deſigns had ſucceeded,
he would have open'd a door to far greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
than can be fear'd from a Sect which may
be eaſily ſuppreſt; becauſe the Principles are
known upon which it is founded. But the Caſe
is far different, when the Head of the Church is
renounc'd; as it happen'd in <hi>England,</hi> where
there are many Religions inſtead of one, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
againſt which nothing can be alledg'd.</p>
               <p>However the Clergy obtain'd a Signal Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over the <hi>Hugenots;</hi> conſidering the great
number of Converſions that were made. But I
know not what Poſterity will ſay
of the<note n="*" place="margin">Judges or Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſent by the King into the Provinces.</note> 
                  <hi>Intendants</hi> employing your
Dragoons, which I preſume was a
Maxim not approv'd by <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
but broach'd by violent and
cruel Men; for till then, you made
uſe of no other but fair and gentle means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
your People; wherein you ſhew'd more
than ordinary Prudence. For example, you would
not ſuffer a <hi>Hugenot</hi> to enjoy any Place or Office,
either in your Court, or in the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and you at laſt ſo reduc'd them by ſeveral
Edicts that they were either forc'd to live idly,
or obliged to follow ſome Trade or turn Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
This converted ſome, who rather than quit
their Places would go to Maſs: Yet theſe were
but few in reſpect of the vaſt numbers that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98314:143"/>
were<note n="*" place="margin">A gentle word for <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,</hi> but 'tis the Author's, and muſt be faithfully ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. He makes ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for it at the end of the Paragraph.</note> perſuaded by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons.
'Tis ſaid, that in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Province of <hi>Poitou,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
above 35000, to which the
promiſed Penſions contributed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much, and were only given to
thoſe who were moſt likely to
draw others to follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
But yet ſome ſtood it
out, and would not ſubmit to the
Miſſion. The Intendants percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it was <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Deſign, totally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
the Religion, made uſe of Fire and Sword;
and if we may believe the Complaints of very
many, there was a great Number that ſuffer'd
ſuch cruel Torments, and yet continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that if they had been in the right way,
they might have very well deſerv'd the Name of
Martyrs.</p>
               <p>While this paſs'd, <hi>Louvoy</hi> made another ſort
of War, in the Dominions of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
which ſuffer'd a thouſand times more than when
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> was in actual Hoſtility againſt him.
The itch which your Miniſter had to be alway
neceſſary to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> made him follow the
ſame courſe he took to be Maſter of <hi>Strasbourg</hi>
and <hi>Caſal.</hi> He choſe a fit time, for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
being engaged in a War with the <hi>Turk,</hi>
Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> obſerv'd no rules of Juſtice,
no not of Civility or good Manners: He ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoot
ſeveral ſpecious Pretences to enter into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and becauſe People would not ſubmit
to what he requir'd, he firſt demanded Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,
as if they had been in actual War:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98314:143"/>
After this Hoſtility, his next way was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the like Summs from thoſe that were his
Friends, which if they did not pay, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to burn their Houſes.</p>
               <p>The poor <hi>Flemings,</hi> to prevent this ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
pay'd the Summ your Miniſter demanded;
but when this was done, he began to undermine
their Houſes, on purpoſe to draw from them
the laſt Penny they had, being made to believe,
that otherwiſe their Houſes ſhould be pulled
down. When he ſaw they had nothing left,
their Houſes were demoliſh'd, and the combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Materials burnt, that they might be of no
farther uſe to the poor miſerable People. I
am perſwaded <hi>your Majeſty</hi> never knew this,
and all that have the Honour to be near you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you ſo far from approving ſuch cruelties,
that you would rather have had them exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay the ſame was done beyond the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> where your Army, commanded by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>Crequi,</hi> ſeiz'd upon many Poſts dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on the Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and block'd
up that ſtrong place. I do not think it was done
without <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Order, becauſe Monſieur
<hi>Louvoy</hi> made you believe, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill did
you great Wrong. Your Miniſter, ſome Years
ſince, imploy'd one of <hi>Metz</hi> to ſpoyl a great
deal of Paper, and tho' at firſt he diſlik'd him,
yet this Man at laſt became his great Favourite,
by telling him he knew a way how to put <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> in Poſſeſſion of all on this ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
without ſtriking a Stroke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:98314:144"/>
His means were altogether imaginary; for he
maintain'd, that whatever heretofore held of the
Lands <hi>your Majeſty</hi> now poſſeſs'd, muſt ſtill hold
of the ſame: So that Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> approving
his Reaſons, made uſe of them, and ſent one of
the Serjeants of your Parliament of <hi>Metz,</hi> to
ſummon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to come at a Day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd
to do Homage and Fealty to <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
for many things he held of you: But his
Catholick Majeſty, thought this new way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
very unreaſonable, and indeed it was
more againſt <hi>Your Majeſty's</hi> Intereſt than for it;
becauſe the Emperour might as well pretend,
that you ow'd him Homage and Fealty for your
own Kingdom, which was heretofore a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: The King of <hi>Spain</hi>
laugh'd at this ridiculous Summons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
againſt whatever ſhould be done to his
Prejudice. Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> who expected as
much, procur'd a Sentence to paſs, by which,
for not appearing and anſwering according to
the Summons, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> was to take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what you demanded; which was very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> having the Power in your own
Hands. Monſieur <hi>Louvoy</hi> by eating got an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;
and by this Sentence, procur'd you more
than you could have expected from a Ten Years
War.</p>
               <p>The Complaints the King of <hi>Spain</hi> made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
begot ſeveral Conferences at <hi>Courtray,</hi>
between <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Deputies: but ſeeing <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would abate
nothing of your Pretenſions, they ſeparated
without doing any thing: And the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:98314:144"/>
reſolving, that what you took ſhould be by force,
rather than by Treaty; you became Maſter of
all the Country from <hi>Sedan,</hi> home to the Gates
of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> which you block'd up ſo cloſe,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could put nothing into it.</p>
               <p>Some time after, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> rais'd the
Blockade, as you ſayd, becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> were
ready to enter into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and you would
not favour their deſigns by giving the Emperour
any diverſion. For my own part, I believe
what you ſaid to be true, and I know <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
hath too much Sincerity to ſay one thing, and
mean another. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
to the contrary; but what I have to ſay is,
that if you will preſerve the Glory you have
acquir'd by your Moderation; you muſt do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to contradict what you have ſaid: Your
Reputation is in your own Hands; for as it
will be your Glory to keep your Word, ſo it
will be your ſhame to give your ſelf the Lye.
You ought therefore, to reject the evil Conſels
that may be given you, which are the bane of
Princes; tho' the Poyſon that is in 'em, be hid
under fair and ſpecious Pretences.</p>
               <p>I fear all thoſe Camps, which Monſieur <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
hath marked out on the Frontiers of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
tend to ſome new Deſign: But <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi>
who is ſo great a Lover of Juſtice, muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that you can never gain Glory by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
that are unjuſt; yet if you could, be your
Power never ſo great in this World; there is
another, where Kings as well as private Men,
muſt give an Account of their Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:98314:145"/>
The <hi>Algerins,</hi> whom you had chaſtiz'd the
laſt Year, were become never the wiſer for
it: So that you were forc'd to ſend <hi>du Quêne</hi> a
Second time, who made them ſenſible, that it
was better to implore <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Pardon,
than to expoſe themſelves to a new Puniſhment.
He threw in a great Number of Bombs, which
totally ruin'd the Town they had endeavour'd
to repair. But the Conteſts and Diviſions which
were among 'em; ſome being for <hi>Mezzomorto,</hi>
and others for <hi>Balucbachi,</hi> the one for Peace, the
other for War, kept them from following the
beſt Advice; which was, to give <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
Satisfaction. I doubt their Conſtancy will not
be Proof againſt your Thunder; for I know <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> is not us'd to be baffled in what you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
and I preſume you will ſend your Fleet
thither ten times, rather than not bring thoſe
Pirates to reaſon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here conclude what I have ſeen done by
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> which would have been to your
immortal Glory, if the confidence you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in Monſieur <hi>Louvoy,</hi> had not led you to
undertake ſome things, more out of Ambition
than Juſtice; <hi>your Majeſty</hi> knows beſt, whether
I ſpeak Truth or no, and can't be deceiv'd after
my relating ſo many Circumſtances. To make
your Reign perfectly Glorious, you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to do, than to regulate your Future
Actions by your own underſtanding; which is
ſo free from Falſhood and Injuſtice; and which
will demonſtrate to the World, you have had no
part in any of thoſe things, I have now told
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> I hope you will take in good part,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98314:145"/>
the Liberty wherewith I have addreſs'd, my
ſelf to you, for the good of your Kingdom,

            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VII. Which ſhews, that thoſe particular Favours
which your Majeſty hath receiv'd from God,
oblige you to render to him that which is his
due; and that no Kingdom can proſper,
without the fear of God.</head>
               <p>IF I have been ſo unhappy to have diſpleas'd
<hi>your Majeſty,</hi> by relating many things with
more Freedom than I ſhould have taken; yet I
cannot be guilty of the ſame Fault in what I am
now about to ſay, ſince I am certain, that in
matters of Piety, and wherein the Service of
God is concern'd, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> thinks no Man
can ſpeak too boldly, nor can any thing be ſaid,
that can better pleaſe you. Many Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
at your Charge, others to which you have
added more Maintenance to ſupply their wants,
Blaſphemers ſeverely puniſh'd, the Poor relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and many things of the like kind, which
for brevity's ſake, and not to be thought a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
I do not mention; are all convincing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,
that the Glory of God is <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's</hi>
chief care: Though in this you have done
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98314:146"/>
no more than what all the World is bound to
do; yet I ſay, 'tis <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Duty more
than another Man's; not only becauſe as you are
a Soveraign you are oblig'd to give good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to your Subjects; but becauſe you cannot
omit the doing of it, without being very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to God.</p>
               <p>If <hi>your Majeſty</hi> will but caſt your Eyes, on
the Favours you have receiv'd from him, you will
ſee many things which require an Eternal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement.
I do not ſpeak of ſuch things
as are common to you with all men; but reflect
if you pleaſe on thoſe Bleſſings, which God's
Providence hath in ſo particular a manner
pour'd out upon <hi>your Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How are you bound to thank him for your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Birth? his giving you Being to fill the
nobleſt Throne upon Earth, is one of the leaſt
of his Favours; and to draw you doubly, I may
ſay, out of nothing as he did, after the Queen
your Mother had been Barren three and twenty
Years, is a Bleſſing that cannot be forgot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
double Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>If you follow ſtep by ſtep what God hath
done for you, you will find his Protection over
your Perſon hath been very ſingular: Remember
that almoſt univerſal Rebellion of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that Confederation of the Parliaments
againſt your Authority, the inſolence of your
People, and how eaſily you quell'd theſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
You will then confeſs, this was not the
Work of Man, but the Hand of God. If after
this, you call to mind the Fidelity of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
and Souldiers, even to the prejudice of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98314:146"/>
their Ancient Rights; and that Victory ſtill
wedded to your ſide, forc'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
yield to the Peace of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their great averſion to it: You will ſee that
this likewiſe, was a Favour of Divine Providence,
which never forſook you. How can you chuſe
but be thankful, for the Miracle it wrought in
recovering you from that terrible Sickneſs,
which I have already mention'd? I know God
made uſe of Natural Cauſes, to which impious
Men attribute all that is extraordinary;
but, by their leave, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more in that recovery; for you were not
only given over by your Phyſicians, who I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
are many times miſtaken; but you were
more than half dead, as thoſe that were preſent
did verily think, and can teſtifie I ſpoke Truth,
when I ſaid your Curtains were drawn.</p>
               <p>If <hi>your Majeſty</hi> pleaſe, let us follow the courſe
of your Life, and ſee whether that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
after this, be Natural. Do you in good
earneſt believe, that ſo regular and mature a
Judgment, as appear'd in you preſently after the
Cardinal's Death, notwithſtanding the ill Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he gave you, was only the Gift of Nature?
'Tis to God alone you are indebted for it, and
to whom you are to return thanks. 'Twas not
in your Power to make your ſelf wiſe, eſpecially
in a Court where you were ſuffer'd to do what
you would, and where none but Women, had
the care of your Education.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I now ſay of the Wars wherein you
have been engag'd by evil Counſel, and if I may
dare ſay ſo, by your own Ambition? And yet,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98314:147"/>
how happily are you come off! All theſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are from Heaven, God having ſent you into
the World, that you might Glorifie him by your
Actions, and hath more particularly engaged you
to praiſe him, by many Obligations heap'd upon
one another: If you do not do that which God
expects from you, what will all the World ſay,
that know the Chararacter of a good Man is to
be Grateful?</p>
               <p>As it is <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Obligation, ſo 'tis your
Intereſt to be thankful: For if a Prince take no
care to give to God that which is his due; how
can he expect his People ſhould do their Duty
to him, whoſe greateſt Glory is to be the living
Image of God upon Earth. If he thinks to be
obey'd, becauſe as a Maſter he commands others,
and believes his Subjects muſt Love or fear him,
becauſe Reward and Puniſhment are in his Hands,
he is much miſtaken: For the Power of a Prince
be it never ſo great; would quickly be brought
to nothing; if thoſe that obey him, did not
do it for God's ſake, who is greater than he?
'Tis Religion that firſt made Subjects fear their
King, and ſtill continues that Fear: As a Tree
which doth not continually receive Nouriſhment
from the Earth, grows dry and withers by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
ſo take away Religion in a Kingdom, the
Reſpect and Fear of a Soveraign, which Subjects
ſuck in with their Milk, inſenſibly decays,
till it be quite Dead; whence follow a thouſand
Miſchiefs, greater than can be Imagin'd or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd;
and then, neither Hope of Reward,
or Fear of Puniſhment, can prevail with Subjects
to do their Duty. A Wretch, that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98314:147"/>
in God, thinks there is much more to be
got by Diſobedience and Rebellion, than ever he
could expect from his Prince; and what Effect
can the fear of Puniſhment have upon him,
who believes there is no other World beſide
this, and that one quarter of an Hour will put
an End to all his Pain.</p>
               <p>Not to give God his due, is to open a Door
to all manner of Wickedneſs; and a Prince
thereby expoſes himſelf to the Hazard of being
driven out of his Kingdom. Look but upon the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which is much more ſubject
to revolutions than any other Kingdoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the greateſt part of its Subjects think
the Religion they profeſs to be meer humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;
and when a Man once comes to that
Belief, 'tis a very hard matter to conquer his
Prejudice, and raiſe him up to the Knowledge
of the true God. Beſides, ſuch an Opinion blinds
and makes Men ſo brutiſh, as to attribute all
things to Nature, and 'tis extremely difficult
for 'em to find the way out of their error.</p>
               <p>Let us come a little nearer, and ſee what
hath been done in <hi>England,</hi> the want of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that Kingdom, was the cauſe of all that
happen'd there, ſince the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi>
the introducing of ſo many Sects, brought the
People at laſt to dip their hands in their King's
blood.</p>
               <p>Come we now to your own Kingdom, where
we may obſerve the ſame diſorders in the reign
of three or four Kings one after another. If you
would know the reaſon, read but their Hiſtory.
One was a Blaſphemer, inſtead of puniſhing that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98314:148"/>
ſin in his Subjects. Another was an Atheiſt, and
ſo of the reſt. So that their Subjects who had
very little more Religion than they, attempted
to dethrone 'em.</p>
               <p>Theſe Confuſions laſted till the Reign of the
Deceaſed King your Father. The Vicious Lives
of the Clergy cannot be remember'd without
horror. A Biſhop never viſited his Dioceſs, but
to receive the Rents due from his Tenants; if
he ſtay'd there, 'twas to enjoy a Miſtreſs, whoſe
company pleas'd him; and when he was weary
of her, he return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> to find another, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom he ſpent that which he ſhould have
given to the Poor; with the reſt he kept Horſes
and Hounds, an abuſe ſo general amongſt 'em,
that he was accounted covetous who did not
live at this rate.</p>
               <p>I have alſo heard my Deceaſed Father ſay that
when he was young, Biſhopricks were beſtow'd
uſually to gratifie Favourites (who had procur'd
'em) with part of their Revenues; they knew
how much they were to give, and the reſt was
for themſelves. The ſame thing was practic'd
with relation to Abbies, and I may ſay all the
Benefices in <hi>France.</hi> The Monks who liv'd at
their eaſe, ſpent their overplus very ſcandalouſly,
but lik'd the Trade ſo well, that in ſpite of all
reproof, they would not leave it.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who knew that the firſt and
moſt important care of a Miniſter of State, is to
eſtabliſh Religious Worſhip, eſpecially among
thoſe whoſe good or evil example is of great
conſequence in a Kingdom, apply'd himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to it. God bleſt his Endeavours, and 'tis
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98314:148"/>
to him we are indebted for our preſent better
change. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> hath likewiſe done your
part, in not beſtowing favours but upon thoſe
who for their good behaviour and learning are
worthy of 'em; for <hi>your Majeſty</hi> well knows
that they who are to be ſet over others, ſhould
be able to teach and inſtruct them; ſeeing want
of good Precepts may be the cauſe of as much
miſchief, as ill example.</p>
               <p>By the particular knowledge I have, I am a
daily witneſs, that in the diſtribution of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and other favours, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> will be
inform'd, not only of the good lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of thoſe perſons that are propos'd to
you; but alſo of their other requiſite qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Now after this knowledge I have nothing
more to ſay, than to exhort <hi>your Majeſty</hi> to
continue the Conduct you have ſhewn, ſince
your coming to the Crown; for nothing ſo
much prevails with Subjects, as the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their Soveraign. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s preſent
Exemplary life will be a Spur to thoſe who are
ſo lazy, as not to keep pace with <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
in the good way you are going.</p>
               <p>Endeavour above all things to keep from your
heart, Slanderers and Hypocrites; whereof
the number is much greater than you imagine
The firſt like love, inſinuate themſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
into Mens minds, but kill as ſoon as they
take poſſeſſion, a Detractor gets into the heart
of a Prince, by pretending his intereſts are
dearer to him than his own; and when he hath
infus'd his poyſon, he will never let him reſt till
he hath made him ſuſpect the fidelity of his beſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98314:149"/>
ſervants. Hypocrites are yet more dangerous,
becauſe under colour of Devotion they infect
you with miſchievous Maxims, whoſe venom 'tis
impoſſible for you to diſcover.</p>
               <p>There are other Vices which tho <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
ought not to ſuffer; yet they are not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to your Government. A Man that minds
nothing but pleaſing his ſenſes, hurts no body
but himſelf; a Drunkard is in the ſame caſe, and
ſo are others of the like nature; ſo that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God a part, the Commonwealth is not
concern'd. If it ſuffer any thing, 'tis becauſe
God who is juſt, doth not uſually bleſs thoſe
places where ſuch diſorders are permitted; and
I attribute all the Miſery of <hi>Flanders</hi> to their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
I cannot without indignation ſee them
pay ſo much veneration and reſpect to an Image
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or of ſome other Saint, and
yet have no regard at all, to the Holy Sacrament
that is upon their Altars.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Monks that are the cauſe of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,
which they had heretofore eſtabliſh'd in
<hi>France;</hi> but that it doth not reign there, ſo much
as in former times, we are to thank the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
It was one of their complaints againſt the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the people who in thoſe
days liv'd in very great ignorance; now they
are illuminated, know they were in the right;
the Monks themſelves never doubted it, and the
thing is too clear of it ſelf, to be any longer a
block of offence. Nothing but intereſt hath
prompted 'em to make ſuch a change in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to load us with Indulgences and Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
They at firſt wrought upon the minds of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98314:149"/>
weak Women, to eſtabliſh their Maxims, and
then infus'd them into their Men; who as I have
ſaid were ſo ignorant, as not to perceive the
ſnares that were laid for them.</p>
               <p>If theſe Monks had kept cloſe to the firſt rules
of their inſtitution, this abuſe could never have
crept in; it came in firſt by Confeſſions, which
by degrees they have now apply'd to themſelves,
through the ſecular Prieſts neglecting their duty,
the care alſo they take, to get Cuſtomers to
their Churches, by things which attract the eyes
more than the heart; hath drawn people from
their Pariſh-Churches, to which by the Canons
they are oblig'd to go under pain of mortal ſin:
So that we ſee 'em deſerted and empty, while
the Churches of Covents, have not room enough
to contain thoſe whom curioſity or dangerous
zeal hath allured thither; but God be thanked,
we begin to know better, what is our duty; 'tis
<hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s part to remedy other abuſes, God
having put power into your hands, to root
out the Tares which grow amongſt the good
Corn.</p>
               <p>The means are eaſie, and the putting it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
abſolutely neceſſary, both for the good of
your Subjects, and the ſecurity of your State;
for the good of your Subjects you ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Monks to meddle with what they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do; entring into the Secrets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
where they often make ſtrange work: And
for the ſecurity of your State, how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it? where they that are bound by an Oath
of Fidelity to the Pope; muſt prefer his Intereſts
before yours; which will occaſion greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:98314:150"/>
than you can imagin; this will appear
to be a manifeſt truth, if you call to mind what
paſt in the Reigns of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. of which
I need ſay ſo no more; ſince <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> knows
what then happen'd, better than I do. The
ſureſt way to prevent theſe two inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
is firſt to deſtroy theſe Monaſteries, or
at leaſt not to ſuffer ſuch a multitude of 'em:
but ſince this will be a difficult thing for <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> to do, though your power be ſo great,
yet I think it may be compaſs'd, if <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
pleaſe, firſt to eſtabliſh again among 'em the
ancient Diſcipline of their Founders, wherein
they are very remiſs. <hi>2dly,</hi> If you forbid them
taking Confeſſion; whereby they inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into Women, out of whom they wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the Secrets of all Families. <hi>3ly.</hi> If you
ſuffer none to take upon 'em the habit, till they
ſhall be of ſuch an age as you ſhall preſcribe;
that they may know what it is to enter into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
If this were done, their number would
quickly be known, and there would not be ſo
many among 'em, who bite their Nails for having
done that which they did not well conſider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand. <hi>4ly,</hi> If you reform the Ornaments
of their Churches, and reduce 'em to the Uſage
of Cathedrals, and of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf,
which ſhould ſerve for a Pattern to others;
where there ſtands upon the High Altar, nothing
but a Croſs, and a few Candleſticks, inſtead of
all the Trinkets we ſee in the Covents. <hi>5ly,</hi> If
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> forbid the ſhameful Traffick of
Fraternities, driven in Service-time, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98314:150"/>
People Devotion; alſo
that the Blind of<note n="*" place="margin">A kind of Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Blind are allow'd to beg at their Church-doors, and at the corners of Streets.</note> 
                  <hi>Quinze Vingt,</hi>
may be kept out of the Church,
that thoſe who are at their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
may not be interrupted. Theſe
two laſt abuſes reign as much in
Pariſhes, as in Covents, which <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> ſhould reform. <hi>6thly,</hi> If you forbid Monks
and Friars talking with Women at Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors,
or in any other place within the limits
of their Monaſteries: For what can they have
to ſay to 'em? doth any body think they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
'em with Devotion? whether 'tis that I am
more corrupt, or that I take more notice of things
than others do; but it hath been always my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that Old Women are ſtill excluded
from their converſation; they are never to be
ſpoken with, when young and pretty Women
are by; do they think to perſwade us, they
have charms to keep themſelves from burning,
when they approach ſo near to the fire? <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> ought to remove this ſcandal, but if you
cannot by the means I have propoſed, there are
others which you may have recourſe to in caſe
of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Care muſt be taken, that Pariſh-Churches, in
which there are many things that want Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
ſhould give ſo good example, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might of their own accord return again
to 'em without any compulſion. I have obſerv'd
that Pariſh-Prieſts are very negligent in their
duty; 'tis a ſhame to ſee how at Funerals they
look to the right and the left, and behave
themſelves ſo, that no body can think 'twas zeal
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98314:151"/>
for God's ſervice, engag'd them in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
but that they enter'd into Orders only
to get a livelihood, they make Devotion a meer
Trade. A Shoomaker when he is making Shoos,
minds more what he is about, than they do.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s concern to remedy ſo great
an abuſe; but 'tis not to be done, unleſs you
reſolve to augment the number of Pariſhes in
your City of <hi>Paris.</hi> A Prieſt who hath no mind
to give good example, is hid in the multitude
of his Pariſhioners, of whom the hundredth part
do not know him; which would not happen in
Pariſhes of moderate extent. What neceſſity is
there for their being ſo large? Or that Prieſts
ſhould have five and twenty thouſand <hi>Livres</hi>
yearly Rent? Divide one Pariſh into ſix, that
will not only make the Prieſts but the People
more vertuous; they may then have their eyes
upon every particular perſon, and hinder the
ſcandal they now encourage for want of due
care and reproof. Beſide, this is the only way
to abate the Pride of the Monks, who think we
cannot be without 'em, for the adminiſtration
of the Sacraments, and really the extent of ſome
Pariſhes is ſo great, that the Church cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the thirtieth part of the Inhabitants, ſo that
they, who cannot get places, go ſome where
elſe, or ſtay at home. In the mean time the
Covents are throng'd with Cuſtomers, which is
contrary to their firſt Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>When there are more Pariſhes in <hi>Paris,</hi> and
in other places where 'tis neceſſary: and when
Archbiſhops and Biſhops ſuffer none but Secular
Prieſts to come into their Pulpits, <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:98314:151"/>
will quickly ſee People leave running after
Monks and Friars, and the Worſhip of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to its firſt purity.</p>
               <p>I ſay nothing of the Laws which <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
ſhould make againſt Monaſteries growing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
rich; you have done it already, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in relation to Nunneries, which you have
order'd for the future, to take no Money of
thoſe who deſire the Habit. 'Tis much more
neceſſary for the Support of <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s
Government, that Lay-families ſhould be richer
than Religious Houſes. This will produce
another good effect, that none will be received
into them, but good Subjects; of which they
take little care, provided People bring Money
with 'em. But this Law is ſo ill executed, that
it ſignifies no more, than if <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made it, the only effect we ſee of it is, that
whereas there were Contracts for the receiving
of a Nun, there are none made now; yet People
pay never the leſs Money for it, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s intention, and for which
you ought to provide a remedy. God requires
it of you, the Religious of both Sexes being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo covetous, that they receive all who
have Money to give 'em, preferably to thoſe
who have none, tho never ſo unfit; the way to
rectifie this abuſe, is to bring an Information a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe who have tranſgreſs'd your Law,
and puniſh them ſo ſeverely, that they may
ſerve as an example to others.</p>
               <p>For to what purpoſe are Laws if they be not
executed? It were better as I have already ſaid,
they had never been made. 'Tis expoſing <hi>Your
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98314:152"/>
Majeſty</hi>'s Authority to an affront, which could
never happen if things had remain'd as they
were before the Law was made. I do not mean
that <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſhould puniſh this fault as if it
were a crime of State; 'tis enough to make 'em
reſtore the Money they have receiv'd with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
it will not be difficult to prove the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Money, tho' it were done in private,
'twill be divulg'd as ſoon as <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is known; Fathers and Mothers who have
Daughters to provide for, will be the firſt who
will reveal the Secret; ſeeing 'tis <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s
Pleaſure they ſhall be reliev'd, whether they
will or no; but they ſhould have no part of what
is reſtor'd, the Givers being as faulty as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and equally tranſgreſſing the Law. So
that <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> will grow rich at their coſt,
and no body blame you, ſince the World will
ſee that <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> deſigns nothing but the
Service of God and the good of your Subjects.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Obedience to the Pope.</head>
               <p>THIS Chapter cannot be better plac'd than
here, it having ſuch a relation to that which
precedes it. That it may be truly ſaid, when
People refuſe Obedience to the Pope, they are
not far from forgetting that which they owe
to God; and when we are not ſenſible of that
ſubmiſſion and reſpect, we ought to have for
thoſe whom he hath as his Miniſters ſet over us,

There is no Prince be he never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that will ſuffer thoſe to whom he commits
his Authority, to be deſpis'd, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common, than to pay them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
they require from us. This is not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to the Governour of a Province, but
even to the meaneſt Judge; and proceeds from
the Character, wherewith the Prince hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
them, in which 'tis his Intereſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them? how can it then be believ'd that
God is leſs jealous of that Authority which he
hath intruſted in the hands of his Miniſters, and
upon which depends the ſafety of Religion.</p>
               <p>I know very well that the Kings of the Earth
are the Lord's Anointed, and for that reaſon
are exalted above all other Men; but yet they
muſt know their Rights are diſtinct and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from thoſe of the Church; and as the
Church never allows Subjects, upon any account,
to be diſobedient to their Prince; ſo a Prince
ought not to permit his People to refuſe paying
Obedience and reſpect to the Church.</p>
               <p>If the Church had continued in the ſtate it
was in, in the time of the Apoſtles, and had not
joyn'd the Sword to the Mitre; things would
have been in another condition than now
they are; but ſince what hath been done,
hath been by God's permiſſion, we ought
to ſubmit to what he hath ordain'd, and not
give a new occaſion of ſcandal. I know that
Churchmen have gone beyond the bounds of
their Duty, and that Biſhops and Popes have
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98314:153"/>
had their faults; yet by whatever they have
done, they cannot loſe their Character, and
ſince it is to this Character our reſpect is
due, they cannot by any of their actions loſe,
or be depriv'd of it. The caſe is the ſame with
Crown'd Heads, who tho' they do not their
Duty, yet Subjects cannot diſpence with the
obedience they owe them.</p>
               <p>Would to God, Sir, your Miniſters had well
conſider'd this Truth, they would not then have
exalted the Authority of your Crown, ſo far
above that of the Mitre. I very much doubt,
whether Equity hath been the rule of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Had I been Learned and able enough to
have decided this great Controverſie which you
have had with <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the <hi>Regale,</hi> and
ſome others that have follow'd it, I would have
determin'd the queſtion poſitively without a
perhaps, and ſpeaking doubtfully; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
my ſelf too ignorant, to give a definitive
Judgment, in things above my reach. Now if
any ask, ſince I confeſs my incapacity, why
then do I condemn rather than approve what
hath been done: I pray <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that you have had not only <hi>Rome</hi> againſt
you in this buſineſs, but many Biſhops and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of your own Kingdom; who have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought examples of Piety and Vertue,
and have liv'd very exemplarily. We ſee alſo
they have choſen to ſuffer Exile and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
rather than ſubmit to that which
they believe is unjuſt, to ſay that what they
have done, is becauſe they are opinionative and
obſtinate, is to impoſe only upon the ſimple;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98314:153"/>
for wiſe men are of another mind. Is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they could premeditately deſign to diſpleaſe
their Maſter, eſpecially you that are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
King upon Earth, and ſo much reſpected
and eſteem'd by all your Subjects? It is much
more reaſonable to think, that <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
ſeeing theſe things, with thoſe perſons eyes, on
whom you relye; the deſire they have to
make themſelves neceſſary, hath put 'em upon
doing what they cannot juſtifie before an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Tribunal: They do not conſider that
they expoſe <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to new Enemies,
whoſe number they need not increaſe, ſince
you have already made your ſelf too many
by your Conqueſts, would they but reflect upon
what ſome perſons at leaſt as wiſe as themſelves,
who have grown old in Embaſſies, have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Kings your Predeceſſors; they
would proceed a little more warily; he deceives
himſelf, who weighs what he undertakes, only
by the power of him for whom he acts; if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
do not hold the Ballance, it were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times better, nothing had ever been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.
I would fain have theſe Great Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
tell me, with what Lawrels they have
Crown'd <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> by the Baniſhment and
Impriſonment of ſo many Pious and Learned
Perſons; whom the Pope in his Bulls hath not
only declared to be ſuch, but hath likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them to ſuffer for the love of Truth. I
wiſh they would alſo tell me, what Victory they
expect by thoſe Orders of Council, which might
I dare ſay ſo, do without any regard had to the
Bulls of his Holineſs, ſo inſolently command
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98314:154"/>
the Literal execution of all that, which they
in the fits of their Frenzy have decreed.</p>
               <p>There are milder ways, and more befitting a
Moſt Chriſtian King, to determine thoſe Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which may happen between <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
and <hi>Rome.</hi> It doth not become a Son to rebell
againſt his Father, who is to be diſarmed by
Kindneſs and Submiſſion, rather than by holding
a Cudgel over him. Tho it be glorious for a
Man to have the better of his Enemies, yet it
is ſhameful, to deſire like a Maſter to command
thoſe to whom he owes obedience and reſpect.
So that ſhould <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> take <hi>Rome,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
all the Eccleſiaſtical State; yet you are pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enough to know, you would get the ſame
reputation by it, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had in
the like occaſion, faithful and impartial Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
have repreſented him to be a Prince that
had no Religion, and who never kept his word;
and tho they that flatter him moſt, have been
forc'd to caſt a Veil over his taking of <hi>Rome;</hi>
yet the foulneſs of that action appears plainly
through it. I know very well there will be a
gloſs ſet upon what <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> doth, to ſecure
your Glory; but you will not find that all Pens
are to be bought and kept in your Pay, there
will be ſome left that may go to the bottom of
this buſineſs, and give the World a true account
of it. Slander is generally better receiv'd than
Truth, and if it be true, as we muſt agree it
is, that the greateſt Kings cannot hinder People
from taking the liberty to examine their actions;
how many will ſay that a Prince had better ſee
with his own eyes, than truſt to other Mens.
Beſides, when a Man is about to do a thing, he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98314:154"/>
ought to conſider what may be the end and the
conſequences of it. I would ask the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and all others, on whoſe advice <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> relyes in Eccleſiaſtical Matters; what
is to be got by Quarreling with the Pope? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
nothing; for if Religion be not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
by it, all your Attempts againſt his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs,
will recoil back upon you: The Reaſon
is, becauſe <hi>Europe</hi> cannot continue in the ſame
State it is now, and the Pope's Authority being ſo
great as it is, as well in Temporal as in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Caſes, he becomes an Enemy to you, no on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his own Perſon, but in that of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors;
and a dangerous Enemy who hath Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in his Hands; which will do more Miſchief
than <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> great Guns, tho' perhaps it
may not make ſo great a Noiſe. The People are
generally very credulous on ſuch Occaſions,
and <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is too clear ſighted, not to
foreſee the ill conſequences of it. <hi>Rome</hi>'s Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
have caus'd the overthrow of very
great Kingdoms; and your own have felt ſuch
furious Shocks, as hath requir'd more than a Day
to recover it. Hiſtory is full of ſuch Events,
and tho' <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Glory and Power, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
you at preſent from fearing the like; yet
you ought to look on your Heirs, who tho' they
inherit the one, may not have the good Fortune
to acquire the other.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Love which a Prince ought to have for his
Subjects, and of Taxes.</head>
               <p>NOthing doth better prove a Prince's Love
to his People, than his reflecting, why
they have made themſelves his Subjects, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him power over them. Every thing
hath a Beginning, and ſeeing we own <hi>Pharamond</hi>
to be our firſt King, it is evident we had none
before him, or at leaſt have no Knowledge left
of any; when the <hi>Gauls</hi> were under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> much is ſaid of ſome famous
Captains among the <hi>Gauls;</hi> but that was all the
Title they had, that of King being never given
to them. We do not read they commanded any
where but in the Army, and when their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
retir'd, they return'd to a private Life. If
they were eſteem'd and reſpected above others,
it was for their Valour, and not for any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that ſtill remain'd in their hands; ſince they
had none but when they were in Arms.</p>
               <p>The great ſtruggles the <hi>Gauls</hi> had to preſerve
their Liberty, which they had taken ſo much pains
to obtain; made them think of chuſing a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
but ſuch a Maſter who had only the Name,
and was ſo far from making himſelf a Tyrant,
that he concurr'd with them, to keep 'em again
from falling into Slavery. Without doubt,
had they thought that he on whom their Choice
was fall'n, would treat them as their Old Maſters
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98314:155"/>
the <hi>Romans</hi> had done, they would certainly have
ſoon ſet Bounds to his Authority. The Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of Royalty was at firſt properly no
more, than the election of a Soveraign, who
was to be univerſally obey'd, for the Publick
Good; and who was to have the ſame Affection
for his Subjects, that a Father of a Family hath
for his Children and Servants. And tho' in later
times, there have been great changes in Monarchies,
we ought to return to their true original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
No body can be in Love with arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Power, and had it not been introduc'd among
the <hi>Turks,</hi> their Emperours might have ſat more
ſecurely on their Thrones. A Prince ſhould
endeavour to reign in the Hearts of his People
by Love, rather than ſubject them to his Will
by Power. Many Kings have pretended to a
deſpotick Power, of doing what they pleas'd;
but that gave occaſion of calling together the
States, or ſuch Aſſemblies as in ſome places are
term'd a Parliament or Diet. But call 'em
by what Names you pleaſe, they are ſtill but
the ſame thing, ſeeing they repreſent the whole
Body of the Kingdom, compoſed of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
of the Nobility, and of that which is called
here in <hi>France</hi> the Third State. Such, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
are the Parliaments in <hi>England;</hi> but our
Parliaments in <hi>France,</hi> are Courts only eſtabliſh'd
to adminiſter juſtice to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> People.
In your Minority the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to meddle with Affairs of State, which was
an Uſurpation upon <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Authority, for
which you had juſt Reaſon to puniſh them. Good
Princes have always been the Protectors of theſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98314:156"/>
Aſſemblies of the States in this Kingdom, and of
Parliaments and Diets; not being concern'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were aſſembl'd or no, becauſe they never
intended to do any thing, but what was for the
Good of their People. And to ſpeak properly,
theſe States and Parliaments, are the People's
Guardians; but thoſe Princes that have a Deſign
to take away their Subjects Liberties, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Arbitrary Government, are always
afraid of Parliaments, becauſe they are a Rock,
on which uſually their Deſires and Hopes ſplit.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay 'tis fit theſe Aſſemblies ſhould
meet as often as they do in <hi>England;</hi> becauſe
by the length of their Debates, Opportunities are
many times loſt, that can never be recover'd.
Nor doth it become Subjects to have the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of their King: If it were to be permitted,
it ought to be at moſt but in very important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
and where it ſeems neceſſary that all the
Orders of the Kingdom give their Conſent; in
all other things, the Prince with his Council
may be a ſufficient Judge, it being to be preſum'd
he will do nothing but for the good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>If it were proper in this place to ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Prince's Council ought to be agreeable to
his Subjects; and conſequently, whether <hi>your
Majeſty</hi>'s Subjects had reaſon to preſs you to
baniſh Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> it would be a very
tickliſh nice Queſtion: For as it is the Peoples
Intereſt and Concern, that no body ſhould give
Evil Counſel to <hi>your Majeſty;</hi> ſo on the other
hand, many Inconveniencies might happen, if a
Prince ſhould have no Council, but ſuch a one
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98314:156"/>
as his People like; for that were to reduce Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
to the Condition of being Soveraigns only
in ſhew. But ſince what we treat of here is
quite another thing, I will only ſay, that the
Conſequence which reſults from the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the States, cannot poſſibly be deny'd;
which is, that a King ought to have a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Affection for his People, which he is oblig'd
never to depart from. The Reaſon is, becauſe
there had been no need of ſuch an Eſtabliſhment,
if they ſhould have had Power to do what they
thought good. But ſeeing ſuch Aſſemblies were
created, to be as I may ſay, Guardians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of the People, and have right to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their Mediation with the Prince, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may paſs to their Prejudice: It is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Proof, that Princes ought to be Fathers to,
and not Tirants over their Subjects. Otherwiſe
the Convocation of the States, and Meeting of
Parliaments, muſt have been created to favour
the one, and to take away the Rights of the
other. Now whoever ſaw an Aſſembly of the
States accus'd for aſſuming to themſelves an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that was not due to them? But that Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
falls often upon the Princes, and many of 'em
are not able to defend themſelves from it.</p>
               <p>If it plainly appear by what hath been ſaid,
that Kings have an Obligation to their People;
that which remains to be ſaid, will no leſs clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prove it, if we examine what are the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of the one, and of the other. We ſhall
ſee, that if Subjects be bound to obey their Prince,
the Prince is oblig'd to love and protect his
Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:98314:157"/>
A Prince, to ſpeak properly, is in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that which the Heart is to all the Parts
and Members of the Body. If the Heart be ſick,
the whole Body preſently reſents it; if any part
of the Body be ill, the Heart at the ſame time
ſuffers. Therefore to be in perfect Health, there
muſt be between the Heart and all parts of the
Body a conſtant Union and Agreement; and
they muſt in their ſeveral Functions mutually help
each other. Between a King and his Kingdom
the Caſe is the ſame: There muſt be a perfect
Harmony and Agreement between him and his
People. As the Heart gives Motion to all parts
of the Body, ſo doth the Prince to all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his People: And as the Heart receives
Succour from all the parts of the Body, to keep
it in a vigorous and healthful ſtate, that the
whole Body may enjoy the ſame; ſo ought a
King to receive Aid from his People, to ſupport
his Power and Authority, that he may preſerve
their Peace and Welfare.</p>
               <p>If this be an indiſputable Truth, which no
Man can doubt, then this Agreement between a
King and his Subjects depends ſolely upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
for if he be juſt, his People will certainly
be obedient. Now to be juſt, is to do every
individual Subject right, and not to ſuffer the
Strong to oppreſs the Weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſeems to have ſufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt it by the good Laws you have made,
and by ſending Magiſtrates into the Provinces,
to ſee them put in Execution. But the Queſtion
is, whether this is ſufficient, and whether there
be not greater Outrages committed in <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:98314:157"/>
Name, and under your Authority, than
were to be feared from the Great Men of your
Kingdom: For 'tis you, Sir, that are ſtronger
than the ſtrongeſt; and if the Power of others
be ſuppreſs'd to make <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> the greater,
yet you ought not to do any thing that is unjuſt.
The Covetouſneſs of the Partiſans is ſo intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that provided they can fill their own Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
they care not what Reproach they bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> Your Council ſometimes goes
too faſt, in making Orders to authorize their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions.
Your Council's chief Care is to pleaſe
you in all things they think are for your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
without ever examining what are the
Rights of your People. I have obſerv'd in ſome
Caſes their blind-fold Complyances, which
I may boldly call criminal; ſince they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Juſtice, which your Council ought to defend.
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> knows I have often oppos'd ſuch
Orders; for as I will always be for that which I
believe is Juſt; ſo I will never conſent to that
which I think is not ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> may remember
when the Duty of<note n="*" place="margin">There being a Duty laid on Wine reſembling our Exciſe, what is made and conſum'd (like Beer and Ale brew'd) in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families is exempt from all Duty. But by this Tax there is only an allowance of ſo much Wine to every Family proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to their Number, and if they exceed that Allowance the Officer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns <hi>Trop bu,</hi> and they pay Exciſe for the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus.</note> 
                  <hi>Trop bu</hi>
came to be debated, I did as
much oppoſe it as poſſibly I
could, and could I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
it had never been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd;
I knew the injuſtice
of it, notwithſtanding all the
fine Colours ſome endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to put upon it; but at
laſt it made ſuch a Noiſe, that
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> thought fit to revoke this new Tax.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:98314:158"/>
There are ſome of this nature which ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
but here are ſuch Complaints and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
again 'em, that they cannot laſt long. One
of this kind, is the making People in ſome places,
pay two ſeveral Taxes which are incompatible, as
in Cities and Towns whoſe Payments by Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are limited to a certain Summ, to require the
Payment of the<note n="†" place="margin">A Tax much like our Toll, which is taken at the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of other Cities, for all ſorts of Proviſion and Merchandize that enters therein.</note> 
                  <hi>Droit d'entrée,</hi>
and the <hi>Taille</hi> too. Tho' <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> doth not enter into a
ſtrict examination of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet you are made reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for it, as well as my
ſelf. Some think this is done by <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
expreſs Order, and by my Advice: But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners
of Provinces have more hand in it than
any body; the deſire they have to make their
Court to <hi>your Majeſty</hi> by increaſing your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;
is the reaſon of their being Inſtruments
to vex the People.</p>
               <p>They become ſo, becauſe the Council out of
which they are taken, and whoſe Members are
deſign'd to ſucceed them, think it is to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
wrong not to follow their Orders. All
Cauſes which concern <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Rights,
come ordinarily before the
<note n="*" place="margin">The King's Officers, who makes the Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all Taxes and Aids within their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces, and judge and regulate a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Elus,</hi> and then what Juſtice
can your People expect, when
they plead before Judges,
who are in Truth Parties?
For there is not an <hi>Elu</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> that is not a Penſioner to the Partiſans;
which is an Abuſe <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and you know I have often ſpoke to you
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98314:158"/>
of it. The Caſe as to the Intendants is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more nice, becauſe it is neceſſary for the
good of your Kingdom, that in thoſe Poſts there
ſhould be none, but ſuch as are zealous Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Intereſt: For otherwiſe your
Affairs would ſoon be in an ill Condition. That
which ought to be obſerv'd by them is, that they
ſhould not by flattery aggravate things; and 'tis
<hi>your Majeſty's</hi> and your Council's part, not to
countenance their being Favourites. Their ſo
paſſionately deſiring to heap up Riches, is that
which begets the good underſtanding and ſecret
correſpondance, which is always between them
and the Partiſans; therefore to rectifie this abuſe,
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> ought not only to chuſe Perſons
capable of the Imployment; but likewiſe thoſe
that are able to maintain themſelves in it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any thing that is baſe or unworthy:
For as a King hath the Glory of all the good
that is done in his Kingdom; ſo he ought to
bear the Shame of all that is ill done.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing all theſe things contribute either
to the Love or Hatred which People have for
their Prince; he ought to be careful, that his
Subjects be as little charged as poſſible, with new
Impoſitions; and he ſhould alſo be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in his Examination and Choice of thoſe
Perſons, with whom he truſts his Authority.</p>

maintain Religion, which, if taken away or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
I have already ſhew'd what irremediable
Miſchief will follow.</p>
               <p>The Nobility likewiſe is a Body, that doth
not only give Luſtre to the Monarchie, but is
the firmeſt Support of it.</p>
               <p>He conſiders things but ſuperficially, that
thinks the<note n="*" place="margin">The Lawyers.</note> 
                  <hi>Gens de juſtice,</hi> that is,
all concern'd in the adminiſtration
of Juſtice, to be more uſeful and neceſſary than
the Clergy and Nobility; whereas, they are ſo
far from being neceſſary in the State, that they
are rather the ruine of it. The multiplicity of
Royal and ſubaltern Courts of Juſtice, the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lywicks,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98314:159"/>
Preſidial Courts, and the Parliaments,
are ſo many Blood-ſuckers. They gnaw and
grate your Subjects, and I will maintain, they
coſt your People every Year, above Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Millions. I will think what courſe may
be taken to remedy ſo great a Miſchief; but I
cannot paſs by other Leeches, no leſs decryed
than theſe I have mention'd, tho' ſomewhat more
ſerviceable, and uſeful to the Publick.</p>
               <p>I mean the <hi>Gens d'Affaires,</hi> that is, the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whom the People think to be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all their Miſery. And indeed, in ſo
thinking, they are not altogether deceiv'd. I
confeſs this Abuſe may be more eaſily reform'd
than the other; but cannot be totally ſuppreſt.
I will ſay more of it, but muſt firſt ſpeak of
thoſe things wich ought to precede it.</p>
               <p>The Tradeſmen, as well as Husbandmen and
Labourers, are included in that which is call'd
the Third Eſtate; but indeed they ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
and have a Place by themſelves; ſince
'tis not juſt, that they, who take ſo much Pains
to preſerve the Kingdom, ſhould be mingled
with a company of Pettifoggers, whoſe buſineſs
it is to deſtroy it. I know <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is too
Prudent, not to protect, and in all things concur
with them, to make Trade and Tillage flouriſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Were I not oblig'd to obſerve order in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I would here more largely ſhew, what
Advantages <hi>your Majeſty</hi> may procure them:
But ſeeing I muſt not go before thoſe, of
whom I have firſt ſpoken, I return again to the
Clergy, who take Place of all the other Orders
of the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>PIety is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick,
that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> hath all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the World, not to beſtow Benefices, but
on ſuch as appear to be good and virtuous Men.
But ſeeing People know how to diſſemble, when
'tis for their Intereſt and Advantage; we ſhould
not always judge by Appearances, but ſtrictly
examin and enquire into their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.
The Univerſities and Seminaries eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
for this purpoſe, are of very great Uſe
and Benefit; for tho' many come to them with
diſſolute and worldly Minds; yet they are in a
fair way to be reform'd by good Example,
which they have daily before their Eyes. But I
think there ſhould be a certain time limited for
Peoples ſtaying in thoſe Seminaries, to which all
Perſons of Quality, as well as others ſhould be
ſubject, and none by any Priviledge exempted:
For 'tis not by long living in Univerſities, but
by coming abroad and converſing in the World,
that many things are learn'd, neceſſary for a
Clergy Man to know, and which he can never
ſo well learn any where elſe.</p>
               <p>Pluralities are now grown common; But ſtill
condemn'd by tender Conſciences. Thoſe that
are ſcrupulous, queſtion whether the going from
one Church to another, ought to be ſuffer'd:
Becauſe as a Lay Man is forbidden to change
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98314:160"/>
his Wife, or to have more than one at a time;
ſo a Clergy Man ought not to have two Livings,
or to commute that which hath been given to
him.</p>
               <p>The Covetouſneſs of Church-men, and of
other Perſons of Conſideration, join'd with that
neceſſity which hath often oblig'd <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
and your Predeceſſors to reward their good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
firſt introduc'd this abuſe of Pluralities. But
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> will do well, to conſider what ill
Conſequences attend it, againſt which, a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Remedy muſt be provided. Eccleſiaſticks
well born, and bred high, are ſeldom ſit Perſons
to edifie the People; for having liv'd in very
great abundance, and kept the great Men compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
they muſt needs retain ſome of their Vices.
Their Tables and their Stables, conſume the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of the Poor, and if in the midſt of
their Plenty, they chance to caſt their Eyes on
a poor Wretch, they command he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of their ſight, inſtead of taking pity on
him.</p>
               <p>Were Church-mens Poſſeſſions proportion'd
to their Character, they would live more frugally,
and give leſs Scandal. Great Riches often ruin
Men; and, if what the Goſpel ſays be true, that
whatever a Clergy-man's Revenue be, yet he
ought to take no more of it to his own uſe, than
neceſſity requires; how dangerous then muſt it
be to have a Hundred or Fourſcore Thouſand
Livers Yearly Rent, which we ſee many Church
men do enjoy. Did they bear any part of the
Burthen of the State, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd,
God's Portion ſet apart, to reward their
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98314:161"/>
good ſervices; but as they are in that reſpect
unprofitable Members of the Kingdom, ſo being
priviledg'd by their Character, they load others
with paying Tythes, and other Duties: While
with great care they free themſelves from the
Burthen which in juſtice they ought to bear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> in ſo large a Kingdom as yours,
hath need of a great number of good Servants,
and you would have wherewith all to reward
'em, if you divided among many, what you
ſometimes give but to one, and yet not content
him. You ſhould above all things conſider, that
the Service of God, and the Salvation of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of Souls, are brought into danger. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are a Rock upon which many a Man hath
been wreck'd, and rich Churchmen for the moſt
part, make an ill uſe of their wealth, and become a
Scandal to their Dioceſs; whereas if a Biſhop
had but a competent Revenue, he would employ
it in things profitable, and tending to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To put things into this State, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to take away the Revenue belonging to
Biſhopricks and Abbies; but to oblige thoſe
that are worth more than Ten thouſand Livers
Rent, to maintain a Vicar or School-maſter in
Pariſhes which have none, but where one is very
neceſſary. For when People are poor, and not
able to bear a new Charge, without being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd,
their Children will want inſtruction;
and Ten thouſand Livres a year, are more than
a ſufficient maintenance for a Biſhop or an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot;
the Service of God doth not require their
having ſuch rich and ſumptuous Equipages, nor
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98314:161"/>
ſuch Magnificent and Dainty Tables. In the time
of the Primitive Church, Luxury did not raign
ſo much among 'em, and then there were more
Saints than Biſhops or Court-Abbots.</p>
               <p>Another good effect that would be wrought
by leſſning the Revenue of the Clergy, is, that
Perſons of Quality, who enter into Orders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no other ſcore, but to have part of the
Wealth that belongs to the Church; would not
take upon them the Prieſthood, unleſs they
were truly call'd to it. So that for the future,
there would be none in the Church, but Men of
great Zeal and Piety, whoſe Example only would
be ſufficient to invite others to the ſame life;
for nothing more prevails on Men, than to ſee
what good Lives thoſe lead, who are their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>

                  </note> Of the Nobility, or Gentry.</head>
               <p>THE Gentry were heretofore very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſo dreaded their Valour, that when they
were known to be in your Armies, the Enemy
was ſtill unwilling to come to a Battle; but of
late the Gentry have loſt much of their Luſtre,
and are fallen into ſo great Poverty, that 'tis
hard to know who are truly Noble. There are
ſome Politicians who pretend this to be for <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi>'s advantage, becauſe if the Nobility
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98314:162"/>
were as flouriſhing as in times paſt, <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>'s
Power would not be ſo firm and ſtable, as
now it is. But ſuch Maxims look more like the
Politicks of <hi>Machiavil,</hi> than thoſe of a great
King. A Kingdom built on the love of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is of much longer duration, than that which
is founded on Tyranny. The times are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the ſame in a ſtate, and when they come
to change, 'tis to be fear'd, that they who have
been ill u'd, will ſhew their diſcontent, by ſome
ſignal diſobedience.</p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd divers Subjects of Complaints
among the Gentry; the firſt is, That they are
drain'd and conſum'd by the War, and their
Services very ill rewarded. The ſecond is, That
the <hi>Intendants</hi> uphold their Vaſſals againſt them,
by protecting them often very unjuſtly. The
third is, That under ſpecious pretences, they
are made a prey to the Covetouſneſs of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans,</hi>
who deſign their ruin. The fourth is,
That the rank which they have always held in the
Monarchy, is now very little regarded, and that
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> reſpects them no more, than if
they were born of the lees of the People.</p>
               <p>As to their firſt complaint, I think it not well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded;
for <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> as powerful as you
are, is not able to reward all the World. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
ought to conſider the Creation you have
made of the Companies of Cadets, and the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Houſe of<note n="*" place="margin">A Monaſtery for Women of Quality out of which they may Marry, or go again into the World.</note> 
                  <hi>St.
Cir;</hi> which is in ſome ſort a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for their Services; ſince it
frees them from the Charge of
their Children, who are maintain'd
at <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Expence, and put
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98314:162"/>
into a condition to be ſeveral ways preferr'd, by
an Education ſuitable to their Birth.</p>
               <p>If they pretend theſe Rewards are not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
according to Merit, and that <hi>Monſieur
Louvoy</hi> diſpoſes of them upon all occaſions, as he
thinks fit; this is what <hi>your Majeſty</hi> cannot
help, becauſe 'tis impoſſible that you can take
notice of all things, or know the merit of every
Officer, in the ſeveral Armies you have ſo far
diſtant from you. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> muſt in this
particular truſt him who hath the Charge of the
War, and if he impoſe upon you, 'tis he only
can be blam'd.</p>
               <p>The ſecond complaint indeed ſeems more juſt
and reaſonable; for as a Gentleman is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to oppreſs his Vaſſal, ſo the Vaſſal ought
not to fail of paying all due reſpect to his Lord.
But becauſe the one more rarely happens than
the other, the Lord is moſt commonly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the wrong doer; and he who hath the
power in his hands, is more like to be guilty of
vexation, than he that hath none. So that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is generally the perſon condemn'd; which
cannot be always juſtified, ſince there is nothing
ſo inſolent as a Peaſant that knows he hath ſome
body to back and protect him. 'Tis difficult in ſuch
Caſes to determine on which ſide the right lyes,
for if a Gentleman ſhould be believ'd on his
word, we ſhould often run the hazard of being
deceiv'd; and if credit ſhould be given to a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
we cannot be aſſur'd he ſpeaks truth. All
that I know to be done in ſuch a Caſe is, that
every <hi>Intendant</hi> ſhould make it his endeavour to
ſearch out the truth if poſſible, before he order
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98314:163"/>
any Information or Proceſs; for ſuch an order
gives great diſtaſte to an innocent perſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he is proſecuted by one that is his
inferiour, and owes him reſpect. But that this
expedient may not delay the ſpeedy doing of
Juſtice, let the falſe accuſer be exemplarily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
and on the other hand, let not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
accuſed be ſo far indulg'd, as to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to oppreſs any body, that hath juſt Cauſe of
complaint.</p>
               <p>For the third, I confeſs there is very good
Ground, and againſt which nothing can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
I have heretofore told <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi>
that the manner of inquiring who are noble, and
who not, is very vexatious and chargeable to
Gentlemen. To prevent the like trouble for the
future, 'twould be a better expedient how to
know them, to make one general exact ſearch;
but not by the <hi>Partiſans:</hi> And when ſuch a
ſearch is made, let there be a Catalogue or Liſt
Regiſtred of all that are Noble in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and let them and their Deſcendants, be
for ever after free from all other ſearches. To
hinder Plebeians from pretending to be of a
good Family that may be extinct, let every one
be oblig'd to give in a Note of all that are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
or Buried in his Family: If this courſe be
taken, no body will be able to make himſelf a
Gentleman that is none; and for thoſe that
ſhall for the future be made Noble, let them be
oblig'd to have their Patents Regiſtred.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> think fit to make ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and oblige every one to the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of it, you will not only get the love of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98314:163"/>
your Nobility, but do an act of Juſtice. For to ſay
truth, a Gentleman who hath been at a great deal
of trouble and charge to get out of the hands of
the <hi>Partiſans,</hi> muſt think it very ſtrange, to ſee
himſelf in a little time plagu'd again, in the
ſame manner, and under the ſame pretence he
was before. Others likewiſe give Gentlemen a
great deal of trouble concerning the Tenure of
their Lands, and tho' they know that upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Inquiſitions, they have made out their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
yet require them to do it again. There
ought to be ſome ſtanding rule eſtabliſh'd, once
for all, to ſettle the repoſe of the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Order of Men in your Kingdom. <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> is more concern'd to do it than you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
they are the chief ſupport of your Crown,
and did they not give good example to others,
by their zeal in your Service, all would quickly
be turn'd Topſie-turvy. Though <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
hath done a great deal for the Gentry, as I have
already ſhew'd, yet you are obliged to do more;
which might be eaſily done, if you would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Nunneries to receive young Women
that deſire to enter into Religion, without a
Portion.</p>
               <p>It would eaſe their Parents of a burden, and
be an advantage to <hi>Your Majeſty;</hi> for that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which is now given with Daughters, might
be beſtow'd on the Sons; and conſequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them to ſerve in your Armies, which would
be a great help to the Gentry, and ſilence many
of their Complaints. It muſt be confeſt, they
are not much the better for the Eſtabliſhment of
<hi>St. Cir.</hi> That is but as a drop of water to one
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98314:164"/>
that is thirſty, and the Houſe is not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the hundredth part of the Women, that
would ſeek a retreat there. How many Maids
for want of ſuch a refuge, lead ſad languiſhing
lives, and yet are happier and wiſer, than others,
who are oblig'd by Poverty to marry very mean
Men, and work for their Living.</p>
               <p>However ſuch a retreat as this, is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than what is given to moſt of the Maids of
<hi>St. Cir.</hi> Where tho the Houſe be under the care
of very great Perſons, yet one who hath a heart
as great as her Birth, is often forc'd, againſt
her Will, to Marry<note n="*" place="margin">A Word of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> a Tax or Toll
gatherer. Thoſe who have other
Sentiments, are not truly noble,
but only ſo in ſhew and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
To prove what I ſay, I need only tell,
what lately happen'd in the Houſe of a great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
where a Young Woman very well born,
by the baſeneſs of her Parents, who Sacrifis'd her
to their Private Advantage, was forc'd to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of their Domeſticks, ſhe died with Grief:
And the Man that married her, now courts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who, may ſhe have her Will, will never
have him; but becauſe ſome in very great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
are for him, he will certainly marry her in
ſpite of all ſhe and her Guardian can do to the
contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> is much diſhonour'd by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
your Authority in ſuch caſes; for theſe
things are commonly done by Letters under the
Privy Signet, by Vertue of which, Daughters
are taken from their Parents, and forc'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Religion; where they are neceſſitated to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98314:164"/>
be diſobedient, being oblig'd to do that, which
by the Laws of God and Man, they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to do. How many Women that are Heireſſes
to good Eſtates, are ſacrific'd in this manner, and
they that do it, never conſider how <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
loſes the hearts of the Gentry, whom it concerns.
The Counteſs of <hi>Tallard,</hi> and the Marchioneſs of
<hi>Thiange,</hi> were married againſt the Will of their
Parents, and tho' to Perſons of Quality, yet
what Satisfaction is that to a Father or Mother,
who perhaps had taken other Meaſures, and
thought themſelves ſecure under <hi>your Majeſty's</hi>
Reign from any ſuch Violence?</p>
               <p>The Gentry ſtand in need of another Help,
which they can expect from none but <hi>your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:</hi>
They are up to the Ears in Debt, out of
which, if you do not take ſome courſe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, they will be all undone; it is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
difficult, and 'twill be an act of Juſtice in <hi>your
Majeſty;</hi> for you will reſtore that repoſe to
them, which they have loſt on your Account; it
being a certain Truth, that they have been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
in your Service. Moreover, you will infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
oblige their Creditors, by ſaving them the
trouble and Charge of a multitude of Suits, which
the Malice of Judges, and the Knavery of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
will make endleſs. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> needs do
no more, than order all Debtors to ſell to
their Creditors, ſuch a Portion of Land, as is
worth the Money they owe them; which Land
ſhall be valued at a reaſonable Price, not at the
rate it goes now, but as it went Twenty five
Years ago: For Gentlemen would be quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
ſhould their Eſtates be valued at no higher
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98314:165"/>
Rate, than the preſent Rents; the miſery of the
Times, which cannot always continue, having
made Land leſs worth by a third Part, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was. 'Tis manifeſt, that when better
Order is taken, Lands will return again to their
former Value.</p>
               <p>But that Creditors may not complain, <hi>your
Majeſty</hi> will do well, to reduce all Land to
five and twenty Years purchaſe; and all Money
to Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt, and then let the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
take their Choice, whether they will have
their Principal and Intereſt at that Rate, or take
the Land that is offered them. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> did
almoſt the ſame thing; for when he ſaw the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
ſo much in debt, that they were not able
to clear themſelves, he order'd they ſhould pay
their Creditors in the manner I have propos'd,
and that their Creditors ſhould be ſatisfied
with it.</p>
               <p>If <hi>your Majeſty</hi> would do this, you would find
a great Advantage by it: For Gentlemen would
not only be in a better condition to ſerve you;
but when <hi>your Majeſty</hi> wanted Money, you
might, if you pleas'd, have all in the Kingdom,
at Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt; for every one would
rather lend his Money to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> than to
any body elſe.</p>
               <p>Were ſo good an Order once eſtabliſh'd, it
would be obſerv'd for the Future: Were that
done which was intended Twelve Years ago,
but not put in execution, becauſe there were ſuch
conteſts about it in Parliament; there ſhould be
Regiſters appointed to record all Obligations and
Contracts; then no body could be deceiv'd
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98314:165"/>
or cheated; for by looking over the Regiſter,
every Man's Debts might be known, and a Man
might preſently ſee whether he that deſir'd to
borrow Money could give good Security for it.
The Parliament had no mind this ſhould be done,
becauſe it would have cut off the <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Head
of all Proceſs and Law Suits; by which they
grew Rich. Their Pretence againſt ſuch a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
was, that all the Grandees of the Court, as
well as others, would be ruin'd by it: for owing
more than they had wherewith to pay, they
would not be able to borrow Sixpence, when
their Debts came to be diſcover'd. So that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
(by this Pretence) with many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſons to be of their Mind, they ſo caball'd
together, that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> revok'd the Edict
you had made concerning it.</p>
               <p>But this was too weak a Reaſon, to hinder
the doing of ſo much good. It is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to oblige People to deal faithfully and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
one with another, and they that lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
ought to have good Security for it. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Men's Credit muſt likewiſe be kept up,
otherwiſe, when they have occaſion for Money,
tho' they have an Eſtate, they will not be able to
borrow, becauſe they are thought to owe more
than really they do: and it muſt appear plainly
to Lenders, that they have good Security. When
ſuch a Regiſter is eſtabliſh'd, it will not be in
Peoples Power to cheat one another, as they now
daily do.</p>
               <p>There is another Benefit which your People
will have by it; againſt which there can be no
Objection, which is, when Men want Money,

they now apply themſelves to Uſurers, by whom
they are ſoon and certainly undone: But when
Regiſters are ſettl'd, they will have no occaſion
to deal with them; for whoever hath an Eſtate in
Goods or Land, may have what Money he wants
at reaſonable Intereſt, and then they that have
nothing, will not be able to deceive any body.</p>

               <p>IT may be thought ſtrange, I ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that they who are employ'd in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Juſtice, are a Sort of People
that ought to be deſtroy'd: As if I thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to introduce Libertiniſm and Violence,
two Things intolerable in a Kingdom. But tho'
I maintain that the rooting out of theſe People,
is the way to reform all Abuſes, and make the
Kingdom flouriſh; yet let it not be thought, I
any more intend Juſtice ſhould be baniſh'd, than
the Fear of God and the King. There are ways
of doing Juſtice, without making it ſo charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the People, and it may be done with eaſe,
by putting what I am about to ſay, in practice.</p>
               <p>That which makes thoſe who adminiſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ſo burthenſome to the People; is the Sale
of their Offices and Places, introduc'd by the
Kings <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Predeceſſors, and by Taxes
from time to time laid upon them, which they
muſt have out of thoſe that unhappily fall into
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98314:166"/>
their Clutches; but fearing it would make too
great a Noiſe, ſhould they flea them all at once,
they prolong ſuits, and fleece them by Degrees,
that their Robberies may not be perceiv'd. They
will have the laſt drop of their Clients Blood, a
Miſery to which all they that go to Law are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
a Man muſt leave his Buſineſs at home,
to run about ſolliciting, and ſometimes lye in
Town many Years, to loſe his Quiet and waſte
his Eſtate, and in truth, to lead as wretched a
Life as the Galley Slaves. Would there be any
need of this, if Juſtice were honeſtly and duly
adminiſtred? Of what nature ſoever any Cauſe
be, is there a neceſſity of diſguiſing it with ſo
many Forms of Proceedings? If Truth be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and naked, why is it repreſented in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Colours? To remedy this, let all the preſent
Forms of Proſecuting Law Suits be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd;
and for the future, let Cauſes be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
as they are in <hi>Turky,</hi> or by Conſuls upon
the Place, without having any thing to do with
green Bags, and Bundles of old Papers. But it
being impoſſible to make Men leave a Knaviſh
Trade, by which they get their Living, there is
no way to reform ſo great an Abuſe, but to cut
it up by the Roots.</p>
               <p>This may be eaſily done,
if your <hi>Majeſty</hi> will but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the<note n="*" place="margin">Is the Sixtieth part of the Price of any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Law or the Finances, which is annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally paid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the King by all Officers, that they may have leave to ſell or to diſpoſe of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces during that Year, and when an Officer dies without paying <hi>la Paulette</hi> his Heirs loſe the Benefit of his place. It takes its Name from <hi>Charles Paulet,</hi> who invented it about the Year 1600<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was authoriz'd by an Arreſt of the Privy Council the 12th of <hi>Dec. 1604.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Paulette,</hi> which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98314:167"/>
tho' it brings a great Revenue to <hi>your Majeſty,</hi>
by annual Payments and Loanes, yet not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the Benefit which the taking of it quite
away will be, not only to the Publick, but to
<hi>your Majeſty</hi> in particular. I have already ſaid,
that they who are concern'd in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtice, coſt your People Two Hundred
Millions Yearly; which will be eaſily made out,
if we conſider what a vaſt number of Blood-Suckers
are to be maintain'd, and what great
Charges People are put to in going to Law. A
poor Country-man that is Plaintif or Defendant,
doth not only loſe his Money, but what is dearer
to him his Time. How can he get his Living, when
he is forc'd to run ſolliciting from Houſe to Houſe,
the Doors being often ſhut againſt him, if he
has not a Silver Key to open 'em.</p>
               <p>The Benefit all People would find, by having
Juſtice adminiſter'd in another manner than now
it is; is ſo viſible, that I need not ſay much to
prove it. 'Tis evident that <hi>your Majeſty</hi> and
the whole Kingdom, will reap very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by it. Your People would be much eas'd,
their Purſes leſs drain'd, and they would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to ſupply <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Wants; and
when this Generation of Leeches has nothing to
do, they will be forc'd to follow ſome other
Trade, more beneficial to Monarchy. Some
would turn Souldiers, eſpecially thoſe that are
Rich, and would vie with People of Quality:
others would become Merchants or Bankers,
which would be of equal Advantage to <hi>your
Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For the more Souldiers you have, the
more Formidable you will be to your Enemies;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98314:167"/>
and the more Merchants you have, the more will
your Kingdom flouriſh. Theſe two Profeſſions
and Tillage, are enough to compleat its proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but I will add one thing more, which ſhall
be mention'd hereafter; and when I have given
my Reaſons for it, let Peoples Prejudice againſt
it be never ſo great, yet I hope they will be of
my mind. But I muſt firſt finiſh this Chapter,
which would be very imperfect, if I did not
ſhew in what manner I would have Juſtice admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd,
when the preſent practice in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of it, and all Offices and Places be
longing to it, are quite laid aſide and ſuppreſt.</p>
               <p>In the Juriſdiction of every Bayliwick, I
would have <hi>your Majeſty</hi> make choice of Three
underſtanding Perſons; and make them Judges
of all Differences that ſhould ariſe there; theſe
Three ſhould be choſen out of the Clergy, the
Gentry, and the Third State. Every one ſhould
plead his own Cauſe, and he that was not able to
do it himſelf, ſhould get a Friend to plead for
him. All Papers and Writings relating to the
Cauſe, ſhould be brought in, and laid on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
No Proceſs ſhould be iſſued, nor any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
paid for hearing the Cauſe. The Party
condemn'd ſhould not only pay Coſts, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a Fine. There may lie an Appeal to <hi>your
Majeſty,</hi> and for that, there ſhould be a certain
number of Judges eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> whereof,
ſome ſhould take Cognizance of the Appeals of
one Province, and ſome of another, but no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than for one Year only, and at the end of
that time they ſhould change their Offices one
with another. Their Salaries like thoſe given
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98314:168"/>
to the Judges of Provinces, ſhould be paid by
the People, for which there ſhould be a Tax laid
upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like that which is levied for <hi>your
Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this were done, there would be an end of

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Men of Buſineſs, ſuch Bankers or others
who farm the King's Revenue.</head>
               <p>IN ſo great a Kingdom as <hi>your Majeſty's,</hi>
where its Bounds have been ſo much enlarg'd
by your Conqueſts, there ought to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Fund of ready Money, that in Caſe your
Enemies ſhould have a mind to be reveng'd for
their Loſſes; <hi>your Majeſty</hi> may be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to oppoſe and repulſe 'em. It is impoſſible
you can do it at your own Charge, tho' <hi>your</hi>
Revenue be great, for if you ſhould make it your
Buſineſs to gather and hoard up Money, your
People would preſently be ſenſible of it: The
Money which is neceſſary to maintain Trade in
a Nation, muſt be in a continual circulation, to
make a Kingdom flouriſh.</p>
               <p>When War was declar'd by a Herald; a
Prince had ſome time to prepare for it, by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Coffers beforehand. But ſince nothing
is ſo much practis'd by Princes, as ſurpriſing
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98314:168"/>
one another, there is a neceſſity of having rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Money, which muſt be ſupply'd by Bankers,
whoſe Credit keeps all Trade in continual Motion.
It is therefore <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Intereſt, not only
to make uſe of, but likewiſe to protect them.
They muſt not however be ſuffer'd to ſuck your
Peoples Blood, but ſhould be ſeverely puniſh'd,
when they are found guilty of Extortion: 'Tis
juſt they ſhould get ſomething, but they muſt
not be permitted to rob your Subjects, and go
unpuniſh'd.</p>
               <p>To encourage them by an Honeſt Gain, I think
it ſufficient to allow them a ſixth Part for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
and 10. <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon extraordinary
Occaſions; for thoſe Branches of your Revenue
which are farm'd out, I think there can be no
better eſtabliſhment than the preſent; I would
not have 'em let at a Rent certain, as in Loans,
and no account to be given of the Overplus.</p>
               <p>That would be to revive the Miniſtry of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Fouquet,</hi> and open a Door to all the Abuſes
that were committed in his time. A Farmer
that looks forward, and conſiders what may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
hereafter, muſt not by bold Frauds make too
much haſte to be Rich, and hazard the undoing
of himſelf, and his Children after him. There
may a time come, when he ſhall be call'd to a
ſtrict Account, and be forc'd to diſgorge all he
hath ſwallow'd, and rot in a Goal: He were
much better for his own Peace, be contented
with reaſonable Gain.</p>
               <p>In farming out <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Revenue, it is
neceſſary that the Perſon on whom you rely to
do it, ſhould never depend on the Fidelity of the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98314:169"/>
Commiſſioners: For, let him be never ſo cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
they will, if poſſible, deceive him in their
Accounts; they will dextrouſly charge too much
or too little as they ſee their Advantage; and
ſometimes between the Intendant of the Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who hath Power to let them; and the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
that rent them; there may be ſo Good an
underſtanding, as to divide the Cake, and defraud
<hi>your Majeſty.</hi> To prevent this, there ſhould
always be join'd with the Farmers, an honeſt Man
who may be confided in; he will be a continual
Spie upon the reſt, and be ſo diſtruſted by them,
that they will be afraid, tho' they have never
ſo much mind, to do <hi>your Majeſty</hi> Wrong.</p>
               <p>It being impoſſible for a Comptroller General,
to know of himſelf, all the ways and means which
may be us'd to raiſe Money; he ought to deal
faithfully with thoſe, that give him information
how it may be done. I always, without reſpect
of Perſons, gave Rewards to thoſe that brought
me any good Memorials, or Propoſals to that
purpoſe. 'Tis the way to ſharpen Mens Wits,
and to diſcontent ſuch Men, may be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to <hi>your Majeſty's</hi> Affairs. Their Papers
muſt be examin'd, to ſee what is good, and
what is bad in their Propoſals. I would fain
know what a Miniſter of State could do, if he
were not ſometimes aſſiſted by other Mens ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he will find it ſo much trouble to look over
and rectifie thoſe Memorials that are brought
him, that he will hardly have time to ſleep qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</p>
               <p>There are ſometimes hard Bargains, where a
Company loſes conſiderably, notwithſtanding
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98314:169"/>
the Allowance that is made 'em: As when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
are aſſign'd to 'em for Payment, which
they cannot ſell or put off. The Caſe is then
the ſame, as if nothing had been given them.
A Miniſter of State, ought on ſuch Occaſions
to do them Juſtice, and not let 'em ſuffer: For
if <hi>your Majeſty</hi> will have Money, you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
and not Perſecute thoſe that are to furniſh
you with it; for if they are to advance it, 'tis
requiſite People ſhould believe they are Men of
Subſtance, and in a good Condition; when once
they think the contrary, they will be wary how
they part with their Money, to thoſe that are
upon the brink of Ruin.</p>
               <p>I remember a Conjuncture of this nature, ſince
I have been in the Poſt to which <hi>your Majeſty</hi>
was pleaſed to prefer me; but I preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
a Remedy: It was in the Year 1670. when
People kept their Purſes ſaſt tied, and there was
little or no Money ſtirring. The Bankers came
daily, and told me, their Credit was quite loſt,
that People thought them engag'd in ill Bargains,
and would truſt 'em no longer. I then did two
things which ſucceeded very well; firſt I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Perſons to enquire what Loſſes they
had ſuſtain'd, with a Promiſe that when I knew
what really they were, I would make 'em Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
Next I ſent for the Principle Agents
of the Bank, and after having had <hi>your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's</hi>
Conſent, I diſtributed Three Millions
among 'em, which they preſently employ'd in
Trade. They that knew not whence the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
came, concluded preſently, that theſe Men
would never run the Riſque of ſo great a Summ,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98314:170"/>
but upon very good grounds, they immediately
follow'd their Example, and People univerſally
began again to open their Purſes.</p>
               <p>In a time of ſcarcity, eſpecially of Wine, the
like inconvenience may happen, becauſe they
that farm the Duties upon it, would be undone,
if there were not ſome allowance made them,
proportionable to their loſs. Now not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how it will go with them, till <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s
pleaſure be declar'd how much they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated;
every one keeps his Money in his hands,
and all the Banks are ſhut up at once, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
who are Sub-farmers will pay nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they alſo expect an abatement; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are not able to pay, when ſometimes
they have a great deal of Money in their hands,
which they will not part with, tho' you ſhould
Quarter Souldiers upon them, or ſend them to
Priſon. To avoid this, which in time will be
extremely prejudicial to <hi>your Majeſty</hi>'s Affairs;
your Miniſter muſt appoint Commiſſioners to
make him a true report of the ſtate of Affairs,
but they muſt never be choſen out of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Farmers; becauſe that would be to put <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi>'s Concerns, into the hands of ſuſpected
Perſons, not to be truſted. Who under bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
names, are often partners with the Sub-farmers;
and will be ſure to aggravate their
loſſes, pretending them to be much greater than
in truth they are. And when they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
will not trouble themſelves, let what
will happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> muſt forbear as much as poſſibly
you can, and the ſtate of your Affairs will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98314:170"/>
the impoſing of any new Taxes; but there
is one that hath not yet been laid, which I think
very juſt and neceſſary, and will be ſo far from
doing hurt, that it will certainly do a great
deal of good. All <hi>France</hi> is of late years, ſo
over run with Luxury, and Vanity reigns every
where to that degree; that 'tis impoſſible to
know a Peaſant from a Gentleman, a Citizen
from a Magiſtrate, or the Rabble from Citizens.
Their Families in the mean time ſuffer, and 'tis
an abuſe which <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> is oblig'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
not only that Mens ſeveral conditions
may be diſtinguiſh'd, but alſo to keep them
from being miſerable. A bare Law in this Caſe,
will be but an uncertain remedy; becauſe we
daily ſee Laws laſt but a little time, and are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
broken as ſoon as made. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>
muſt therefore lay a Tax upon all thoſe that
wear Clothes beyond their Quality, and you muſt
by an Edict declare, who may wear Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who Silk, and ſo downwards; and that they
who ought not to wear Gold or Silver, and yet
preſume to do it, ſhall pay ſo much; and they
that wear Silk, or any other forbidden Stuff, ſo
much. This impoſition will make all People
live within compaſs, according to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or will be a very conſiderable Income to
<hi>Your Majeſty;</hi> for if you oblige thoſe to pay a
Crown or two, that contrary to the Law wear
Gold or Silver, and thoſe to pay a little leſs
that wear Silk, Lace, or whatever elſe ſhall be
prohibited; how many that by the Law ought
not to wear ſuch or ſuch things, will rather pay
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98314:171"/>
their Money, than (as is uſually ſaid) not go like
other folks; and yet no body can complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch a Tax, becauſe it will be voluntary,
no perſon being bound to pay it, but he that
will.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Of Tradeſmen and Commerce.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing ſo neceſſary to make a
Kingdom flouriſh as Trade; and for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
proof of it, we need but obſerve
the difference between a Town ſituated upon a
good River, and an Inland Town. The one is
rich and plentiful, the other poor and miſerable.
But Towns near the Sea-ſide, have yet an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which others have not, becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
more in all things, than thoſe upon Rivers,
or in any other places; ſo that whoever hath
a mind to follow any imployment, may if he
pleaſe live very comfortably. Now if ſo many
advantages attend Trade, which no body can
deny, it ſhould be an incitement to <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi>
to promote and protect it. Many have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and ſtill blame me, for perſwading <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> to encourage and countenance Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
exclaiming againſt me, that nothing we
can do, will be comparable to that we have
from foreign parts. But they are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for tho' I confeſs we did not in our firſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98314:171"/>
attempts, bring things to that perfection we
deſir'd; yet it muſt be granted, that in what
we have done ſince, we have excell'd all others. I
will inſtance only in the Glaſſes made at <hi>Paris.</hi>
We never had from <hi>Venice</hi> any ſo great, as are
now made in the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Antoine.</hi> The
<hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador himſelf was ſurpriz'd, and
till he ſaw it with his own eyes, would never
believe any could be made ſo large; and tho'
he wrote to <hi>Venice</hi> what Glaſſes he had ſeen here,
yet they were ſo incredulous, that they thought
it impoſſible. 'Tis true our Glaſs doth not look
ſo clear and lively, as that which comes from
thence; but it may be eaſily refin'd. And the
difference between theirs and ours, is not ſo
great, that we ſhould ſend thither three Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
every year, to buy Looking Glaſſes and
Coach-Glaſſes.</p>
               <p>What can be objected againſt our Tapiſtry
made at <hi>Beauvais;</hi> and at the <hi>Gobelins?</hi> I would
fain know whether <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> be willing, I
know not how much Money ſhould go into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> to bring Hangings from thence? If
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> had not ſo long ſuffer'd it, you
might e're this have been Maſter of thoſe rich
Provinces. For 'tis certain that they have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
their War with <hi>French</hi> Money; for by that
very Manufacture in three ſeveral places, they
have drawn out of <hi>France</hi> many Millions, and if
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would forbid the bringing likewiſe
of Hair, and Lace from thence, they would
ſoon fall into great Poverty. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ſhould
therefore lay ſo great an Impoſition upon theſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98314:172"/>
Commodities, that no body would care to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them. What need have we of Tapiſtry,
of Hair, or <hi>Flanders</hi> Lace? Your Kingdom is
great enough and full enough of Ingenious Men,
to furniſh all theſe things. The Importation of
them muſt be diſcountenanced, by <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>'s
being the firſt that leaves uſing of them;
for people will certainly follow your example,
ſince in imitating you, they never conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
do well or ill.</p>
               <p>The Caſe is the ſame as to our Cloth, and other
Manufactures. We muſt do all we can, to ſtop
the current of our Monies going out of the
Kingdom. If any complain that our firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
do not ſucceed, yet we muſt not give
over; no Prentice does immediately become a
Maſter, but by conſtant forging becomes a Smith.
All beginnings are difficult, and nothing but
time makes things perfect; Water in the Spring
is not ſo clear as it is in the Stream, and
'tis patience that brings Men to the End they
aim at.</p>
               <p>I know that they who are not of my Opinion,
make this Objection againſt it. If we reſolve
not to have any Commerce with Foreigners,
they will not Trade with us; ſo that 'tis beſt to
let things ſtand on the ſame foot they now
are, and have always ſtood; but they that talk
at this rate, ought to know, that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
have need of us, but we no need of
them. <hi>France</hi> hath generally all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
within it ſelf, very few excepted; but
it is not ſo with other Countries that confine
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98314:172"/>
upon us; they have neither Wine, Salt, Corn,
Hemp, or Brandy; and therefore muſt have it
of us; and we ſhould make but an ill uſe of that
which God hath given us, if we let others have
it, for that whereof we have no need. If Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
muſt have our Money, let it be only for
that which cannot be had in our own Kingdom;
as Spices which are to be fetched from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
or bought of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> for any thing
elſe, we may be without it, and let not Luxury
tempt us to do any thing prejudicial to our
Native Country.</p>
               <p>They are ſo rigorous in many great Cities of
your Kingdom, that they will not receive
Tradeſmen among them; which is an abuſe
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> ought not to ſuffer; for it keeps
many from applying themſelves to Trade, who
perhaps would thrive better, than thoſe that are
in it. What neceſſity is there of ſerving an
Apprentioeſhip to a Maſter? It may perhaps
be neceſſary for Handicrafts-men and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
becauſe no body ſhould venture upon a
Trade which they do not underſtand; but
for others, why muſt they loſe their time, or
why muſt they be hinder'd from following a
Trade they have learn'd in Foreign Countries,
or becauſe they cannot ſhew a Certificate that
they ſerv'd an Apprenticeſhip? Is it juſt or
reaſonable, that <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s Name ſhould be
made uſe of to keep induſtrious perſons from
getting their Living? you are the Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of your People, and ought to take them

If you would publiſh an Edict to abrogate all
By-laws in Corporations, againſt People's ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up Trades there without their leave, it
would do no harm. <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would find
your account, in obliging People to take Letters
of Licence from you; for which they ſhould pay
a ſmall Summ. The number of thoſe that would
come for Licenſes would be ſo great, that tho'
they had 'em for little, yet <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would
find it very conſiderable. Beſide, they would
think themſelves oblig'd to you, becauſe what
they gave you, would be leſs than it coſts
them in Corporations, to get leave to keep a
Shop.</p>
               <p>Particular care ſhould be taken by <hi>Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
to regulate the Trade of <hi>Stationers.</hi> It is
in Country-Towns ſo ſubject to the Inquiſition
of the <hi>Paris</hi> Bookſellers, who by vertue of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
obtain'd from the <hi>Chancery,</hi> keep all
other Bookſellers throughout the Kingdom in
ſuch dependence; that they muſt either ſtarve,
or run the hazard of being undone. If <hi>Your
Majeſty</hi> will take compaſſion of 'em, you muſt
confine the Priviledges of the <hi>Paris</hi> Book-ſellers
to the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and permit all others to
ſell without Controll. <hi>Paris</hi> alone is more
worth than all the reſt of the Kingdom, but 'tis
not reaſonable, that more than two thouſand
Families, ſhould periſh for the ſake of a
few.</p>
               <p>The Council is full of inſtances of the like
kind, and your People have reaſon to expect,
you ſhould favour the oppreſſed. The Books
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98314:173"/>
that are brought from <hi>Paris</hi> are ſo very dear, that
poor People are not able to come up to their
Price. A poor Parſon whoſe living is worth but
a hundred Crowns a year, hath as much need of
Inſtruction, as he who hath two thouſand; and
if it be expected that he ſhould Preach and
do his Duty, he muſt not be trod under
foot.</p>
               <p>The only thing that can be objected againſt
ſo good and juſt a Regulation, is, that <hi>Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
may have reaſon to leſſen the number
of Bookſellers; for Libels are now ſo frequent
and common, that Bookſelling may be thought
a Trade more pernicious than profitable to
the Government. When there are fewer Book-ſellers,
the Authors of theſe Libells may be
diſcover'd. It may alſo be neceſſary to bring
all that ſell Books to ſo low a condition, as to
force them to follow ſome other Imployments;
for indeed there is no need of ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Learning and Letters will flouriſh without
it. But whatever <hi>Your Majeſty</hi>'s intention be,
you may do as is done in <hi>Spain,</hi> where Books
are Sold at a Price certain, and he that Prints
them, is not permitted to put ſuch a rate upon
them, as they that have need of them, think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Husbandmen and Tillage.</head>
               <p>TIllage and Husbandry, being the great
Wealth of the Kingdom, <hi>your Majeſty</hi> is
not only concern'd, to contribute all you can,
to the maintaining of it in its preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but if poſſible, to put it into a better. In
many Places of the Kingdom, a great deal of
Land lyes Untill'd, becauſe the People are very
poor, and have not Beaſts or Cattle to Manure
it, nor any other means to improve it. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and help your People in a buſineſs ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would do well to leſſen
the Taxes, a Burden under which they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſink; and lend them Money to buy Cows
and Sheep. Five or ſix Millions diſpers'd among
the Provinces, would make them all flouriſh,
and <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> would be the firſt that would
reap the benefit of it; for as ſoon as your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are in a better condition, they will be the
better able to aid and aſſiſt you.</p>
               <p>One of the greateſt cauſes of the Sterility of
the Earth, is the Poverty of thoſe that ſhould
cultivate it; for we ſee one and the ſame Soil,
produce more or leſs, as it is well, or ill
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98314:174"/>
Plow'd and Dreſs'd. Therefore it will not be
enough for <hi>Your Majeſty</hi> to give Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Money to buy Cattle if they ſtill want
Horſes: I call ſuch poor Jades, as are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to draw a Plow, want of Horſes.
For when the Earth is but ſcratch'd up, and
not Plow'd deep enough, what Crop can it
produce? <hi>your Majeſty</hi> muſt therefore give
'em Money to buy better, and ſtronger
Horſes; and the rather, becauſe you your
ſelf will find the benefit of it. Let them
have Mares of a good ſize, and they will
bring Colts that will ſerve to mount your
Cavalry; and then there will be no more
need of going into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
to buy Horſes of Stature for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe that keep Stallions, muſt
take more care of them, than they have
done hitherto. 'Tis therefore my opinion,
that they ſhould be put into the hands of
Gentlemen, who know beſt how to order
them: and 'tis more their buſineſs than theirs
who now keep them. But the Summ which
<hi>Your Majeſty</hi> hath hitherto been pleas'd to
lay out for this purpoſe, is not ſufficient for
it. Fourſcore and four Stallions in the whole
Kingdom, are but enough for two or three
Provinces, and there are others which are very
proper, to keep Races to breed by.</p>
