            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For to passe ouer, and to speake nothing of the times of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient Patriarkes &amp; Prophets, in whose dayes, as I haue sayde before, there was no season voyde of slaunders and reproches against the truth. We knowe that there were certaine persons that sayde and openly pronounced of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient Iewes, (of whom we doubt not, but they worshypped the onely and the trew God) that in stede of God they worshipped other a Sowe or an Asse:<note place="margin">

               </note> and that all their religion was nothing els but a sacrilege &amp; a contempt of al diuine power. We knowe that the sonne of God, oure sauioure Iesus Christ, for teachinge of the truth, was taken for an enchaunter, for a worker of mischiefe, for a Samaritane, for Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, for a deceiuer of the people, &amp; for a man that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his delite in eatinge and drinkinge. And who is ignorant of those thynges that were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time past agaynste that moste earnest setter forthe &amp; champion of the truth S. Paule: somtime that he was a seditious person, that hee gathered souldiers, that hee entended vprore: sometimes that he was an Heretike, sometyme that he was madde, somtimes that onely to make strife and for his pleasure, he blasphemed the lawe of God, &amp; despised the ordinaunces of the fathers? Who knoweth

               </note> so sone as he had receaued into the inwarde bosome of his mynde the truth, and had begon freely (according as he was bounde) &amp; stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preache it and to professe it, was by &amp; by brought to pleade for his life, as though he had wickedly spoken blasphemy againste the lawe, against Moses, againste the Temple, &amp; against God? Or who is ignorant that there were men in tymes paste, whiche accused the holy Scriptures of lyes, saying that they conteined thinges plaine contrary and repugnant one to an other: &amp; that the Apostles did dissent euery one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other,<note place="margin">

And least it should be to longe to reherse all, for that were infinite: who is ignorannt, howe that oure Fathers whiche firste began to acknowledge and to professe the name of Christe, were slaunderously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of,<note place="margin">

            <p>All these thinges in those daies were spoken against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of God, against Christe Iesus, against Paul, against Stephan, and againste al those that in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
<pb facs="tcp:8195:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Churche embraced the truth of the Gospel, and were content to be called by the name of Christians, a name in those daies very odious amongest the people. And albeit those thinges were not trew, yet the Deuill thought it inough for him, if at the least he coulde bring it to passe, to cause them to be taken for trewe, and that the Christians should be hated of al men, and by al men persequuted vnto the death. Wherfore Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces leadde by suche perswasions, killed the Prophets of God, euen to the laste man. Esaie thei condemned to the sawe, Ieremy to be stoned, Daniel to the lyons, Amos to the club, Paule to the sworde, Christe to the crosse, al Christian men to prisons, to tortures in horses bellyes, to the gallowes, to rockes, to cliues, to wilde beastes, to fyers. Yea &amp; thei sticked not to make great bonefiers of their liuing bodies, onely for a light to serue them in the night season,<note place="margin">

            <p>O holy Scribes and Pharisees, vnto whome this holines was neuer knowne. O holines and Catholike faith. These things Petre neuer taught at Rome: Paul liued not at Rome after this maner: They did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly maynteine baudery: they did not exacte any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions or taxes vpon harlots: They did not allowe that open adulterers and murderers should goe vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.

Nether for any other cause did they so bitterly turmoile them, or call them runnawaies and forsakers of their profession, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bicause they had gone from their fellowship, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the ordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nces of the elders. And in case we wil folow the iudgement of those men onely, by whom the Church was gouerned at that time, &amp; haue no respect other to God or to his woorde or to any other thinge: doubtles it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be denied, but that the Apostles, in as much as they declined away from the high Byshops &amp; priestes, that is to say from the catholyke Church, and contrary to their willes, cried they neuer so much, brought in an innouation &amp; a change of many thinges in religion, were rightly condemned and according to law.

And that Christ and the Apostles, what time they did exhorte the people to the redyng of the holy scriptures, that out of them thei might become plentifull in all wisdome and knowlege, did goe about to abuse menne with lies? It is no meruaile thoe these men despise vs and all that we doe or say, whiche make so litle accounte of God him self, and of his moste holy worde. Yet was it but a folish deuise of them, in seking to hurte vs, to commit so haynous an iniurie agaynst the worde of God. But Hosius will crie out, we doe him iniurie, and that these be not his, but Zuinkfeldius wordes. But what if Zuenkfeldius also crie, that they be not his, but Hosius wordes? For wher did Zuinkfelde euer write the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or if he did write them and Nosius iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to be wicked, why did he not at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least speake one worde to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute them, how so euer the matter goe?

            <p>Doubtles there is nothing can be spoken of greater weight against the religion of God, then when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of noueltie: for like as in God him self, so in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion there ought to be nothyng newe: neuerthelesse we can not tel how it cometh to passe, that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, we haue alwaies seene it in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as God wolde, as it were, kindle and disclose his truth vnto men, althoe it were of it self not onely most auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but also euerlastyng: yet of wicked men and of such as were enemies therunto, it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led grene and newe stuffe.

And may we not, saye they, learne of the what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of new doctrine is this?

<q>Hath God saith he, now at the length after so many ages called himself to so late a rememberance? Eusebius saith also, that Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion euen from the beginning was called in reproche <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is to saye, new and strange.</q>
Euen after the same sorte these men doe condemne all things that we doe allow, for new and straunge: their owne thinges againe, whatsoeuer they be, they will haue them to be commended as moste auncient. And lyke as Necromanciers and Witches, at this day such as haue to doe with Deuils, are wont to say: that thei haue their bookes and all their sacred &amp; hidd misteries from Athanasius, from Cyprian, from Moises, from Abel, from Adam, and also from Raphael the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, to the intent that that skil which had proceded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such authors and inuentours, might be adiudged to be more glorious and more heauenly. Euen so these men, to the ende that their religion, which they themselues haue hatched and that not so long agoe to themselues, might be the eassier and better set forth vnto men, that eyther were fools in deede, or little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered what they did, and where about they went, are wont to say, that it came vnto their handes from Augustine, from Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chrisostome, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ambrose, from the Apostls, &amp; from Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>For right wel thei know, that ther is nothing more plausible vnto the people, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these names, or better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common sortes of men. But what if those
<pb facs="tcp:8195:42"/>
thinges, which these men would haue accounted to be new, be founde to be most auncient? Againe, what if those thinges, in maner all, which these men so hyghly set forth with the name of antiquitie, after that they haue been well and diligently syfted, shall be founde at the last to be but grene and new?</p>
            <p>Truely the lawes and Ceremonies of the Iewes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Aman did accuse them of nouelty, yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any man that considered them truly and vprightly, thei coulde not appeare to be new, for thei were written in most auncient tables. And Christe, although many supposed that he did declyne from Abraham and from the olde fathers, and that he brought in a new Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne heade, yet he answered truely: If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued Moises, you should beleue mee also: for my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is not so new as you take it. Moises a most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aucthor, whom you doe esteme aboue all men, did speake of mee. And. S. Paule, Although the Gospell of Iesus Christ be reputed of many to be new, yet it hath saith he, a most auncient testimony of the law and the Prophetes. As for our doctrine, the which we may cal more rightly the Catholike doctrine of Christ, is so far of from all nouslty, that the olde God of all ages and the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ hath commended it vnto vs in moste auncient monuments, euen in the Gospell, and in the bookes of the Prophetes and of the Apostles. So that now it can not seeme new vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, except there be any, to whom either the fayth of the Prophetes, or the Gospell, or Christ himselfe seemeth to be newe. But in case their Religion bee so auncient and so olde, as they woulde haue it to appere, wherefore doe they not proue it oute of the examples
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8195:42"/>
of the primitiue Church, out of the auncient fathers, out of the olde Councels? Why lyeth so olde a cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned so longe tyme wythout a defender? as for Sworde and Fyer they haue had alwayes at hande: but of olde Councels and Fathers no worde at all.</p>
            <p>And surely it had been altogether against reason, to begin at these bloody and cruell reasons, if they could haue founde any gentyler and mylder argumentes. But if they haue in deede such truste in Antiquitie, wythout any maner of counterfeiting: why did Iohn Clement a Countrie man of oures, not many yeares paste, in the syght of certaine honest men and men of good credit, teare and cast into the fyer certaine leaues, out of a most auncient Father and a Greeke Bysshop called Theodoret, in the which he dyd euidently and expressely teache, that in the Sacrament the nature of bread was not taken away?

Now the Pope chalengeth bothe the swordes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth them bothe: wherefore it ought to seeme lesse maruaile, if that hath folowed sithens, which Clement spake of: that he hath both deceiued himselfe, and them that haue giuen eare vnto hym. Leo the Pope sayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in one Churche and vpon one day it is lawfull to say but one Masse: These men in one Churche doe saye sometymes ten, sometimes twenty, sometime thirtye Masses, and ofte times moe in one day, in so much that the vnhappy man that standeth by, and is the looker on, can scantly tell, which way it is best to turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Pope Gelasius saith, that if anye man deuide the Sacrament, so that when he taketh the one parte he leaueth the other, he doth lewdely and committeth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege. These men both contrarye to gods worde and contrary to Pope Gelasius, commaunde that the one parte of the Sacrament onely be gyuen to the people: and in so doyng, they make al their Priestes gilty of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege. But in case they will say, that all these matters are nowe worne out of vre, &amp; become vtterly deade, so that vnto these daies they appertaine nothing at al: yet to the intent that all men may vnderstand, what credit is to be gyuen vnto these manner of men, and what good is to be looked for of those Councels which they assemble together: let vs see a little, what regarde they haue to those things, which now in these latter yeares, whils thei be yet in fresh reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thei haue decreed, &amp; in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel lawfully called to be inuiolably obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

And that I may come ones to an ende: of all the fathers whiche any one of them dyd teache the to dispose the bloud of Christ, and merites of the holy Marters: and as it were marchaundise, to sell thy pardons in a common market and all the corners of purgatory? These kinde of men ar oft times wonte to talke muche of their hidde and depe learnyng, and of their manifolde and great variete of reading. Let them therefore now bring out somwhat if they can, wherby it maye at the leaste appeare that they haue readde and knowe somewhat. They haue cried it out lustily in all companies where they came, that all partes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:8195:46"/>
were auncient and approued, not only of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but also by the consent and continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and times.</p>
            <p>Wherfore let them at one time or other shew this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie which thei speake of. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make these things to appere, whiche ar spred, as they say, so far &amp; so wide. Let them proue that al Christian nations haue agreed vnto their religion. But they flee, as we sayde a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, euen them selfs from their owne decrees: and those thinges, whiche so fewe yeares paste they had establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to remaine for euer, in so shorte time haue made to be of none effect. I pray you then, how shold they trust in the fathers, in the olde cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, in the wordes of God? They haue not, O mercifull God, they haue not those thinges, whiche thei boaste themselues to haue, nother antiquitie, nor vniuersalitie, nother the consent of all places, nor of al times. And therof they themselues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they would rather haue the matter dissembled, ar not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Yea somtimes thei sticke not also plam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confesse it. And therfore thei say, that the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of olde Councels and fathers ar of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that somtimes they may be chaunged: for according to the diuersitie of times, diuerse decrees ar conuenient to be had in the Church. And thus they couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name and title of the Church, and with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite shadow doe scornfully abuse the simple &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched people. And a meruayle it is, that either me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be so blinde, as they can not see these thinges: or if they doe see them, that they be so pacient, as they can thus easily endure them, and with so quiet a minde.</p>
            <p>But in asmuche as they haue abolished and repealed those auncient decrees, as thinges that ar now become
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8195:46"/>
ouer olde, and worne out of vse, peraduenture thei haue set other in their place, that be better and also more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.

               </note> Trewe it is in deede, that thei haue put other in their places, but accordyng as Hieremias said, chaffe in steade of wheate: and as Esay saythe, Those thynges, whiche God hath not requyred at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. They haue stopped vp all the vaynes of the springyng water, and they haue digged broken and durty pittes, full of slyme and filthines, whiche nother haue anye cleane water, nor ar able to contayne it. They haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the people the holy communion, the worde of God, from whence shoulde haue come all comforte, the true worshyppe of God, the right vse of sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and of prayer. Agayne thei haue giuen vnto vs of their owne store, wherewith in the meane season we might chiere oure selfes, salte, water, creame, pottes, spittell, palmes, bulles, Iubiles, pardonnes, crosses, smoky ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and an infinite nombre of ceremonies, and mere mockes as Plautus saythe, meerly to be mocked at. In these thynges, haue they fixed theyr whole reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. With these thinges, they taught that God might be well appeased: that with these, Devils be driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. That with these, mens consciences were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For these forsothe be the ornamentes and denty storeboxes of Christian religion. These, in the sight of God be pleasant and acceptable: that these thynges might be auaunced vnto honor, it behoued that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Christ and of the Apostles should be taken
<pb facs="tcp:8195:47"/>
out of place. And as the wicked kynge Hieroboam in time paste, after he had taken awaye the true worship of God, and had brought the people to the worshipping of golden calues, leaste that afterwardes they shoulde peraduenture haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged theyr mindes, and slipping from him, haue returned agayne vnto Hierusalem to the Temple of God, he exhorted them with a long ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, sayng: These o Israel ar thy gods: after this sorte your God hath commaunded that you should worshippe him: It should be a paynefull and a troublesome thing for you to vndertake so long a Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and euery yeare to goe to Hierusalem, to the intent to honor and to worshippe God. After the same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner in all pointes, these men, when that for theyr owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake, they had ones made voyde the law of God, least that the people should afterwardes ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their eies, and slippe an other waye, and finde at others handes a more certayne course for their saluation, O how often haue they cried, This is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kynde of worshippyng that pleaseth God: and whiche he doth streightly require at our handes: and wherewith he will be appeased in his anger: By these thinges the agrement in the Church is conserued: with these thinges all sinne is cleansid, and consciences ar made quiet: whoe that shal forsake these thinges, he leaueth himself no hope of eternall saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? It is a paynefull and a troublesome thyng for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to looke backe vpon Christ, vpon the Apostles, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the olde fathers: &amp; euer more to be attentife what their will and commaundement is. This I warrant you, is the very way to bring the people of God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the weake elementes of the world, from the leauenne of scribes &amp; Pharises, and from mans traditions. It behoved that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8195:47"/>
the ordenaunces of Christe and of his Apostles should be thruste out of place, that these might be accepted in theyr stede. O this was a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause, why that good olde doctrine whiche many ages had bene approued, should be abiected, and a new forme of Religion should be brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God. Neuerthelesse what so euer it is, these men crie still:
Nothyng must be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged: with these thinges mens mindes ar satisfied: these thinges ar decreed by the churche of Rome: that church can not erre: for Siluester Prierias saith,<q> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church of Rome is the squire &amp; rule of truth: from the whiche the holy scriptures receaue their authoritie. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, sayth he, of the Churche of Rome, is the vnfalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule of fayth, from the whiche the holy Scriptures fetcheth her strength.

Pighius also is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde to saye, that we ought not to beleue any texte of the scripture be it neuer so playne, vnlesse we haue our warrant from the Churche of Rome. Muche like as if any of these that can not speake good and pure Latine, and yet can bable somwhat after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Latine very roundly and redily, woulde needes maynteyne, that all other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also ought to speake such Latine now in these times, as many yeres past Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrect or Catholicon did speake, and suche as at this daye is vsed amongest themselues in their common scholes: for so both that whiche is spoken maye be well inough vnderstanded, and also mens mindes wel satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and that it were a mockery, now after so longe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Theodoricum de schismate.</hi>
               </note> we can not as yet surely perceiue: except perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, like as the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Romanes in time past dealt with Lady Victorie, so these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after that truth came fliyng vnto them, they pulled of her winges, that neuer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8195:48"/>
after she should be able to flie from them. But what if Ieremie say vnto them, accordyng as we sayde before, that these be the wordes of lies? What if the same man saye agayne, that euen they whiche ought to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured the vineyarde, haue wasted and destroyed the Uineyarde of the Lorde? What if Christ saye, that they whiche chyeflye ought to haue bene carefull ouer the Temple: of the Lordes temple haue made a denne of thieues? But in case the Church of Rome can not erre, then muste it needes be that the happynes thereof is greater then the wisedome of these menne. For suche is their lyfe, doctrine and diligence, that the Churche maye full well for all them not onely erre, but also pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe vtterly, and come to nothyng. Doubtles if that Churche maye erre whiche hath vtterly gone astraye from the worde of God, from the commaundementes of Christe, from the ordinances of the Apostles, from the examples of the primitiue Church, from the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the olde fathers and auncient Councels, and from the verye decrees of theyr owne makynge: and whiche will not be kepte in order with no lawes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther olde nor new, nother of theyr owne nor of others, nother of God nor of manne: then is it moste certaine, not onely that the Churche of Rome mighte erre, but also that moste lewdely and shamefully it hath erred.</p>
            <p>But you were ones, saye they, of our felowship, but now you ar become Apostatas &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>negates, &amp; haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated your selfs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. True it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue disseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our selfs from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and for that cause we bothe giue thankes to our moste mercyfull and mightie God, and also on oure owne behalfes we doe moste hyghlye
<pb facs="tcp:8195:49"/>
reioyce. But we haue not departed at all from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche, from the Apostles, nor from Christe.
<q>We can not denie but we were brought vp amongest them in darkenes and in the ignorance of God: euen as Moyses was in the discipline and in the bosome of the Aegyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. We were sayth Tertullian, of your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, and no marueile: for men ar made and not borne Christians.</q>
But let these men tell me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ar come downe from these seuen hils, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon afore time Rome did stande, and haue chosen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dwel vpon the playne whiche is called the fielde of Mars? They will say peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, bycause the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duytes of water that were in those hils, without the whiche they could not wel liue, ar now decayed &amp; dried vp. Then lette them giue vs that same leaue, touchyng the water of euerlastyng life, whiche they will haue to be graunted vnto them in this case of material water. Amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this water fayled longe a goe: the elders, as Hieremy sayeth, sent theyr you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelings to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waters, but they, when thei could finde nothing, brought home theyr empty vessels, beyng in great miserie and vtterly loste for thirste. The needy, sayeth Esay, and the poore sought after water, but they founde none in no place: theyr tongues were now euen dried for thyrst: these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had broken vp all their water courses and theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duytes: these had choked all theyr springes, and had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with myre and durte the fountayne of the water of life. And like as Caligula in time paste, by closing vp of all mens barnes, brought vpon the people a generall hunger and famine: so these men in chokyng vp of all the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taynes of Gods worde, haue brought the people into a miserable thyrste. They brought as Amos the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8195:49"/>
Prophete sayth, hunger and thirst vpon men, not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of bread, not a thirste of water, but of hearyng the worde of God. The poore wretches wandered vp and downe sekyng after some litle sparke of that light of God, wherwith they might chiere their consciences: but it was cleane quenched out: they coulde finde none at all: Suche was the very state, suche was the pyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition of the Church of God. Moste miserably men liued therein without the gospell, without lighte, without all comforte.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, although our departyng be somewhat greuous vnto them: yet ought they to consider howe iuste the cause of our departing is. For in case they wil saye: it is lawefull for thee by no means to departe from that fellowship, wherein thou haste ben brought vp: Thus they maye easily in oure personnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne both the Prophetes and the Apostles, and also Christe him self. For why doe they not likewise finde fawte at this: that Loth departed from Sodome, Abraham out of Calde, the Hebrewes out of Egypte, Christ from the Iewes, Paule from the Pharisees? For onlesse there maye be some iuste cause of suche departynges, we see not, why they also maye not in like sorte be accused as factious and seditious men.</p>
            <p>Nowe if we ought to be condemned for heretikes, bycause we doe not al thinges whiche these menne doe commaunde vs: whoe I praye you, or what maner of men shall we account them to be, which doe despise the commaundementes of Christe and of the Apostles? If we be Schismatikes that haue disseuered our selfs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these fellowes, by what name I pray you, shal we call them, that haue departed from the Grekes, at whose
<pb facs="tcp:8195:50"/>
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des they receyued the faith, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the primitiue church, from Christ him self, from the Apostels, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were from their owne parentes? For as for the Grekes, such as at this daye doe professe the religion and name of Christ, althoe they haue many thinges that ar corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet they retaine to this howre a great part of those thinges which they receyued of the Apostles. Therfore nother haue they priuate Masses, nor their sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes mangeled, nor purgatory, nor pardonnes: As for the Popes titles and proude names, so muche they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, that whosoeuer doth take them vpon him, and wil needes be called either the vniuersal Byshop or heade of the whole Church: of him they will not sticke to saye, that he is bothe an intolerable arrogant man, and a personne that iniuriously defaceth all other By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes his bretherne, and also an heretike.</p>
            <p>Now then, sins the matter is plaine &amp; can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these fellowes ar gone back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those, of whom thei receiued the gospel, of whom thei receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith, of whome the true religion &amp; the Churche: what cause is there, why they shuld not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to be called home againe, euen vnto the same personnes, as it were to the fountaines of religion? Wherfore ar they so afrayde, as thoe al the Apostles &amp; old fathers sawe nothing, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of their times? for doe they, trowe ye, see more, or be thei more careful ouer the Churche of God, then they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> first deliuered these things? And now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our selfs, we haue departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Churche, wherin nother the worde of God could be hearde pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught: nor the Sacramentes rightly administered: nor the name of God, as it ought to be, called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and whiche they themselues doe confesse to be corrupted in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8195:50"/>
many thinges: and wherin, to say the truth, there was nothing that could staye any man that was wise, and that had any consideration, of his owne saluation. To conclude, we haue departed from that Churche that is now founded, not from that Church that was in time past: and we haue departed in such sorte, as Daniel did out of the denne of Lions: as the thre childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the fier: yea rather caste out by them with their cursinges and banninges, then departed of our selfs.</p>
            <p>Agayne, we haue adioyned our selfes vnto that Church, wherin they them selfs, in case they wil speake truely and according to their owne consciences, can not denie, but all thynges ar soberly and reuerently hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and so farre forth as we were able to attayne, most neerely vnto the order of the olde time.<note place="margin">

               </note> For lette them compare their Churches and oures together, they shal see, bothe that they moste shamefully haue departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostels, and we moste iustly haue forsaken them. For we, after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Christe, of the Apostles and of the holy fathers, doe giue the whole sacrament vnto the people: These men, contrary to all the fathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to al the Apostels, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Christ him self, not without (as Gelasius sayth) hygh sacrilege, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the sacramentes, and plucke the one parte awaye from the people. We haue restored the Lordes supper accordyng to the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, and desire to haue it asmuch as maye be, and to as many as may be, most common, and as it is called, so to be in very deede, a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. These men haue chaunged all thinges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the institution of Christ: &amp; of the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion they haue made a priuate masse: so that we present vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a holy Supper: they, a vayne pagent to gase vpon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8195:51"/>We doe affirme with the moste auncient Fathers, that the bodye of Christe is eaten of none other, but of godly and of faithfull menne, and suche as ar endued with the spirite of Christe: these fellowes doe teache that the very bodye of Christe, maye in very deede, and as they terme it, really and substantially be eaten, not only of wicked and vnfaythfull men, but also, it is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to speake it, of myse and dogges.</p>
            <p>We doe praye in oure Churches after suche sorte, that, accordyng as Paule dothe admonishe vs, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may know what we doe pray,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> and with one minde answere, Amen. These men powre out in the churches vnknowne and straunge wordes, like vnto the noyse of soundyng brasse, without any vnderstanding, without sense, without iudgement, and this is their only ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that the people should not be able to vnderstande any thing at all.</p>
            <p>And bycause we will not reherse all the differences betwene vs and them, for they ar in maner infinite: We translate the Scriptures into all languages: these men wil scantly suffer them to be abroade in any tonge: We doe exhorte the people to heare and reade the worde of God: these menne driue them from it: We woulde haue our cause hearde before all the worlde: these menne flee al iudgement and triall: We leane vnto knowlege, they vnto ignorance: We truste to the light, they vnto dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: We haue in reuerence, as reason is, the wordes of the Apostles and of the Prophetes: these men do burne them. To conclude, we in Gods cause wil stande to the iudgement of God only: these men will stande to their owne. But if they will consider all these thinges with a quiet minde and a prepared purpose to heare and to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8195:51"/>
learne: thei shal not only allow our doyngs, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all errours, haue folowed Christe &amp; his Apostles, but also they themselues shal fal away from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and of their owne accorde, encline themselues to ioyne with our felowshippe.</p>
            <p>But they will saye,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of general Councels.</hi>
               </note> that it was an vnlawefull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to goe aboute such matters without an holy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Counsell: for therein is the whole powre of the Churche: there Christe hathe promised that he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ready at hand. And yet they themselues haue broken the commaundementes of God &amp; the decrees of the Apostles, and as we sayde a litle before, haue scate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and torne in pieces in maner all, not onlye the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but also the certaine principles concernyng doctrine of the primitiue Church, and that without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riyng for any generall Councell.</p>
            <p>But where as they say, that it is not lawful for any man to appoint any new order without a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel: who I praye you hath prescribed these lawes vnto vs? or where haue they founde this decree?</p>
            <p>It was folishly done of Agesilaus the kynge, who beyng ones acertained of the minde and pleasure of the hyghe Iupiter, woulde needes present the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agayne vnto Apollo, for to know whether he were of the same minde that his Father was. But we should doe more foolyshlye a greate deale, in case that, when we doe heare God him selfe speakynge moste playnely vnto vs in the holye Scriptures, and vnderstande his will and pleasure, if I saye, afterwardes, as though al this were nothing, we would refarre the whole matter to a councell. The whiche is nothing els, but to searche whether menne be of the same minde that God is: and
<pb facs="tcp:8195:52"/>
whether menne will allow by their authoritie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God. What I praye you, shall not the truthe be truthe, or shall not God be God, except a councell will and commaunde it so to be? If Christe would haue handeled the matter so fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginnyng, that he woulde haue taught or sayde nothing without the consente of the Bysshoppes, and woulde haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ouer hys whole doctrine vnto Annas and Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, where should the fayth of Christ be at this day? or who shoulde euer haue hearde of the gospell? Peter forsothe, of whome the Pope is wonte to speake more often and with more reuerence then of Iesus Christe, did boldely withstande the sacred councell: and sayde, it was better to obeye God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.</note> then men. And Paule, what time he had ones receyued the gospell into his minde, and that not of men, nor by man, but only by the wil of God, did not counsell with flesh and bloud, nor dyd not referre the matter vnto his kinsemen or brothern: but went by and by into Arabia, for to publishe, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of God, Gods misteries.</p>
            <p>We surely doe not despyse Councels or assemblies and conferences of Bysshoppes and learned menne: Nother haue we done those thinges that be done alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without Bysshoppes or without a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell. The matter was handeled in full parlament, with long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and in a greate assemblie. But as touchyng this councell, whiche Pope Pius dothe at thys tyme counterfetly set forthe, wherein men beyng nother cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor hearde, nor seene, ar so lightly condemned, what we maye loke or hope to gette thereby, it is not harde to gesse.</p>
            <p>Nazianzenus longe agoe, when that in his tyme
<pb facs="tcp:8195:52"/>
he sawe menne that came to suche assemblies, to bee so blinde and so obstinate, that they were caryed after their owne affections, and foughte rather for victorie then for truthe: pronounced in playne wordes, that he neuer sawe good ende of anye councell. What woulde he saye nowe, if he were a liue at this daye, and shoulde vnderstande what these menne wente aboute? For in that tyme all though they were gyuen to partes, yet bothe mennes causes were hearde, and manifeste er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours by the common consente of all partes were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaye. These menne agayne neyther will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the cause to bee freelye debated: nother will endure to haue anye thyng chaunged, howe many errours so euer there be.</p>
            <p>For that is a thyng whiche they ar wonte often and with out all shame to boaste of, that their Churche can not erre: that in hit there is no blemyshe: that there is nothyng to be graunted vnto vs: or yf there be anye thyng, that the iudgement thereof appertayneth vnto Bysshoppes and Abbots: they be the directers of those matters, they be the Churche of God. Aristotel saythe, that bastardes can not make a citie. But whether the Churche of God maye be made of these fellowes or no, let them consider: for surely, nother be they lawfull Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots nor right Bysshoppes.</p>
            <p>But let them hardely be the Churche: lette them be hearde in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels: let them only haue authoritie to giue a voyce: Neuerthelesse in times paste, when the Church of God (if it be compared with their Churche) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably wel gouerned, as Cipryan sayth, bothe Elders and Deacons &amp; some parte also of the common people
<pb facs="tcp:8195:53"/>
were called to the hearyng of Ecclesiasticall causes.</p>
            <p>But what if these Abbotes and Bysshoppes haue no knowledge? What yf they vnderstande not what religion is, and what opinion they oughte to haue of God? What if law be loste of the preeste, &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel of the Elders? What if the night, as Micheas saythe, be vnto them in stede of a vision, and darkenes in stede of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seyng thynges to come? What if all the watchemen of the Citie, as Esaye sayth, ar become blinde? What if the salte hath loste his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and his taste? and as Christ sayth, is good for nothyng, not so muche as to be caste out vpon the dunge hill?</p>
            <p>Forsothe they will committe all thynges to the Pope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Pope is aboue the Councell.</hi>
               </note> whoe can not erre. But that, to beginne withal, is a folishe deuise: that the holy ghost should flie away in haste from the holy Councell to Rome, to the intent that if he doubte or sticke in anye thyng, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to winde him selfe out, he mighte take counsell of some other spyrite I wote not who, better learned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him self: For if the case stande so, what needed it that so many Byshops should in this time at so great charges and through so long iorneys be summoned to come to Trent? It were yet a much more wiser &amp; better way, sure I am it were bothe shorter and more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for them, rather to put of all thynges to the Pope: and to repayre at the firste dasshe, to the heauenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of hys sacred breaste. Moreouer it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste equitie, to put ouer oure cause from so manye Bysshoppes and Abbottes to the iudgemente of one man, speciallye of hym, whoe standeth accused by vs of moste weyghtye and greuous offences: and as yet hath not brought in his answer: who also hath conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned vs

without iudgement before wee were once called to bee iudged. What? trow ye that these be things of our own deuise? Or is not this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of their Councels at this day?

What Scripture hath at any time forbidden Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearing of such causes? Whoe did euer make these lawes but these fellowes onely?

which Christ himselfe that can not erre, so long before did prophecy, that it shoulde erre: and which wee our selues did euidently see before our eyes, swarue awaye from the holy Fathers, from the Apostles, from Christ himselfe, from the Primitiue and Catholike Church.

<q>I haue, saythe he, deliuered vnto you that, whiche I receyued of the Lord. And Christ for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute

the error of the Pharisees: You must retorne, saith he, to the beginning: from the beginning it was not so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to the intent he might the better rebuke the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gayne and couetousnesse of preestes, and purge the temple: Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, sayth he, this was a house of prayer, where al the people together should deuoutly and soberly cal vpon God: and so ought you also to vse it at this day: for it was not buylded to that intent, for to become a denne of theeues.</p>
            <p>So likewise all the godly Princes, and such as were commended in the holye Scriptures, were therefore chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, bicause thei had walked in the wayes of Dauid their father: that is to saye, bicause they had resorted back to the first principles, &amp; to the wel heades, and restored religion to his first estate.</p>

            <p>And wheras our desire was, that the lordes Temple should be restored to his first estate: we went not about to seke any other foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then that which we knew was layde now long agoe by the Apostles: the whiche is our sauiour Iesus Christ.</p>

the olde and primitiue Churche: agayne whereas the hope of a generall councell was verye vncertaine, and muche more vncertaine the successe thereof: but chiefly whereas we were certayne of Gods will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it a verye vnlawefull thynge to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much carefull and troubled aboute the iudgementes of menne: we could no longer stande in deliberation with fleshe and bloud: but rather we dyd that thyng, whiche bothe mighte well be done, and whiche had bene ofte times done of many godly menne and catholike Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes: takyng in hande to prouide for our Churches by a prouinciall Councell. For thus we knowe right well the olde Fathers were wonte to make a profe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dyd come to councels assembled out of the whole worlde. There be abrode at this daye Canones wryten in particuler counsels, at Carthage vnder Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, at Ancyra, at Neocesaria, at Grangra, also in Paphlagonia, as some men thinke, before the name of the vniuersall councell of Nice was euer hearde of. After this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner in time past, the Pelagians and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes, without a generall councell, were by and by mette with all at home in a pryuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sultation. Thus Ambrose a Christian Byshop, what time Constantius themperour dyd euidently fauor Auxentius a Byshop of the Arrians faction, appealed not vnto the generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, wherin he saw, by reso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of themperours power, &amp; of affection vnto partes, nothyng could be done, but vnto his own clergie &amp; people: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, vnto a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall assemblie. Thus in the councell of Nice it was decreed, that euery yeare twise: in the councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yerly ones at the least, there should be in euery
<pb facs="tcp:8195:63"/>
prouince assemblies of Byshoppes: the whiche thynge, the councell of Chalcedone saythe was done for this cause: that, if any errors or abuses should crepe out in any place, they might by and by, euen in the very place where thei sprange vp, be destroyed.
So that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus and Palladius refused the councel of Aquileia, bycause it was not a generall and a common councell, Ambrose the Byshop of Millane answered: <q>It ought not to seme new or strange to any man, if the Byshops of the weste called councels amongest them selues, and made prouinciall assemblies: for that hath bene done both of the Westerne Byshoppes not a fewe times, and of the Grekes very oft.</q>
Thus had Charles the great a prouinciall councell in Germany, touchyng the taking away of images, agaynst the seconde councell of Nice. Neyther is this way of proceding vtterly vnhearde of, or newe amongest vs. For we haue had in times paste here in Englande prouinciall assemblies, and with our own lawes we haue ordered our Churches.

men and also Byshoppes: how might it appere to any sobre manne, that suche a councell were generall? Or when so many partes of the world ar absent, how can they saye truely, that they haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the whole worlde? or what maner of councell was this laste hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Trente? or how might it be called general, when that out of all Christian kingdomes and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries there came vnto it but forty Bysshoppes, and of them some that were so eloquent, that they seemed more mete to be sent to the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer schole: but so well learned, that they neuer redde ouer the holy Scriptures? Howe so euer it is, the truthe of the gospell of Iesus Christe, dothe not depende upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> councels, or as Paule sayth, vpon the daye of man.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their dutie, and harden their hartes agaynste God and his anoynted Christe, and continew still in peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng the streyght wayes of the Lorde: God will rayse vp the very stones, and make litel babes eloquent, that alwaies there may be some, by whome the lies of these men maye be confuted. For God is able not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out councels, but also maugre the councels, both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende and to encrease his kyngdome.
<q>There be, saythe Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many deuises in mans hart, but the councel of the Lorde abideth stable: for there is no knowlege, there is no wisedome, there is no councell agaynste the Lorde. Thinges, sayth Hilary, that ar buylded vp by mannes worke, doe not endure. The Churche of God muste be otherwise buylded, and otherwise conserued. For it is grounded vpon the foundation of the Apostls and Prophetes, and ioynted together with one corner stone Iesus Christ. But S. Hierome of all other spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

Except paraduenture they will say this: that Peter whiles he was at Rome neuer taught the Gospell: neuer fedde his flocke, that he toke away the keys of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hid the treasures of his Lord: only that he satt him down in Laterane, and with his fynger did sett an order for all the roumes in purgatory, and for al kindes of punishment: as for the poore vnhappy soules, some he assigned vnto punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some againe for money he toke out by and by at his pleasure: also that he toke order for priuate masses, that they should be said in euery corner.

For these thinges be done by the Popes at this daye in Rome, and be so done, as though nothing else ought to be done. Or excepte paraduenture they had rather aunswere thus: that the Pope at this daye doth all those thinges, which we knowe Peter did in time paste: that he trauaileth heare and there in to all Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries: preaching the Gospell not only in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> assemblies, but also priually from howse to howse: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he plieth his businesse in season, oute of season: in time, out of time: that he doth the duty of an Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist: accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisheth the ministery of Christ: becommeth a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ouer the howse of Israell: receiueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures and worde of God, and as he hath receiued them, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth them againe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people: that he is the salt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth: the light of the world: that he fedeth not himselfe, but hys flocke: that he dothe not entangle hymselfe with worldly buisines appertaining to this life, nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpeth no dominion ouer the Lords people: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he seketh not to be serued himself of others, but rather himself to serue others: that he accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth all Bysshops for his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and equalles: that he is a subiect vnto Princes, as vnto those that are sent of God: giueth vnto Cesar that which appertaineth to Cesar: and that according, as the auncient Byshops of Rome did, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he calleth the Emperour his Lorde: Now onles the Popes doe these thinges at this day: and except Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

doe those thinges which we spake of before, there is no cause why they should bragge so much of the name of Peter, and of this succession: and lesse a great deale why they should complaine of our departing, &amp; cal vs home againe vnto their faith and felowship. It is said, that a certaine Lacedemonian called Cobilo, what time he was sent Embassadour to make a league with the Kinge of Persia, and founde by chaunce certaine courtyers playing at the dise: by and by, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration of his busines, retourned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and when he was asked, wherfore he had so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarde to the doing of those things, which he had in commission by common aucthoritie for to doe, he answered: that he thought it shoulde haue tourned to the slaunder of the common welth, if he should haue made a league w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diseplaiers. But if we should dispose our selues to retourn againe vnto the Pope and to his errors, and make a league not onli with diseplaiers, but also with men of much lewder condition then disers: this shoulde be not onely slaunderous towardes our good name, but also towardes the procuring of gods wrathe against vs, and the oppressyon and vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming of our owne consciences, full of presente myschyefe. For wee surelye departed from hym, whom we sawe had blynded the worlde nowe manye yeares together: from hym that was wonte ouer arrogantelye to auaunte hymselfe that hee coulde not erre: and what soeuer he dyd, that hee myght not be iudged of any mortall man: not of kinges, not of Emperours, not of the whole clergye, not of all the worlde together, no not if he shoulde carye with hym

a thousande soules to Hell, from him that toke vpon him to commaunde not only men, but also the Angels of God, to goe, to come, to leade soules into purgatory, &amp; to bring them back againe when it liked him, whom Gregory did most plainly affirme to be the Uaunteur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and standerdberer of Antichrist, and that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the catholike Faith: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom not long agoe, those countrie men of oures, that be the ringleders of such as bende themself against the Gospell and against the knowne truth, did of their owne choyse and gladly, euery one of them disseuer themself: neither yet would they be vnwilling to doe it at this day, were it not that that the blemishe of inconstancye and shame and their estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongst the people did let them. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, we haue forsaken him, to whom we were not bounde, and who had nothing, except it were onely a certaine fonde ymagination of preeminence of the place and succession, that he coulde saye for hymselfe. And yet we of all other nations had most iust cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from him, for our Kinges, euen those also which most carefully inclined themselfe to obey the Authorite and faith of the Bishops of Rome, haue felt sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly now long agoe the yoke &amp; tiranny of the Popes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For both from our king Henry the second of that name, the Romaine Bysshops did plucke the Crowne from his heade, commaunding him, all his Maiestye laide a parte, and in a priuate arraye, to the intent he shoulde be a laughinge stocke to all hys people, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe as an humble petitioner and suter before his legate: And also against oure king Ihon, armed the Byshops and Monks, and some parte also of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and discharged all his subiects of the othe of their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8195:67"/>
allegeance, wherby thei were bound vnto him, and last of all, moste wyckedly they spoyled hym by trayterous meanes, not onely of his kingdome, but also of his lyfe. And vpon king Henry the eight of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name a most noble Prince, thei thundered out their curses and lightnings of excommunication, and stirred vp against him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Emperoure, somtimes the Frenche king: &amp; so much as was in them, gaue ouer the whole Realme to the praie and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spoyle: doubtles very madde and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished men, that could beleue that either so great a kyng might be made a gaste with bugges and with clyckets: or that so mighty a kingdome might be so easily deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it were at one morsell. And as thoughe all these thinges had not been ynoughe: they woulde haue had the whole Realme, also to be tributary vnto them: and out of it moste vniustly they did exacte an yerely rent. So costlye forsooth was the frendship of the Citie of Rome vnto vs. But in as much as by crafty meanes and with lewde sleightes thei wrested out these things from vs: there is no cause why the same againe by lawefull meanes and good lawes might not be taken from them. Yea if our kings in those times of darknes, ledd by some opinion of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet holines, of their owne accorde and liberalitie, gaue them those thinges for Religion sake: yet afterwardes when the errour is espied of other kinges that haue the same aucthoritie, they may be taken away, for that gift is of none effect that is not approued by the will of the gyuer: but that can not seeme to be a will, which is darkened and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peched with errour.</p>

to his former estate, and as it were newe borne againe, be slaulderously and shamefully spoken of. For the same thing happened vnto Christ himselfe and to the Apostles. Neuertheles, least thou shouldest suffer thy selfe to be ledde out of the waye, and to be deceiued with these outraging clamors of our aduersaries, wee haue sett forth before the, the whole course of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: what wee dooe beleue of God the Father, what of his onely sonne Iesus Christe, what of the holye Ghoste, what of the Church, what of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, what of the Ministery, what of the holy Scriptures, what of Ceremonyes, and what of euery parte of a Christian mans profession. We haue declared, how that we doe detest al olde Heresies, the which other the holy Scriptures or the auncient Councels haue condemned as pestilences and poysons of mens soules, and that as much as we can possiblie, we doe call home againe the discipline of the Church, the which our aduersaries haue vtterly brought to nothing: and doe punishe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the auncient lawes of our forefathers, all losenes of lyfe and licencious manners: and that with such seueritie, as the cause doth require, and so farre as our power will stretche: that we doe vpholde the state of kingedomes, in the same condition that we founde them, without empairing or chaunging any thing: and doe maintaine to the best of our power the Maiesty of our Princes safe and sounde: that wee haue forsaken y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church which these men had made a den of theeues, and wherein they had left nothing sounde or sauering of the Church of God, and which by their owne testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony had erred in many thinges: none otherwise then as Loth in time past we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of Sodoma, or Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Wherfore good Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reader, in as much as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> seest the reasons &amp; causes both of our doings touching the restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst vs, &amp; also of our departing from the fellowship of these men, thou oughtest not
<pb facs="tcp:8195:69"/>
to maruaile if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had rather obey our Iesus Christ then men. Paule dyd admonishe vs, that we shoulde not suffer, our selues to be caried out of the way with these variable doctrines: and thal specially wee should flye from them that woulde sowe any dissension from that doctrine which wee had receiued from Chryste, and from the Apostles. Their iuggeling toyes, euen as the owle at the rysing of the Sunne, beginne alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall and flye away at the presence and light of the Gospell: And although they were pyled and heaped vp, euen to the highe skyes: yet they fall downe againe vpon the least occasion and in manner of their owne accorde. For thou oughtest not to imagine that al these things are happened at a blind auenture or by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for it was goddes will that maugre the malice in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all men, the Gospell of Iesus Christ shoulde be spredde in these dayes throughout the worlde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, beyng admonysshed by gods worde, haue of their owne accorde applyed themselues to the doctrine of Christe. Wee surely haue not sought to wynne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selues either glory, either riches, either pleasure, eyther ease thereby. For all these thinges our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries haue in great aboundance, and we also, what time we were amongest them, had such thinges more largely and more plentifully. Neither doe we abhorre from peace &amp; agrement: but for conseruation of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace, we will wage no warres w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God.
<q>Doubtles, saith Hylarius, the name of peace is sweete: but peace saith he, is one thing, and thraldome is an other.</q>
For to assent, which is the thyng that these men doe seeke for, that Chryste shoulde bee commaunded to sylence, that the truthe of the Gospell shoulde bee betrayed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8195:69"/>
that wicked errours, should be dissembled, that the eyes of Christian menne shoulde be blered, that men should manifestly conspire agaynst God, is not an establysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace, but a moste horrible couenant of thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<q>There is saythe Nazianzene a certayne kinde of peace, vnprofitable: ther is a profitable discorde. For we muste allowe peace with an exception, so farre as it is laweful, and so farre as we may.</q>
For otherwise Christ himself brought not peace into the world, but a sword. Wherefore yt the Pope will haue vs to be friendes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne with him, lette him firste reconcile himselfe with God.
<q>For hereof saythe Cyprian, scismes doe aryse, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the head is not sought for, and menne retorne not home to the fountaynes of the holy Scriptures, and the commaundementes of the heauenly doctor ar not kept. For that sayth he, is not peace, but warre: nother is he that is disseuered from the gospell, ioyned to the Churche, but these menne doe only set to sale the name of peace to their owne gayne: for that peace which thei so muche require, is nothyng but the ease and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of idle beallies.</q>
For all these matters might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well ynough amongest vs, if ambition, bellychere and licencious liuyng were no hinderance therto. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence cometh all the sorowe: their minde is vpon their platters. This is hit they crie and make all this buysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for, that thinges euill gotten, they might more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and lewdly maintaine. Al Pardoners, Dataries, Collectors, Bawdes and others that thynke gayne, to be godlines, and serue not Iesus Christ but theyr own bellies, doe greuously complayne of vs at this day: For in time paste this kinde of men had good dayes in the olde worlde. But nowe what so euer increase cometh
<pb facs="tcp:8195:70"/>
vnto Christe, that thinke they turneth them to losse. This is hit, whereon the Pope himself complaineth at this daye, that charitie forsoth is waxen could, bycause his rentes ar lesse nowe then they were wonte to be. Thus he bringeth vs into hatered al that he maye, and rayleth vpon vs and condemneth vs for heretikes: to the intent that they whiche vnderstande not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, should thinke there were no worse men vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. Yet we for all this nother ar, nor ought to be ashamed of the gospell. For we regarde more the glory of God, then the estimation of menne. We knowe that all these thinges which we doe teache, ar trewe, neyther can we either vse violence agaynst the knowlege of our owne conscience, nother yet present our selfs as witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst God. For if we denie any parte of the gospel of Iesus Christe before menne, he on the other side, will denie vs agayne before his father. Now if there be any that will be offended and maye not endure the doctrine of Christe, they be blinde themself, and leaders of suche as ar blinde: Neuerthelesse the truthe must be preached and set forthe by our open profession of the same, and patiently we muste loke for the Iudgement of God to come. In the meane while let these menne take heede what they doe, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue some regarde of their owne saluation, and let them ceasse to hate and to persequute the gospell of the sonne of God, leaste at the length they finde him to be the punisher and reuenger of his owne cause. God will not suffer himselfe to be mocked. Men doe see all ready how the matter goeth. This flame the more it is kepte vnder, so muche the more and more it breaketh out and flyeth abrode. Their vnfaythfulnesse shall not deface the fayth of God: but if they dispose not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8195:70"/>
themselfe to laye awaye this hardnesse of their hartes and to receyue the gospell, the Publicanes and sinners shall goe before them into the kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>God and the father of our Lord Iesus Christ open all their eyes, that they maye see that same blessed hope whereunto they ar called: that we maye all together in one, worshippe that same onely and true God, and that same Iesus Christ, whome he sente downe to vs from Heauen. To whome together with the Father and the holy Ghost, be giuen all honor and glory for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
