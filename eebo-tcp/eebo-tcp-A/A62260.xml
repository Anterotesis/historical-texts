            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Squadron under <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaert</hi> being the Van of their Fleet, attacked the <hi>French,</hi> which made the Rear of ours, they both separated themselves from both their Fleets, and so continued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged out of our sight almost the whole day, Sailing to the Southward: At first <hi>Bankaert</hi> came briskly down upon Monsieur d'<hi>Estrees,</hi> but afterwards finding it too hot, kept at a greater distance.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> with the <hi>Blew</hi> Squadron in the Van of our Fleet, was attacked by <hi>Van Ghent,</hi> in the Rear of theirs, and endeavoring to get the Wind of the Enemy, found so great opposition, that after having sunk a Man of War which laid him on Board, having above half his men killed, his Ship wholly disabled, and having put off two Fireships, was no longer in a condition to put off the third, which burnt her; the onely Ship we lost the whole day: His Lordship, and all the Officers, except Capt. <hi>Haddock,</hi> being lost with her; of which some few ordinary Men that were saved by Swimming to our Ships and Boats, give us no farther Account.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Henry,</hi> that was one of her Seconds, commanded by Capt. <hi>Digby,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> having put off several Fireships; most of her Men, her Captain, and almost all her Inferior Officers slain, fell into the

               <p>The Body of their Fleet commanded by Monsieur <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> attacked the Body of ours, commanded by His Royal Highness; <hi>De Ruyter</hi> was accompanied by <hi>Van Esse,</hi> another Admirall, and their Seconds, which all at a convenient distance fired upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> who being to Windward of her own Division, could receive little or no assistance from them; the Capt. Sir <hi>John Cox</hi> killed, the Main-Top-Mast, Flagstaff, and Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, being shot down, and the Ship intirely disabled in three hours time, His Royal Highness thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to change his Ship; so that about Ten a Clock being attended by Monsieur <hi>Blanckfort,</hi> my self, Mr. <hi>Ashton,</hi> Monsieur <hi>du Puys,</hi> and <hi>John Thompson</hi> his best Pilot, he went on Board the St. <hi>Michael,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> Commander, and there put up a new Standard, which because of the great smoak, could not be seen well enough to be attended by his Division. About this time, the Royal <hi>Katherine</hi> newly come from the River with fresh Men, and wanting many of the Conveniencies necessary for her defence, was boarded and taken by the Enemy, her Capt. Sir <hi>John Chichely</hi> being carried prisoner on Board their Ships; but the Enemy leaving no great number of Men in her, they were afterwards overpowred by ours, who carried the <hi>Dutch</hi> that had taken her, prisoners, and the Ship safe into Harbor.

Capt. <hi>Berry</hi> in the <hi>Resolution,</hi> and Sir <hi>Fretchevile Holles</hi> in the <hi>Cambridge,</hi> came also on Head of us, but were both very soon disabled, the latter having also lost her Commander; the Earl of <hi>Ossory</hi> in the <hi>Victory</hi> took their places; the Engagement being very hot all this time. Towards Five in the Evening His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness observing his Ship to Sail heavily, the <hi>London,</hi> and many of the Vice-Admirals Division having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the St. <hi>Michael,</hi> found upon enquiry that she had six foot Water in the Hold; so that with the same Company he brought thither, except his Pilot, who was killed there, he carried his Standard on Board the <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Spragg</hi> Commander; where after fighting an hour or two with the Ships to Windward, they were forced to bear down, and gave opportunity to the Duke and Sir <hi>Joseph Jordan</hi> to joyn; at which time <hi>de Ruyter</hi> put out a Signal, upon which all his Fleet bore down to joyn the <hi>Zealanders,</hi> who with others had engaged the <hi>French</hi> all day; who being to Leeward, did as well as it was possible for them to do with the distance, the <hi>Dutch</hi> being to Windward, kept from them. Thus ended the Battle, and the Day; The Duke with about Thirty Sail kept to Windward of the <hi>Dutch</hi> all night, standing to the S. E. and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self still so the next morning, and so continued till about Six a Clock; when seeing some Ships a Stern, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supposition, they were the Remainders of our Fleet, His Royal Highness tacked and stood with them, and found them to be as he guest, and the whole <hi>French</hi> Squadron with them; about Seven he returned to his own Ship, as well refitted as was possible by the care of Captain <hi>Narbrough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Ten the whole Fleet were together, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve we saw the <hi>Dutch</hi> standing after us, upon which we Tacked, having the Weather-Gage, and stood to them, in hopes of Engaging them presently:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60831:4"/>
But, when the Van of our Fleet was come up to the Body of theirs, they Tacked, and stood back towards their own Coasts; Notwithstanding which we had certainly engaged them, had we not been prevented about Three a Clock by a sudden Fogg, which last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till Six; and though it then cleared up, it blew so fresh, and was so late, and so near their Bancks, that we did not think it safe to Attacke them, but continued Sailing by them almost within Canon shot till Nine at Night; when, being within a League of the <hi>Oyster-Banck,</hi> off the Coast of <hi>Zealand,</hi> we Tacked, and stood till Three in the Morning to the North-west, at which time we stood back till Six, to see if we could perceive the Enemy, which not discovering, we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored till the Afternoon, that we got under Saile, and stood back to our own Coast, being very stormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As for our Losses, Besides the <hi>Royal Iames,</hi> there is not one Ship lost, though several Commanders slain; The Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> Mr. <hi>Digby</hi> Captain of the <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Sir <hi>Fretcheville Holles</hi> Captain of the <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Sir <hi>Io.
