            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thinking them such rare thinges, as was worthy to be regestred. Marry I must confesse, I haue selected and pycked a great sorte out of Latine Wryters, the Authors or Wryters whereof, I haue named most commonly at the ende of the same. And some notable and precious thinges I gathered out of some olde Englishe wrytten bookes, and some also not long since prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vnworthy to be hyd, and great pittie but they should bee knowne: which purposesly I haue placed herein, whereby I thinke verelye, manye will reade them, heare them and haue profit by them, that otherwise should neuer haue known
<pb facs="tcp:5181:3"/>
them. For manye (I suppose) will buye this Booke for thinges whereto they are affectioned, that neuer coulde or would haue bought, or looked on the bookes, wherein all they are. So that by this meanes, they are like to winne against theyr willes. Perhappes you will meruell, that I haue not placed them in better order, and that thinges of like matter are not ioygned together. Truely there are so many of so diuerse and sundry sortes and contrary effectes, that it could not be altogether obserued. And in my iudgement through the straungenesse and varietie of matter, it will be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirously and delightfully read: knowing we are made of such a moulde, that delicate Daintinesse delightes vs much: but we loathe to bee fed too long with one foode: And that long wandring in straunge, peasant and contrary places, will lesse wery vs, then short trauell in often troden ground.</p>
            <p>This worke might haue béene framed with finer Phrases (more dilectable to some, though not so meete for many) but that it is better to profit a great sorte, then to feede the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a few, well assured, that the learned and eloquent can better perceiue plaine speeches: then the slenderlye lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and common sorte can vnderstand eloquent Discourses. Therfore as I haue written it to all indifferently, so wish I to manifest the meaning thereof accordingly: especially of such as are to be conceaued. Not ignorant, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uierse and sundry Astrologicall Aphorismes, and some other practises besides in this booke, that many both wise, learned and eloquent, cannot attaine to the vnderstanding thereof, (much lesse the common sort:) the meaning wherof I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the learned therin. But because the Planeticall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and effect in theyr howres, (whereof I haue noted some maruelous matters in this woork) should not be hidde or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, I hope shortly there will be set forth such a Rule or Platforme, that they may be thought simple witted, or slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly learned, that therby cannot finde out and know quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what howre or time any planet dooth raigne or beare rule,
<pb facs="tcp:5181:3"/>
and at what instant the same begins, and how long the force therof dooth last: which once knowne, the thinges that I haue written herein concerning the same (well marked and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) will not onely auoyde much mischiefe and harme: but also will procure great pleasure and profit. Untyll the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing whereof, I referre you to a little Booke, intituled or called, A briefe Treatise concerning many proper Tables &amp;c. Wherein is the Computacion of yeeres with the raignes of the Kinges of England: in which litle Booke, is a briefe and exact Table and Rule, wherby any may finde iustly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when and how long any Planet dooth raigne, especiallye such as be of good capacitie and haue pregnant wittes. As for the duller sorte, I thinke it is too briefe and too busie.</p>
            <p>I haue deuided this into ten bookes, euery one wherof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a hundreth of the intituled Notable thinges: which are in all a thousand. Wishing that they may be accepted as thankfully &amp; willingly, as I haue bestowed them friendly and freely.

They do bring (saith he) from the newe Spaine, two Stones of great vertue, the one is called the Stone of the bloud, and the other is a Stone for the disease of the Stone in the kydneys &amp; raynes. The bloud Stone is a kind of a Iasper of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cullours, somewhat darke, full of sprinckles lyke to bloud, being of cullour red: of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which Stones the Indyans do make certayne Hartes, both great and small. The vse therof, both here and there, is for all fluxe of bloud, of what parts so euer it be, of the Nose, or of the Menstrues, or of the Pyles, and of wounds, or of that which is cast out of the mouth. The Stone must be wette in colde water, and the sycke man must take it in his ryght hand, and from tyme to tyme wet it in cold water. In this sort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Indyans do vse them. And as touching the Indyans, they haue it for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that touching the same Stone in some parte where the bloud runneth, that it doth restrayne: and in this they haue great trust, for that the effect hath bene seene. It doth profyte also, hauing it holden, hanged or tyed in the same parte, where the bloud runneth, so that it touch on the fleshe. Of this Stone we haue seene great effectes, in staunching of bloud. And some that do suffer the Hemeroidall fluxe, haue remedyed them selues with making Rynges of this Stone, and wearing them continually on theyr fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and also in Menstruall fluxe of Women.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:5181:143"/>The other Stone which is for the disease of the Stone in the kydneys or raynes, the fynest of them are lyke vnto <hi>Plasina</hi> of <hi>Esmeraldes,</hi> which is lykened to greene, with a mylkishe cullour, the greatest is the best, they bring them made in dyuers fourmes and fashions: for so the Indyans had them in olde tyme, some lyke to Fyshes, other lyke to heads of Byrdes, other lyke to bylles of Popageys, other lyke to round Beade stones: but all pierced through, for that the Indyans dyd vse to weare them hanging, for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the griefe of the stone or stomacke: for in these two sycknesses it doth maruelous effects.</p>
            <p>The chiefe vertue that it hath, is in the paine of the stone in the kydneys and raynes, and in expellyng of sande and stone. Insomuch that a Gentleman which had one of them here, the best of them that I haue seene, hauing put it to his arme, it doth make him to expell and cast out much sande, that many tymes he doth take it away: for that he thynketh that it doth hurte him for to put out so much, and in taking it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, he ceaseth to cast any from him. When he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the payne of the Stone, and puttyng it too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it dooth take awaye incontinent, with expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of much Sande and small Stones. I haue seene it carryed to personnes, that haue bene grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with great griefe and paynes of the sayd disease, and puttyng it to them, they doo forthwith expell the Sande and the lytle Stones: and remayne cleare thereof. The Stone hath a propertye hydden, by the which meanes, he dooth great effectes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that they fall not into the payne of the sayde diseases.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:5181:144"/>And after it is come, it taketh it away, or diminisheth it. It doth make the sande to be expelled with great abundaunce, and lykewise stones. It taketh away the heate from the raynes of the backe: it profyteth in griefes of the stomacke, put to it, and aboue all it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth from the sayde griefe. My Lady the Dutches (a Dutches in Spaine) for that she had in short time, three tymes, exceeding paynes of the stone, she made a bracelet of them, &amp; she vsed to weare it at her arme, and sythence she put them to her arme, she neuer had more paynes of the stone. And so it hath happened to many other that had the lyke benefyte, for the which they are much esteemed, &amp; nowe they be not so soone had as at the beginning: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these Stones only the Gentlemen &amp; Ritch men haue them.

Know that it is most hotte, and is of such penetration and heate, that if you put one drop therof in your hand, by and by it penetrates the hand without any hurt.
