         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

matter he adds) <hi>in order to the perfecting the Purchase of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> Which word, <hi>purchase,</hi> he thus explains, in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural and Nonsensical stile, viz. <hi>That God man purchased and compleated Reconciliation, Justification, &amp;c. with God, at once, without us</hi> (which is as good sense, as to say, God <hi>Purchas'd</hi> them of God) and for Proof thereof, he very many times over repeats that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10 <hi>If when we were Enemies, we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, by the death of his Son</hi> (not so much minding the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words) <hi>much more being reconciled, we shall be sav'd by his Life</hi>: And verse 11. <hi>We have now received the Attonement, &amp;c.</hi> This he hath made a Cloak for his justification of men, even while no good is wrought in them (one while saying, they are reconcil'd to God; another while, God to them) Now though plenteous Redemption, Salvation, and Peace were in being in Christ for us, while Enemies; and that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Love towards us, in that while we were Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Christ died for us, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. which doth explain the intent of the words [<hi>If when we were Enemies we were reconcil'd to God, by the death of his Son &amp;c.</hi>] yet it is not the nature of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for men to be Enemies to God: I appeal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of both <hi>R.G.</hi> and all other <hi>Professors,</hi> Whether Enmity and Reconciliation do not differ? And whether, while Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are at enmity, they be then actually reconcil'd? <hi>Though while we were Enemies, we were reconcil'd, by the death of his Son</hi>; intentionally on God's Terms, but not actually in our selves, till the Enmity was slain in us; as God, with reference to his Purpose, speaks to <hi>Abraham, I have made thee a Father of many Nations</hi> (before he was actually so made) For <hi>Paul,</hi> in the following words, saith, <hi>God, who quickeneth the Dead, calleth those things which be not as though they were, Rom.</hi> 4.17. And also <hi>Zacharias,</hi> being filled with the Holy Ghost, he Prophesied say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>for he hath visited and redeemed his People, Luke</hi> 1.67, 68. and to the end of the chapter: Now though this [<hi>Redeemed</hi>] be spoken of as a thing done, yet it was spoken of in the Prophesie, <hi>of Christ the Horn of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; whose <hi>Salvation</hi> is Deliverance and Preservation out of the hands of our Enemies, that we may serve him, without
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107200:4"/>
fear, in Holiness and Righteousness before him all the dayes of our life: This was not witnessed when the Enemy rul'd, and no good was wrought in us.</p>
            <p>Further, If Reconciliation and Redemption had been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally finish'd without us, when no good was wrought in us, what needed the Apostle so earnestly <hi>beseech and pray them in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God</hi>? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. They might have said, that is done and complated already: Or to say, <hi>Tbat Jesus Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar People, &amp;c?

                  <hi>Answer,</hi> These are covertly, and deceitful Insinuations, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that we deny Christianity, or deny Redemption through Faith in Christ, both which are very false; for it is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sin pleasing-doctrines which oppose and slight the inward Work of Christ in his People, that we oppose: And what we have said on this account, are neither Cavils nor groundless Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as we are falsly accus'd.</p>
               <p>R. G. to the Reader saith, <hi>Having lately published a Book, intituled, A Testimony to the true Saviour—Concurring with the Voices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Nay, it was a heap of Confusion, which could add nothing to the credit of the Prophets nor Apostles, if they had been question'd; but their Testimonies of the Man Christ Jesus, we never doubted of, nor oppos'd, as wickedly and falsly he hath mis-represented us.</p>
               <p>R. G. <hi>And unto Reconciliation, Justification, and Redemption, as already in being in him, purchased, compleated, and perfected with God for Sinners, by the price of his whole, entire, and perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That perfect Reconciliation and Redemption, &amp;c. were in being both in God and his Son for us, while Enemies, we assert, but not receiv'd by us till we were made Friends; and so reconci'd in our Minds by the Spirit or Word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation operating within. But (<hi>R. G.)</hi> to thy matter, I query first, How, and of whom Reconciliation, Justification, &amp;c. are purchas'd for Sinners, and so perfected whilst not made effectual by the workings of the Spirit within? Or are men justified, <hi>when no good is wrought in them by any Light or Spirit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,</hi> as thy Doctrine was, and is? And thou shouldst have plainly spoke-out, and told us what thou meanest by the words, <hi>Purchased with God</hi>; whether in the sence of <hi>Satisfaction</hi>; and Payment to God in our stead, as thy Tutors, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> hold, yea, or nay? And whether the Love, which is infinite, was not the cause of his sending his Son into the World, that the World through him might be sav'd; and so the coming and manifestation of Christ in his Life, Works, Doctrines, Sufferings, tasting Death for every man, &amp;c. Effects of the Love of God to Mankind, yea, or nay? And tell us plainly where doth the Scripture say, <hi>That Justification and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are purchas'd of God, and perfected without us, by the crucified Body, when no good is wrought within?</hi> And if all these things are so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd and perfected without for Sinners, or the whole World, what must be the Spirit's operation within? And how then can God condemn any for sin, if thy Doctrine be true? If thou sayst it is because of their Unbelief, then this hath respect unto the Work of the Spirit and Faith within, without which men cannot be sav'd nor justify'd (wherein thou, <hi>R. G.</hi> dost plainly contradict thy self) whatever thou, or carnal Professors, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of your Justification, &amp;c. being purchas'd and perfected without you, you are not yet purchas'd nor redeem'd from Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor from a deceitful spirit; wherein thou hast shew'd thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love to be Enmity and Falshood, against us and the Truth, as will further appear.</p>
               <p>R. G. <hi>That there are some, pretending to be Teachers among them—under the disguise of the names of Light and Power within,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107200:7"/>
thereby bring in damnable Errors, to pervert the Faith—among whom these four Men have numbred themselves, by their voluntary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against the plain Truth, left us upon record by the Prophets and Apostles, and testified by me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Its our Testimony of the Light and Power within, that perplexeth thee, and such dark and lifeless Professors as thou art, who are in the spirit of Enmity: And why dost thou Envy and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye us, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> or those for whom Christ died, as well for thy self? If we had oppos'd the plain Truths of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, in Scripture (as thou hast most falsly accus'd us) it had been thy part and duty to have prov'd the Scriptures true, if we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them; and not to impose thy impertinent Tautollogies upon us, which thy Book is fill'd with; if we were either <hi>Jews, Turks, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> which in any thing deny'd plain Scripture, thou takest but a mean course to convince us, by thy imposing and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Question: But hadst thou dealt plainly, and only brought us plain Scripture, without thy Confusion, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Glosses, and Sin-pleasing Fancies, we should not have had these Controversies, nor such mudled stuff, and ramblement to deal withal, as thou hast divulg'd.</p>
               <p>And as to thy speaking of two Gospel Mysteries, (viz.) <hi>What was wrought in Christ, and finished and perfected as once by that Sacrifice of his crucified Body; and the second of what is to be wrought by Christ in us, &amp;c.</hi>

Now this was not to indulge any in sin, or enmity thereof in themselves; nor yet for any to plead that they are redeem'd, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly justified at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without them, while in their sins, and no good wrought within them; for in that state they are so far from receiving the Attonement, that they are Enemies to Christ and to his Cross, and guilty of his Body and Blood, not discerning either: And this is thy state, who thinkest thy self justify'd (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wast born, above sixteen hundred Years since) and yet art in thy sins, pretending to the Work of Christ in thee (when otherwhiles thou reckonest all done without thee) but now sayst, <hi>It is daily doing in many Bodies, till Mortality be swallowed up of Life:</hi> And when dost thou think that will be? Will it be on this side the Grave, yea, or nay? Dost thou not expect a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Sanctification, and Deliverance from Sin till after thou art deceas'd? If thou dost not, how art thou in the Method of the Gospel, and how art thou perfectly justify'd? Its they that are wash'd and sanctify'd that are justify'd. As to the Sufferings of Christ without, though the Scripture-Relation of them be true, yet thou hast but a Traditional and Historical Faith thereof, with some particular Conceits and wrong Constructions, whilst thou coverst thy self in thy sins with a Profession thereof: And so art upon a false Bottom, not sanctified nor justified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which is the immediate Cause of both unto them that believe in the Name of his Son Christ Jesus, whose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Sinners was two-fold, both inward and outward; he bore the Burthen, and Weight of the sins of the World.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou wouldst have <hi>G. K.</hi> to prove, <hi>That Christ doth bear Sins but as he did bear them in his Crucified Body,</hi> p. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which I say,</hi> He was a Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World; the Righteous Seed hath suffer'd through all Ages, by the seed of Rebellion; there is a spiritual suffering, as well as there was a bodily suffering; his Soul was made an Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for sin; he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the Transgressors, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. And said the Apostle, The Spirit it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107200:8"/>
maketh intercession for us with Groanings, which cannot be uttered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. And do not these <hi>Groanings</hi> imply an inward and spiritual suffering? And was not Christ spiritually crucified in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi>? And that he doth suffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that in his crucified Body at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is evident to them that know the Fellowship of his Sufferings, though not to thee; as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> witnessed, when he said, <hi>Who now rejoyce in my Sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christ in my Flesh, for his Body's sake, which is the Church,</hi> Col. 1.24.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou accusest the Author of the Book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The great Mystery of the Great Whore,</hi> with saying, <hi>That the Soul is infinite in it self, without beginning, more then all the World, a part of God, of his Beeing —coming from God, and returning to God again, the Power of God, &amp;c.</hi> And addest, <hi>Doth a Part of God infinite, need to be saved, &amp;c</hi>? And in p. 27. on the same occasion sayst, <hi>This is the very Root of Rantism &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> We have alwayes distinquish'd between the Soul of Man, and that which saves it; and between the soul as in death under transgression, and as quickened and united unto God by his Son; as is plain to be seen in that Book accus'd by thee, where mention is, <q>Of the <hi>Soul</hi> being in Death in Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and man's spirit not sanctified, p. 91.</q> 
                  <q>And of the <hi>Soul</hi> being <hi>immortal,</hi> and living in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, where <hi>Christ</hi> is the Bishop of it; it being in the hand that saves from Transgression: And that Christ brings up the soul to God, whereby they come to be one Soul, page 129.</q> In which state the soul is in Union with God, as he that is joyn'd to the Lord is one Spirit: <hi>And they that are Baptiz'd into Christ have put on Christ, through whom they come to obtain the answer and end of his Prayer,</hi> (viz.) <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us, &amp;c. And the Glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, as we are one,</hi> John 17.21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>And its said, That Man is the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11.7. Now how absurd would it be to question, Doth the Image and Glory of God need to be saved? For man is called so, he partaking of that Image and Glory; and so it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

intended of the soul (as to Divine, Immortal, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite) then as by participation of that Life and Light, which is divine and infinite, wherewith the soul is cloth'd and adorn'd in the renewed state.</p>
               <p>But as to its being the Power of God, <hi>a Part of God</hi>; I find not these words so asserted by the Author of the said Book, nor any thing (like them) with that general intent and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as strained by this Accuser; for the Power of God is that which saves the soul, and it is the soul (as in the Power) that is unchangable: And God is not to be divided into parts and particulars (he is not divisable nor separable) It was the Priests words, That the <hi>soul is a part of the Divine Essence,</hi>

And in p. 68. it is said, <q>God breathed into man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul; for that which came out from God is the Cause that man became a Living Soul: And is not this of God, &amp;c?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Infinite, Divine, &amp;c.</hi> is no otherwise intended to the soul, then as relating to the Breath of Life (which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came from God, by which the soul lives and subsists in its Beeing) which (figuratively) some have put for (or called) the Soul, as being the Soul or Life of it, by which it lives and is upholden, whether under a sense of Anguish or Peace: And this hath no accord with Rantism, but is a Testimony against it and thee too.</p>
               <p>And it had been well for thee, to have cleared thy self of Rantism, ere thou hadst charged it on others; for, indeed thy doctrine hath a direct tendency to it; as, <hi>That men are perfectly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and reconciled in the sight of God, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is like thy doctrine, <hi>Redemption was in Christ, therefore not to be done in us; Christ passed through Death, therefore we must not be crucified, nor perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead to sin in this Life</hi>: Is not this the very tendency or sum of much of thy Doctrine? But is it not Sin, and its Enmity within, which Christ came to redeem and reconcile man from? Thou art yet in Death, far from being redeem'd, or thus reconcil'd; who hast not known the Ministration of Death, Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Wrath; but questionest the Believers passing through it [though it be a plain Truth, that they did (and many do) so pass] they passed from Death to Life, and through the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came dead unto the Law: And did not the Commandment which was ordain'd to Life, work Death in the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who also knew the Terrors of the Lord?

But you Sin-pleasing-Preachers, have neither sown in Tears; have not gone forth Weeping, bearing pretious Seed; nor reaped the Fruit thereof; Your fallow ground is not plow'd up; your Earth doth not open, either to receive or bring forth Righteousness in the seed or fruit thereof; your Earth is hard and barren, Sin and Unrighteousness dwells in it, whereby you have caus'd the Heavens to be as Brass, and the Earth as Iron.</p>
            <p>Again, To oppose the Righteousness of the Elect Seed and Works of the Spirit within, as unto Justification, this <hi>R.

            </p>
            <p>Now, if he hath truly represented what they of <hi>Rome</hi> say in this case, I must needs say, However they may hold that, and other Truths in Unrighteousness, that they of <hi>Rome</hi> have given a better definition of Justification, then <hi>R.

Now was this an old Popish Trick, or the old Law-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirit (as he calls it) No, sure it was before the Law was written; and it was the Spirit of Faith, by which <hi>Abraham</hi> obey'd God; for <hi>Abraham</hi> believ'd and it was imputed to him for Righteousness; and he was called the Friend of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2 23.

Truth (though in unrighteousness) I must not therefore deny it: If the Pope, and the Devil also, confess there is a God and a Christ; must I therefore deny it, or be counted a <hi>Papist</hi>?

            <p>Again, Our asserting the Righteousness of the Elect Seed rais'd in us, and Obedience of Faith therein for Justification and Acceptance with God: This doth neither deny nor oppose the Sacrifice of the crucified Body of the man Christ Jesus, nor yet blot out of our hearts either the Name or Remembrance of him, who is the great <hi>Propitiation</hi> for sin, as unjustly the Elect Seed, and its Righteousness within is accus'd, p. 23. For the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ within, and his Manifestation in Spirit, doth neither deny nor oppose his Manifestation or Suffering in the Flesh, but rather answereth and fulfilleth the Intent and End thereof; for the outward Manifestation of the Son of God in the likeness of sinful Flesh, as it did condemn sin in the Flesh, so his inward Manifestation in Spirit doth destroy sin, worketh Justification and Redemption in them who obey his Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for he is the Author of Eternal Salvation to as many as obey him; and it is through the Obedience of the Spirit that the soul is purified unto unfained Love, &amp;c. And if ye through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye shall live: so here is Righteousness, Redemption, and Salvation receiv'd in Christ the Light, through obedience to his Light within; however this be slightly stiled, <hi>A Law-working spirit,</hi> and falsly judged. <hi>A Principle agreeing with all the false Religions in the World,</hi> by this <hi>Antinomian, Presbyterian, Independant,</hi> R.G. p. 24. who thus further preacheth, as in the Name of the man Christ Jesus, <hi>Receive the Attonement, be ye Reconciled to God; Believe and be saved, the Man Christ Jesus having already slain the Enmity in himself, the power of Sin, and Death, and the Law, for us: And thus he is our Saviour, &amp;c.</hi>

For he had no sin nor enmity, nor power of it in himself to slay; seeing by the eternal Spirit he offer'd up himself without <hi>Spot</hi> to God; by all which, though he by his Innocency condemn'd sin in the flesh, and in himself became a Conqueror and Triumpher through Sufferings; yet if <hi>R.

the Obedient; and so they falsly apply, reckon, and impute Christ's Righteousness to themselves, while they are actually rebellious against his Light within: and I see no better tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that <hi>R.

Iniquity, and Falshood; such are the People that are sav'd by the Lord, who are Children that will not Lye, in whom Deceit and Enmity is slain by the Power and spiritual Appearance of Christ Jesus within, though I grant in general that he is the Saviour of all men, as he affords them Preservation by his Power, as Men and Creatures, in order to give them a day of Visitation, wherein the tenders of Life and everlasting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be held forth unto them, that believing and receiving the Son of God, they may be sav'd from Sin and Death in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for he is the Saviour of all men, but especially of them that believe, whose Faith is not a meer Historical Faith of things only done without, but a FAITH in the Name and Power of the Son of God, a Heart-purifying Faith, a justifying Faith, a Faith that worketh by Love, a Faith that is victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over the World; by which Faith, we being justified, we have Peace with God; and by which Faith we have received Christ in Spirit, and know him after the Spirit. The Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Knowledge, Faith; and outward Profession of him (as meerly after the Flesh) will neither save nor justifie.

               <head>Robert Gordon's Answer to these Scriptures.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have considered the Scriptures thou mentionest; and I find that in none of them it is testified who the true Christ our only Saviour is, but what he is through the operations of his Spirit in Believers, called therefore the Anointing within, or Christ within; but these Operations of his Spirit within, are no where in Scripture called the Lord's Christ, our only Saviour: And if thou own no other Mediator, Christ, or Saviour, then what is described in these Scriptures thou mentions, then necessarily thou disowns the Lord Jesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a Man approved of God, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far <hi>R. G.</hi> telling us also of the <hi>Writings of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Man</hi> Jacob Behoman, as his words are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:107200:23"/>On which the Observation was thus, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe,</hi> Hear the tenure and tendency of <hi>R. G</hi>'s. Answer how antichristian it is? He appears here plainly as owning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Mediator, Christ, or Saviour, then that <hi>Christ</hi> that said, I am come a Light into the World, I am the Vine; &amp;c. (And we ask, Was not he Jesus of <hi>Nazareth?)</hi> And of whom it is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in Scripture, <hi>Christ in you; Christ the Power and Wisdom of God; He that hath the Son, hath Life; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> But R. G. doth not own this Christ to be the Lord's Christ, or Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth</hi>; but he must have some other christ, then this Christ, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scib'd in those Scriptures before. (But dare he say that <hi>Jacob Behoman</hi> owns his doctrine herein? And I add, Surely R. G. grows darker and darker, to turn from a <hi>Behmanist,</hi> to an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian, Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Independant.</hi>) For this Christ, who is the Word, the Light, the Christ in Believers, the Power and Wisdom of God speaking in Saints, R. G. deems but the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of the Spirit, and not <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Operator, Saviour,</hi> or <hi>Redeemer</hi>; wherein he is greatly mistaken, and has out-run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self besides any right Aim: For Christ, as the Word, the true Light, the Power and Wisdom of God, the Redeemer from all Iniquity; and as in his Saints, the Giver of Life and Victory over the World, &amp;c. he is the true Operator of God (his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations within, cannot be wrought without him the Operator) and the Author of Faith, the Worker out of Sin, the Saviour and Redeemer from Iniquity (and so an Operator as such) He is given for a Leader, for Light, Life, and Salvation to all who believe in his <hi>Light,</hi> which will shine, live, prevail and prosper against all the Darkness, Dark-spirits, and Enmity which oppose it.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader judge, whether <hi>R. G</hi>'s. words be not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, and he an Antichrist and Deceiver, yea, or nay?</p>
               <p>This R. G. represents some of G. L's. Letter to him in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I find thy Mind, in this Book, abroad; gathering in the comprehension what thou fancy'st, and hast heard of others,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107200:24"/>
so heaps up Confusion and Contradiction: What will avail thee or me, that we know abroad, of things done abroad? Nothing at all. If ever thee or I come to know true Peace, we must come to know the Life that quickens: It is not Names nor Things done without, but the Life within that redeems, that purges, that sanctifies, that quickens the Soul to God.</q> To this R.G. cavillingly answers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now consider what is testified by the Prophets and Apostles, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Man Christ Jesus without them, a Name and thing abroad—The Saints of old believed in him for Redemption; they saw, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and left it upon Record to us, and their Report is true, that we also, who have not seen, might Believe and be Blest—Thou hast made the Coming, Death, Sufferings, and Resurrection of the Man</hi> Christ, <hi>for the taking away Sin, as quite useless as Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Justification, Salvation, as a Name and Thing done Abroad, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, He hath not made void these things by his owning the Life that quickens, the Life within that redeemeth, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and that sanctifieth, and quickens the soul to God; for this answereth both Christ's Testimony, and the End of his Coming: He hath only signify'd how void and empty R. G. is of the true and living Knowledge of Christ, and his Works within: As also, Accounting that faith but dead, which is receiv'd only by Tradition and Report, without either sight or sense of Christ, or his Power and Operations within, as the Foundation, and Author, and Object of Living Faith, which sanctifies and justifies; which is contrary to R. G's. dead Faith of Names and Things all without, while nothing of Life is felt within: The Flesh of the Son of Man he hath not eat, and his Blood he hath not drunk of; so that Life in him he hath not received: And I believe, that the Name of Christ Jesus, his Power and Works, have so little place or reception in him, that both Christ, his Name, the Redemption of the Soul, Justification, and Salvation, are all shut out of doors, and so but as Names and things abroad with R. G. and so the End, and Effect of Christ's Coming, and Sufferings, and the Power of his Resurrection, these also have no place in such as he, who do not experience the Life nor the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107200:24"/>
Power of Christ within, to redeem, sanctifie, or quicken the Soul to God; neither is his sin taken away from within, while Salvation and Redemption are shut out, meerly as things abroad: but Christ said, It is the Spirit that quickens, the Flesh profiteth nothing, <hi>John</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.63. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said, Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him <hi>so</hi> no more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. And did not the Apostle know him to be their everlasting Salvation, Justification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption?</p>
               <p>Now that of Jesus, the Son of the Highest, its said, The Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of <hi>David</hi>; and he shall Raign over the House of <hi>Jacob</hi>; and of his Kingdom there shall be no End, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. Now to this we both confess, and assert it.</p>
               <p>But whereas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>Now though I grant, that according to the Flesh he was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> descended of the Linage of <hi>David</hi>; yet he was Miraculously conceiv'd by the Over-shaddowing of the Power of the Highest, and therefore was call'd the Son of God; not <hi>Natural Seed of</hi> David, that's not Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now I ask, Was this a Natural Seed?</p>
               <p>But in that Christ, in the dayes of his Flesh, said, I can of my own self do nothing; the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do, that he doth: Still I imply and grant, that he took upon him a real Body of Flesh; though methinks <hi>R.

               <salute>R. G.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALthough thy Part to me be answer'd by another, yet there are some things which I find fit a little to touch; I had indeed much in my heart, for Truth's sake, to lay open the Emptiness, Weakness, and Inconsistency of this thy work against us; but being prevented by another concern'd with me therein, much of what I have to say may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unto a further occasion.</p>
            <p>Thy way of Reasoning against me, as having nothing from the Lord to answer thee, or proving rebellious, in not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, because I did not communicate it unto thee, by word of Mouth, or writing, is vain and frivolous; it was deliver'd thee in Print by one of my Friends, viz. <hi>G. L.</hi> and seeing thou camest forth in Print against us (though under a Cover) what ground hadst thou to expect another way of answering, then by Print? And although I was in the same Town with thee, yet I left the Town, and the Nation also, before it was Printed; so I could not send thee it in Print, and in Writing it was not convenient; but I left it with Friends, to be given thee in Print, as was accordingly done: And however thou so positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'st that I had any thing from the Lord to answer thee (in thy presumptious carnal Confidence) yet in the Day of the Lord,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107200:31"/>
that shall over-take thee, it shall be known unto thee, that I had it from the Lord, in Love to thy Soul.</p>
            <p>Thy alledgance that our Principles are inconsistent (without further probation) will have no more weight with sober men, then that the Earth is inconsistent, because it may seem so to a man Drunk with Wine, to whom all things seem to reel and stagger; so Principles, never so consistent and solid, may seem as inconsistent to thee, and such as may be Drunk with a spirit of Giddiness and Levity; whereas the inconsistency is in such men's spirits, and not in our Principles.</p>
            <p>What thou writest of a <hi>Fourfold Combination</hi> against thy Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as thou call'st it; and our making such a stir about it, and printing together against it, as for our very lives; and thy giving us names in a vain and scornful mind, as if thou seem'st to glory; is weak and groundless. <hi>G. L.</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lish'd nothing of his in Print against thee: <hi>A. R.</hi> only writ a few Lines to thee, as being thy old Acquaintance, rather indeed regrating thy Condition, then entring into a Dispute with thee; and but touching at two or three things passing by: And <hi>G. W.</hi> did lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more but set thy Contradictions before thee, which as yet stand over thy head unanswer'd; thou having not so much as assay'd any Answer unto them (but telling us, <hi>He or we might no less charge Contradictions upon the Apostle</hi> Paul; thus fathering thy gross Confusion, and Contradiction upon him) So thy Book was upon the matter almost wholly left upon me, that thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not have made such a Noise of a <hi>Fourfold Combination</hi>; and there was no great stir made about it by us; however, thou may'st have apprehended so, by the stir in thy own spirit; not unlike a man diseas'd with the <hi>Megrum</hi> in his head, that imagins he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great Noises and Stirs abroad (when all is quiet) because of the Distemper within himself.</p>
            <p>The whole substance and strength of my Answer unto thy first remains in force against thee, who hast wav'd the most material things in it; only nibling at some things, when thou seem'st to thy self, thou wouldst get something to say; for Proof of which, I refer the Readers to one impartial Examination of both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:107200:32"/>In thy fourth Page, Part 1. to <hi>A. R.</hi> thou abusest my worde, taking occasion from a small Error in the Printing, which is a disingenious way of dealing; and had not thy prejudice blinded thee, thou might'st easily have corrected it by the sense: Thy abuse of me is in these words, that thou citest my words thus, <hi>Yet the Soul, yea and the whole man, is to be saved within</hi>; whereas my words were thus, <hi>Yet the Soul, yea and the whole man, is to be saved, with, in, and through the Seed, whoever believe in Christ, and are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him</hi>—The Error in Printing is, that <hi>within</hi> was put for <hi>with, in</hi>; and upon thy own Mistake and Abusing me, thou rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est a Callumny, as if I held, <hi>That the full Salvation was only from sin within</hi>; whereas I said, <hi>The whole man was to be sav'd</hi>; and I say still, not only the <hi>Soul,</hi> but the <hi>whole Man</hi> is to be sav'd, both from <hi>sin,</hi> and all the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>consequences</hi> of it, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward: And the Redemption of the Body, and the Resurrection, I do believe according to Scripture, contrary to what thou falsly insinuatest against me.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou queriest, <hi>By what Scripture can I prove that Christ died for a Seed in man that needed Redemption, which Seed is Christ in every man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Thou abusest our words herein, which are not that Christ needed Redemption, but that he redeems his Seed which he taketh upon him; but Christ died for men, that men who were dead might become alive; and no other way can men live, but by having Christ to live in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. And the Life of Christ in the Saints is in a rais'd Seed; he who was crucified in them (who could not be crucified in them, but as in the Seed) coming to live in them; but if thou wert not ignorant of this Birth, thou wouldst not propound such an ignorant Question; and the Scripture speaketh expresly of Christ, as having been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in <hi>some,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>crucified in you</hi>; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in you</hi>; for so are both places in the <hi>Greek</hi>

            <p>That I slight the <hi>Work of Man's Redemption,</hi> or what Christ <hi>did</hi> or <hi>suffer'd</hi> in order thereunto is falsly charg'd upon me, nor dost thou

            <p>Pag. 10. Thou alledgest, <hi>I did not in my first, tell what further ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency the Sufferings, Testimony, and Example of Christ had unto our Reconciliation, then that of</hi> Paul<hi>'s, or any other Martyr's.</hi>

               </gap> art thou not asham'd thus falsly to charge us, and yet a few Lines after, in contradiction to thy self, to clear us again?</p>
            <p>Pag. 13. Thou accusest me, as <hi>unfaithfully repeating thy words, to make them speak what thou intend'st not</hi>; but thou dost not mention one particular, wherein I have so done, nor canst thou; only thou tell'st m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>That I leave out that part of the Sentence, in the Apostle's words, that is most weighty against me,</hi> viz. <hi>Being Reconciled.</hi>

            <p>And for a confirmation of thy false and confus'd doctrine, as, that <hi>Men, while yet enemies, and so remaining, before and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to any inward Operations of the Spirit of Holiness, are reconcil'd to God, and God to them</hi>: Thou abusest that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. both corrupting it as its in the <hi>English,</hi> and wresting it to a wrong <hi>sense</hi>;

1st, in that thou addest the word <hi>(yet</hi>) as importing, <hi>A remaining Enemies,</hi> which <hi>(yet</hi>) is not in that verse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. 2d, that thou draw'st from this place, <hi>That God is fully reconcil'd to them, while yet remaining Enemies</hi>: Whereas the Scripture saith not, When we were Enemies, God was reconcil'd to us; but thus, as it is in the <hi>English, When we were Enemies, we were reconiled to God</hi>: And that the Apostle cannot understand, that they were reconcil'd to God, while remaining Enemies, is manifest; because he inviteth Enemies to be reconcil'd to him; which imports, they were not already reconcil'd to him: Yea, thou grantest, <hi>That it is a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication on our part, as to receiving the Attonement, that we be reconcil'd to God.</hi> But because the <hi>English</hi> Translation, at first view, seemeth to favour thee, I shall therefore refer thee and others, who have any skill in the <hi>Greek</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, and you will find the words run thus, <hi>If we being Enemies (Graece <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And here in thy 15th page I take notice of another piece of thy Self-confusion and Contradiction, as that thou say'st, <hi>Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Justification was fully done, perfected, accomplish'd at Christ</hi>'s <hi>Death without us, and is not to be done or wrought over again in any man</hi>: And yet in Contradiction thou say'st, <hi>To make our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation effectual in every man, we are as a Qualification on our part, &amp;c. requir'd, invited to be reconcil'd to God.</hi> Then according to thee, it must be made effectual in men; and yet thou deny'st, that it is to be made or wrought within any men, it being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fully done; And if it was fully done before, was it not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, before? Or if it be not effectual, till it be made so in us, was it not in-effectual before? And if it was in-effectual, it was not fully done: What Confusion and Contradiction!

            <p>Pag. 16. Thou chargest me with a <hi>Self-contradiction,</hi> because I said, <hi>The full and perfect Redemption was in Christ, while we were Enemies</hi>: But herein thou show'st thy self weak; for I say still, Our full and perfect Redemption was in him, while we were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, so was our full and perfect Sanctification, Wisdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; yet it followeth not that we are Redeem'd, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Wise, and Righteous, till (as it is in him so) it be receiv'd by us; for it is the receiving it that giveth us the denomination of <hi>Redeemed, Sanctified, Wise, Righteous,</hi> as the Cloth becometh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, by receiving the <hi>Colour,</hi> and not otherwise.</p>

our Friend's words give thee the least ground for it: As for <hi>W.B.</hi> he said, <hi>Humility, Meekness, was a Mediator to asswage and stop Wrath in the Enmity-Seed</hi>; but he said not, it was our <hi>Mediator betwixt God</hi> and <hi>Vs</hi>: So thou canst not be excus'd, from being a gross and unjust Perverter of his words: And if any have called Christ the <hi>Humility,</hi> it is not more then <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>That he,</hi> to wit Christ, <hi>was made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, &amp;c.</hi> and when Christ is call'd <hi>Humility, Righteousness,</hi> are not understood those particular Effects and Fruits of the Spirit, but that original &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative <hi>Righteousness, Verity, Humility, Truth, and Goodness, &amp;c.</hi> that is <hi>Christ,</hi> as he is <hi>God,</hi> the fountain, goodness, truth, righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
