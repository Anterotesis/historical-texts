            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first chanced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this severe piece and had read it in the Language it was sent me, I was so much concern'd with the honour

of our Country, that it was my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to suppress the publication of our shame, as conceiving it an act of great inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; But upon second, and more impartialthoughts, I have been temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make it
<pb facs="tcp:54133:3"/>
speak English, and give it liberty, not to reproach, but to instruct our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; remembring what the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath said, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen rebuke is better than secret Love.</hi> Prov. 27.5.

<pb facs="tcp:54133:4"/>
are most of them, very home; and which we may no way evade, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, at least, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (who ever he were) made nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble use of his time, but best of all, by setting upon an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffectuall

redresse of what is amiss. And though <hi>I</hi> doubt not, but one might easily retort in as many instances, upon defects as great (if not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (for he that finds fault, had need be perfect)

of, in a conjuncture (as you rightly deduce) of so strange vicissitude, and wonderful alterations; And to whom, my <hi>Lord,</hi> should I more readily submit?

as that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which can escape your cognizance, not onely in that <hi>Island,</hi> but in all the world besides. But since you oblige me not to dip into the transactions of State, the effects of Providence, Time, Notices of a superiour Orbe, and in which you cannot be instructed by so weak an instrument as your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and demand onely the little <hi>Remarkes</hi> of my hasty, and desultory <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination;</hi> though I cannot pretend to improve your <hi>Lordships</hi> knowledge, yet I may hope to give it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54133:7"/>
and an <hi>Essay</hi> of my Obedience.</p>
            <p>It must be avowed that <hi>England</hi> is a sweet, and fertill Country.</p>
            <p>Terra potens armis, atque ubere gleba:</p>
            <p>That the Fields, the Hills, and the Vallies are perpetually clad with a glorious, and agreeable verdure; that her provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are plentifull; her staples important; and her interest very considerable; not omitting the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull <hi>Ladies,</hi> I had almost said, of the world, but for a just respect due to the illustrious <hi>Circles</hi> of our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54133:7"/>
               <hi>Court,</hi> where the beauties of conversation, so far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the tinctures of Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Roses. But these, my <hi>Lord,</hi> are not the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires</hi> which you demand; I will therefore hasten to my <hi>Post.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a short passage from <hi>Calais,</hi> we came on shore at <hi>Dover,</hi> where the people of the Town enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd us with such suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and forbidding counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, whispering, and stiff postures, that I should never have believed so great a difference in the addresses of two Nations, could have been produced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54133:8"/>
by so short a trajection, and in a Port continually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd to the faces of strangers, had not the contrary humours of our contiguous neighbours, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made it possible, in so many pleasant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. But I was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, when we had taken <hi>Post,</hi> and scarce out of the <hi>Village,</hi> at the acclamations of the <hi>Boys,</hi> running after, and affrighting our horses, hooting, and crying out, <hi>French Dogs, French Dogs, a Mounser, Mounser!</hi> by a particular expression of welcome, which other people would interpret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54133:8"/>
But in this Triumph (though somewhat late e're we set out of <hi>Dover</hi>) we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as far as <hi>Rochester</hi> the first night, where, how new a thing it appeared to me, to see my confident <hi>Host</hi> set him down cheek by joul by me, belching, and puffing <hi>Tabacco</hi> in my face, you may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; till I afterwards found it to be the usuall stile of this Country; and that the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who lodge at their <hi>Inns,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themselves in their company, and are much pleas'd with their imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies: Arriv'd at the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54133:9"/>
               <hi>Metropolis</hi> of civility, <hi>London,</hi> we put our selves in <hi>Coach</hi> with some persons of quality, who came to conduct us to our Lodging; but neither was this passage without honours done to us, the kennel dirt, squibs, roots and rams-hornes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favours which were frequently cast at us by the children, and appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises without reproofe; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, that in <hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> as seldome meets withall, as with the contests of <hi>Carmen,</hi> who in this Town domineer in the streets, o're-thow the <hi>Hell-Carts</hi> (for so they name
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54133:9"/>
the <hi>Coaches)</hi> cursing, and reviling at the <hi>Nobles:</hi> You would imagine your self amongst a <hi>Legion</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> and in the suburbs of <hi>Hell.</hi> I have greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the remisness of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and the temper of the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and that the <hi>Citizens,</hi> who subsist onely upon them, should permit so great a disorder, rather joyning in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, than at all chastizing the inhumanity: But these are the naturall effects of parity, popular Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and Insulary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>I find, as you told me, my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54133:10"/>
               <hi>Lord, London</hi> to be a Town so nobly Situated, and upon such a River, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> certainly shews not a more usefull and agreeable; but withall this, a <hi>City</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a wooden, nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, and inartificiall congestion of Houses; some of the principall streets so narrovv, as there is nothing more deformed, and unlike, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of it at a distance, and its <hi>asymmitry</hi> vvithin the Walls. Their <hi>Fountains,</hi> vvhich are the pride and grace of our streets, and plentifully supplyed in this <hi>City,</hi> are here immur'd,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54133:10"/>
to secure the vvaters from, I know not vvhat, impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but, certainly, it do's greatly detract from the beauty of the <hi>Carfours,</hi> and intercepts the vievv.</p>
            <p>Amongst the peices of <hi>modern Architecture,</hi> I have never observ'd above tvvo, which were remarkable in this vast <hi>City:</hi> The <hi>Portico</hi> of the Church of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and the Banqueting house at <hi>White-hall,</hi> of vvhich I remember to have heard your <hi>Lordship</hi> speak: but you would be amaz'd at the <hi>genious</hi> of this age, that should suffer this goodly and venerable fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brick,<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54133:11"/>
 to be built about, and converted into raskally <hi>Ware-Houses,</hi> and so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly obscur'd and defac'd, that an argument of greater avarice, malice, meanness and deformity of minde cannot possibly be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Nothing here of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, nothing of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, no publique and honourable works, such as render our <hi>Paris,</hi> and other <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and visited by all the World; emulating even <hi>Italy</hi> her self, for her <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,</hi> uniform and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Structures: But O! how lothsome a <hi>Golgotha</hi> is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54133:11"/>
this <hi>Paul</hi>'s! I asure your <hi>Lordship,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> is the sole spot in all the world, where, amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> their <hi>Churches</hi> are made jakes, and stables, markets and Tipling-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and where there were more need of <hi>Scorpions,</hi> than <hi>Thongs,</hi> to drive out the <hi>Publicanes</hi> and <hi>Money-Changers:</hi> In sum, where these excellent uses, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the markes of Piety and Reformation.</p>
            <p>I had sometimes the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity to visite the several <hi>Worships</hi> of these <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Christians,</hi> and <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts:</hi> But I extreamly

wondred to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In this <hi>remarke,</hi> my Lord, to be somewhat more particular, you will not be displeas'd; because it was a thing you so much recommended to my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall notice. <hi>Form,</hi> they observe none: They pray and read without method, and indeed, wtithout reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or devotion. I have beheld a whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sit on their-with their hats on, at the reading of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54133:12"/>
               <hi>Psalms,</hi> and yet bare-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when they sing them. In divers places they read not the <hi>Scriptures</hi> at all; but up into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> where they make an insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, tedious and immetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical <hi>Prayer,</hi> in Phrases and a tone so affected and mysterious, that they give it the name of <hi>Canting,</hi> a tearm by which they do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually expresse the <hi>gibbrish</hi> of Beggars and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds; after which, there follows the <hi>Sermon</hi> (which for the most part, they read out of a book) consisting (like their prayers) of <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> and <hi>abstracted</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54133:13"/>

so far to the other extream, that they have now lost all moderation, and decorum; And I have been herein, my Lord the more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious to inform my self of each particular; because it seemes yet to be the most publique <hi>Religion</hi> of the State.

how heavy, dull and insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant the conversation is; loud, querelous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. I shall relate a story that once happened in my presence at a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> house in the <hi>Country,</hi> where there was much company and feasting. I fortun'd to come at dinner-time, and after the cloth was taken away (as the manner is) they fell to their laudable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise: But I unacquainted then with their custome, was lead up into a <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Room,</hi> where I had the permission (with a noble person who introduced me) to sit and converse
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54133:24"/>
with the <hi>Ladies,</hi> who were thither retired; the <hi>Gentle.</hi> of the house leaving us in the mean time, to entertain his freinds below: But you may imagine how strangely I was astonish'd, to see within an hour after, one of the company that had dined there, entering into the Room all bloody, and disorder'd, to fetch a svvord vvhich lay in one of the vvindovves, and three or four of his companions, vvhom the fumes of the Wine had inspirited, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, and dragging him by the hair, till in this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, one of their Spurs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54133:24"/>
engaged into a Carpet, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which stood a very fair <hi>Looking-Glass,</hi> and two noble pieces of <hi>Porselain,</hi> drew all to the ground, brake the <hi>Glass</hi> and the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas</hi> in pieces; and all this on such an instant, that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> and my self, had much ado to rescue the affrighted <hi>Ladies</hi> from suffering in the tumult; but at last we prevail'd, and brought them to tearms, the quarrel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an <hi>Health</hi> onely, which one of them would have shifted. I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Lord, ever to have known (or very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54133:25"/>
rarely) a <hi>health</hi> drank in <hi>France,</hi> no not the <hi>Kings;</hi> and if we say <hi>A Vostre sante Monsier,</hi> it neither expects pledge, or ceremony. 'Tis here so the custome to drink to every one at the <hi>Table,</hi> that by the time a <hi>Gentleman</hi> has done his duty to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he is ready to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, whereas with us, we salute the whole <hi>Table</hi> with a single glass onely. But, my Lord, was not this, imagine you, an admirable <hi>Scene</hi> and very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary? I confess, the <hi>Lady</hi> of the house being much out of countenance at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54133:25"/>
what had hapned, profered to excuse this disorder and I was as ready to receive it, till several encounters confirmed me, that they were but too frequent, and that there was a sort of perfect <hi>Debauchees,</hi> who stile themselves <hi>Hectors,</hi> that in their mad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of <hi>Revels,</hi> pierce their veins to quaff their own <hi>blood,</hi> which some of them have drank to that excess, that they died of the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance: These are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <hi>Atheistical</hi> order of <hi>Braves,</hi> compos'd for the most of <hi>Cadets,</hi> who spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond their <hi>pensions,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54133:26"/>
to supply their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, practise now and then the high-way, where they sometimes borrow that which they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay at the <hi>Gibbet;</hi> an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious trade, unheard of amongst our Gallant <hi>Noblesse;</hi> however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune reduce them. But I know not whether I might not here match these valiant <hi>Heroes</hi> with an avow'd society of <hi>Ladies,</hi> and some of them not of the meanest for birth (I even blush to recount it of that fair Sex) who boast of making all advantages at <hi>play,</hi> and are become so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54133:26"/>
dextrous at it, that seldome they make a sitting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out design and booty: For there is here, my Lord, no such thing as courtship af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the decent mode of our <hi>Circles;</hi> for either being mingled in a room, the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> separate from the conversation of the <hi>Ladies,</hi> to drink, as before I related; or else, to whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with one another at some corner or <hi>Bay-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> abandoning the <hi>Ladies</hi> to Goship by themselves, which is a custome so strange to a <hi>Gallant</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> as nothing appears more barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54133:27"/>
and this in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect must needs be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that those beautifull Creatures can so little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, that they want assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, address, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming discourse of our <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiseles,</hi> which are faculties so shining, and agreeable in their Sex with us in <hi>France</hi>: and in truth, even the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> themselves, are greatly defective as to this particular, ill Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, unplyant, morose and of vulgar address; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, not so polished, free and serene, as is universally found even amongst the most inferiour of our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54133:30"/>
the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> even of Family, that me thought I never beheld a ruder conversation; especially, when comparing their parts, and educations, I found them generally so much inferiour, as if a <hi>Lord</hi> were indeed other than a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> or a <hi>Gentleman</hi> not a fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for a <hi>King:</hi> But this must needs be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of an ill, and haughty institution, and for that most of these great persons are in their minority, and the age wherein they should be furnished with the noblest impressions,

taught onely to converse with their servants, some <hi>Sycophants,</hi> and under the regiment of a <hi>Pedant,</hi> which imprints that scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and folly, and fits them with no better forms when they should produce themselves, and give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to others as well of their superiority in vertue, as in birth and dignity. But this is my Lord a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which I have heard you often complain of, and which we do frequently take notice of at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad into our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; where for want of address, and fit persons to

               <hi>Gentlemen</hi> need seek no revenge; for though (as I told you) the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are most of them very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, yet the <hi>Proverb</hi> goes, <hi>As drunk as a Lord.</hi> But, my Lord, as there is no rule so generall, but it do's admit of exceptions, so should I give my own experience, as well as your Lordships the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make the censure universal; there being even amongst <hi>these,</hi> some <hi>sew,</hi> and in particlar my L. <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>N.</hi> &amp;c. whom I esteeme to be very noble, and accomplished persons, as who have learned (by

It was frequently, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the last <hi>Winter,</hi> that I was carried to their <hi>Balls,</hi> as where indeed I hoped to see what should appear the most of gallant and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did amongst the <hi>Ladies,</hi> nor really did my expectations deceive me; for there was a confluence of very great beauties, to which the glistring of their jewells, (which upon these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they want not) could add nothing save their <hi>weight;</hi> the various ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites being so particular, as if by some strange <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,</hi> they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countled, and come out of

when any of them were taken out, made me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ashamed to lead a <hi>Lady</hi> who did me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for fear (though my skill be very vulgar in that exercise) they should have taken <hi>me</hi> for a <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Master,</hi> as who had, happly imploy'd my youth so ill, as to have some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the rest in that faculty.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54133:34"/>
that were insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in <hi>France,</hi> where these trifling fellows do better know themselves, are worse payed, and less presumptuous.

            <p>When this Ceremony was ended, some of the <hi>Gallants</hi> fell to other <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,</hi> and as far as I understood, were offering

at that innocent, yet salt and pleasant diversion, which in <hi>France</hi> are called <hi>Ralliarie;</hi> but so far were they from maintaining it within the decencies, and Laws, which both in <hi>that,</hi> and our <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi>

in <hi>England,</hi> though it be free in all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; every <hi>Coach</hi> and <hi>Horse</hi> which enters, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mouthfull, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the <hi>Publicane,</hi> who has purchased it, for which the entrance is guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Porters</hi> and long Staves.</p>
            <p>The manner is, as the company returns, to alight at the <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> so called, and in order to the <hi>Parke,</hi> as our <hi>Thuilleries</hi> is to the <hi>Course;</hi> the inclosure not disagreable, for the sollemness of the Grove, the warbling of the Birds, and as it opens into the

jeast mens estates away, &amp; yet avow their avarice) that I have much admired at the temper of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and their remissenesse in reforming it: There was a young Person, whom at my being there, was very much cried up for his abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and in whom I did not observe that usuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, which I but now reproved; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it springs either for want of those abillities which the <hi>Municipall</hi> Lawes of this <hi>Nation</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting most of them in <hi>Customes</hi> like our <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> whose antient <hi>dialect</hi>

            <p>But what is infinitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable in this Country, are the <hi>Bowling-Greens,</hi> and the <hi>Races,</hi> which are really such pleasures abroad, as we have nothing approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them in <hi>France,</hi> and which I was extreamly delighted in; but the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure</hi> of the Country, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54133:39"/>
delicious <hi>Downes</hi> it is, which renders them this praeheminence, and indeed, it is to be valued, and doth in my esteeme, very much commute for the lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of that glorious <hi>Planet,</hi> which ripens our <hi>Vines</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>I have now but a word to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54133:40"/>
add, and that is the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Visits,</hi> which they make <hi>here</hi> so long, that it is a very tyranny to sit to so little purpose: If the Persons be of <hi>Ladys</hi> that are strangers, it is to look upon each other, as if they had never seen any of their own <hi>kina</hi> before; and here indeed the <hi>virtue</hi> of their <hi>Sex</hi> is eminent; for they are as silent and fixt as <hi>Statue's;</hi> Or if they do talk, it is with censure, and sufficient confidence: so difficult it is, to <hi>Entertaine</hi> with a grace, or to observe a mediocrity.</p>
            <p>In Summe, my <hi>Lord,</hi> I
