            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The first written Law giuen to the Elect people of God, being Ecclesiasticall binding the soule, was giuen into the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> a Leuite, but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners of men caused them to be extended to the punishment of the body: wherein as God reserued the Iudgement and inquisition to <hi>Moses,</hi> the execution was done by the hands of the people, not by the Leuites; Time perfected Sinne, Sinne seuerity: the people weary of the strict gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Samuel</hi> a Leuite, will haue a King though of the Tribe of <hi>Renia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> to <hi>iudge vs</hi> (say they) <hi>and to goe out before vs,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. But was this request against the ordinance of God? No, the Law of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> long before, gaue instruction for the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of King, and prescribed a Law to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9697:8"/>
the King, so that the Israelits sinned not in their request, but in the time of their request, not attending Gods leasure. Was the Ecclesiasticall Law abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now? No, the King must take the Law and reade it diligently from the hands of the Priest, in one and the same Chapter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Now that it is called <hi>Bands</hi> here, is in respect of that tye which the King hath vpon the People, bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his Lawes, not repugnant to Gods Law, for then they cease to be Lawes; and of him to the people, as you may read of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. which hee cals there, <hi>The Couenant betweene him and the people.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.
<hi>Samuel</hi> declareth to the people the duty of a Kingdome. So you see here was a King ouer the people aboue the Priest, but neyther Lawes abrogated, they being indeede the two hands of 2 King, which must defend and wash one another: though the wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9697:9"/>
them they are feet, the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lifted vp vnlesse the other be thrust downe, godly men will attend
<hi>Samuel</hi> home, though <hi>Saul</hi> be chosen aboue him: but they are branded for vvicked men that slighted the Ciuill Magistrate vvhen they had a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. Such men forget that <hi>Salomons</hi> Throne had Lyons on eyther side to support it, that our Kings carry a Crosse in one hand, as vvell as a Sword in the other. As the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry acknowledges all obedience to the temporall power, not as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his broode affirme, <hi>Virationis non Legis, sed virationis &amp; Legis,</hi> Both by the Law of God and humane reason: so likewise it is the duty of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Magistrate to rise vp to <hi>Nathan,</hi> as
<hi>Dauid</hi> did, to vphold the priuiledges of the Church, as good <hi>Constantine</hi> did; Not (saith hee) onely because I am sworne so to doe: but because I am sworne to that which the Law of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9697:9"/>
God commandeth. There are some that though they desire not to haue the gouernment of the Church whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguished, yet with <hi>Vzza</hi> they thinke it had neede of their help: others with the busie Bethshemites will be prying into the Arke, they will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, and looking into the defects of Church-gouernment, be it but to fill vp their discourse, hauing neither place nor purpose for the amending it: But the same God which struck <hi>Vzza</hi> dead for doing the first, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. will not let these escape more then he did the Bethshemites, of whom he destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fiftie thousand for presuming the last, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>There are a third Sect, and those are
<hi>puri quasi minime puri,</hi> the impuritans of our time, these neuer cease crying out to the Church, as the Diuell did vnto Christ, cast thy selfe downe, humble thy selfe before vs. The Church though rent and almost ruinde, is yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9697:10"/>
too glorious in their eies, it faring with these men as with those who standing vpon earth looke vp to lofty pinnacles, which still seeme to wauer and stand awry, when the defect is truly in their owne sight.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there is a fourth number which with <hi>Ammon</hi> hauing defiled their sister, would gladly expose her to the contempt of others: These men (with sacrilegious hands) hauing raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Church of her Lands and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, are the first that tell her when shee threatens them, A proud Beggar God hates. Surely, as <hi>Thamar</hi> said to <hi>Ammon,</hi> to say I to such in the behalfe of my dispised Mother: This last wickednesse is greater yet then the first, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.16. Let these and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these remember that it was the sinne of the Princes of <hi>Iuda,</hi> to take from the authority of the Priest, which the Lord compareth to the remouing of the Bounds, an act accursed in the

<hi>And I tooke vnto me two staues, the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands, and I fed the flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why are both Lawes Spirituall and Temporall called <hi>Staues</hi>; because they ought to haue these foure proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a staffe, to direct, to correct, to defend, to support. They must direct

all, correct the wicked, defend from the oppressor, support the oppressed: And that the stone may be hewed out and fitted to the line, <hi>Iethro</hi> placeth Iustice vpon a cube or square, painting out a good Iudge with foure answerable qualities, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Prouide</hi> (saith he to <hi>Moses</hi>) <hi>amongst all the people, able men</hi>: that is for direction, <hi>fearing God not men</hi>; that is for correction, <hi>dealing tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; that is for defence, <hi>hating couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>; that is for support.

The Poet I say presents a poore Client hauing feeed his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor to plead for the recouery of two hogs were taken from him, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor assures him it should be his first motion, and with all speed steps to the Barre, there he makes a long Oration so farre from the matter, that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Client, thinking he had forgot him and beene busied in other mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, cries out vnto him, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age de porcis;</hi> I beseech you now Sir remember my hogs. It stands vpon the Iudges to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this abuse, and vpon the Iury to beware of them: the Fencer when he dazels most, hits soonest; dost thou see him inueigh against the person of the accused or iustifie the accuser, let this plaister smell neuer so sweete it couers but a sore.

            <p>But to conclude, it is not sufficient to defend from the oppressor, but a good Iudge must support the oppressed, <hi>he must be a Father to the Fatherlesse, and a husband to their mother, Eccle.</hi> 4. So shalt thou be as the Sonne of the most high, thou must be speedy in dispaching

their causes, thou must looke they be not dishartned by the greedinesse of thy fees, or thy officers fees, God is thy pay-master, &amp; will be theirs; dispatch them before they cry, for their cry will reach as farre as Heauen, and God will come downe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. Now there are 4. crying sinnes expressed in this Distcik:
<q>
                  <l>Clamitat in celu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vox sanguinis &amp; Sodomoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</l>
                  <l>Vox oppressorum, merces retenta laborum:</l>
               </q>
And because the first two are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, of the third wee haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: I cannot forget to touch the fourth, which is the withholding the reward of the labourer, seeing hee is amongst the most oppressed, and it is your duty to support him: I neede not tell you that the faithfull Minister is a true laborer, a painefull watchman, 1.
<hi>Ez.</hi> 3. though it may be in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are not husbandmen as <hi>Paul</hi> cals them the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but Haruest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men known onely to their Parishioners when they come to gather their tithes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9697:22"/>
               <hi>tanquam stratonicles in auream messem,</hi> reaping where they doe not sowe, I shall not neede to tell you who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their wages, your Courts haue their names in black rowles, as God has them in his black booke, but I say you are to support them that haue their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges withholden, you are with <hi>Ezra</hi> to make hast in restoring the Church to her rights, to bestow trauell, nay and cost too for the rebuilding the Temple of the Lord, but alas our number of Brick is required at our hands, but the allowance of straw is taken away; nay, there is daily more Brick required, the poore Minister is forced to attend at the Assises and Sessions, to present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants at his owne cost abroad, who hath not wherewith to feede him at home, if this be not an oppression, I am sure it is to deuide the punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideratly as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance betweene <hi>Mephisbosheth</hi> and <hi>Ziba,</hi> a good man and a wicked, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>

19. <hi>Sanabimur si separemur a caetu</hi> saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> and I am sure it is Religious, seeing God hath put vs apart from the people, not to lay burdens vpon vs to impouerish vs to the contempt of the people, but I speake to the wise, lesse then a word is heere sufficient.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the wages of the poore soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is to be lookt vnto, a true laborer, that hath sweat his blood for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The sonne of <hi>Syrack</hi> in the 26. of
<hi>Eccle.</hi> 29. saith there are two things which grieued his heart: A man of war that suffered pouerty, and a man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that is not set by. They haue a rule in the Gospell to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their pay, but there is no law to see them miserable for want of pay, let vs not vse them as we doe our chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, creep to them in winter and stand aloofe from them in Summer. No let vs deale with them as wee doe with plants cherish and prune them in our spring, that wee freely may tast their

fruit in the fall, I note them as cares worthy your intertainment, Let <hi>Esau</hi> speake neuer so friendly, he hopes yet a day of mourning will come let vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent it by our Charity, by Iustice, by Prayers. But he that is wicked to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to whom can he be good: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this fourth property of support I adioined a fourth qualtitie in a Iudge to hate Couetousnesse, it is well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the Mountaines where gold growes beare neither grasse nor graine, hearb nor tree, so where the loue of the World couetousnesse raignes, there is no hope no expectation of support, let gold be interposed betweene God and the conscience of the Iudge once, like the earth betweene the Sun and the Moone, we shall haue an Ecclipse: But wherefore should I speake so much of the vices of Iudges? Surely Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to your exceeding great prais, <hi>Qui malos corrigit laudat bonos,</hi> he that inueighs against sin, extolles ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9697:23"/>
He that hath beene the least while a Iudge in this place, hauing left <hi>Iacobs</hi> stone in the highest Court of our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to witnesse the integrity of his conscience, that God I say hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, I speake it with great ioy, the chiefest in place of Iustice whom I haue beene so happy to know, haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded matter of reuerence to me, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiration; reuerence towards their vertues, admiration in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, who hath his <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> in <hi>Salem,</hi> his lot in <hi>Sodom.</hi> Be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, oh be truely thankefull to God beloued brethren, that he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held our sins with the eye of seuerity, sinne being the cause that in all ages he hath set ouer rebellious people, cruell and wicked gouernors, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. He hath not I say dealt with vs as he hath done with other Nations.</p>
            <p>The memory of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (as that of <hi>Iosias</hi>) is like the composition of the perfume that is made by the art of the
