            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are deſired to heare what's the beſt Newes in the <hi>middle Region.</hi> I had lately the honour to meet with one of the <hi>Secretaries of Art and Nature,</hi> who aſſured mee that there was pretty ſport at <hi>Oxford.</hi> There are ſome Right Worthy Doctors who are ſick of the <hi>Kings-Evill,</hi> but dare not goe to <hi>Holden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> to bee cured; for though they ſay the Kings hand works more Miracles ſince this <hi>Truce,</hi> then it did all the time of the warres; yet he cures none but ſuch as are <hi>willing</hi> to be cured. It is obſerved by ſome, that there is moſt <hi>ſpirituall</hi> wickedneſſe in <hi>All-Soules</hi> at Oxford. Upon the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> divers ſubtlle Doctors had a meeting very late at night at Dr. <hi>Sheldens</hi> Lodging, to try whether they could <hi>out-plot</hi> thoſe, whom they could not <hi>out-pray</hi> upon the 26. of <hi>May,</hi> being our Monethly Faſt. On Thursday the 27. they met at Dr. <hi>Fell's</hi> houſe the pretended Vice-Chancellor, or Deputy of Marqueſſe <hi>Hertford;</hi> and on Friday the 28. of <hi>May,</hi> being the laſt Friday of the moneth, the <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants common Faſting-day,</hi> (a day ſtrictly obſerved as I hear at Chriſt-Church in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the Dean, Sub-Deane, and Canons) they ealled a Veſtrie,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114196:3"/>
that they might chooſe out ſome bold Delegates to oppoſe the Viſitors (who are to meet <hi>Iune</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>) and hinder a Reformation. But it ſeemes they could not worke Miracles upon that Faſting-day; and therefore they adjourned to the 31. of <hi>May,</hi> an happy ſeaſon, for then they unanimouſly agreed to call a Convocation, which they did upon the firſt of <hi>Iune;</hi> and being aſſembled, Dr. <hi>Fell</hi> made a Speech without <hi>Feare</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi> in which hee called thoſe that took the Covenant, <hi>perfidious</hi> perſons &amp; <hi>Traitors.</hi> Upon a ſad debate it was agreed, that certaine Reaſons, (called <hi>just Scruples)</hi> ſhould bee tendred to juſtifie ſuch as refuſe to take the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant, and the Negative Oath.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were not communicated then, for they were not ſo much as read in the Convocation Houſe; but they were received with an implicite faith; and if any man would queſtion the fidelity or wiſedome of Dr. <hi>Shelden,</hi> and the reſt, he was to have ſatisfaction in his private College; and yet (as I am informed) in their private Colleges the heads doe onely uſe it for the ſtrengthning and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> of their owne party againſt the Covenant, &amp; <hi>corrupting</hi> of ſome Youths, that are not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between <hi>Pretences</hi> and <hi>Arguments;</hi> For at Trinity College, Mr. <hi>Vnet</hi> Fellow of the Houſe could not obtaine a ſight of the reaſons. <hi>Haniball (P.)</hi> was not ſo great an enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge the ſecrets of the Conclave to Mr. <hi>Vnet,</hi> a knowne friend to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The grand Deſigne is to unite the whole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in a body that they may joyne together as <hi>one</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You may take notice that the firſt ſcruple (in the New Scruple-Houſe erected at <hi>Oxford, Iune</hi> 1) is this, Whether the Houſe of Commons ſhould be owned and acknowledged as a Parliamentary Houſe? the reaſon whiſpered is, becauſe there are ſo many new Members choſen in by vertue of the new Great-Seale without his Majeſties coment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114196:4"/>
This deſigne is ſmoothly carried, yet ſufficiently diſcovered, and almoſt confeſſed by that deliberate and adviſed omiſſion in their Preface to their other Juſt Scruples; the words run thus.</p>
            <p>Whereas by an Ordinance of the Lords aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <note place="margin">Obſerve that have a no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons.</note> in Parliament for the Viſitation and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, Power is given to certaine Perſons therein named, to inquire concerning thoſe of the ſaid U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, that neglect to take the Solemne League and Covenant, and the Negative Oath, being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto them, and likewiſe concerning thoſe that oppoſe the execution of the Ordinances of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament concerning the Diſcipline and Directory, or ſhall not promote or cauſe the ſame to be put in execution according to their ſeverall places and callings. Wee the Maſters, Schollars, and other Officers of the ſaid Univerſity (not to judge the Conſciences of others, but) to cleare our ſelves before God and the World, from all ſuſpition of obſtinacy, whileſt we diſcharge our owne, preſent to conſideration the true reaſons of our preſent judgement concerning the ſaid Covenant, Oath and Ordinances, expecting ſo much Juſtice, and hoping for ſo much Charity, as either not to bee preſſed to conforme to what is required in any of the premiſſes, farther then our <hi>preſent</hi> Judgement will warrant us, or not condemned for the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo to doe, without cleare and reall <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> given to our <hi>Iuſt Scruples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is juſt Judge <hi>Ienkins,</hi> the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt not bee acknowledged for one of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114196:4"/>
Houſes of Parliament, ſo that the learned Dr. <hi>Shelden</hi> and Judge <hi>Ienkins</hi> are entred into a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy againſt the Houſe of Commons, the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Both Houſes of Parliament; and therefore it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy againſt the Lords alſo. They inſiſt not much upon the Introductory Preface to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; they pretend that they are not able to ſay, that the rage, power, and preſumption of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God (in the ſenſe therein intended) is at this time increaſed, whereas their preſent confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the Houſe of Commons makes it moſt cleare and evident: never did the Enemies of God rage more furiouſly in <hi>Oxford,</hi> then now they doe.</p>
            <p>Nay, they are ſo high and gallant, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they will not bee ſatisfied, although the Covenant ſhould not be impoſed upon them at all, for if it be but onely recommended to them and then left to their choice, yet being ſubjects they cannot of their owne <hi>Free-will</hi> enter into any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant wherein his Majeſty is concern'd without his conſent, it being in his power by the equity of the Law, <hi>Nugmb.</hi> 30. to anull ſuch a League as ſoon as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is contrary to the Proclamation the 9 of <hi>October</hi> 19 <hi>Caroll,</hi> and they are obliged by their naturall Allegiance to obey all commands of his Majeſtie, which are not in their apprehenſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the will of God, or the poſitive Lawes of the Kingdome: From whence it will follow, that one Proclamation of the Kings is ground ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them to oppoſe all Orders and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114196:5"/>
of Parliament; whereas I was ſuch a foole to conceive, that upon the ſurrender of <hi>Oxford</hi> they did agree to ſubmit to all Orders and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament, or leave the Kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 6 moneths: they may be fully aſſured that the Parliament will not permit them to ſtay here, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Rebell.</p>

               <p>Or at leaſt, That Epiſcopall Ariſtocracy hath a fairer pretenſion, and may lay a juſter title and claime to a Divine Inſtitution, then any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Formes of Church-Government can doe, all which yet doe pretend thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Papall Monarchy, that of the Presbyterian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy <hi>(Ariſtrocracy</hi> they ſhould have ſaid) and that of the Independents by particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or gathered Churches.</p>
               <p>Moreover, They are aſſured by the undoubted teſtimony of ancient Records and latter Hiſtories, that Prelacy hath been continued with ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, Uninterrupted, Unqueſtioned Succeſſion of all the Churches of God, and in all Kingdomes that have beene called Chriſtian throughout the whole world for 1500 yeares together, that there never was any conſiderable oppoſition made there againſt. What they may prove by latter Hiſtories I know not, but ſure I am, it is a folly to cite late Hiſtories, to prove what was done 1500 yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and I am moſt ſure, that all the Prelates and their adherents in <hi>England,</hi> can never prove, that ſuch a Prelacy as we deſire to extirpate, hath been for 1500 yeares eſtabliſhed in all the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But their trueſt reaſon and ſaddeſt ſcruple, is this that followes:</p>

                  <hi>Wee doe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Some of us hold our liveli-hood, either in whole or in part, by thoſe Titles of Deanes, Deanes and Chapters, &amp;c. mentioned in the Articles, being members of ſome Collegiate and Cathedrall Churches.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>If they had put this formoſt I ſhould have been ſooner ſatisfied, but I muſt break off being called to other ſervice; you may have more hereafter if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie permit: In the meane time, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how much the Houſe of Commons is ſlighted, as if not worthy to be named, in their Preface: 2. How groſſely they abuſe the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Citie of <hi>London:</hi> 3. How they combine againſt all Presbyterians and Independents, that is, againſt all the friends of the Parliament: 4. How they declare all that have taken the Covenant, Lords and Commons, to be perjured perſons, men that have ſhaken off their Allegiance, and renownced the Kings Supremacy: 5. (They ſay) what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit; <hi>That if wee receive not prelacy upon the grounds they offer, the judgement and practice of the vniverſall Church, we ſhall be at a loſse in ſundry points both of</hi> faith and manners <hi>at this day firmely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſecurely practiſed by us, when by the Socinians, Anabaptists and other Sectaries, we are called upon for our proofes: as namely, ſundry Orthodoxall Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the Trinitie and Co-equalitie of the perſons in the Godhead, againſt the Ari<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the obſervation of the Lords Day, and even the Canon of Scripture it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſtay, may not the Scripture be ſufficiently known by its own majeſtie, light and glory, by the teſtimony of the Spirit, ſpeaking in the Word to our hearts and conferences? And are not the Scriptures perfect, and therefore ſufficient for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and correction without Eccleſiaſticall Traditions? And are not all thoſe Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and other Learned men who have taken the Covenant, able to refute Socinians, Papiſts, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, Anabaptiſts, without the helpe of the Prelaticall partie? If they be not, wee will ſend to Doctor <hi>Shelden</hi> and Judge <hi>Ienkin</hi> for their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. So much for the <hi>Oxonian Ienkiniſme.</hi>
