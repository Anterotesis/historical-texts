            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>One evident cause of all that gross ignorance and error, ethat wretched prophaneness and licenciousness, that
<pb facs="tcp:98032:3"/>
wild Fanaticisme, as well in practice as opinion, which is now every where too visible, is the want of good and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instruction in the first principles of our Religion. Where youth is suffered to grow up in ignorance, no better can be expected, but that it run into dotage at last. If the Foundation be either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, or fals-laid, it can be no wonder to see the Superstructure shaken, or blown down.</p>
            <p>The truth is, it is but too easy to shew, that all those unhappy divisions and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, which have ben of late, and yet are amongst us in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have Sprung, if not only, yet in great part, from the neglect or abuse of that prime duty of Catachizing. But I am not willing to draw out this Epistle into an unreasonable length by inlarging upon this subject. Insteed of that, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly exhort you, as you value the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, the peace of the Church, and the eternal happiness of your own Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:98032:4"/>1. <hi>Be not wise in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,</hi> take heed of that Spiritual pride whereby men are so apt to swell and grow great in their own eyes, and much above these low ways of learning.</p>
            <p>If any man despise these little helps, it is but reasonable he should make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he needs them not, and when he shall do so, I will promise him, I will not trouble him any longer with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let not your children or servants perish for want of that instruction, whereof you presume your selves to have no need. It is not your fulness can keep them from starving. Suffer them to be led by the hand, till they get more strength.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Neither is he that Planteth any thing, nor he that Watereth, but God that giveth the increase, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. and worketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. opening our hearts to attend to the things that are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. and giving us the spirit of Wisdome in the knowledge of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18.</p>

                  <item>1. I see that, in most things which are not plain to sense, it is a very rare thing to find many men of one opinion; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all they, who differ most from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that in very weighty matters of Religion, do unanimously agree in this, that there is a God.</item>

                  <item>4. The wicked, and worst, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the most of men, could never find any reason to believe there is no God: but, though they could heartily wish there were none, because the very thoughts of him are troublesome, disturbing their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and their wicked designs, with fear
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98032:45"/>
of him; yet do they feel him in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences whether they will or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. They who have denyed a God, are but a very few, and so wicked, that the world hath been weary of them, and they could hardly perswade the world they were in earnest; but rather that their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives did perswade them to wish there were no God, than that any reason did convince them to believe so: Yea, all they can say, shews only, that at most they are in doubt, and phancy for a time (to still their troublesome consciences) some possibility that there may be no God, whilst they can neither make it certain to themselves, nor so much as probable to others, who would fainest have it so, that there is none. Seeing then that the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mankind, even the most, the wisest, and the best, believe it; and a very few only of the very worst, do rather wish than say, or only say, but cannot prove, that there is no God: I have no reason yet to think all men in the world ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fools in believing, or knaves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a lie; but only these very few, whom no man hath cause to account much better.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If any man shall now say, that this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal belief, is only grounded on some
<pb facs="tcp:98032:45"/>
blind Tradition, which some crafty Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that he might keep the silly world in awe: I ask, who made him so wise as to know that which for so many thousand years now past, no man hath been able to discover? When began this Tradition? When was it not? Who set it first on foot? was it never discovered to be so till now? How doth it now appear that it is so? Did all men before, believe there is no God? And is it then a likely thing that all men, even the wisest, should beat first tamely caught, and ever after blindly led by a bare hear-say, and that in a matter of such universal, and eternal concernment to all mankind? By what means did he bring all men to believe him? Did he by force compel them to it? What mighty man was he that could thus over awe the world? How sewed up their lips, that no man could tell this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble story? How came it to pass, that when this force abated, men returned not to their old unbelief? Or did he move men by reason to believe him? They must needs be very weighty reasons that could perswade all men to come off from their old unbelief, and to embrace a belief that they saw would fill their minds with fear,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98032:46"/>
and awe, and put a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rb upon their carnal wills, and restrain their beloved Lusts, and set a bar to their worldly Interests, and stop up the current of their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and abridge them at once of all their wonted liberties. If they were not strong and powerful reasons that could do all this, which certainly must be very hard to do, then why hath not the Atheist all this while, out of love to his supposed truth, with his better reasons, perswaded the world to that which must needs seem far easier, considering mens corruptions, generally to cast off the belief of God? But if they were good reasons, as they must needs be which makes so proud a thing as man, to own a God above him; then is it reasonable to believe a God. But what design had this politick man in all this? Did he pretend he had his Laws from God, and by that device perswade men to submit to them? If he himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved no God, 'tis hard to think what hopes he should conceive, that those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which could not perswade himself, might prevail with all others: besides, if this was his design, it doth not seem to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor much of policy, to perswade men in love with liberty, to put their necks into

               </gap>f a God whom they knew not, or of Religion which they loved not: Again, the wiser sort might well be supposed as politick as he, and not easie to be gulled out of their liberrty; and the more simple are rather apt to suspect than believe all that Politicians commend unto them. Lastly, Did he pretend the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal good of all mankind, and rationally convince men that the belief of a God that governeth, and shall judge the world is the onely thing that preserves good order in the world? if so, then tell me, did he say the truth, or did he lie in saying there is a God? If he said truly, then is it a truth, and to be believed: If it was a lie, then is it for the good of the whole world, and therefore a duty, to believe a lie, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a truth: For if it be a lie to say, there is a God, then is a lie the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pillar of all goodness and virtue, peace and order, faithfulness and honesty among men: And if it be true to say, there is no God; then is a truth the Foundation of all wickedness, disorder and mischief. And who but the Atheist, who can believe any thing but a God, will be perswaded to believe this.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth for the beauty of the whole, and for the particular use and office to what it serves: what strange powers, and faculties of Soul I have, and how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the workings of imagination, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and reason within me, and the like: I must needs think whence I should have these things. I am sure, I did not thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them my self, and there was a time when I had none of them, and when I was not what now I am; and therefore I must needs have both my being, and all that is in me from some others. Who should this other be? My Parents, and theirs before them, might say the very same of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that I now do; and they could not make me what I am: they could not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly promise themselves a Child, they knew not how I was formed in the Womb, how my parts or members were set toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor took they any care to order them; when I was conceived, they could not tell whether I should be a Man or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Monster, perfect or imperfect, a

Wise man or a Fool, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nor yet whether I should be born, or live when born. No Man understandeth half the wonders of himself, how he is nourished, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and seeth, and heareth, and thinketh, and dreameth; no, not so much as how his hairs and nails came to be what they are. What then can I think, but that I am the work of one, who is wonderful in power, and wisdom, and goodness, who made both me and all Men, even God?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Now that I am, I find that I am not in my own power; I cannot bring about all my own designs and purposes as I would; I cannot supply my own wants and imperfections, nor continue to my self all my enjoyments and comforts; I cannot make my food nourish my Body, nor keep my Body from Sickness or pain, nor make that part straight which is crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or beautiful which is deformed; I cannot keep out fears, nor rule my thoughts, nor hinder casualties, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long my Life, nor prevent my Death and Corruption: I am therefore in the power, at the disposal, and under the Providence of another, by whom I am preserved and governed, that is, God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For ought that I can perceive,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98032:48"/>
(and we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n from what we can perceive, and not from what we cannot) Man is the most perfect and Noble of all things here below. Man hath Life, and motion, and sense, and choice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and reason, and discourse; whereas of other things, some want all, and all want some of these: yea, in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, all these things were designed for the use and benefit of Man, for they are fitted for his use, and he can, and doth upon occasion use them, and we see no other use of many of them: I cannot therefore believe that Man was made by any of them, and I am sure Man did not make them; but both they and Man were made by some other: for if Man be not of himself, nor in his own power, but governed by another; much less are those things which appear subject and inferior to Man, of themselves, or in their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but rather are all governed by God the Maker of all.</p>
            <p>Lastly, All things are, and work for some end and purpose, even things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding, or sense, or life, work, as it were, by a certain Rule, and that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly for the preservation of themselves, and the common good of the World, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98032:49"/>
especially of Man. The Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies orderly and duly shed abroad their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Light and heat, to make the Earth fruitful, and direct, and cherish man and beast: the Earth yields her Fruits in due season for the nourishment of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and without the Orderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of the Earth or Heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that Light and warmth would not be equally distributed to the several parts of the Earth, and Summer, and Winter, and Spring, and Harvest, and day and night would not keep their right course, If the Waters did not contentedly keep within their own banks and Channels, the Earth would be drowned, and except Vapours did go up, and gather into Clouds, and come down in seasonable showers, the Earth would be barren, and Man and Beast would perish. We see how all living Creatures do propagate for the upholding of their kind; and how Plants bring Seed to the same end, and that Seed scattered in the Earth furnisheth us with a new stock of Plants. We see how living Creatures are Armed with Natural weapons for their own defence, and on occasion use them, and those that have none, have either wit and ability to make for their own use, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98032:49"/>
Men; or have fli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ht of wing, as Fowls; or speed of foot, as Hares, &amp;c. or are fitted to make themselves hiding places, as Moles and Worms, &amp;c. We see how that young things so soon as fallen from their Dams, seek their food; the little Infant when it knows nothing, naturally seeks the Pap, and Sucks, which it can hardly be taught to do after it is weaned, and needs it not. A thousand such things I cannot but observe, which shew that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hath it's being for some end, and Naturally works for that end, and yet many of them neither know that end, nor how they work: what then can I imagine, but that there is some Almighty, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power, or God, who wisely made, and doth still direct all things for, and to their several ends and uses.</p>
            <p>If any Man shall now again say, that it is possible all things might be as they are without a God: I ask, how doth he know that this is possible? If he know it not, why doth he say it is? And if he know it, why is he not so kind to shew us how it may be? But suppose it be possible, that things might be without a God; is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reasonable for me to think that things are not from God, onely because 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98032:50"/>
they might be otherwise, whilst I find great probabilities to perswade that they are from God? Must I therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I had no Father, because 'tis possible I might be without a Father, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some body may possibly say, it may be I had none; when as I cannot conceive, nor can he shew me any reason why I should think I had none; yea, whereas I see that all Men generally have Fathers, and there is one whom I call Father, and of whom all that know me have ever told me that he is my Father, and the features of my Face, and other resemblances of him in me make it likely enough that he is my Father; and I have found cause to believe by the Portion and Estate is given me, that (though he might be dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was born, and so I never saw him) there was one who own'd me for his Child, and loved me, and cared, and provided for me? The whole World of Men wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that there is a God, the whole course of Nature, and the special tokens in my self, make it highly reasonable for me to be believe a God; and shall I now not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, because one man or two are bold to tell me, it may be that there is none; certainly I must believe that which is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98032:50"/>
reasonable, rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er than that which at most is but possible, and I cannot conceive so much as possible neither.</p>
            <p>If it here be said, that God is said to be an Eternal and Infinite being, and that no Man can possibly comprehend such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore how can any Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which is incomprehensible? I must say, that 'tis true, what is eternal and infinite, is also, as such, incomprehensible, for fully to comprehend it, were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to have bounds and limits, which if it had, it were not eternal nor infinite; yet though I cannot comprehend fully the eternity and infiniteness of God, I may believe there is a God, who is Eternal and Infinite, for this is no more than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a Being, that hath greater perfections than I can understand; and it is so easie for me to believe this, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe it, for I cannot but believe that there is a being that hath greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections than man, because I cannot but believe there is one who gave to man all his perfections: and I am sure that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand all the perfections that be in Man, nor in any thing else, and therefore much less can I understand all the perfections of him who made man: I must therefore needs believe there is one
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98032:51"/>
of such perfections as I cannot understand. Yea, it is most certain that all men know so much of Eternity and Infinity, that they must confess that something is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, without beginning; and something infinite, without bounds; whether they will or no. It cannot be truly said, that once there was nothing, for then nothing could ever have been; because where there was nothing, there could be no power or inclination to any thing, nothing to make or produce any thing: but now we see many things, even a World. Say then, had the World a beginning, or had it none? If it had a beginning, was it made by it self, or by some other? It did not make it self, for before it was made, it was not; and when it was not it could do nothing. If it was made by some other, then was that other before it, and is the same who made all things, God. If the World had no beginning, then was it eternal: So we must grant an eternal Being, an eternal World, or an eternal God. And if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be eternal, something is infinite, for eternal hath no bounds of duration. If it be then impossible to conceive that once there was nothing, and then many things began to be without a Maker; then is it impossible not to believe, and therefore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98032:51"/>
easie to believe something eternal. Is it not then for me more reasonable to believe an eternal God, who cannot be God if he be not eternal, than for another to believe an eternal World, which may be a world, and not eternal? Seeing then all must grant that something is eternal, I have no reason not to believe a God, onely because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend eternity.</p>
            <p>I ask once more, how came Man to be? Every man can say, I was begotten by a Father, and so was my Father, and his before him, and so I must go on, either without end, or I must stop at some man, who was first of all men. If I go on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, and suppose that no Man was first of all, then must I grant an infinite Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Men one after another, and that there hath been already an infinite number of men, and that this infinite number of Men may yet be greater, and so one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite may be greater than another, and the same number infinite and not infinite: and these things are surely incomprehensible, and if I must be forced to grant something incomprehensible, why should I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an incomprehensible God? Is it not easier for me to conceive an eternal God, who first made man, then an eternal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of short-lived men dropping into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98032:52"/>
the World one after another, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vanishing again? If I stop at some first man, did that man once begin to be, or did he not? If not, then have we found an eternal being, an eternal man: and shall it be more reasonable to believe an eternal man, when we now see all men have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and are Mortal, then an eternal God, who must be eternal if he be God? Why did that eternal Man leave Children so unlike himself, of so short a Life? Or what is now become of him? If he was eternally, he had eternally a power to be, and live, and did chuse to dye, and be no more, and not leave the least notice to the World that ever he was? Did that first man begin to be? He gave not his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to himself, for before he began to be, he was not: he had it from no other man, for he was the first man: did he spring out of the Earth? Shew what power the Earth had to prodcue so noble a Creature; and if it had that power, did it spend it all at once, that it should never before or since bring forth another man, or any thing like him? I know men may dream of strange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The content of the whole World per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades me that it is at least a very great unadvisedness and arrogance, hastily to dis-believe a God; the whole frame and order of Nature convince me, that it is very reasonable and highly satisfactory to the mind of man to believe there is a God; but far greater satisfaction yet a man may receive from those clearer evidences which God hath given to the World of himself, in Prophesies and Miracles. Let a Man therefore thus reason with himself.</p>
            <p>First, Things have been fore-told, many hundred years before they came to pass; and these things have come to pass exactly in all circumstances of time, place, and manner, as they were fore-told. For my own part, I know, that I cannot tell what shall be to Morrow, or the very next hour; and others who have ventured to fore-tell such things, have miserably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool'd both themselves, and all that gave
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98032:53"/>
credit to them: onely those few who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that they came from God, and gave sufficient evidence to the world that they spake by God's Command, have been so happy as to gain credit to the God from whom they came, as the true God, and to themselves as his true Prophets, by a timely and evident fulfilling of those things which they did foretel. Now seeing, that there have been men who have foretold the the things which afterwards came to pass in all circumstances as they were fore-told; and such things as did not depend upon the constant course of Nature, and such as no man else could foresee; and seeing that these men did profess they knew not these things by their own Art or Study, nor by any natural means, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the revelation which they had from God; and seeing it is unconceivable how any should know such things but he alone who governs and orders all things; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe there is a God, who sent these men, and spake by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Works have been done, which not only exceed the power of man to do, but are clearly above the power, and against the course of nature; these are truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Miracles, wonderful works. The Fire
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98032:53"/>
hath refused to burn them that were cast into it, the Waters have stood up like Walls on each hand, whilst men have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed dry-foot through the midst of them; the Sun hath been made to stand still for a time, and the dead have been raised to life with a word: these, and the like things I am sure man hath of himself no power to do, nor can any man imagin by whom they could be done, but by him alone who hath the command of nature. These things were done by men onely, who said they came from God, and to witness to the world that they said truly, and all to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the world to acknowledge God, to fear, worship, and obey him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but believe that there is a God who sent these men, and wrought by them.</p>
            <p>If any man now ask, how we know there have been such things as these, he will receive a fuller answer in that which now follows, to shew what reason we have to believe the Scriptures to be true, wherein these things are recorded.</p>
            <p>It is very reasonable to believe, that (if there be a God) he expects some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and duty from us; and because we can of our selves but guess, at most, what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98032:54"/>
duties they be which we are to pay unto him, and so may be mistaken; it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet very reasonable to believe that God hath given us some notice of his will and pleasure, and some rule to direct us how we may acceptably serve and honour him: and that he should therein make known unto us so much of himself, as may beget in us an honuorable esteem, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend thoughts of his Majesty; and so much of his works, as to convince us that we came from him, and do depend upon him; and so much of his goodness and bounty as may encourage us to serve him cheerfully; and lastly, such demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his truth, as may satisfie us that all this is real, and no guile or deceit in it. The reasonableness of believing this, upon supposition onely that there is a God, will make it still more reasonable to believe there is a God, when we see that there is something, which men do receive and own, as a rule sent from God to teach us how we are to honour him, and that it hath all those things in it, which we suppose it reasonable that such a Rule should have.</p>
            <p>Now we have in our hands a book, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the</hi> Bible or book, and <hi>the</hi> Scripture or Writing, by way of excellency: and it is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98032:54"/>
believed that in this Book we have the Word of God, whereby he hath revealed himself and his will unto us; to teach us both what we are to believe, and what we are to do, and what we are to hope for. That then which we are now to be satisfied in, is, how it appears that this Book doth indeed contain the Word of God. Now this Book being made up of two parts, the Old, and the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Writers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bearing witness to the Writers of the Old Testament, that they came from God; it will certainly follow, that if the Writings of the New Testament be true, and from God, the Writings of the Old are so too: Therefore a man need do no more but satisfie himself in the truth, and Divine Authority of the New Testament. And here let a man thus reason with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I see that we have these Books, and I see whose names they bear, I see that the men who writ these Books pretend that they spake from God, and that we ought to receive these books as the Word of God; and a great part of the world doth receive them as such. Now that such men once were in the world, and that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98032:55"/>
these books were indeed written by them, I have as much reason to believe as the matter will bear, that is, as much as I can have to believe any thing that was done before I was born; and no man can expect more. I find that the Histories which are generally received throughout the world do make mention of them, and do record the many oppositions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions which they met with in the world, because of what they preached and writ. And of these that witness of them, some indeed are Friends, such as believe what they write, and build their Salvation upon it, and therefore would certainly take what pains they could to be well informed of the truth of it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be supposed (being many of them the learnedst men in the world) to have taken meerly on trust a thing which they thought of such everlasting concernment to all the world, that they feared not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he most barbarous Torments and Deaths, but chearfully suffered all in defence of it: Others are Enemies, such as believe not what is written, but yet witness that there were such men, and that thus they writ, and themselves write against the things here written. Seeing then that we have the

               </gap>nies of Friends and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in all ages since these men lived and wrote, and that now their Writings have been received, and to the death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, by a great, and that the most civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, learned, and wisest, part of the world, for neer upon seventeen hundred years; if I do not believe that such men there were, and that such things they wrote, I can believe no History, nor any thing which was, or was done before I was, or that I have not seen: and this certainly were most absurd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I find that these men who writ these Books do tell us in them, that there was one then in the world called Jesus Christ, and he was the Son of God, and came forth from God to teach men the true knowledge of God; and that they were his Disciples, Scholars and Followers, and were taught by him, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; and were sent forth by him, with command to preach what he had taught them, to the world; and that this is God's Word which they have left us in these Books. If then these men speak the truth, then is this God's Word. All then that I am now to be satisfied in, is, what reason I have to believe that these men spake the truth.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98032:56"/>3. That these men spake truth, and writ the truth, and nothing else, I shall have reason to believe, If I can find that they had all opportunities of knowing the truth of what they writ; and that they have given sufficient testimony of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and fidelity in writing only what they knew.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they had all the opportunities of knowing the truth of what they writ, I cannot doubt, when I consider that most of them were constantly with Jesus Christ, and instructed by him: and that all they write is either a relation of the deeds of Christ, whereof they were eye-witnesses; or of such deeds whereof themselves were actors; or else such Doctrines as Christ taught them, and they received from his mouth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they have given sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their fidelity and honesty in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering unto us nothing but the truth which they knew; I cannot but believe when I consider these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In some of the chief matters of fact which they relate, which seem of all others most incredible; and which, if once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, will certainly give credit to all they say; as the Death and Burial, and

            <p n="2">2. It cannot be conceived what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they could propose unto themselves in delivering such an untruth to the world: for they could not but foresee that they were to preach a Doctrine which the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wise-men of the world would scorn and deride, as a thing incredible to their reason, and contrary to the Principles which their admired Philosopy was built upon: a Doctrine contrary to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions then professed by the men of the world, and for which they were most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and all the powers of the world did own and countenance; and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, would with the Sword endeavour to uphold. Yea they found themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed derided and persecuted, exposed to hunger and thirst, and watchings, and stripes, and bonds, and death; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly endured all sufferings, and shame for the Doctrine's sake which they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they could not then propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves worldly wealth, or honors, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98032:57"/>
in what they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor is it reasonable to think they did it meerly to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves an empty name hereby; for besides that, they were made a laughing-stock both to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reguarded it: it is not usual for men of their breeding, and mean way of living, to be so ambitiously greedy of a bare name, as to forgo their whole livelyhoods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all miseries, and lay down their lives to purchase it: yea both their Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Doctrines did all along con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and shew they were not tainted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with falsehood, or ambition. Did they then believe themselves what they spake and writ, or did they not? If they did not believe it, then did they for the sake of an known, and unprofitable lie, forsake all that was good and profitable to them in this world, whilst they had no hopes of another world, and so must needs be perfectly mad: but they were no mad men, their own writings do abundantly witness for them. If they did believe what they writ, to be true, and had all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of knowing the truth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> it; then sure we have all reason to believe them honest and plain-dealing men, and to embrane the Truth which they have left us.</p>
            <p>I consider once more, that they were men so unblameable in their Lives, that the very worst their enemies could say of them, was, that they were a company of plain, simple, and unlearned men: If so, then is it still more unlikely that they should of their own brains invent such a Religion, as so great and learned a part of mankind hath now so long a time embraced as the wisest and the best, and which all must grant did require more than a Fools head to invent it. Again, if these men had an ambition onely to be the Founders of a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then either they had real hopes that the world would accept of it, or they had none: It cannot be thought they had no such hope, for who would suffer what they did to promote that which they did not hope would prevail? And if they had any such hope, whence did it arise? They could not hope that all the mighty Princes, and great Scholars of the world, and men bred and born and zealous in other Religions, would easily be led into a new one by a few poor, inconsiderable, unlearned men:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98032:58"/>
nay, if they hoped by their own Authority and credit to impose this new Religion on men, why were they so free in discovering their own meanness, and what's more, their own failings and infirmities, which sure must needs prejudice men from receiving it onely upon their commendation of it. Or did they hope that the Doctrine would commend it self, and so venture it to be tryed onely by it's apparent purity and goodness? Then was this plain-dealing and honesty; and if men embraced it for this, then is it truly such, and indeed we cannot imagine but that which is received by so great a part of Mankind, and yet is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Religions to which men were before wedded, and so cross to the designs of worldly, ambitious, and voluptuous men, who are usually both the greatest and mightiest part of mankind, must needs have some more than ordinary apparent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in it, and power manifestly going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it; and so we find still more and more reason to believe it.</p>
            <p>Will any man yet say, that perhaps these few well-meaning honest men were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (as such men are apt to be) by the craft of him whom they followed? What colour of reason hath any man to suspect
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98032:58"/>
this? First, the works he did were such as they saw, and not onely they, but his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were convinced they were real. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, those works were enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that what he taught them was nothing but the very truth.</p>
            <p>First, that wonderful works were wrought by Jesus Christ and his followers, they who are no Friends to either, but Enemies, do witness. Neither can any man perswade himself, that the writers of Scriptures durst have published these things to the World at that time, when there were so many men alive, who would have disproved them, and declared them lyars, and marred their whole design and credit, if they had been false. They tell us not of things done in a corner, where others could not see, but in the streets and Market-places, and publick Assemblies, and in the presence of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, who had seen and tasted of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the works done were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove the Doctrine taught to be of God. 1. They were professedly done to that end that men might believe it was from God; and therefore it must be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were such as were fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such a belief, for if they had not been such as men must reasonably think they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98032:59"/>
were done by the power of God only, there could be no hopes the Doctrine would be believed to come from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of them. 2. That they were such as did truly manifest a divine power, the works themselves are enough to convince us. For who but God, or they with whom God wrought, could make the blind to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, a few loaves to satisfie, and much more than sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, many thousands? Who could raise the dead to life again, command sicknesses to depart, the winds to cease, the Seas to be calm, the Devils to be gone? Who could raise himself from the dead, and go up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven in the sight of Men, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the thoughts of men's hearts, and such like wonderful works as the world saw done by Jesus Christ and his followers, but by the power of an Almighty God? Was not all this enough to convince men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that these men came from God, and spake from God?</p>
            <p>Lastly, If after all this it shall appear that the things which are written in these books, are such things as do well become the Majesty and wisdome, and goodness of God to make known, and fit for man, on supposition that there be a God, to know;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98032:59"/>
what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re can be thought requisite to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any reasonable man, both that there is a God, and that these books contain his word? Now that the things are truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and fit for man to know, he cannot chuse but confess that reads and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands them; they being such as all men must acknowledge, are apt to beget in man, a due and honourable esteem, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent thoughts of God; setting him forth before our eyes as the alone maker, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and governour of all things; glorious in incomprehensible Majesty, infinite in power and wisdom, and holiness, and knowledge, and justice, and goodness: shewing us our dependence on him, and his Providence over us, and how that in his goodness and bounty consists our Life, his Will is our Law, his favour our onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and his displeasure our destruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These Books shew us how good God was to us at first in making us with immortal Souls, and beautiful Bodies, and providing all things necessary for the good of both; and in giving us the command and use of other Creatures; and how man fell by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying God from that good and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table estate, into all manner of misery, the severe judgments of God on those who
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98032:60"/>
stubbornly continue in their Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and the wonderful courses that God hath taken to restore us to happiness, and the singular mercies of God to all that fear him: And what things can we imagine fitter than these to perswade man to honor and fear, and love, and obey God. Again, if we consider the Doctrines commended therein to our Faith, as the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, and the sending of the Holy Ghost, and the way of pardoning sins, and saving sinners by the death and Resurrection of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, and the like; these things are wonderful and Mysterious; and because they are so, they are the fitter to beget in us Humility, and Reverence, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and being so comfortable, to oblige us to all love and obedience. If we look upon the Laws and Rules of Life, of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God, &amp; watching over our selves, and loving our Neighbours; we find them all to be full of all Purity, and Holiness, &amp; Justice, and Equity, such as we must needs in reason judge fit to be observed: and the things commanded such as tend most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to the glory of God, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal good of all mankind, so that the wit of man cannot possibly conceive what could
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98032:60"/>
have been wiser or better. Lastly, if we consider the promises and rewards propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the incouragement of obedience, and the threatnings and punishments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against all disobedience; we find them such as truly becomes an eternal God, and most apt to beget obedience to the Laws of God: for they are not lite and momentany, nor reaching (as those of men) to the body onely and this present Life, but they are infinite and eternal, of Soul and Body both. Considering all these things, I cannot imagine what could be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God to reveal, or necessary for man to know, than the things contained in these books.</p>
            <p>Seeing now that the World hath ever believed that there is a God, and that the very Being, Order, Beauty, variety, use, and working of all things make it highly reasonable so to believe: Seeing there have been Prophesies and Miracles such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived possible without a God: Seeing that we have Books which pretend to make known God and his Will unto us, and that it is most reasonable, if there be a God, to believe he should some way make this known unto us: and seeing that the men whose names these books do bear,

of God, so full of all Holiness, so much conducing to the good of mankind, so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the minds of men in things not otherwise to be known by man; and finally, such as being once received, makes the professors thereof a most comfortable and chearful being here, by giving them hopes of an eternal happy being hereafter: I cannot chuse but be fully perswaded, both that there is a God, and that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and a standing Rule of believing, and honouring, and serving God in such a way, as he will graciously accept, and eternally reward.</p>
