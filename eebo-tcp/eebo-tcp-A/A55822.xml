            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE great prevailing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
in the preſent Age,
making it the duty of every
one of us, that have undertaken the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt, to endeavour to put a ſtop
thereto; that I may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
do my part herein, is a ſufficient
reaſon to juſtify the preſent publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But beſides, the Poiſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
I fear, reached ſome places,
where it is my particular duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
its Miſchiefs; and infected ſome
Perſons, for whoſe eternal welfare,
as well as temporal, I have reaſon to
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:43695:4"/>
be nearly concerned; I have hereby
been more eſpecially engaged to ſet
forth the enſuing Hiſtory, with the
Tract ſubjoined thereto, for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
againſt it. And if I can here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
avail any thing with thoſe who have
caſt off Chriſtianity as an Impoſture,
to make them ſee the error of their
Apoſtacy, I ſhall then obtain the full
end I propoſe; If not, at leaſt I
ſhall diſcharge my Conſcience, and my
Duty, in doing the beſt I can in order
thereto.</p>
            <p>That which at preſent ſeems moſtly
to carry men away into this Infidelity,
is the giddy humour, which too many
among us, eſpecially of the younger
fort, areliable unto, in following
whatſoever hath gotten into faſhion
and vogue. For theſe, looking no
further than what prevails moſt among
ſuch they converſe with, of courſe fall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with it, whatſoever it be, without
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:43695:4"/>
any other conſideration, but that
they think it the Dreſs which is moſt
faſhionable and genteel for them to
appear in, and the Mode wherein they
may make the moſt acceptable figure
among the Company they keep. And
therefore that kind of Infidelity, which
is called <hi>Deiſm,</hi> being of late impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
patronized by too many of thoſe
who govern the Humours of the Times,
abundance of this ſort of unthinking
People have merely, out of compliance
with them, run in thereto, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
take upon them to call Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
a Cheat, and an Impoſture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever having conſidered what an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture
is, or whether any of the Marks
and Properties thereof can poſſibly agree
with this Holy Religion, or no.</p>
            <p>That therefore theſe may ſee what
it is they charge Chriſtianity with, and
how far all the Marks and Properties
thereof are from having any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:43695:5"/>
with it; I have in the enſuing
Hiſtory, which contains the Life of
that famous Impoſtor, who is on both
ſides equally acknowledged to be ſuch,
fully laid open what an Impoſture is,
and in the Diſcourſe ſubjoined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
ſhown, That none of thoſe Marks
and Properties, which are ſo viſible
in the Impoſture of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and
muſt be alſo in all other Impoſtures in
Religion, can poſſibly be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that holy Religion which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.
And an Hiſtory being that
which gives the moſt lively and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
repreſentations of a Matter; and
Books of this nature being ſuch as
moſt obtain the favour of being read,
I hope I have taken the propereſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of coming home to the Conſciences
of thoſe to whom I write.</p>
            <p>And that I may not be thought to
draw this Life of <hi>Mahomet</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to ſet forth his Impoſture in the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:43695:5"/>
fouleſt Colours I am able, the better to
make it ſerve my preſent purpoſe; I
have been careful to ſet down all my
Authorities in the Margin, and at the
end of the Book have given an Account
of all the Authors from whom I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
them.</p>
            <p>And that I may the more remove
all ſuſpicion of this matter, I think it
requiſite to acquaint you, That altho
at preſent I have adapted the Life of
<hi>Mahomet</hi> to this purpoſe; yet it
was not originally deſigned for it, it
being when I firſt wrote it, only the
interſperſed Parts of one Chapter of
a much larger Work, which I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Publick, viz. <hi>The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Ruin of the</hi> Eaſtern
<hi>Church;</hi> which beginning from the
Death of the Emperor <hi>Mauricius,
Anno Dom.</hi> 602. was deſigned to
have been brought down to the fall of
the <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire, which happen'd
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:43695:6"/>
               <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 936. when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of Provinces under the <hi>Caliph,</hi>
uſurping the Soveraign Authority, each
in their ſeveral Diſtricts, did put an
end to that large and formidable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
by dividing it among them.</p>
            <p>An Inſtance fit for our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For notwithſtanding thoſe earneſt
Expectations and ſtrong Hopes, which
we entertained in the beginning of This
Government, of having our Diviſions
healed, and all thoſe Breaches which
they have cauſed in the Church, again
made up; finding thoſe of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſtill to retain the ſame Spirit
on the one ſide, and ſome others to
be ſo violently bent on the other, againſt
every thing that might tend to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
and allay it, as to fruſtrate all
thoſe excellent Deſigns, which have
been laid in order thereto; I thought
I could not better let thoſe Men ſee;
what miſchief they Both do hereby to
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:43695:6"/>
the Common Intereſt of Chriſtianity;
than by laying before them the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Ruin and Deſolation, which from
the like Cauſe hapned to the Churches
of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> once the moſt flouriſhing
of the whole Earth. For they having
drawn the abſtruſeſt. Niceties into
Controverſy, which were of little or
no moment to that which is the chief
end of our Holy Chriſtian Religion,
and divided and ſubdivided about
them into endleſs Schiſms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
did thereby ſo deſtroy that
Peace, Love, and Charity from among
them, which the Goſpel was given to
promote, and inſtead thereof continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
provoked each other to that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Rancour, and every evil Work,
that they loſt the whole Subſtance of
their Religion, while they thus eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contended for their own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concerning it, and in a manner
drove Chriſtianity quite out of the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:43695:7"/>
World by thoſe very Controverſies in
which they diſputed with each other
about it. So that at length having
wearied the patience and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, in thus turning this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Religion into a Firebrand of Hell
for Contention, Strife, and Violence
among them, which was given them
out of his infinite Mercy to the quite
contrary end for the Salvation of their
Souls, by living Holily, Righteouſly,
and Juſtly in this preſent World, he
raiſed up the <hi>Saracens</hi> to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of his Wrath to puniſh them
for it; who taking advantage of the
Weakneſs of Power, and the Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Councils, which theſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
had cauſed among them, ſoon
over-run with a terrible Devaſtation
all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Provinces of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire. And having fixed that
Tyranny over them, which hath ever
ſince afflicted thoſe Parts of the World,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:43695:7"/>
turned every where their Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Moſques, and their Worſhip into
an horrid Superſtition; and inſtead
of that Holy Religion which they had
thus abuſed, forced on them that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Impoſture of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi>
which dictating War, Bloodſhed and
Violence in matters of Religion, as
one of its chiefeſt Virtues, was in
truth the moſt proper for thoſe, who
had afore by their Schiſms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
reſolved all the Religion they
had thereinto. And when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came to this trial, ſome of thoſe
who were the hotteſt Contenders about
Chriſtianity, became the firſt Apoſtates
from it; and they, who would not afore
part with a Nicety, an abſtruſe Notion,
or an unreaſonable Scruple, for the Peace
of the Church, were ſoon brought by the
Sword at their throats to give up the
whole in compliance to the pleaſure of a
Barbarous and Savage Conqueror. And
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:43695:8"/>
no wonder that ſuch, who had afore
wrangled away the ſubſtance of their
Religion in contention and ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
each other, and eat out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heart of it by that malice and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
which they ſhewed in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
about it, became eaſily content,
when under this force, to part with the
Name alſo. Thus thoſe once glorious and
moſt flouriſhing Churches, for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of their wickedneſs, being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to the inſult, ravage and ſcorn
of the worſt of Enemies, were on a
ſudden overwhelmed by them with ſo
terrible a deſtruction, as brought them
to that low and miſerable ſtate, under
the preſſures of which they have ever
ſince groaned; wherein they, retaining
no more than ſome few and lamentable
ruins of what they once were, ſeem thus
to be continued even unto this day by
the Alwiſe Providence of God in the
ſame miſerable Condition under the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:43695:8"/>
Pride and Perſecution of <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Tyranny, for no other end, but
to be an Example and Warning unto
others againſt that wickedneſs of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and Diviſion, by which they
were brought thereto. A ſad Memento
to us; for of all Chriſtian Churches
now remaining in the World, Which is
there that hath more reaſon than we
at this preſent, to learn inſtruction
from this Example, and take warning
therefrom? For are not our Diviſions
now brought to much the ſame height
with theirs, which drew down from
the juſt hand of God this terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon them; when men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no conſcience of breaking the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
peace of the Church, divide and
ſubdivide from it into endleſs Factions,
Schiſms, and Contentions, about their
own Imaginations? When they durſt
reject the Ancient and Primitive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, which was by
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:43695:9"/>
the direction of God's holy Spirit eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in it from the beginning, to
make way for new Schemes of their own
invention; and are content to ruin all,
rather than not obtain their humour
herein? When they will have the
Decency and Order of our outward
Worſhip condemned as Crimes, and
for the privilege of praying in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
according to their own unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
Conceptions, without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
or Senſe, advance ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt our Liturgies and Forms
of Prayer, as have in a manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deſtroyed the Devotion of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
When they ſcruple more at the
kneeling to God in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Euchariſt, while they
are receiving from Him one of His
greateſt Mercies, and ought to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
to him their higheſt Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in return thereto, than in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chiefeſt of his Commandments;
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:43695:9"/>
and thus in a manner reſolve all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into contending againſt our Juſt
and Legal Eſtabliſhments about it?
And when others on the other hand,
whoſe duty it is to labour for our
Peace, would rather have this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
flame of Strife and Diviſion
ſtill continued among us, than throw
in one Bucket of Water to cool and
allay it? I ſay, when matters are
brought to this paſs, Do we not equal,
or rather excel that Wickedneſs for
Contentioin, Strife and Diviſion, for
which God poured out his fierce wrath
upon thoſe once moſt flouriſhing
Churches of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and in ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a manner brought them to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thereby? And have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then to be warned by The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Have we not reaſon to fear, that
God may in the ſame manner raiſe up
ſome <hi>Mahomet</hi> againſt us for our
utter confuſion; and when we cannot
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:43695:10"/>
be contented with that bleſſed Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of Divine Worſhip and
Truth, which he hath in ſo great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
given unto us, permit the Wicked
One by ſome other ſuch Inſtrument to
overwhelm us inſtead thereof with his
fouleſt Deluſions? And by what the
<hi>Socinian,</hi> the <hi>Quaker,</hi> and the <hi>Deiſt</hi>
begin to advance in this Land, we may
have reaſon to fear, that Wrath hath
ſome time ſince gone forth from the
Lord for the puniſhment of theſe our
Iniquities and Gainſayings, and that
the Plague is already begun among us.</p>
            <p>That therefore we may fully ſee to
what theſe Miſchiefs among us lead,
and be influenced thereby to ſuch an
amendment, as might divert the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from us, was the reaſon that
made me deſign the publication of the
Hiſtory I have mentioned; wherein
my purpoſe was to give an account,
firſt of the Controverſies which miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:43695:10"/>
divided thoſe Eaſtern Churches,
and then of that grievous Calamity
and Ruin which hapned to them
thereupon through that deluge of
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Tyranny and Deluſion
which overwhelmed all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
in which they were planted, and
hath continued there to the afflicting
of the poor remainders of them with
miſery and perſecution ever ſince.
For mens minds being uſually more
influenced by Example, than by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
or Exhortation; and eaſier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the miſchief which any evil
leads to, by ſeeing the Sufferings of
others herein, than by the greateſt
ſtrength of Reaſon and Argument
that can be preſſed upon them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hereto; I hoped that perchance
by laying open before the Contending
Parties here among us what miſchief
thoſe Eaſtern Churches ſuffered in
the like caſe through that diſmal
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:43695:11"/>
Ruin which was by their Diviſions
brought upon them, I might awaken
them with this affrighting Example
to think of thoſe things which might
tend to their Peace, and hereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them to ſet ſome ſteps
towards the happy re-eſtabliſhing of
it among us, which as yet no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Argument hath been able to
induce them to.</p>
            <p>But when I had made my Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and gone a great way in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my laſt hand to the Compoſure,
thoſe Diſturbances that hapned about
the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, gave me a reflection which
put a ſtop to my Pen, and made
me reſolve to ſurceaſe the whole
Work. For perceiving what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the unwary ſtirring of this
Controverſy did give the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi>
the <hi>Deiſt,</hi> and the <hi>Socinian,</hi> for
the advancing of their Impieties,
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:43695:11"/>
by confounding and diſtracting the
minds of men with their Cavils
and Objections againſt what we
hold in this Myſtery to be above
our Underſtandings fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and how ſeveral of them
did in a manner ſo licentious, as was
ſcarce ever before allowed in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
State, exerciſe their Wits in
this matter, I durſt not, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Subject of this Book, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it abroad in ſo wanton and
lewd an Age. For the two great
Myſteries of Chriſtianity (and which
will be always ſuch unto us while
in this ſtate of Ignorance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity)
being the Doctrine of the
Trinity, and that of the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Union; and this latter being
the Subject about which all thoſe
Diviſions were, which occaſioned that
ruin of thoſe Churches, of which
in this Hiſtory an Account was
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:43695:12"/>
purpoſed to be given; and this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
leading me therein, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to unravel all thoſe Controverſies
which they made about it, but alſo
to unfold all the Niceties and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Notions which each Sect did
hold concerning it; I had reaſon to
fear, that thoſe who made ſuch
work with one of the Myſteries of
our Holy Religion, would not be
leſs bold with the other, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
as great, were it in that
manner laid open unto them, as it is
in this Hiſtory contained; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I rather choſe totally to ſuppreſs
my Labours, than run the hazard
in their publication of doing more
hurt than good thereby. Only that
part which relates to the Life of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> after having gathered it
together out of that Chapter of this
Hiſtory, where it lay interſperſed
with other matters, I have here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:43695:12"/>
to anſwer that Deſign which
I have already given an account
of.</p>
            <p>As to the Diſcourſe annexed, I
have directed it only to thoſe Deiſts,
who according to Mr. <hi>Blunt</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of them, hold a Providence,
and future Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For ſuch ſeeming to retain
the Common Principles of Natural
Religion and Reaſon, allow a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
foundation whereon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
with. But as to the Atheiſt,
who denies the being of a God, which
all things elſe prove; and the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean
Deiſt, who allowing his Being,
denies his Providence, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
over us, which all the
Occurrences of our Life become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
arguments for, they being ſuch
as muſt neceſſarily reject firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and bid defiance to all manner
of Reaſon, before they can ſo far
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:43695:13"/>
blind themſelves as to arrive hereto,
do leave no room for any Argument,
but that of the Whip and Laſh to
convince them of thoſe impious Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
and therefore deſerve not
by any other method to be dealt with.
Beſides, if you will know the true
Reaſon which induceth the Atheiſt to
deny the Being of God, and the
Epicurean Deiſt his Government over
us; it is that they may give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up, without fear of future
Judgment, to all thoſe Beſtial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of Luſt and Senſuality
which their corrupt Hearts carry
them after; and therefore it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Reaſon of the Man, but
the Brutal Appetite of the Beaſt that
makes them ſuch, they deſerve no
otherwiſe than as Beaſts to be treated
by us; and for this Reaſon, as I
write not to them, ſo I deſire to be
underſtood to have nothing to do with
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:43695:13"/>
For the clearer underſtanding of
the Hiſtory, I deſire you to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
That in the proper Names, <hi>Al</hi>
is a Particle which ſignifieth in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic</hi>
the ſame with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> The,
or the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as in <hi>Al Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas;
Ebn,</hi> or with the Particle <hi>Al</hi>
after it <hi>Ebno'l</hi> is <hi>the Son,</hi> and <hi>Abu,</hi>
or with the Particle <hi>Al</hi> after it <hi>Abu'l</hi>
is <hi>the Father,</hi> and thus <hi>Mahomet</hi> is
called <hi>Ebn Abdollah Abu Caſem,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Son of Abdollah, the
Father of Caſem.</hi> For it was uſual
with the <hi>Arabs</hi> to take their Names
of diſtinction from their Sons as well
as from their Fathers; and thus <hi>Ebno'l
Athir</hi> is <hi>the Son of Al Athir,</hi> and
<hi>Abu'l Abbas</hi> is <hi>the Father of Al
Abbas; Abd,</hi> or with the Particle
<hi>Al</hi> after it, <hi>Abdo 'l,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi>
and thus <hi>Abdo 'llah</hi> ſignifieth
<hi>the Servant of God,</hi> and <hi>Abdo 'l
Shems, the Servant of the Sun.</hi>
               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:43695:14"/>
In theſe and all other <hi>Arabic</hi> Names
I exactly follow the <hi>Arabic</hi> Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
without regarding how they
have been written or ſpelt by any other
Weſtern Author that hath treated of
them; and that the rather, becauſe of
the great agreement which the <hi>Arabic</hi>
hath with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> both in the
power of its Letters, and the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of its Words; there being no
Language in the World more akin to
ours, than the <hi>Arabic</hi> is in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
Only as to the Name of the
Impoſtor himſelf, I rather chuſe to
make uſe of the vulgar manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, becauſe of the notoriety of it,
than make any change, although to
the truth, from that which hath been
generally received, and therefore I call
him every-where <hi>Mahomet,</hi> although
<hi>Mohammed</hi> be the alone true and
proper pronunciation of the Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:43695:14"/>
As to the <hi>Errata</hi> which have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

deſire thou wouldſt correct them from

him; but he defended himſelf againſt
both, and forced the latter to a very
ſhameful Retreat, when he came with
a numerous Army to Beſiege the <hi>City,</hi>
as ſhall be hereafter more fully related.
He lived to a very great Age, being<note n="k" place="margin">Elmacin. lib. 1. c. 1.</note>
an Hundred and ten years old at his

his Father, bore the chief ſway in <hi>Mecca</hi>
as long as he lived, which was to a
very great Age; and under his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
chiefly was it, that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when

ſupported againſt all his Oppoſers, and
grew up to that height thereby, as to

as might beſt ſuit with the ſenſual
Appetites and Deſires of thoſe to whom

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43695:32"/>
which he bore him, the other nine

with his Enemies, and oppoſed him all
they could, as a Man that under the

on dangerous Deſigns to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of his Country.</p>
            <p>But that which gravelled him moſt,
was that his Oppoſers demanded to
ſee a <hi>Miracle</hi> from him. For ſaid they
<note n="o" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 2. c. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bidawi ad Alcorani cap. 12.</note>, Moſes <hi>and</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and the reſt of the

worked Miracles to prove their Miſſion
from God; and therefore if thou be a
Prophet, and greater than any that were
ſent before thee, as thou boaſteſt thy
ſelf to be</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>do thou work the like Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to manifeſt it unto us. Do thou make
the Dead to riſe, the Dumb to ſpeak, and
the Deaf to hear, or elſe do thou cauſe
Fountains to ſpring out of the Earth, and
make this place a Garden adorned with
Vines and Palm-Trees, and watered with
Rivers running through it in divers Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
or elſe let us ſee come down from
Heaven ſome of thoſe Puniſhments which
thou threatneſt us with. Or do thou make
thee an Houſe of Gold, adorned with
Jewels and coſtly Furniture; or let us ſee
the Book thou wouldſt bave us believe to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43695:32"/>
come from Heaven, deſcend down to us
from thence legible in our Eyes, or the
Angel which thou telleſt us doth bring it
unto thee, and then we will believe in thy
Word.</hi> This Objection he endeavoured
to evade by ſeveral anſwers. One<note n="q" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 17.</note>
while he tells them, he is only a Man
ſent to Preach to them the rewards of
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the Puniſhments of <hi>Hell.</hi>
At another time,<note n="r" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 17.</note> That their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
contemned the Miracles of <hi>Saleh,</hi>
and the other <hi>Prophets,</hi> and that for
this reaſon <hi>God</hi> would work no more
among them. And a while after, that
thoſe<note n="ſ" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 6.</note> whom <hi>God</hi> had ordained to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
ſhould believe without <hi>Miracles,</hi>
and thoſe whom he had not ordained to
believe ſhould not be convinced, though
all thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> ſhould be wrought in
their ſight, which they required; and
that therefore they were totally need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
But this not ſatisfying, as being
a plain Confeſſion that he wanted that
Power of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which all other
<hi>Prophets</hi> had to prove their <hi>Miſſion,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of thoſe that were his Followers
departed from him, of which he much
complains in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
finding that this would not do on
his coming to <hi>Medina,</hi> and having there
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43695:33"/>
taken the <hi>Sword</hi> in hand, and gotten
an <hi>Army</hi> to back his Cauſe, he began
to ſing another Note. For his Doctrin
then was<note n="t" place="margin">Richardi Confutatio, c. 7. Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuzeni Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia 4. &amp; Orat. 1. Sect. 11. Alcoran c. 2. c. 3. c. 4 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>God</hi> had ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Jeſus</hi> with <hi>Miracles,</hi> and yet Men would
not be obedient to their Word, and
therefore he had now ſent him in the
laſt place without <hi>Miracles</hi> to force them
by the <hi>Power of the Sword</hi> to do his
Will. And perſuant hereto<note n="u" place="margin">Alcoran c. 4. Cantacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeni Orat. 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. Sect. 12.</note> he forbad
his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to enter into any further
Diſputes about his Religion, but inſtead
thereof he commanded them to fight
for it, and deſtroy all thoſe who ſhould
contradict his Law, promiſing great
Rewards in the Life to come, to ſuch
as ſhould take up the Sword in this
Cauſe, and <hi>the Crown of Martyrdom</hi> to
all thoſe who ſhould dye fighting for it.
And upon this Head, ſome of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan
Doctors</hi> argue very ſubtilly.
For<note n="*" place="margin">Ahmed Ebn Zin. Guadag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Tract. 2. c. 10. Sect. 11.</note> ſay they, The <hi>Prophets of God</hi>
are of divers ſorts according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Attributes of his Divine Nature,
which they are ſent to ſhew forth.
That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ſent to manifeſt
the <hi>Righteouſneſs, the Power, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God;</hi> That he ſhewed forth the
<hi>Righteouſneſs of God</hi> in being impeccable,
his <hi>Knowledg</hi> in that he knew the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43695:33"/>
of Mens hearts, and foretold
things to come; and his <hi>Power</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe <hi>miraculous Works,</hi> which none

ſent to manifeſt <hi>the Wiſdom, the Glory,

<hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>his Clemency;</hi> none of
which carrying with them a Power to
force Men to believe, <hi>Miracles</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in their <hi>Miſſions</hi> to induce them
thereunto. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
ſent principally to ſhew forth the
<hi>Fortitude</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Power of the
Sword,</hi> which being of it ſelf alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to compel all Men into the <hi>Faith</hi>
without any other Power accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, for this reaſon (ſay they) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
wrought no <hi>Miracles,</hi> becauſe he
had no need of them, <hi>the Power of the
Sword,</hi> with which he was ſent, of it
ſelf alone ſufficiently enabling him to
accompliſh his <hi>Miſſion</hi> by forcing Men
to believe therein. And from hence it
hath become the Univerſal Doctrine of
the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that their <hi>Religion</hi> is
to be propagated by the <hi>Sword,</hi> and
that all of them are bound to fight for
it. And for this reaſon<note n="x" place="margin">Cantacuzen. Orat. Sect. 11. Guadagnol Tract. 2. c. 5. Sect. 3.</note> it hath been a

<hi>Mahomet, Othman</hi> was the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
herein, which advanced him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to<note n="k" place="margin">Elmacin. lib. 1. c. 1. Bartholomae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Ediſlenus.</note> be <hi>Secretary</hi> to the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</hi>
But for want of Paper at firſt, as
in a place where there was never before
any occaſion for it, they were forced to
make uſe<note n="l" place="margin">Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 157.</note> of the <hi>Spade-bones</hi> of Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Mutton to write on, which was
a device anciently made uſe of by other
<hi>Tribes</hi> of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who had Letters,
but wanted <hi>Trafick</hi> to accommodate
them with more convenient Materials
for this purpoſe, and therefore their
Books, in which their <hi>Poems,</hi> and other
Matters they delighted in were written,
<note n="m" place="margin">Ebnol A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thir. Pocock. ib.</note> were only ſo many of thoſe <hi>Spade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones</hi>
tied together upon a String. This
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43695:36"/>
               <hi>Baſhar</hi> afterwards became one of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s
Diſciples, and followed him in his
Wars, till poyſoned at <hi>Chaibar,</hi> as ſhall
be hereafter related.</p>
            <p>But theſe Particulars being thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
That the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi>
is of ſo elegant a Stile, and the
ſuppoſed Author thereof ſuch a <hi>Rude
and Illiterate Barbarian;</hi> it will be here
asked, who were the Aſſiſtants by
whoſe help this Book was compiled,
and the <hi>Impoſture</hi> framed? And there
will be the more reaſon to ask this,
becauſe the Book it ſelf contains ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particulars of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion,</hi> as neceſſarily imply the
<hi>Authors</hi> of it to be well-skill'd in both,
which <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was bred an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,</hi>
and lived ſo for the firſt forty Years
of his Life among a People totally Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
cannot be ſuppoſed to be. But
this is a <hi>Queſtion</hi> not ſo eaſily to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
becauſe the nature of the thing
required it ſhould be concealed. The
<hi>Mahometan Writers,</hi> who believe in the
<hi>Impoſture,</hi> as they will allow nothing
of this, ſo to be ſure will ſay little of
it; and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who abhorred
his Wickedneſs, are apt to ſay too
much. For it was uſual with them, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43695:36"/>
it is with all other contending Parties,
to ſnatch at every Story which would
diſparage the Religion they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
and believe it right or wrong,
if it would ſerve their purpoſe this way.
And from hence it hath proceeded, that
we have ſo many fabulous and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Accounts both of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his
<hi>Impoſture,</hi> go current among us, which
ſerve only to the expoſing of us to the
laughter of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> when rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them. And beſides the
<hi>Scene</hi> of this <hi>Impoſture,</hi> being at leaſt
ſix hundred Miles within the Country
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> amidſt thoſe <hi>Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
who all immediately imbraced it,
and would not afterward permit any
of another Religion, as much as to live
among them; it could not at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
be ſo well ſearched into by thoſe,
who were moſt concerned to diſcover
the Frauds of it, and therefore an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
account cannot be expected in this
particular. However, that I may give
all the ſatisfaction herein, that I am
able, I ſhall here lay together whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I can find in any credible Author
concerning it, and give the beſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereof, that the matter will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43695:37"/>
That <hi>Mahomet</hi> compoſed his <hi>Alcoran</hi>
by the help of others, was a thing well
known at <hi>Mecca,</hi> when he firſt broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his <hi>Impoſture</hi> there, and it was often
flung in his Teeth by his Oppoſers, as
he himſelf more than once complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
In the 25th Chapter of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
his words are, <hi>They ſay, That the</hi>
Alcorn <hi>is nothing but a Lye of thy own
Invention, and others have been aſſiſting
to thee herein.</hi> Where the <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
ſay the Perſons here meant<note n="n" place="margin">Liber Agar Guadagnol, Tract. c. 10. Sect. 1. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſione Sectae Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, cap. 1.</note>, were
the Servants of a certain <hi>Sword-Smith</hi>
at <hi>Mecca,</hi> who were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with
whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> was uſed often to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
for the better informing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from them in the <hi>Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi>
And from hence it is, That
<note n="o" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Bellonius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> found
at <hi>Mecca</hi> two <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who had with
them <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and that he was much helped
by them in the Compoſing of his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi>
But this is too open work for ſo
ſecret a Deſign. They that upbraided
him with his being aſſiſted by others,
meant not thoſe whom he publickly
coverſed with, but the private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
whom he ſecretly made uſe of
at home in the framing of the whole
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43695:37"/>
               <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and the writing for him that
<hi>Book,</hi> which he pretended was brought
to him from <hi>Heaven</hi> by the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel.</hi>
And what he hath in another
place of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> doth particularly
point at one of thoſe, who was then
looked upon to have had a principal
hand in this matter. For in the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter his words are, <hi>I know
they will ſay, That a Man hath taught
him the</hi> Alcoran; <hi>but whom they preſume
to have taught him is a</hi> Perſian <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſpeaketh the</hi> Perſian <hi>Language.
But the</hi> Alcoran <hi>is in the</hi> Arabic <hi>Tongue
full of Inſtruction and Eloquence.</hi> Now,
who this <hi>Perſian</hi> was, Frier <hi>Richard</hi> in
his <hi>Confutation of the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Law,</hi>
helps us to underſtand. For in his Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter of that Tract he tells
us, That <hi>Mahomet</hi> being an Illiterate
Perſon, he had for his helper in the
forging of his <hi>Impoſture</hi> among others,
one <hi>Abdia Ben Salon,</hi> a <hi>Perſian Jew,</hi>
whoſe Name he afterwards changed to
make it correſpond with the <hi>Arabic
Dialect</hi> into<note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>Abdiah</hi> is the ſame in <hi>Hebrew</hi> that <hi>Abdollah</hi> is in <hi>Arabic, i. e.</hi> the Servant of God, and <hi>Ben</hi> the ſame with <hi>Ebn, i. e.</hi> the Son.</note>

in the Sixth Chapter of the ſame Tract,

               </note> 
               <hi>Salman</hi>
the <hi>Perſian,</hi> who by his skill in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Intrenchment at the <hi>Battle of the
Ditch,</hi> ſaved <hi>Mahomet</hi> and all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
where otherwiſe he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
have been over-powred by the
number of his Enemies, and totally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined.
For he was a very cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Fellow, and ſo thoroughly skill'd in
all the Learning of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he
had commenced<note n="ſ" place="margin">Dialogus inter Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metem &amp; Abdollam.</note> 
               <hi>Rabbi</hi> among them.
And therefore, from him <hi>Mahomet</hi>
ſeems to have received, whatſoever of
the Rites and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he
hath ingrafted into his Religion. For
this making a very conſiderable part of
it, and many of the particulars being
drawn from the abſtruſer parts of the
<hi>Talmudic Learning,</hi> this neceſſarily ſhews
ſo able an helper to have been in the
whole contrivance. And what <hi>Johannes

the Perſon, by whoſe Hand all

publiſhed by <hi>Bibliander,</hi> a Tract

which Tract helps us to correct the
Name, which is in Frier <hi>Richard</hi>'s Tract
very corruptly written, as being only
a Tranſlation at the third Hand. For
that Tract of Frier <hi>Richard</hi>'s, which we

            <p>Beſides this <hi>Jew,</hi> the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> had

And the many particulars in his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
relating to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi>
plainly prove him to have had ſuch an
helper. <hi>Theophanes, Zonaras, Cedrenus,

which is epitomized in <hi>Vincentius Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacenſis</hi>'s

<note n="z" place="margin">Ecchelenſis Hiſt. Arab. Part. 1. c. 6.</note> that <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>Bahira</hi> are only two
different names of the ſame perſon. He
was a <hi>Monk</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> of the Sect of the

it, that he firſt took notice of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
while a Boy, after that Prophetic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as is before related; but according
to that Account he would have been too
old to act his part in this <hi>Impoſture</hi> ſo
many years after. The truth of the
matter is, <hi>Mahomet</hi> did not fall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him till a long while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when he was projecting his wicked
Deſign in his head; in order to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
forming of which, being very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to acquaint himſelf with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
and <hi>Chriſtian Religions,</hi> he was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
in examining into them, as he
met with thoſe that could inform him.
And in one of his Journeys into <hi>Syria,</hi>
either at <hi>Boſtra</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius Abul Feda Al Kodai Al Jannabi.</note> as ſome ſay, or<note n="b" place="margin">Georgius Monachus in Diſputatione cum Abuſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>

and receiving great ſatisfaction from him
in many of thoſe Points, which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

And therefore not long after<note n="c" place="margin">Theopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Zonaras, Richardi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futatio c. 13.</note> this <hi>Monk</hi>
for ſome great Crime being excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated

and was turned forth from the reſt of
the Herd at free paſture to work no
more. And no doubt this <hi>Monk</hi> having
told the Tale of his Expulſion from his

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43695:40"/>
make it believed at <hi>Mecca</hi> to be drawn

this Name given him, as ſuiting that

            <p>As to his other Helpers, if he had
any ſuch, what is ſaid of them is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and that ſo little, as is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
here to relate. We may ſuppoſe
from the very nature of the deſign (it
being to impoſe a Cheat upon Mankind)
that he made as few as poſſible conſcious
to it; and the two abovementioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficient for his purpoſe, it doth
not appear likely that he admitted any
more into the Secret of it. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is there any more room in it for
another to act. For his <hi>Religion</hi> being
made up of three parts, whereof one was
borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> another from
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the third from the
<hi>Heathen Arabs, Abdollah</hi> furniſhed the
firſt of them, <hi>Bahira</hi> the ſecond, and
<hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf the laſt; ſo that there
was no need of any other help to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the <hi>Impoſture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there are many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
go current of this matter, both as
to the coining of the Forgery, and alſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43695:41"/>
the manner of the firſt propagating of
it; as that the <hi>Impoſtor</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">In praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputationem Chriſtiani. Purchas Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage Book 3. chap. 3.</note> taught <hi>a Bull</hi>
to bring him the <hi>Alcoran</hi> on his Horns
in a publick Aſſembly, as if it had this

bred up <hi>Pigeons</hi> to come to his Ears to
make ſhow thereby, as if the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
converſed with him, and many other
ſuch Stories, which being without
any foundation or likelihood of truth,
I paſs them over as idle Fables not to be
credited, although I find ſome very
great Men have been too eaſy to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, as particularly<note n="g" place="margin">In notis ad Sphaeram Manilii.</note>

the <hi>Pigeons.</hi> Such tricks as theſe would
have been eaſily ſeen thorough by the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> they being Men naturally of
as ſubtile and acute Parts as any in the
World. And therefore <hi>Mahomet</hi> never
as much as offered at any thing of this
nature among them; but diſclaiming
all Miracles, thereby avoided the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of hazarding his deſign upon any
ſuch open Cheats, where it would be
ſo liable to be totally blaſted by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
The whole of this <hi>Impoſture</hi>
was a thing of extraordinary Craft,
carried on with all the Cunning and
Caution imaginable. The framing of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43695:41"/>
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> (wherein lay the main of
the Cheat) was all contrived at home
in as ſecret manner as poſſible, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hazarded abroad, but the ſucceſs
of preaching it to the People. And in
doing of this, no art or cunning was
wanting to make it as effectual to the
end deſigned as poſſible: And therefore
whatever Stories are told of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that are inconſiſtent with ſuch a
management, we may aſſure our ſelves
are nothing elſe but Fables fooliſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by ſome zealous <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to blaſt
the <hi>Impoſture,</hi> which needed no ſuch
means for its Confutation.</p>

Death, falling into the Hands of <hi>Abn
Sophian,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Ommia,</hi> then
one of his moſt violent Oppoſers, his
Enemies laid hold of this advantage to
renew their Oppoſition againſt him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43695:42"/>
and proſecuted it with that ſucceſs that
they ſoon put a ſtop to the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of his <hi>Impoſture</hi> at <hi>Mecca.</hi> For
their Party, after he had now loſt his
Protector, and they became thus head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt him, ſoon grew to that
ſtrength, and appeared with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
on all occaſions to oppoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
that for fear of them no more
new <hi>Proſelytes</hi> durſt joyn themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; and many of thoſe who had
afore declared for him, having done it
for no other end, but to joyn with a
Party where they thought they might
beſt make their Intereſt, as ſoon as
they ſaw the hopes which they had of
his prevailing to be again blaſted by
this Oppoſition, which they judged too
ſtrong for him to weather, again drew
back and appeared no more with him.
And therefore <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſeeing his hopes
of carrying his Deſign at <hi>Mecca,</hi> thus in a
manner totally cruſh'd, began to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
where elſe he might fix. That which
he drove at was to have gained ſuch a
Party there, as might be ſtrong enough
to over-power the reſt, and ſubject the
whole City to him; and then, after
having poſſeſſed himſelf of ſuch a Poſt,
from thence to have armed his <hi>Diſciples</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43695:42"/>
for the gaining him that <hi>Empire</hi> over
the reſt of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
And to this purpoſe was it,
that he ſo often inculcated it into them,
that his Doctrine was to be propagated
by the Sword, and that all that would
receive the Faith which he preached,
muſt fight for it. But now ſeeing no
likelihood of accompliſhing this at
<hi>Mecca,</hi> he ſet his Thoughts on work
how to gain ſome other Town, where
to arm his Party for this Deſign. And
therefore his Unkle <hi>Abbas</hi> living moſt
an end at<note n="m" place="margin">For which reaſon it hath been ever ſince even to this day called <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas Beladi, i. e.</hi> the Town of <hi>Abbas, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii notae ad Alfraganum, p.</hi> 100.</note> 
               <hi>Tagif,</hi> (another Town of

great Intereſt there<note n="n" place="margin">Elmacin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 1. c. 1.</note>, he took a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
thither under his Wing to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
his <hi>Impoſture</hi> in that place, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the making of himſelf Maſter of
it. But after a Months ſtay, having not
been able with all his endeavour to gain
as much as one <hi>Proſelyte</hi> among them,
he again returned to <hi>Mecca</hi> to make
the beſt of his Party there, and wait
ſuch further advantages as Time and
Opportunity might offer him for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
of what he deſigned. And
now <hi>Cadigha,</hi> his Wife, being<note n="o" place="margin">Elmacin Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius Abul Feda, <hi/>

               <hi>Ayeſha,</hi> the Daughter of

whereby making himſelf Son-in-law to

his beſt beloved Wife, <hi>Ayeſha,</hi> he heard
a knocking at his Door, whereon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
he found there the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi>
with Seventy pair of Wings expanded
from his Sides, whiter than Snow, and
clearer than Chryſtal, and the Beaſt
<hi>Alborak</hi> ſtanding by him, which they
ſay is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> on which the <hi>Prophets</hi>
uſed to ride, when they were carried
from one place to another upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of any Divine Command. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
deſcribes it to be a Beaſt as white
as Milk, and of a mixt Nature between
an <hi>Aſs</hi> and a <hi>Mule,</hi> and alſo of a Size be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both, and of that extraordinary
ſwiftneſs, that his paſſing from one
place to another, was as quick as that
of Lightning; and from hence it is
that he hath the name of <hi>Alborak,</hi> that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43695:44"/>
word ſignifying Lightning in the <hi>Arabic
Tongue.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Mahomet</hi> appeared
at the Door, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> moſt
kindly imbracing him, did with a very
ſweet and pleaſing Countenance ſalute
him in the Name of God, and told him
that he was ſent to bring him unto <hi>God</hi>
into <hi>Heaven,</hi> where he ſhould ſee
ſtrange <hi>Myſteries,</hi> which were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be ſeen by any other Man, and
then bid him get upon the <hi>Alborak.</hi>
But the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> it ſeems having long lain
idle from the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi> till <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
(there having been no Prophet in
all that Interval to imploy him) was
grown ſo reſty and skittiſh, that he
would not ſtand ſtill for <hi>Mahomet</hi> to get
up upon him, till at length he was
forced to bribe him to it by promiſing
him a place in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> whereon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quietly taken him on his back,
the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> leading the way with
the Bridle of the Beaſt in his Hand, he
carried him from <hi>Mecca</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
in the twinkling of an Eye. On his
coming thither all the Prophets and
Saints departed appeared at the Gate
of the <hi>Temple</hi> to ſalute him, and from
thence attending him into the Chief
<hi>Oratory,</hi> deſired him to pray for them,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43695:44"/>
and then departed. Whereon <hi>Mahomet</hi>
with the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> going out of
the <hi>Temple,</hi> found there a <hi>Ladder of
Light</hi> ready fixed for them, which they
immediately aſcended leaving the <hi>Albo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak</hi>
there tied at a Rock till their return.</p>
            <p>On their arrival at the <hi>Firſt Heaven</hi>
the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> knocked at the Gate,
and having informed the Porter who he
was, and that he brought <hi>Mahomet</hi> the
Friend of <hi>God</hi> with him by the Divine
Command, the Gates were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opened, which he deſcribes to be of
a prodigious largeneſs. This firſt <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
he tells us, was all of <hi>pure Silver,</hi>
and that he there ſaw the <hi>Stars</hi> hanging
from it by Chains of Gold, each being
of the bigneſs of Mount <hi>Noho,</hi> near
<hi>Mecca</hi> in <hi>Arabia;</hi> and that in theſe <hi>Stars
Angels</hi> kept watch and ward for the
Guard of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to keep off the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
from approaching near it, leſt they
ſhould over-hear and know what was
there done. On his firſt entring into
this <hi>Heaven,</hi> he ſaith, he met an <hi>old
decrepit Man,</hi> and this was our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Adam,</hi> who immediately imbraced
him giving <hi>God</hi> thanks for ſo great a
Son, and the recommended himſelf
to his Prayers. As he entred further,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43695:45"/>
he ſaw a multitude of <hi>Angels</hi> of all
manner of Shapes; ſome in that of
<hi>Men,</hi> others in that of <hi>Birds,</hi> and others
in that of <hi>Beaſts</hi> of all manner of ſorts.
And among thoſe who appeared in the
ſeveral Shapes of <hi>Birds,</hi> he there ſaw
a <hi>Cock</hi> of Colour as white as Snow, and
of ſo prodigious a bigneſs, that his Feet
ſtanding upon the firſt <hi>Heaven,</hi> his
Head reached up to the ſecond, which
was at the diſtance of five hundred Years
journey from it, according to the rate as
we uſually Travel here on <hi>Earth.</hi> But
others among them, as they relate this
matter from their <hi>Prophet,</hi> Hyperbolize
much higher concerning it, telling us
that the Head of this <hi>Cock</hi> reacheth up
through all the <hi>Seven Heavens</hi> as far as
the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> which is above ſeven
times higher; and in the Deſcription of
him, ſay, that his Wings are all over
decked with <hi>Carbuncles</hi> and <hi>Pearls,</hi>
and that he extends the one of them
to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the other to the <hi>Weſt,</hi>
at a diſtance proportionable to his
heighth. Concerning all theſe, the
<hi>Impoſtor</hi> tells us, the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him, that they were <hi>Angels</hi>
which did from thence intercede with
<hi>God</hi> for all <hi>Living Creatures</hi> on the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43695:45"/>
               <hi>Earth.</hi> That thoſe who interceded for <hi>Men,</hi>
had there the ſhape of <hi>Men;</hi> that thoſe
who interceded for <hi>Beaſts,</hi> the ſhape of
<hi>Beaſts;</hi> and thoſe who interceded for
<hi>Birds,</hi> the ſhape of <hi>Birds,</hi> according to
their ſeveral kinds. And that as to the
<hi>great Cock,</hi> that he was the <hi>chief Angel</hi>
of the <hi>Cocks;</hi> that every morning <hi>God</hi>
ſinging an holy Hymn, this <hi>Cock</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
joineth with him in it by his
crowing, which is ſo loud, that all
hear it that are in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi>
except <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Fairies,</hi> and then all
the other <hi>Cocks</hi> that are in <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Earth</hi> crow alſo. But when the
Day of Judgment draws near, then
<hi>God</hi> ſhall command him to draw in
his Wings, and crow no more, which
ſhall be a ſign, that that Day is at
hand to all that are in <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth,</hi> excepting ſtill <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Fairies,</hi>
who being afore deaf to his crowing,
ſhall not then be ſenſible of his ſilence
from it. And this <hi>Cock</hi> the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
look on to be in that great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>God,</hi> that whereas it is a
common Saying among them, that
there are three Voices which <hi>God</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hears, they reckon the firſt the
Voice of him that is conſtant in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43695:46"/>
the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> the ſecond, the Voice
of him that early every morning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the pardon of his Sins; and
the third, the Voice of this <hi>Cock</hi> when
he croweth, which they ſay is ever
moſt acceptable unto him.</p>
            <p>All this ſtuff of the <hi>Cock Abdollah</hi>
helped <hi>Mahomet</hi> to out of the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts.</hi>
For it is all borrowed from
them, with ſome little variation only
to make it look not totally the ſame.
For in the Tract <hi>Bava Bathra</hi> of the
<hi>Babyloniſh Talmud,</hi> we have a Story
of ſuch a <hi>prodigious Bird,</hi> called<note n="u" place="margin">Buxtorfii Lexicon Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binicum in voce <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Ziz,</hi>
which ſtanding with his Feet upon the

with his Head, and with the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Wings darkneth the whole
Orb of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and cauſeth a total
<hi>Eclipſe</hi> thereof. This <hi>Bird</hi> the <hi>Chaldee
Paraphraſt</hi> on<note n="vv" place="margin">Pſalm 50. v. 11. &amp; Pſalm 80. v. 14.</note> the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſays, is a
<hi>Cock,</hi> which he deſcribes of the ſame
bigneſs, and tells us that he crows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Lord.</hi> And the <hi>Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſt</hi>
on<note n="x" place="margin">Ad cap. 3. v. 7. &amp; ad cap. 38. v. 36. &amp; ad cap. 39. v. 16.</note>

and of his crowing every morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>the Lord,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> giveth
him Wiſdom for this purpoſe. What

            <p>From this <hi>Firſt Heaven, the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi>
tells us, he aſcended up into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
which was at the diſtance of five
hundred years journey above it, and
this he makes to be the diſtance of
every one of the <hi>Seven Heavens</hi> each
above the other. Here the Gates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opened unto him, as in the <hi>Firſt
Heaven,</hi> at his entrance he met <hi>Noah,</hi>
who rejoycing much at the ſight of
him, recommended himſelf to his
Prayers. In this <hi>Heaven,</hi> which was
all made of <hi>pure Gold, the Impoſtor</hi> tells
us, he ſaw twice as many <hi>Angels</hi> as
in the former, and among them one
of a prodigious greatneſs. For his Feet
being placed on this <hi>Second Heaven,</hi>
his Head reached to the <hi>Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>Second Heaven</hi> he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up into the <hi>Third,</hi> which was
made of <hi>Precious Stones;</hi> where at the
entrance he met <hi>Abraham,</hi> who alſo
recommended himſelf to his Prayers.
And there he ſaw a vaſt many more
<hi>Angels</hi> than in the former <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and among them another great one of
ſo prodigious a ſize, that the diſtance
between his two Eyes were as much
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43695:47"/>
as Seventy thouſand days journey, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our rate of travelling here
on <hi>Earth.</hi> But here <hi>Mahomet</hi> was out
in his <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> for the diſtance
between a man's Eyes being in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to his heighth but as one to
ſeventy two, according to this rate
the heighth of this <hi>Angel</hi> muſt have
been near fourteen thouſand years
journey, which is four times as much
as the heighth of all his <hi>Seven Heavens</hi>
together, and therefore it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſuch <hi>an Angel</hi> could ever ſtand
within any one of them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this, here he placeth
him, and in his deſcription of him tells
us, that he had before him <hi>a large Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
in which he was continually wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in, and blotting out; and that
having asked <hi>the Angel Gabriel</hi> of him,
he was informed by him that this was
<hi>the Angel of death,</hi> who continually
writes into <hi>the Table,</hi> which he had
before him, the Names of all that are to
be born, and there computes the days
of their life; and as he finds they have
compleated the number aſſigned them,
again blots them out, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath his Name thus blotted out
by him, immediately dies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:43695:47"/>
From hence he aſcended up into
the <hi>Fourth Heaven,</hi> which was all of
<hi>Emerald;</hi> where at the Entrance he
met <hi>Joſeph the Son of Jacob,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
himſelf to his Prayers. And
in this <hi>Heaven</hi> he after ſaw a vaſtly
larger number of <hi>Angels</hi> than in the
former, and among them another <hi>great
Angel,</hi> as high as from this <hi>Fourth
Heaven</hi> to the <hi>Fifth,</hi> who was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
weeping, and making great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and mourning, and this,
<hi>the Angel Gabriel</hi> told him, was for
the <hi>Sins of men,</hi> and the deſtruction
which they did thereby bring upon
themſelves.</p>
            <p>From hence he aſcended up into the
<hi>Fifth Heaven,</hi> which was made of
<hi>Adamant,</hi> where he found <hi>Moſes,</hi> who
recommended himſelf to his Prayers,
and there alſo he ſaw a much greater
number of <hi>Angels</hi> than in the former
<hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence he aſcended up into
the <hi>Sixth Heaven,</hi> which was all of
<hi>Carbuncle,</hi> where he found <hi>John the
Baptiſt,</hi> who recommended himſelf to
his Prayers. And here he alſo ſaw
the number of <hi>Angels</hi> much encreaſed
beyond what he had ſeen in any of the
former <hi>Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:43695:48"/>
From hence he aſcended up into
the <hi>Seventh Heaven,</hi> which was all
made of <hi>Divine Light,</hi> and here he
found <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> where it is to be
obſerved he alters his Stile. For he
ſaith not, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
himſelf to his Prayers, but
that he recommended himſelf to <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> deſiring him to pray for him;
whereby he acknowledgeth him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be the greater. But it was
his uſage through the whole ſcene of
his <hi>Impoſture</hi> thus to flatter the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
on all occaſions. Here he ſaith he
found a much greater number of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
than in all the other <hi>Heavens</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
and among them one Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Angel</hi> having ſeventy thouſand
Heads, and in every Head ſeventy
thouſand Tongues, and every Tongue
uttering ſeventy thouſand diſtinct
Voices at the ſame time, with which
he continued Day and Night inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praiſing <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> having brought
him thus far, told him, that it was
not permitted to him to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore directed him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
up the reſt of the way to the
<hi>Throne of God</hi> by himſelf, which he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43695:48"/>
ſaith he performed with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
paſſing through Waters and Snow,
and many other ſuch difficult Paſſages,
till he came where he heard a Voice
ſaying unto him, <hi>O Mahomet, ſalute
thy Creator;</hi> from whence aſcending
higher, he came into a place, where
he ſaw a vaſt extenſion of Light of
that exceeding brightneſs, that his
Eyes could not bear it, and this was
the Habitation of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> where
his <hi>Throne</hi> was placed; on the right
ſide of which, he ſays, <hi>God</hi>'s Name
and his own were written in theſe
<hi>Arabick</hi> words, <hi>La ellah ellallah Moham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
reſul ollah,</hi> i. e <hi>there is no God but
God, and Mahomet is his Prophet.</hi> Which
is the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> which
words alſo he ſays, he found written
upon all the Gates of the <hi>Seven Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
which he paſſed thorough. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
approached to the <hi>preſence of God,</hi>
as<note n="y" place="margin">Alcoran c. 53.</note> near as within two Bow-ſhots;
he tells us he ſaw him ſitting on his
<hi>Throne</hi> with a covering of ſeventy
thouſand Vails before his Face; that
on his drawing thus near, in ſign of
his favour, he put forth his Hand,
and laid it upon him, which was of
that exceeding coldneſs, that it pierced
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43695:49"/>
to the very Marrow of his Back, and

him, who conducting him back again

and Allegory, but the major Vote
hath carried it for <hi>a real Journey;</hi> and
to this ſenſe it being now pinn'd down,
there is no one among them that dares
in the leaſt to doubt thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Impoſture</hi> was never in greater
danger of being totally blaſted, than
by this <hi>ridiculous Fable,</hi> ſuch a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block
did it lay even before thoſe
of his own Party, and therefore he
needed to interpoſe the utmoſt of his Art
to ſupport the Credit of it; for which
purpoſe he not only got his Friend <hi>Abu
Beker</hi> to be a Voucher to it, but alſo
brings in <hi>God</hi> himſelf in two places of
his <hi>Alcoran</hi> bearing witneſs thereto,
that is, in the Chapter of the <hi>Children
of Iſrael,</hi> and in the Chapter of <hi>the Star;</hi>
in the laſt of which he makes <hi>God</hi> to
ſwear by the <hi>Star</hi> to the truth of it,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43695:50"/>
that <hi>Mahomet</hi> related nothing in this
Story but what he had ſeen; that he
was admitted to approach him in the
Higheſt <hi>Heavens</hi> within the length of
two Bow-ſhoots; and had ſeen the
great Wonders of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and had
many <hi>hidden Myſteries</hi> there revealed
unto him, and that therefore Men
ought not to diſpute any more againſt
him concerning it.</p>
            <p>But how ridiculous ſover the Story
may appear, <hi>Mahomet</hi> had his Deſign
therein beyond barely telling ſuch a
miraculous Adventure of himſelf to the
People. Hitherto he had only given
them the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which was his <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law,</hi> and had owned himſelf no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than barely the <hi>Meſſenger of God</hi> to
deliver it unto them, telling them that
it was brought to him by the <hi>Angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel;</hi>
and that as he received it, ſo he
publiſhed it unto them, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at any Comment, Explication, or
additional Interpretation of his own
concerning it; and therefore when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
with any Objection from his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
againſt it (as he often was
while at <hi>Mecca,</hi> where he was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
teaſed and perplexed with ſome or
other of them) his uſual refuge was in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43695:51"/>
this ſaying; That the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was

               <hi>God's Book,</hi> and that he only could
explain the meaning of it: And it was
Wiſdom in him at firſt not to aſſume
any farther. But now learning from
his Friend <hi>Abdollah</hi> that the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>written Law</hi> dictated by <hi>God</hi>
himſelf, had alſo another <hi>Law</hi> called the
<hi>Oral Law,</hi> and given with it (as they
pretend) to <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf while in the
<hi>Mount,</hi> and from him delivered to the
<hi>Elders</hi> of the People, and from them
down to after Ages by <hi>Oral Tradition;</hi>
and underſtanding alſo that this <hi>Law</hi>
was in as great Authority with them as
the other, and that it had its whole
foundation in the Sayings and Dictates,
which were pretended to be from <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and preſerved by the Memories of thoſe
who converſed with him; He had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
for the future to advance his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the ſame pitch, and make all his

his <hi>Muſslemans,</hi> as well as thoſe,
which were pretended to be from <hi>Moſes,</hi>
did among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And for this end
chiefly was it that he intended this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Journey to <hi>Heaven.</hi> For could
he once make it believed among his <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,</hi>
that he had there ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43695:51"/>
with <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> had with him
in the <hi>Mount,</hi> and was there fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by him in the knowledge of all
Divine Truths, as this Story pretends
he was, he thought he ſhould therein
have a ſufficient foundation to build this
Pretence upon, and might by a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
from it, claim the whole which
he aimed at; and he was not miſtaken
herein. For how ridiculous ſoever the
thing at firſt appeared, yet in the reſult
he carried his Point, and obtained all
that by the Project which he propoſed
to himſelf from it. For the whole of
it at length going down with thoſe who
had ſwallowed the reſt of his <hi>Impoſture,</hi>
from that time all his Sayings became
looked on as Sacred Truths brought

if we may conjecture from the great

towards the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable

which was one of the firſt which
he publiſhed after his coming to <hi>Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threb,</hi>
may ſeem fully to clear the matter.
For his words there are, <hi>Thou ſhalt find
the</hi> Jews <hi>to be very great Enemies to the
true Believers; and the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>to
have great Inclination and Amity towards
them. For they have Prieſts and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
that are humble, who have Eyes
full of Tears when they hear mention of
the Doctrine which God hath inſpired into
thee, becauſe of their knowledge of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43695:54"/>
Truth, and ſay, Lord, we believe in thy
Law, write us in the number of them who
profeſs thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity. Who ſhall hinder us
from believing in God, and the Truth
wherein we have been inſtructed? We
deſire with Paſſion, O Lord, to be in the
number of the Juſt.</hi> by this we may
ſee what a deplorable decay the many
Diviſions and Diſtractions, which then
reigned in the <hi>Eaſtern Church,</hi> had there
brought the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> into,
when its Profeſſors could ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
it for that groſs <hi>Impoſture,</hi> which
an <hi>Illiterate Barbarian</hi> propoſed unto
them. And indeed it is no ſtrange
thing for Men, when once they have
deſerted the Orthodox Profeſſion of the
<hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> to fleet from one Error
to another, till at length by ſeveral
Changes in <hi>Religion,</hi> they change the
whole of it away, and give themſelves
up to total Impiety. For we ſee it daily
practiſed among us.</p>

It hapned on that very year in which
<hi>Mahomet</hi> was born, on this occaſion.
About Seventy years before the time
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> there reigned over the
<hi>Homerites</hi> an ancient <hi>Nation</hi> of the

he was able to extirpate it out of

with Fire, cauſed all thoſe of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

who would not renounce their <hi>Faith,</hi>
and turn to <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> During which
Perſecution the<note n="b" place="margin">Al Maſudi Ecchelenſis ib.</note> 
               <hi>Arabian Writers</hi> tell
a very memorable Story of a <hi>Chriſtian
Woman,</hi> who being brought to the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi>
with a Son of hers very young,
whom ſhe carried in her Arms, was at
the ſight of the Fire ſo afrighted, that
ſhe drew back as if ſhe would rather

and renounce her <hi>Faith,</hi> than thus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

out, <hi>Fear not Mother to dye for your
Religion, for then after this Fire you ſhall
never feel any other.</hi> Whereon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being again encouraged, went on
and compleated her <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> This
<hi>Perſecution</hi> drove ſeveral of the <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite

City of the <hi>Homerites,</hi> abundance of
<hi>Arabians</hi> reſorted thither to the <hi>Chriſtian
Worſhip,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Temple of Mecca</hi>
began to be neglected, and the <hi>Heathen
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43695:57"/>
Worſhip</hi> there hitherto performed with
ſo great Concourſe from all Parts of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>
to grow into decay: At which the
Men of <hi>Mecca</hi> were exceedingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed.
For they had the chief of their
ſupport from the great reſort of <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,</hi>
who came thither every year
from all Parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> to Worſhip
their <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> and perform their
annual ſolemn Ceremonies unto them.
And therefore to expreſs their Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt <hi>this Church,</hi> which ſo
much threatned their main Intereſt with
total ruin, ſome of them went to <hi>Sanaa,</hi>
and getting privately into the <hi>Church,</hi>
did in a moſt contumelious manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
it all over with their Excrements. At
which <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo incenſed, that
to revenge the Affront, he ſwore the
Deſtruction of the <hi>Temple of Mecca:</hi>
And accordingly to effect it marched
thither with a great Army, and beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the City. But not being able to
compaſs his end, (I ſuppoſe for want
of Proviſions for his numerous Forces
in ſo deſert and barren a Country) he
was forced to march back again with
Loſs and Diſgrace; and becauſe he had
ſeveral <hi>Elephants</hi> in his Army, for that
reaſon this was called, <hi>The War of the

Elephant;</hi> and the <hi>Aera</hi> by which they
reckoned from it, <hi>The Aera of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</hi>
And to this War is it, that the
105th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> called
the <hi>Chapter of the Elephant,</hi> doth relate,
where <hi>Mahomet</hi> tells us, How <hi>the Lord
treated them that came mounted upon
Elephants to ruin the Temple of</hi> Mecca,
<hi>and that he defeated their treacherous
Deſign, and ſent againſt them great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Birds, which threw down Stones
upon their Heads, and made them like
Corn in the Field, which is deſtroyed and
troden down by the Beaſts.</hi> Where<note n="e" place="margin">Zamach Shari Bidawi Jallulani, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the
<hi>Commentators</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> tell us,
That to preſerve the <hi>Temple of Mecca</hi>
from the intended Deſtruction, <hi>God</hi>
ſent againſt the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> great Armies
of Birds, each of which carried three
Stones, the one in the Mouth, and the
other two in the two Feet, which they
threw down upon their Heads, and that
thoſe Stones, although not much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than Peaſe, were yet of that
weight, that falling upon the Helmet,
they pierced that and the Man tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
and that on each of them was
written the Name of him that was to
be ſlain by it; and that the Army of
the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> being thus deſtroyed, <hi>the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43695:58"/>
Temple of Mecca</hi> was ſaved. For <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
having reſolved to continue that
<hi>Temple</hi> in its former Reputation, and
make it the chief place of his <hi>new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Worſhip,</hi> as it had been before of
the <hi>Heathen;</hi> coined this <hi>Miracle</hi> among
many others of purpoſe to gain it the
greater Veneration in the minds of his
deluded Followers, although there might
be ſeveral then alive, who were able
to give him the lye thereto, it being
but fifty four Years before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Hegira</hi> that this War hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For it was the very Year<note n="f" place="margin">Golii notae ad Alfraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, p. 54. Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 64.</note> in
which <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
this <hi>Chapter</hi> came not forth in

which was many years after,
when all might be dead that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
any thing of this War, and the
Fable thereby out of danger of being
contradicted by any of thoſe who knew
the contrary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aera of the Impious War</hi> began
from the twentieth Year of the <hi>Aera of
the Elephant,</hi> and had its Name from a
terrible War, which was then waged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<note n="g" place="margin">Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 174. Golii notae ad Alfraganum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 54.</note> the <hi>Koraſhites</hi> and <hi>Kaiſailanites,</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43695:59"/>
of War under his Unkle <hi>Abn Taleb,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then twenty Years old. It was
called the <hi>Impious War,</hi> becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to that heat and fury, that they
carried it on even in thoſe Months,
when it was reckoned impious among
them to wage War. For it was<note n="i" place="margin">Al Jauhari Al Shareſtani Al Kamus Cazwini. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius in notis ad Alfraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, p. 4, 5, &amp; 9. Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 174, &amp; 176.</note> an
Ancient Conſtitution through all <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>
to hold four Months of the Year
ſacred, in which all War was to ceaſe.
And theſe were the Months of <hi>Mohar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,
Rajeb, Dulkaada,</hi> and <hi>Dulhagha;</hi>
the Firſt, the Seventh, the Eleventh,
and the Twelfth of the Year, in which
it was obſerved with the greateſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among all their <hi>Tribes</hi> to uſe no
Act of <hi>Hoſtility</hi> againſt each other, but
with how great Fury ſoever one <hi>Tribe</hi>
might be engaged againſt another (as
was uſual among them), as ſoon as
any of thoſe <hi>Sacred Months</hi> began, they
all immediately deſiſted, and taking off
the heads from their Spears, and laying
aſide all other Weapons of War, had
intercourſe, and intermingled together,
as if there had been perfect Peace and
Friendſhip between them, without any
fear of each other; ſo that if a Man
ſhould meet on <hi>thoſe Months</hi> him that
had ſlain his Father, or his Brother, he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43695:59"/>
durſt not meddle with him, how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
ſoever his Hatred or Revenge
might prompt him to it. And this was
conſtantly obſerved among all the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Arabs,</hi> till broken in this War,
which from hence was called the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
War.</hi> And in this <hi>Impious War,</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Al Kodai Al Kamus. Pocockii Specim. Hiſt. Arab. p. 174.</note> 
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> having firſt taken Arms,
gave a preſage thereby, to what impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
purpoſe he would uſe them all his
Life after.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Hegira</hi> being that, which
all of the <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> have ever
ſince the Conſtitution of <hi>Omar</hi> compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by; the ſubject Matter of the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi>
which I now write, obligeth me
henceforth to make uſe of this <hi>Aera</hi>
through the remaining part of it. But
becauſe it computeth by <hi>Lunary Years</hi>
only, and not by <hi>Solary;</hi> its requiſite
that I here inform the Reader of the
Nature of thoſe Years, and the manner
how the <hi>Hegira</hi> computeth by them.
Anciently the <hi>Arabs,</hi> although<note n="l" place="margin">Al Jauhari Ebnol Athir. Pocockii Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim. Hiſt. Arab. p. 177.</note> they
always uſed <hi>Lunary Years,</hi> yet by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalating
Seven Months in Nineteen
Years, in the manner as do the <hi>Jews,</hi>
reduced them to <hi>Solary Years;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
had their Months always fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſame Seaſon of the year. But
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43695:60"/>
this growing out of uſe about the time
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> their year hath ever ſince
been ſtrictly <hi>Lunary,</hi> conſiſting only of
Three hundred fifty four Days, eight
Hours, and forty eight Minutes,<note n="m" place="margin">Golii notae ad Alfraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, p. 11. Scaliger de Emendatione temporum, lib. 2. Cap de Anno Hege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.</note>
which odd Hours and Minutes in thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years, making eleven Days exactly,
they do intercalate a Day on the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,
5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi>,
24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, years of this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</hi>
So that their year in thoſe years
of this <hi>Period,</hi> conſiſts of three hundred
fifty five Days, by reaſon of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calated
Day, which they then add to
the laſt Month of the Year. And this
Year, all that profeſs the <hi>Mahometan
Religion</hi> have ever made uſe of, and
there is a Paſſage in the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Alcoran. c. 9.</note>,
whereby they are confined to it. For
the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> there calls it an <hi>Impiety to
prolong the Year,</hi> that is, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an <hi>Intercalary Month</hi> thereto. So
that according to this Account, the
<hi>Mahometan Year</hi> falling eleven Days
ſhort of the <hi>Solary;</hi> it hence comes to
paſs, that the beginning of the Year of
the <hi>Hegera</hi> is unfixed and ambulatory;
(the next year always beginning eleven
days ſooner than the former) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſometimes it happens in <hi>Summer,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:43695:60"/>
ſometimes in <hi>Spring,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

thirty three Years compaſs goes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
all the different Seaſons of the
Year, and comes about again to the
ſame time of the <hi>Solary Year,</hi> although
not exactly to the ſame Day. Which
being like to create ſome Confuſion to
us who are uſed to the <hi>Solary Year;</hi> to
prevent this, after the Year of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gera,</hi>
in the Margin I add the day of
the Month in the Year of our <hi>Lord</hi>
in which it begins. The Months of

nine, and ſo alternatively to the end
of the Year, only on the Intercalary
Years, <hi>Dulhagha</hi> hath thirty Days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

in their return from <hi>Syria,</hi> he ordered
out <hi>Hamza</hi> with a Party of Thirty Horſe
to way-lay and plunder them, and he
having accordingly poſted himſelf in a
Wood in the Countrey of <hi>Yamara,</hi> by
which they were to paſs there, tarried
their coming; but on their approach,
finding them guarded with Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

And ſeveral other Expeditions which
were this Year undertaken of the ſame

            <p>The next Year a very rich <hi>Caravan</hi>
going from <hi>Mecca</hi> towards <hi>Syria,</hi>

carrying a great quantity both of Goods

called <hi>Beder,</hi> he found them guarded by
a Convoy of a Thouſand men, under
the Command of <hi>Abu Sophian,</hi> whereon
a fierce Battel enſued between them;
but <hi>Mahomet</hi> gaining the Victory, <hi>Abu

could back again to <hi>Mecca,</hi> ſaving moſt
of the <hi>Caravan</hi> with him, at which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s
Men much<note n="b" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 3.</note> repined. However
great Spoils were gained by them in this
<hi>Battel,</hi> which had like to have made a
Quarrel among them about the diviſion.
For the <hi>Army</hi> conſiſting of two Parties,
the Men of <hi>Medina,</hi> who were called
the <hi>Anſars,</hi> that is, <hi>Mahomet's Helpers;</hi>
and the Men of <hi>Mecca,</hi> who were called
the <hi>Mohagerins,</hi> that is, <hi>the Companions
of his flight;</hi> the<note n="c" place="margin">Hottingeri Bibliotheca Orientalis, c. 2. ad Suratam Octavam Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corani.</note> former would have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43695:63"/>
had a larger ſhare than the latter. To
ſalve this Controverſy, <hi>Mahomet</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the Eighth Chapter of his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
wherein he adjudgeth the fifth part
to himſelf, and the reſt to be equally
divided between them.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs of this Battel gave great
encouragement to the <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and his
party. He frequently brags of it in his
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> and would have it believed that
<note n="d" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 3. Bidawi.</note> two <hi>Miracles</hi> were wrought for his
obtaining of it; the firſt, That <hi>God</hi>
made his Enemies ſee his Army as dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to what it was, which helped to
diſmay them; and the ſecond, That he
ſent <hi>Troops of Angels</hi> to his aſſiſtance,
which helped to overcome them. They
were to the number of Three thouſand
(as<note n="e" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 3.</note> he himſelf tells us); but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
to every one's Eyes but his alone,
the credit of it ſtands upon no better
foundation, than the reſt of his <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi>
his own ſingle <hi>Teſtimony</hi> only.</p>
            <p>This Year he altered the<note n="f" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 102. Al Kodai. Abul Feda. Johannes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas, c. 6.</note>

which he was uſed to call the
<hi>holy City,</hi> and the <hi>City of the Prophets,</hi>
and intended to have ordered his <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>
thither, and to have made it the
chief place where all his Sect were to
worſhip. But now finding that his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
ſtill bore a ſuperſtitious venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Temple of Mecca,</hi> which had
for many Ages before been the chief
place of the <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip</hi> of the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> and that it would be a very
prevalent Argument to reconcile his
Fellow <hi>Citizens</hi> to him, if he ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
their <hi>Temple</hi> in its former honour,
he changed his former Law to ſerve his

               <hi>Mecca,</hi> and ordained
the <hi>Temple</hi> of that place, which from
its ſquare form was called the <hi>Caaba</hi>
(that word ſignifying a ſquare in the
<hi>Arabic Tongue)</hi> to be the chief place of
worſhip for all of his <hi>Religion,</hi> to which
they were ſtill to perform their <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>
as in former times. And to this
Change he was the more inclined out of
his averſion to the <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt whom
having about this time contracted an
irreconcileable hatred, he liked not any
longer to conform with them in this
Rite. And that his <hi>Followers</hi> might be
diſtinguiſhed from them in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
is the reaſon<note n="n" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 2.</note> which he himſelf
gives for this change. However,<note n="o" place="margin">Johannes Andreas, c. 6.</note> many
of his Diſciples were much ſcandalized

that <hi>Religion,</hi> which was ſo often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

thereon.</p>
            <p>From this time, the more to magnify
the <hi>Temple of Mecca,</hi> and to give the

worſhipped at it while in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> but
being caſt down from thence (for they

on <hi>Earth,</hi> towards which he might pray,
and go round it in holy worſhip unto
him in the ſame manner as the <hi>Angels</hi>
went round that which he had ſeen in

the ſimilitude of that <hi>Temple</hi> in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

               <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> rebuilt it in the

worſhipped <hi>God</hi> with the true Worſhip;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43695:65"/>
but his Poſterity afterwards corrupted
it with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and prophaned this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Temple</hi> with <hi>Idols,</hi> from which he
was now to purge it, and conſecrate it
anew to the true Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> to
which it was primitively intended. And
he did not only thus retain <hi>the Temple of
Mecca,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> thither,
and all the abſurd Rites which were
performed at them in the times of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
For theſe being the things which
long uſe had created a great veneration
for in the minds of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> by
adopting them all into his <hi>new Religion</hi>
he made it go down the eaſier with
them. And indeed this was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
piece of his Craft, ſo to frame his
<hi>new Religion</hi> in every particular, as
would beſt take with thoſe, to whom
he propoſed it.</p>
            <p>As to this <hi>Temple of Mecca,</hi> and what
it was before <hi>Mahomet,</hi> all that is true
of it, is this. It was an <hi>Heathen Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
in the ſame veneration among the
<hi>Arabs</hi> that the <hi>Temple of Delphos</hi> was
among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whither all their

               <hi>Tribes</hi> for many Ages came once a year
to perform their <hi>Idolatrous Ceremonies</hi> to
their <hi>Gods,</hi> till at length <hi>Mahomet</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forced them to exchange their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:43695:65"/>
for another <hi>Religion</hi> altogether as
bad, made this <hi>Temple</hi> alſo undergo the
ſame change, by appointing it thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to be the chief place for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of that falſe Worſhip, which he
impoſed, in the ſame manner, as it was
before of that which he aboliſhed, and
ſo it hath continued ever ſince.</p>
            <p>This ſame Year he alſo appointed the
Month of<note n="ſ" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius p. 102. Alkodai.</note> 
               <hi>Ramadan</hi> to be a Month of

the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerving the celebration
of their great <hi>Faſt of the Expiation</hi> on the

<hi>Tiſri,</hi> he asked what it meant? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told it was a <hi>Faſt</hi> appointed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
he replied, that he had more to do

the Tenth day of <hi>Moharram,</hi> the
Firſt Month of the <hi>Arab Year,</hi> to be
a <hi>ſolemn Faſt</hi> with his <hi>Muſſlemans</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
hereof, which by a name alſo
borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> he called <hi>Aſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
which is the ſame with the <hi>Hebrew

this <hi>Faſt of the Expiation</hi> was kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

adopt other of their <hi>Faſts</hi> into his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
hoping by theſe means to win
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43695:66"/>
them over unto him. But finding them
ſtill to oppoſe him all they could, and
on all occaſions to perplex him and his
<hi>Followers</hi> with Queſtions and Difficulties
about his <hi>Religion,</hi> which he could not
find Anſwers for, and on the account
hereof to diſparage and deride him and
his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> he contracted that aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and hatred againſt them, that he
reſolved to differ from them<note n="vv" place="margin">Ebnol Athir.</note> in this
too, as well as in the particular laſt
mentioned; and therefore aboliſhing
the ſaid <hi>Faſts,</hi> which he had taken
from them, in imitation of the Chriſtian
way, with whom about this time (it
ſeems) he was very deſirous to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
himſelf, he appointed the whole
Month of <hi>Ramadan</hi> to be as it were his
<hi>Lent,</hi> or a continued time of ſolemn
faſting. And this Year the Month of
<hi>Ramadan</hi> beginning in the Month of
<hi>March,</hi> it did now exactly fall in with
the time of the <hi>Chriſtian Lent.</hi> But the
reaſon which he himſelf gives for his
appointing of it was, becauſe<note n="x" place="margin">Alcoran c. 2.</note> on this
Month, as he pretends, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> firſt
came down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to him, that
is, that <hi>Chapter</hi> of it which he firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.

not being able to light on him in any

ſent out Parties to ſearch after him, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

bitter hatred againſt him was this. <hi>Caab</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:43695:67"/>
was a very eminent Poet among the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> and having a <hi>Brother</hi> called
<hi>Bejair,</hi> that had turned <hi>Mahometan,</hi> he
made a very <hi>Satyrical Poem</hi> upon him
for this Change, wherein he ſo terribly
galled the <hi>Impostor,</hi> that he could not
bear it, but reſolved to revenge the
Affront with his deſtruction, if ever he
could get him into his hands. For ſome
time <hi>Caab</hi> eſcaped all the Snares which
he laid for him; but after his power had
encreaſed ſo far, that the greater part
of <hi>Arabia</hi> had ſubmitted to him, he
found he could be no longer ſafe, but
by making his peace with him, and
therefore to purchaſe it, came in unto
him, and profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Mahometan</hi>
alſo. Hereon <hi>Mahomet</hi> bad him repeat
that <hi>Poem</hi> which had ſo much offended
him, which had did, putting the name
of <hi>Abu Beker</hi> in every Verſe, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was the name of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> but
this not doing, <hi>Mahomet</hi> would not give
him his pardon, although at that time
he did not take any advantage of his
voluntary coming in unto him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
putting his Wits to work, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to this farther Device for the obtaining
of his ſecurity from him. For
being informed that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had lately
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43695:67"/>
gotten a new <hi>Mistreſs,</hi> whom he exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
doted upon, and much regretted
her abſence from him while then abroad
upon the Wars; the <hi>crafty Jew</hi> ſtruck
in with this Paſſion for the mollifying of
him, and compoſed an excellent Poem
in her commendation, which having
repeated before him, he ſo took the
heart of the <hi>old Lecher</hi> thereby, that
he not only pardoned him, but alſo
received him into the number of his
particular <hi>Favourites,</hi> and made him
one of his chief <hi>Confidents</hi> ever after.
And as a mark of his Favour then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on him the Cloak which he
wore, which being kept by him out of
an affected veneration to the <hi>Impostor,</hi>
as an holy Relict, was afterwards bought
by <hi>Moawias,</hi> when he came to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
for Thirty thouſand pieces of Gold,
and was made the <hi>Robe</hi> which he and
all his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Ommia</hi>
conſtantly wore on all Solemn Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
And it's ſaid of this <hi>Caab,</hi> that
he afterwards became ſo intimate with
<hi>the Impostor,</hi> that he took him into his
greateſt Secrets, even to that of the
<hi>Imposture</hi> it ſelf, in compoſing the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
for which his great Skill in the
<hi>Arabick Language,</hi> and all other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43695:68"/>
then in uſe among them, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualified him.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of this year hapned
the Battel of <hi>Ohud,</hi> which had like to
have proved fatal to the <hi>Impostor.</hi> For

               <hi>Abu Sophian,</hi> to revenge the laſt Year's
Affront, marched againſt him with an
Army of Three thouſand Foot, and
Two hundred Horſe; and having ſeized
the Mountain of <hi>Ohud,</hi>

<hi>Mahomet</hi> was forced to hazard Battel to
diſlodge him from that Poſt, although

uſe of ſome of his Fingers ever after.</p>
            <p>To ſalve the Objections which were
raiſed againſt him on this Defeat, he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43695:68"/>
was much put to it. Some<note n="h" place="margin">Alcoran c. 3.</note> argued
againſt him, How he that was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of God,</hi> and ſo much in his favour,
as he pretended, could be overthrown
in Battel by the <hi>Infidels.</hi> And others
murmured as much for the loſs of their
Friends and Relations, who were ſlain in
the Battel. To ſatisfy the former, he
laid the cauſe of the overthrow on the
Sins of ſome that followed him; and
ſaid, that for this reaſon <hi>God</hi> ſuffered
them to be overthrown, that ſo the
Good might be diſtinguiſhed from the
Bad, and thoſe who were <hi>true Believers</hi>
might on this occaſion be diſcerned from
thoſe who were not. And to ſtill the
Complaints and Clamours of the latter,
he invented his Doctrine of <hi>Fate</hi> and
<hi>Destiny,</hi> telling them, that thoſe who
were ſlain in the Battel, though they
had tarried at home in their Houſes,
muſt have died notwithſtanding when
they did, the time of every man's Life
being predeſtinated and determin'd by
<hi>God,</hi> beyond which no caution is able in
the leaſt to prolong it; That the <hi>Deſtiny</hi>
of all is ſtated to an hour, which cannot
be altered; and therefore thoſe who
were ſlain in the Battel, died no ſooner
than they muſt otherwiſe have done;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43695:69"/>
but in that they died fighting for the
<hi>Faith,</hi> they gained the advantage of
the Crown of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which were due thereto in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi>
where he told them they were alive
with <hi>God</hi> in Everlaſting Bliſs, which
was of greater advantage than all the
<hi>Treaſures</hi> in the world could in this Life
have been unto them: That they were
there rejoycing very much, that they
had laid down their Life ſo happily, as
by thus fighting in the <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi>
and <hi>his Law,</hi> and were expreſſing among
themſelves exceeding gladneſs, that
thoſe who ran to hinder them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Battel, met them not. Both
which <hi>Doctrines</hi> he found ſo well to
ſerve his turn, that he propagated them
on all occaſions after. And they have

the Woman being got to <hi>Heaven</hi> would

               <hi>Ricaut</hi> give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his forbidding the uſe of <hi>Wine</hi>
from another occaſion, which they thus
relate, Mahomet <hi>making a Journey to a
Friend of his, at Noon entred into his Houſe,
where there was a Marriage Feaſt, and
ſitting down with the Gueſts, he obſerved
them to be very merry and jovial, kiſſing
and imbracing one another, which was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the chearfulneſs of their Spirits
raiſed by the Wine, ſo that he bleſſed it
as a ſacred thing in being thus an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of much Love among Men. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the ſame Houſe the next day,
he beheld another face of things, as Gore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43695:71"/>
blood on the Ground, an Hand cut off,
an Arm, Foot, and other Limbs diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;
which he was told was the effect
of the Brawls and Fighting, occaſioned
by the Wine, which made them Mad, and
inflamed them into a Fury thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
one another. Whereon he changed his
mind, and turned his former Bleſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Curſe, and forbad it ever after to
all his Diſciples.</hi> But he himſelf ſeems
totally to refer the reaſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
to the Quarrel, which <hi>Wine</hi>
and <hi>play at Games of Chance</hi> had cauſed
among them. For in the 5th Chapter
of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where he gives his <hi>Law</hi>
concerning this matter; his words are,
<hi>The Devil deſires to ſow Diſſention and
Hatred among you through Wine, and
Games of Chance, to divert you from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
God, and praying unto him.
Abandon Wine and Games of Chance. Be
obedient to God, and the Prophet his
Apoſtle, and take heed to your ſelves.</hi>
The truth of the matter is, the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ecchelenſis, Hiſt. Arab. Part. 1. c. 5. Richardi Confutatio, c. 8.</note> were given to drink <hi>Wine</hi> to great
exceſs, when they could come by it,
and being of an hot Temper, as living
moſt of them within the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi>
were liable to be inflamed by it into
the higheſt Diſorders; and this <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:43695:71"/>
having had ſufficient experience of,
particularly in the dangerous Inſtance I
have mentioned, did in reſpect of his
<hi>Arabians,</hi> prudently enough provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the like miſchief for the future
by thus taking away the Cauſe from
whence it did flow.</p>
            <p>The next Year was the War of the
<hi>Ditch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heg. 5. June 2. A. D. 627.</note> where <hi>Mahomet</hi> was in great danger
of being totally ruined. For the Men of
<hi>Mecca</hi> having entred into Confederacy
with ſeveral of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh
Arabians,</hi> to whom he had declared
himſelf a mortal Enemy<note n="q" place="margin">Elmacin. lib. 1. c. 1. Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 102.</note>, marched
againſt him under the Command of
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Abu Sophian,</hi>
with an Army of ten thouſand Men.
<hi>Mahomet</hi> marched forth to meet them,
but being terrified with their number
by the advice of <hi>Abdollah Ebn Salem,</hi>
the <hi>Perſian Jew</hi> abovementioned, (whom
<hi>Elmacinus</hi> calls <hi>Salman)</hi> fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with a <hi>Deep Ditch,</hi> within which
Intrenchment the Enemy beſieged him
many days, which time the crafty <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor</hi>
imployed to corrupt over to his
Intereſt their Leading-men. In which
attempt having ſucceeded with ſome
of them, he did by their means ſow
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43695:72"/>
ſuch Diſſentions among the reſt, as
ſoon extricated him from all this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was fallen into, which hapned
on this occaſion. There was then in
the Enemies Camp,<note n="r" place="margin">Ecchelenſis, Hiſt. Arab. Part 1. c. 3. Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 102.</note> 
               <hi>Amrus Ebn Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dud,</hi>
an Eminent <hi>Koraſhite,</hi> and Unkle
to <hi>Ali,</hi> who having the Reputation of
being the beſt Horſe-man in <hi>Arabia,</hi> to
ſhew his Manhood while the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
lay thus idle againſt each other,
rode up to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Trenches, and
challenged any of his Army to fight
with him in a <hi>ſingle Combat. Ali,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his <hi>Nephew,</hi> accepts the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi>
and having ſlain <hi>Amrus,</hi> and alſo
another that came to his aſſiſtance,
thoſe whom <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Inſtruments</hi> had
wrought into a Diſſention from the reſt
took this opportunity<note n="ſ" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 102. Elmacin. lib. 1. c. 1.</note> to deſert the
<hi>Camp,</hi> and march home. Whoſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the reſt in this Conſternation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the whole Army broke up and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.
And ſo this War, from which
ſo much was expected, ended in nothing,
but the loſs of ſix Men on <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
ſide, and three on the other.</p>
            <p>But though the <hi>Enemy</hi> could make
no uſe of the advantage they had, yet
<note n="t" place="margin">Elmacin, lib. 1. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> knew how to make the beſt
of that which they gave him by this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43695:72"/>
Retreat. And therefore immediately
marching after the <hi>Cozaites,</hi> one of the
<hi>Jewiſh Tribes</hi> confederated againſt him,
beſieged them in their Fortreſſes, and
forced them to ſurrender at Mercy to
<hi>Saad Ebn Maad,</hi> one of his chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.
But he being ſore of a Wound
he had received at the War of the <hi>Ditch,</hi>
in revenge thereof cauſed the Men, and
among them <hi>Hahib Ebn Atab,</hi> their
chief Commander, to be put to the
Sword, and the Women and Children
to be ſold for Slaves, and all their Goods
to be given for a Prey unto his Soldiers;
and as ſoon as this was executed, died
himſelf of the Wound, which he had
thus cruelly revenged.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth Year he ſubdued<note n="u" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 102. Elmacin. lib. 1. c. 1.</note> the
<hi>Lahianites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heg. 6. May 23. A. D. 627.</note> the <hi>Muſtalachites,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Tribes of the <hi>Arabs.</hi> The
<hi>Muſtalachites</hi> were of the Poſterity of
the <hi>Chozaites,</hi> whom <hi>Coſa</hi> expelled out
of <hi>Mecca.</hi>
               <note n="vv" place="margin">Abul Feda Pocockii Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim. Hiſt. Arab. p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> having overthrown
them in Battle, ſlew moſt of the Men
according to his bloody manner, and
took their Wives and Children Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
among whom finding <hi>Juweira,</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Hareth,</hi> a Woman of
excellent Beauty,<note n="x" place="margin">Elmacin, lib. 1. c. 1.</note> he fell in Love with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43695:73"/>
her, and took her to him to Wife, and
for her ſake releaſed all of her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
that were found among the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> after ſo many
advantages obtained in his Wars, being
much increaſed in ſtrength<note n="y" place="margin">Elmacin, lib. 1. c. 1.</note>, marched
his Army againſt <hi>Mecca,</hi> and at <hi>Hadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>
a place near that City, on the
Road from thence to <hi>Jodda,</hi> a Battle
was fought between them, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of which was, that neither ſide
gaining any advantage over the other,
they there agreed on a <hi>Truce</hi> for ten
Years. The Conditions of which were,
That all within <hi>Mecca,</hi> who were for
<hi>Mahomet</hi> might have liberty to joyn
themſelves to him; and on the other
ſide, Thoſe with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who had a
mind to leave him, and return to their
Houſes in <hi>Mecca,</hi> might alſo have the
ſame liberty. But for the future, if
any of the Citizens of <hi>Mecca</hi> ſhould go
over to <hi>Mahomet</hi> without the Conſent
of the <hi>Governor of the City,</hi> he ſhould
be bound on remand to render them
unto him. And that if <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or
any of his Party had a mind to come
into the <hi>City,</hi> they might have liberty
ſo to do at any time during the <hi>Truce,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:43695:73"/>
provided they came unarmed in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
way, and tarried not above three
days at a time.</p>
            <p>By this Truce, <hi>Mahomet</hi> being very
much confirmed in his Power, took on
him<note n="z" place="margin">Elmacin, ib.</note> thenceforth the Authority of a
<hi>King,</hi> and was inaugurated by the Chief
Men of his Army under a Tree near
<hi>Medina,</hi> which immediately (it ſeems
curſed by the Authority given ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> under it) withered away
and periſhed, which the <hi>Mahometans</hi>
themſelves relate, but make another
Interpretation of it.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s having thus made
<hi>Truce</hi> with the Men of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
obtained free acceſs for any of his
Party to come into that <hi>City;</hi> he thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
ordained them to make their<note n="a" place="margin">Al Kodai. Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 175.</note>
               <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> thither, which have ever
ſince with ſo much <hi>Religion</hi> been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by all of his <hi>Sect</hi> once every Year.
This was an Ancient Rite of the <hi>Heathen
Arabs,</hi> it having been a conſtant Uſage
<note n="b" place="margin">Vide ſupra ad Annum Hegerae ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum.</note> among them for many Ages foregoing
to come once a Year to the <hi>Temple of
Mecca,</hi> there to worſhip their <hi>Heathen
Deities.</hi> The time of this their <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Shareſtani Makrizi Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii notae ad Alfraganum, p. 8 &amp; 9. Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 177.</note> was in the Month of <hi>Dulhagha;</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:43695:74"/>
and on the tenth Day of that Month
was their great <hi>Feſtival,</hi> in which the
chiefeſt Solemnities of their <hi>Pilgrimage</hi>
were performed, and therefore it was
called <hi>Ayd al Cabir,</hi> i. e. <hi>the great Feaſt;</hi>
and alſo, becauſe theſe Solemnities did
chiefly conſiſt in offering up Sacrifices
and Oblations, <hi>Ayd al Korban,</hi> that is,
<hi>The Feaſt of Oblation;</hi> and the whole
Solemnity, <hi>Al Hagha,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Solemn
Feſtival,</hi> in the ſame Senſe as the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
word <hi>Chag,</hi> from which it is derived,
ſignifieth any of the three <hi>Solemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,</hi>
on which the <hi>Jews</hi> were thrice
every Year to appear before the <hi>Lord</hi>
at the <hi>Temple of Jeruſalem.</hi> And from
hence the Month in which this <hi>Feſtival</hi>
falls, is called among them <hi>Dulhagha,</hi>
which is as much as to ſay, <hi>The Month of
the Solemn Feſtival.</hi> And that all might
have free liberty ſafely to come to
this <hi>Feſtival</hi> from all Parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
and again ſafely return, was the reaſon
that not only this <hi>Month,</hi> but alſo the
preceding and following were held <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi>
among them, in which it was not
lawful to uſe any Act of Hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any Man, as I have afore ſhewn.
And therefore this <hi>Solemn Pilgrimage to
Mecca</hi> having been a <hi>Religious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:43695:74"/>
which all the <hi>Tribes of the Arabs</hi> had
long been devoted to, and was had in
great Veneration among them, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
thought not fit to ruffle them with
any Innovation in this matter, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting
it into his <hi>Religion,</hi> retained
it juſt in the ſame manner as he found
it practiſed among them with all the
ridiculous Rites appendant thereto, and
ſo it is obſerved even unto this day by
all of that <hi>Religion,</hi> as one of the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Duties</hi> of it. For the <hi>Crafty
Impoſtor</hi> taught them concerning it (as
he did of all the other <hi>Heathen Rites
of the Arabs,</hi> which he found neceſſary
to retain) that it was a <hi>Command</hi> from
<hi>God</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> annually
to obſerve this <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to <hi>Mecca;</hi>
and that it was given unto them on
their rebuilding the <hi>Caaba;</hi> and that at
firſt it was only uſed to the Honour
of <hi>God,</hi> in the coming of all the <hi>Arabs</hi>
thither once every Year, there to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
together before him in one Holy
Aſſembly, in the ſame manner as the
<hi>Jews</hi> were after commanded thrice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Year to worſhip before him in their
three Solemn Feſtivals at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
But that in proceſs of time it became
perverted to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> from which he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43695:75"/>
was now commanded again to reſtore
it to its primitive uſe. And in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of this Eſtabliſhment, he had no
ſmall reſpect to his <hi>Native City,</hi> that
he might preſerve to it the ſame benefit
of this <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> which it had before
ſo long enjoyed. And in thus providing
for the Intereſt of that People in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Religion,</hi> which he was a framing,
he thought he might the eaſier prevail
to draw them over unto it. And in
this he was not miſtaken. For had he
totally aboliſhed this <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greateſt Honour and Benefit
which that place enjoyed, and by which
indeed it did moſtly ſubſiſt; their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
would have engaged them to that
vigorous Oppoſition againſt him, that
in all likelihood he would never have
become Maſter of that <hi>City,</hi> and for
want thereof have miſcarried in the

the <hi>Royal,</hi> which he had now inveſted

him; ſo that they were in the ſame

Their <hi>Pontifical Authority</hi> chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

and after by others, who roſe up on

yet as to all things relating to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of their particular States they
diſowned all manner of Obedience unto

another in his ſtead, as they thought
would beſt ſuit with their Intereſt,
which was uſually done according as

Authority. Ever ſince that time, moſt
<hi>Mahometan Princes</hi> have a particular

Authority formerly inveſted in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liph</hi>'s,

as Tools of State to ſerve their Intereſt,
and make the <hi>Law</hi> ſpeak what at any

it be.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had finiſhed his
<hi>Moſque</hi> at <hi>Medina;</hi> he always, if on the
place, officiated in it himſelf both in
Praying, and alſo in Preaching to the
People; for which he had no other
convenience at firſt than a piece of a
<hi>Beam,</hi> or the <hi>Stump of a Palm-tree</hi> dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the Ground, on the <hi>top</hi> of
which he leaned when he did officiate.
But being now inveſted with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, he thought this too
mean an accommodation for his Dignity;
and therefore by the advice of one of his
Wives cauſed a <hi>Pulpit</hi> to be built for him,
which had two Steps up into it, and a
Seat within to ſit on; and this the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor</hi>
ever after made uſe of, leaving
his Beam. And thoſe, who writing of
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Miracles, tell us among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
That a <hi>Beam</hi> groaned at him<note n="f" place="margin">Al Gazal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mean this <hi>Beam</hi> which they ſay groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s leaving of it, thereby
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43695:77"/>
expreſſing its grief for being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.
<hi>Othman Ebn Affan,</hi> when he
came to be <hi>Caliph,</hi> hung his <hi>Pulpit</hi> with
<hi>Tapiſtry,</hi> and <hi>Moawias</hi> advanced it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
adding ſix Steps more to it. For
being<note n="g" place="margin">Elmacin, lib. 1. c. 7. Eutychius, Tom. 2. p. 360. Abul Faraghius, p. 124.</note> ſo exceeding Fat that he could
not ſtand while he officiated, as all his
Predeceſſors had done, he was forced
to ſit when he preached to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and therefore that he might be
the better heard, he raiſed the <hi>Pulpit</hi>
to this heigth, and ſo it now remains
in that <hi>Moſque</hi> at <hi>Medina</hi> even to this
day.</p>
            <p>This Year he lead forth his Army<note n="h" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 102. Elmacin, lib. 1. c. 1.</note>
againſt <hi>Chaibar,</hi> a City inhabited by
<hi>Arabs</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> who being
overthrown by him in Battle, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
their City and took it by Storm.
And here thoſe, who are the magnifiers
of <hi>Ali,</hi> tell this <hi>Miracle</hi> of him, that
in the Aſſault, <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like, he plucked
up <hi>one of the Gates of the City,</hi> (which
was of that weight, ſaith <hi>Abul Feda,</hi>
that eight other Men could not move
it) and held it before him for a Shield
to defend himſelf againſt the beſieged,
till the City was taken. On <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
entring the Town, he took up his
Quarters in the Houſe of <hi>Horeth,</hi> one
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43695:77"/>
of the Principal Inhabitants of the Place,
whoſe Daughter<note n="i" place="margin">Abul Feda. Al Kodai. Al Jannabi. Diſputatio Chriſtiani, c. 8. Richardi Confutatio, c. 13. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 189, 190.</note> 
               <hi>Zainab</hi> making ready
a <hi>Shoulder of Mutton</hi> for his Supper,
poyſoned it. And here thoſe, who
are for aſcribing <hi>Miracles</hi> to <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
tell us, That the <hi>Shoulder of Mutton</hi>
ſpoke to him, and diſcourſed that it was
poyſoned; but it ſeems, if it did ſo, it
was too late to do him any good. For
<hi>Baſher,</hi> one of his Companions falling
on too greedily to eat of it, fell down
dead on the place. And although <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
had not immediately the ſame
fate; becauſe not likeing the taſte, he
ſpit out again what he had taken into
his Mouth, yet he let down enough to
do his buſineſs. For he was never well
after this Supper, and at three Years
end died of it. The <hi>Maid</hi> being asked,
Why ſhe did this; anſwered, That ſhe
had a mind to make trial, whether he
were a <hi>Prophet</hi> or no. For were he
a <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſaid ſhe, he would certainly
know that the Meat was poyſoned;
and therefore would receive no harm
from it; but if he were not a <hi>Prophet,</hi>
ſhe thought ſhe ſhould do the World
good Service in ridding it of ſo wicked
a <hi>Tyrant.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:43695:78"/>
After this<note n="k" place="margin">Elmacin lib. 1. c. 1.</note> he reduced under his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<hi>Beder, Watiha,</hi> and <hi>Selalima,</hi>
which were alſo <hi>Towns</hi> belonging to the
<hi>Jewiſh Arabs,</hi> who rendred to him on
<hi>Articles;</hi> and theſe were that they
ſhould continue in their former Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
paying for <hi>Tribute</hi> one half of
the income of their <hi>Date-trees</hi> every
year; but to be at his diſcretion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
them when he ſhould think fit. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of which Agreement
they ſtill retained their former Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and dwelt in them without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
till the Reign of <hi>Omer,</hi> who
pretending that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had given
charge in his laſt Sickneſs not to permit
<hi>two Religions</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> drove them
all out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Impoſtor</hi> by thoſe many Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
having now encreaſed his ſtrength
to an Army of Ten thouſand men,<note place="margin">Heg. 8. April 30. A. D. 629.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Mecca,</hi>
and therefore pretending they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the <hi>Truce,</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius p. 103. Elmacinus lib. 1. c. 1.</note> marched ſuddenly upon
them, before they were aware of his
Deſign; and therfore being totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
in that Surprize to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a poſture of defence againſt
him, they found themſelves neceſſitated
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43695:78"/>
to yield unto him. Whereon <hi>Abu So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi>
taking with him <hi>Al Abbas,</hi> one
of the Unkles of the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
of his <hi>Religion,</hi> had it ſeems tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſtill at <hi>Mecca)</hi> went out unto him,
and by turning <hi>Mahometan,</hi> ſaved his
life; and the City, without any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was rendred to him at diſcretion.
On his entry into it having put to death
ſuch as had been moſt violent againſt
him, all the reſt, without any further
oppoſition, ſubmitted unto him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his <hi>Religion.</hi> And therefore having
thus made himſelf abſolute Maſter of the
place, he immediately ſet himſelf to
purge the <hi>Caaba</hi> of its <hi>Idols,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
that <hi>Temple</hi> anew to his <hi>Religion,</hi>
as having reſolved ſtill to continue it in
its priſtine honour, by making it the
chief place of Worſhip for all of his Sect.
There<note n="m" place="margin">Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. pag. 95, 96, 97, 98.</note> were a multitude of <hi>Idols</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

ſtanding round its <hi>Area,</hi> all which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
cauſed to be pulled down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
and the place to be totally
cleared of them. The chief among thoſe
<hi>Idols</hi> were thoſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi>
within the <hi>Temple,</hi> and that of <hi>Hoball</hi>
without. The reſt were of <hi>Angels</hi> and
<hi>Prophets,</hi> and others of their principal
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43695:79"/>
               <hi>Saints</hi> departed, whom they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only as <hi>Mediators,</hi> in the ſame
manner as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now do their
<hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Images</hi> which they erect
unto them. For the <hi>Arabians</hi> always held
that there was<note n="n" place="margin">Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. pag. 107, &amp; 108.</note> but one only <hi>God the
Creator and Governor of all things,</hi> whom
they called <hi>Allah Tuall,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Supreme
God,</hi> and <hi>God of Gods,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi>
whom they durſt never repreſent by any
<hi>Image.</hi> But being (as they held) ſo
great and high, as not to be approached
to by men while here on <hi>Earth,</hi> but
through the mediation of Advocates or
Interceſſors interpoſing for them unto
him in <hi>Heaven;</hi> That <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Holy
men beatified</hi> might perform this Office
for them, was the reaſon that they ſet
up their <hi>Images,</hi> and built them <hi>Temples,</hi>
and directed their Worſhip and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

the whole of the <hi>Arabian Idolatry,</hi>
which <hi>Mahomet</hi> now by deſtroying theſe
<hi>Idols</hi> put a total end unto.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as it was heard among the
Neighbouring <hi>Arabs,</hi> that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had

<hi>Mahomet</hi>

driven back to the Walls of <hi>Mecca,</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Alcoran chap. 9.</note> which he aſcribes to the overconfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his men in their numbers;
which cauſing them to neglect their

over them. But the <hi>Impoſtor</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Bidawi &amp; Zamach Shari ib.</note> having gathered up his ſcattered
Forces, and rallied them again into a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
acted more cautiouſly in the ſecond
Conflict, and then,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Alcoran c. 9.</note> as he ſaith, by
the help of inviſible Troops of <hi>Angels</hi>
(which are reckoned by ſome <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi>
on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to be Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand),
and by others to be Sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand)
gave his Enemies ſuch a total
defeat,<note n="t" place="margin">Elmacin lib. 1. c. 1.</note> that he took from them their
Baggage, with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and all their Subſtance, which
conſiſted moſtly of great Flocks of
Sheep, and Herds of Cattle. For theſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43695:80"/>
being of the <hi>Nomad Arabs,</hi> it was their
Cuſtom to carry their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and all that they had with them,
where-ever they moved. After this
Battel, theſe People ſent <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi>
unto him to pray the reſtoration of their
Wives and Children, to whom <hi>Mahomet</hi>
gave this Option, to chuſe which they
would have again reſtored unto them,
either their Wives and Children, or
their Goods: Whereon they having
choſen their Wives and Children, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
divided all their Goods which he
had taken from them among his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
Only <hi>Melic Ebn Auf,</hi> their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
now he ſaw his Power was ſuch
as no more to be reſiſted, came in and
imbraced his <hi>Religion,</hi> and thereon had
all his Goods again reſtored unto him.</p>
            <p>The remaining part of the Year<note n="u" place="margin">Pocockii Hiſt. Arab. p. 91, &amp; 92.</note> was
ſpent in demoliſhing the <hi>Heathen Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and deſtroying their <hi>Idols</hi> in all
places through <hi>Arabia,</hi> where his Power
reached. To which purpoſe ſeveral of
his Commanders being ſent out with

Chalid</hi> that of <hi>Al <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza,</hi> and the
Temple of <hi>Boſſa</hi> built thereto, and
others the reſt of them. So that this
Year proved very fatal to the <hi>Idols</hi> of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43695:80"/>
the <hi>Arabs,</hi> they being moſt of them
now deſtroyed, and the former Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
of them forced to ſubmit to
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and imbrace his <hi>Impoſture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having brought moſt parts
of <hi>Arabia</hi> under his Power,<note place="margin">Heg. 9. April 20. A. D. 630.</note> the enſuing
Year<note n="vv" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p. 103. Elmacinus lib. 1. c. 1.</note> he turned his Arms towards <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
and poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Tabuc,</hi> a
Town belonging to the <hi>Greek Empire,</hi>
and from thence falling on the <hi>Princes</hi>
of <hi>Dauman</hi> and <hi>Eyla,</hi> forced them to
become <hi>Tributaries</hi> unto him, and then
returned to <hi>Medina</hi> in the Month <hi>Rajeb.</hi>
While he was abſent on this Expedition,
the <hi>Tayifians,</hi> whom he had begun to
beſiege the former Year, being much
preſſed by ſome of his Lieutenants,
whom he had committed the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that War unto, were forced to
ſubmit and imbrace his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> which
they had afore been ſo averſe unto; of
which he having received an account
on his return, he ſent thither <hi>Abu Sophian</hi>
to diſarm them of all their Weapons and
Inſtruments of War, and appointed <hi>Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Ebn Abulas</hi> to be their Governour.
And this was the laſt Year in which he
went to the War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:43695:81"/>
And now the Power of the <hi>Impoſtor</hi>
being much encreaſed,<note place="margin">Heg. 10. April 9. A. D. 631.</note> the fame of it ſo
terrified the reſt of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> which had

came in and ſubmitted to him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his <hi>Impoſture.</hi> So that this Year
his <hi>Empire</hi> and his <hi>Religion</hi> became eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
together through all <hi>Arabia,</hi> and
he ſent his Lieutenants into all parts of
it to govern in his Name, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
the <hi>Idol Temples,</hi> and all other
the remains of the <hi>Arabian Idolatry</hi>
where-ever they came, ſet up his new-invented
<hi>Religion</hi> in its ſtead, and forced
all men by the power of the Sword to
conform thereto.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of this Year being

Matters,<note n="y" place="margin">Elmacin lib. 1. c. 1. Abul Feda Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius p. 103.</note> towards the end of it <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
took a Journy in <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to

day of <hi>Dulhagha,</hi> which is the great day
of that <hi>Solemnity,</hi> where a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of people reſorted to him from all
parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whom he inſtructed in

<hi>Medina.</hi> This <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> of his is by

            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:43695:81"/>
But although he was arrived to this

his late <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> he began daily to
decline through the force of that Poiſon,
which he had taken three years before
at <hi>Caibar,</hi> which ſtill working in him,
at length brought him ſo low, as forced
him on the 28th day of <hi>Saphar</hi> (the
ſecond Month of their Year) to take
his Bed, and on the twelfth day of the
following Month he died, after having
been Sick thirteen days. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Sickneſs was a ſlow Fever,
which at length made him delirous,
whereon<note n="c" place="margin">Bochari. Shareſtani. Al Jannabi Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 178, 179.</note> he called for Pen, Ink, and
Paper, telling them that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
a Book to them, which ſhould
keep them from erring after his Death.
But <hi>Omar</hi> would not admit this, ſaying,
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſufficeth, and that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
through the greatneſs of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
knew not what he ſaid. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who were preſent, were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind, and expreſſed a great deſire,
that the Book might be wrote, which
their <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpoke to them of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43695:82"/>
a Contention aroſe between them,
ſome being of <hi>Omar</hi>'s mind, and ſome
of the contrary, at which <hi>Mahomet</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
offence, bid them all be gone,
telling them, That it did not become
them thus to contend in his preſence.
So the Book was not wrote, the loſs
of which was afterwards lamented by
ſome of his Followers as a great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>During his Sickneſs<note n="d" place="margin">Abul Feda Ebnol Athir Ebn Phares Al Jannabi.</note>, he much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the bit which he had taken
at <hi>Caibar,</hi> telling thoſe that came to
viſit him, That he had felt the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it in his Body ever ſince; that
at times it brought on him very dolorous
Pains, and that then it was going to
break his very Heart-ſtrings. And when
among others, there came to ſee him
the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Baſhar,</hi> who died on the
ſpot of that Poyſon,<note n="e" place="margin">Al Jannabi Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 190.</note> He cried out,
<hi>O Mother of</hi> Baſhar, <hi>the Veins of my
Heart are now breaking of the bit which
I eat with your Son at</hi> Chaibar. So it
ſeems notwithſtanding the intimacy he
pretended with the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and
the continual <hi>Revelations,</hi> which he brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that he received from him, he could
not be preſerved from thus periſhing,
by the Snares of a ſilly Girl.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:43695:83"/>
On his Death there was great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
among his Followers. Many of
them<note n="f" place="margin">Abul Feda Shareſtani Al Jannabi Pocockii Spec. Hiſt. Arab. p. 179.</note> would not believe that he could
dye. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>how can he dye
ſince he is to be a Witneſs to God for us?
It cannot be ſo, he is not dead, but is
only taken away for a ſeaſon, and will
return again, as did Jeſus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they went to the Door of the Houſe,
where the dead Corps lay, crying out,
<hi>Do not Bury him, for the Apoſtle of God
is not dead.</hi> And <hi>Omar</hi> being of the
ſame mind, drew his Sword, and ſwore,
that if any one ſhould ſay, That <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
was dead, he would immediately
cut him in pieces. <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the
Apoſtle of God is not dead, but only gone
for a ſeaſon; as</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Son of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
<hi>was gone from the People of</hi> Iſrael
<hi>for forty Days, and then returned to them
again.</hi> For the compoſing of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<hi>Abu Beker</hi> came in, crying out
unto them, <hi>Do you worſhip</hi> Mahomet,
<hi>or the God of</hi> Mahomet? <hi>If you worſhip
the God of</hi> Mahomet, <hi>he is Immortal
and liveth for ever; but as to</hi> Mahomet,
<hi>he certainly is dead.</hi> And then from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Paſſages in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he proved
that he muſt dye as well as other Men.
Which having ſatisfied <hi>Omar</hi> and his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43695:83"/>
Party, they then all took it for granted,
that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was dead, and no more
to return to Life again till the general
Reſurrection of all Mankind. What goes
ſo current among us, as if the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
expected <hi>Mahomet</hi> again to return
to them here on Earth, is totally an
Error. There is no ſuch Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, nor are there any of them,
that ever fancied ſuch a thing, ſince the
time that <hi>Omar</hi> was convinced of his
miſtake herein.</p>
            <p>But this diſorder was no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed

greater heat about his Burial. The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagerins,</hi>
that is, thoſe who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him in his Flight from <hi>Mecca,</hi> would
have him carried thither to be buried
in the place where he was Born. The
<hi>Anſars,</hi> that is, thoſe of <hi>Medina,</hi> who
joyned with him, would have him bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
there where he died. And there
were others, who had a phanſy to have
him carried to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there
buried among the Sepulchres of the
<hi>Prophets.</hi> For that, ſaid they, was the
City of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> And while each
Party ſtrove to have their own way
complied with, the Conteſt grew ſo
high, that they had like to have all
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43695:84"/>
gone together by the Ears; but that
the wiſdom of <hi>Abu Beker</hi> compoſed this
matter alſo. For he coming in, told
them, that he had often heard from
the <hi>Prophet</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Prophets</hi> were
to be buried in the place where they
died. And then without more ado com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Bed whereon he lay to be
plucked out, and a Grave to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
dug under it, to which all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and there they buried him
forthwith in the place where he died,
which was in the Chamber of <hi>Ayeſha,</hi>
his beſt beloved Wife at <hi>Medina,</hi> and
there he lieth to this day without <hi>Iron-Coffin</hi>
or <hi>Loadſtones</hi> to hang him in
the Air, as the Stories which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
go about of him among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulouſly
relate. There was indeed<note n="h" place="margin">Plinius, lib. 34. c. 14.</note>

had a device by building the Dome of

of <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> to make her Image all of
Iron hang in the middle of it, as if it
were in the Air; but there was no ſuch
attempt ever made as to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
Carkaſs. For that being buried in the
manner, as I have related, hath lain in

her. But for fear of the Scandal, which
his taking of her might give, he did all
he could to ſuppreſs his Flame, till at
length being able to reſiſt no longer,
he did break the matter to her, and
cauſed <hi>Zeyd</hi> to put her away, that he
might take her to Wife. Which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to ſubmit to; this gave great
Offence to all his Followers, that he,
who called himſelf a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and an
<hi>Apoſtle of God</hi> ſent to teach Men his
<hi>Law,</hi> ſhould for the gratifying of his
Luſt, do ſo ſcandalous a thing. But to
ſalve the matter, out comes the thirty
third Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> called the
<hi>Chapter of Hereſies,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> is brought
in declaring, That he had married
<hi>Zainab</hi> to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and given him
free liberty to enjoy her according to
his deſire; and alſo rebuking him, that
knowing <hi>God</hi> had given him this thing,
he ſhould abſtain ſo long from her out
of regard he had to the People, as if he
feared them more than <hi>God.</hi> However
this could not clear him ſo, but that
many of his followers are hard put to
it, to excuſe him from the Scandal of
this fact, even unto this day; and there
are ſome of them who make no doubt
to charge him with Sin on the account
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43695:89"/>
hereof. <hi>Zainab</hi> hereon becoming the
Wife of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> lived with him to the

in love with her. But how ſecret ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he managed the Amours for fear
of his Wives, <hi>Ayeſha</hi> and <hi>Haphſa</hi> found
it out, and catched them together in
the Fact. Whereon they reproached
him bitterly for it, that he who called
himſelf a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſent from <hi>God</hi> to teach
Men Righteouſneſs, ſhould do ſuch a
thing; at which being much confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he ſwore a ſolemn Oath, That in

and not ſay any thing of it to raiſe a
Scandal againſt him among his <hi>Muſſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
he would never have to do with
her more. On which Oath they were
content to paſs the matter over, and
ſay nothing of it. But <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Luſt
being of greater force with him than
his Oath, he could not long hold, but
was catched again with her by his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Wives. Whereon they flew out
into a deſperate Rage againſt him, and
after having loaded him with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Reproaches, both for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
as well as Adultery, went from
him to their Father's Houſes, which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a great Noiſe, and many being
offended with him for it; to ſmooth
the matter again, he hath recourſe to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43695:90"/>
his old Art, and out comes a new <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
to juſtify him in it, the Sixty
ſixth Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> called
the <hi>Chapter of Prohibition,</hi> wherein he
brings in <hi>God</hi> allowing <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and
all his <hi>Muſſlemans</hi> to lye with their Maids
when they will, notwithſtanding their
Wives. The firſt words of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

mayeſt pleaſe thy Wives? God hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you to lye with your Maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>

Women-ſlaves for their Luſt, as they

who never marries, hath all his
Women under this later Notion, that
is, as his Slaves, and he keeps none
but ſuch in his <hi>Seraglio;</hi> only after they

gives them the Name of <hi>Sultana,</hi> which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43695:91"/>

the matter to go thus, and that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
had in the ſame Chapter threatned
them with Divorce unleſs they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and were obedient; they ſent their
Fathers to him to make their Peace,
and again returned to his Houſe, and
totally ſubmitted for the future to his
Will in all things; and from that time
he lay with his Maid, <hi>Mary,</hi> as often
as he pleaſed without their any further
Contradiction or Controul, and had a
Son by her, who was called <hi>Abraham.</hi>
But after the Death of the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> no
account was had of her, or her Son; but
both were ſent away into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and no
mention made of either ever after among

hatred which ſhe bore her, procured of
her Father, who ſucceeded the <hi>Impoſtor</hi>

diſpoſed of.</p>
            <p>One of the main Arguments<note n="n" place="margin">Ahmed Ebn Zin.</note>, which
the Followers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> make uſe of
to excuſe his having ſo many Wives,
is, that he might beget young <hi>Prophets;</hi>
but notwithſtanding this, the left no
young Prophet nor Propheteſs neither
behind him of all his Wives. Of<note n="o" place="margin">Abul Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 103.</note> ſix

his firſt Wife, and none by any of the
others, they all died before him, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only <hi>Fatima,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Ali,</hi> and
ſhe ſurvived him only ſixty Days.</p>
            <p>As the gratifying of his Ambition,
and his Luſt, was the main end of his
<hi>Impoſture,</hi> ſo they both continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
through the whole Contexture of
it. At firſt his Ambition had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
in him; but when that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be ſomewhat ſatisfied by the
Power he had attained to, his Luſt grew
upon him with his Age, and at length
he ſeemed totally diſſolved into it. And
there are ſtrange things ſaid of him this
way<note n="p" place="margin">Guadagnol. Tract. 2. Cap. 7. Sect. 1. Richardi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futatio, c. 8. Diſputatio Chriſtiani, c. 6.</note>, as that he had in Venery the
ſtrength of forty other Men, and that
he knew all his Wives, when he had
eleven of them, one after another in
an<note n="q" place="margin">Johannes Andreas è li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro Aſſamail, cap. 7. Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagnol ex eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem libro, Tract. 2. Cap. 7. Sect. 1.</note> hours time. Whatever Laws he
gave to reſtrain the Luſt of other Men,
he took care always to except himſelf,
reſolving it ſeems to take his full ſwing
herein without let or controul, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the violent bent of his bruitiſh
Appetite, this way, ſhould lead him.
For,</p>
            <p>1. He<note n="r" place="margin">Alcoran. c. 4.</note> would not allow any other
to have above four Wives, but to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43695:92"/>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Alcoran. c. 33. Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Andreas, c. 7. Guadag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nol Tract. 2. c. 10. Sect. 3.</note> he reſerved a liberty to Marry
without reſtraint, as many as he ſhould
think fit, and he had ten together at the
ſame time, when he died.</p>
            <p>2. He obliged<note n="t" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 4.</note> all others, who have
two, three, or four Wives, to uſe
them all equally alike, both as to their
Cloathing, Diet, and the Duties of the
Marriage-bed. And in caſe any Wife
thinks her ſelf unequally uſed in any
of thoſe particulars, and that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
doth not as largely diſpenſe to her
of them, as to his other Wives, it is
allowed through all <hi>Mahometan Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
that ſhe make her Complaint to
the <hi>Judge,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> will give her
redreſs herein, and force the Husband
to do her Juſtice. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> reſerved
liberty to himſelf to do as he ſhould
ſe ſit as to this; and therefore when
ſome of his Wives were aggrieved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſhewed more favour to the
others, and particularly to <hi>Ayeſha</hi> than
to them, and made complaints againſt
him on this account: To ſtill their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
he brings in God in the Thirty
third Chapter of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> giving
him full liberty to deal with his Wives
as he ſhould think fit, to go in to which
he pleaſed and abſtain from which he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43695:92"/>
pleaſed; and commanding them to be
content herewith, and alſo to be well-pleaſed
with whatever elſe he ſhould do
in reference to them, accepting as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from him, whatſoever he ſhould
give them, and take Exceptions at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which he ſhould be pleaſed to
order concerning them.</p>
            <p>3. In the fourth Chapter of his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
which is called the <hi>Chapter of
Women,</hi> he forbids his <hi>Muſſlemans</hi> to
marry with their <hi>Mothers,</hi> their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law,</hi>
the <hi>Wives of their Fathers,</hi>
their <hi>Daughters,</hi> the <hi>Siſters of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
the <hi>Siſters of their Mothers,</hi> the
<hi>Daughters of their Brothers,</hi> the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of their Siſters,</hi> their <hi>Nurſes,</hi> their
<hi>Foſter-ſiſters,</hi> the <hi>Mothers of their
Wives,</hi> the <hi>Siſters of their Wives,</hi> the
<hi>Daughters of their Wives by other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi>
the <hi>Daughters of Women whom
they have known,</hi> and the <hi>Wives of their
Sons,</hi> and the <hi>married Wives of other
Men.</hi> And yet in the Thirty third
Chapter he brings in God exempting
him from this Law, and giving him
an eſpecial Priviledge to take to Wife
the Daughters of his Brother, or the
Daughters of his Siſter, and to go in
to any other Woman whatſoever of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43695:93"/>
Believers, that ſhall be willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
her ſelf unto him. But he there
takes care to appropriate this liberty
ſo particularly to himſelf alone, that
he excludes all others whatſoever from
it. For it ſeems, the old <hi>Lecher</hi> feared
his Luſt ſhould not be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, if any thing leſs than the
whole Sex were allowed him for the
gratifying of it; and therefore would
endure no reſtraint or limitation upon
himſelf herein, how ſtrictly ſoever he
lays it upon others. In the above-mentioned
<hi>Law</hi> he forbids the Marrying of
<hi>the Wives of other Men;</hi> and abundant
Reaſon there is for it, that no Man
ſhould be allowed adulterouſly to take
to Wife, her that is at the ſame time
the Wife of another; and yet he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
it in marrying the Wife of his
Servant <hi>Zeyd.</hi> But to allay the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
and Offence, which was taken
at it; and to ſecure others from fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the like Injury and Violence from
him, he was content after that to lay a
reſtraint upon himſelf to do ſo no more;
and therefore brings in God, telling
him in the ſame Thirty third Chapter
of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that it ſhall not be lawful
for him for the future to take another
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43695:93"/>
Man's Wife, how much ſoever he may
be taken with her Beauty.</p>
            <p>As he was thus brutiſhly enſlaved to
the love of Women, ſo was he as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
Jealous of thoſe whom he had
taken to Wife. And therefore to deter
them from what he feared<note n="u" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 33.</note>, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
them with double the puniſhment
of other Wives, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
in caſe they ſhould be falſe unto
him. And when ſome of his Followers
made too frequent reſort to his Houſe,
and there entred into diſcourſe with
ſome of his Wives, this gave him that
Offence, that to prevent it for the future,
out comes, as from <hi>God,</hi> thoſe Verſes
of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
               <note n="vv" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 33.</note>, wherein he tells them,
That they ſhould not enter into the
Houſe of the <hi>Prophet</hi> without permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that if invited to Dine with him,
they ſhould depart as ſoon as Dinner
was over, and not enter into diſcourſe
with his Wives; that although the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
be aſhamed to bid them be gone,
yet <hi>God</hi> is not aſhamed to tell them the
truth. And in the ſame Chapter he
forbids his Wives to ſpeak to any Man,
unleſs with their Faces vailed. And this
his jealouſy proceded ſo far, as to go
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43695:94"/>
beyond the Grave. For he could not
bear, that any one elſe ſhould have to
do with his Wives, though after his
Death; and therefore<note n="x" place="margin">Alcoran, c. 33.</note> ſtrictly forbids
all his Followers ever to go in to any of
them as long as they ſhould live. So
that although all other Women when
repudiated, or become Widows, had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Marry again, all his Wives
were excluded from it. And therefore
all thoſe, whom he left at his Death<note n="y" place="margin">Johannes Andreas, c. 7.</note>,
lived Widows ever after, although ſome
of them were very young; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Ayeſha,</hi> who was not then full
twenty Years old, and lived above eight
and forty Years after, which was in that
hot Country looked on, as a very hard
reſtraint put upon them.</p>
            <p>In all theſe inſtances I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it appears how much he made his
Impoſture ſerve his Luſt. And indeed
almoſt the whole of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> was<note n="z" place="margin">Richardi Confutatio, c. 12.</note>
in like manner framed to anſwer ſome
purpoſe or other of his, according as
occaſions required. If any new thing
were to be put on foot, any Objection
againſt him or his Religion to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
any Difficulty to be ſolved,
any Diſcontent among his People to be
quieted, any Offence to be removed,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43695:94"/>
or any thing elſe done for the Intereſt
of his Deſigns, his conſtant recourſe was
to the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> for a new <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and out comes ſome Addition to
his <hi>Alcoran</hi> to ſerve his turn herein.
So that the moſt of it was made on
ſuch like occaſions to influence his Party
to what he intended. And all his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators</hi>
thus far acknowledge it, that
they are on every Chapter very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in aſſigning for what Cauſes, and
for whoſe ſakes it was ſent down from
Heaven unto them. But hereby it came
to paſs that abundance of Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
got into this Book. For as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and the Deſigns of the <hi>Impoſtor</hi>
varied, ſo was he forced to make his
pretended <hi>Revelations</hi> to vary alſo,
which is a thing ſo well known to
thoſe of his <hi>Sect,</hi> that they all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it; and therefore where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
are ſuch, as they cannot
ſalve them, there they will have one
of the contradicting places to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.
And they reckon in the whole
<hi>Alcoran</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Johannes Andreas, c. Guadagnol. Tract. 2. Cap. 7. Sect. 3.</note>, above an hundred and fifty
Verſes which are thus <hi>revoked,</hi> which
is the beſt ſhift they can make to ſolve
the Contradictions and Inconſiſtencies
of it. But thereby they do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43695:95"/>
betray the Unſteadineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of him that was the Author
of it.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of his <hi>Impoſture,</hi> he
ſeemed more inclined to the <hi>Jews</hi> than
to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and in the firſt forming
of his new invented <hi>Religion,</hi> followed
the Patern of theirs more than any
other. But after his coming to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi>
he took that diſguſt againſt them,
that he became their bitter, and moſt
irreconcileable Enemy ever after, and
uſed them with greater Cruelty in his
Wars, than any other he had to deal
with.</p>
            <p>But to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> he ever carried
himſelf with as much favour as could
be expected from ſuch a <hi>Barbarian;</hi> and
where-ever they fell under his Power,
they had always good Terms from him.
His general Rule, and which he laid as
a ſtrict Obligation upon all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
was to fight for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>Religion.</hi> And there<note n="b" place="margin">Alcoran. c. 4. c. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Diſputatio Chriſtiani, c. 8. Richardi Confutatio, c. 1, 6, 7, &amp; 10. Cantacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeni, Orat. 1. Sect. 11.</note> were
only two Conditions on which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Peace to any he had to do with,
and theſe were either to come in to
his <hi>Religion,</hi> or ſubmit to be Tributaries
unto him. They that did the former,
were admitted into the ſame Privileges
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43695:95"/>
and Freedoms with the reſt of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers:
But the later had only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his Protection, as to their Goods
and Perſons, and free Exerciſe of their
Religion, without any other privilege
or advantage whatſoever, for which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man paid an Annual Tribute. But
thoſe, who would not come in, and
make Peace with him on one of theſe
two Conditions, were by his Law to be
put to the Sword. And this <hi>Law</hi> in every
one of its particulars is ſtill obſerved in
all <hi>Mahometan</hi> Countries, even to this
day. At firſt few ſubmitted to him,
but ſuch as he forced by Conqueſt;
but when his Power grew to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
then Multitudes both of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
and other <hi>Religions,</hi> flocked to
him for his Protection, and became his
<hi>Tributaries.</hi> And there hath in this

at <hi>Paris,</hi> and after by <hi>Fabricius</hi> at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoch,</hi>
a Writing in <hi>Arabick,</hi> which
bears the Title of an <hi>Ancient Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> with
this <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> which is ſaid to have

rejects it as a <hi>Forgery;</hi> and good reaſon
he had ſo to do. For it bears date in
the fourth Year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> when
<hi>Mahomet</hi> was not yet in a condition to
ſpeak in that Language, which he is
made to do in that Writiting; nor was
his Power then ſo formidable, as to move
any to pray his Protection, he having
not long before been overthrown and
beaten at the Battle of <hi>Ohud;</hi> and at the
time this <hi>Inſtrument</hi> bears date (which
was the fourth Month of that Year)
not fully recovered from that Blow;
but in the loweſt Circumſtances, he had
at any time been ſince his taking the
Sword for the propagating of his <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi>
And there is another particular in
it, which manifeſtly diſcovers the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.
It makes <hi>Moawias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abu
Sophian,</hi> to be the Secretary to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,</hi>
who drew the <hi>Inſtrument;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is certain, that <hi>Moawias,</hi> with his
Father <hi>Abu Sophian,</hi> was then in Arms
againſt him; and it was not till the
taking of <hi>Mecca,</hi> which was four Years
after that they came in unto him, and
to ſave their Lives imbraced the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi>
This <hi>Inſtrument</hi> is to be read in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Hiſtory of the Preſent
State of the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Empire,</hi> Book 2.
Chap. 2.</p>

However this is certain, that the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> had better Terms from him
than any other of his <hi>Tributaries,</hi> and
they enjoy them, even, to this day; there
being no <hi>Mahometan</hi> Country where
their <hi>Religion</hi> is not eſteemed the beſt
next their own, and the Profeſſors of
it accordingly reſpected by them before
the <hi>Jews, Heathens,</hi> or any other ſort
of Men that differ from them.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Impoſtor</hi> allowed the <hi>Old and

wrote an Anſwer to it, which he
calls <hi>The Bruſher of the Looking-Glaſs,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

<hi>Book</hi> came abroad, it ſo allarmed <hi>the College
de propaganda Fide</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ordered it to be anſwered. The firſt
who was appointed for this Work was <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventura
Malvaſia,</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan Frier</hi> of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
who publiſhed his <hi>Dilucidatio Speculi
verum monſtrantis,</hi> in anſwer to this <hi>Bruſher,
A. D.</hi> 1628. But this, I ſuppoſe, not being
judged ſo ſufficient by the <hi>College,</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Philip Guadagnol,</hi> another <hi>Franciſcan
Frier,</hi> to write a ſecond Anſwer thereto.
And on this occaſion he compoſed his Book

For this, I ſuppoſe, meeting with better
approbation from the <hi>College,</hi> they ordered
it to be tranſlated into that Language, and
it being accordingly done by the ſame <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
they ſent it into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed

doth by no means anſwer the Deſign, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

at the <hi>Sepulcher</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> on <hi>Eaſter

have believed to be by fire from <hi>Heaven,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:43695:103"/>
and then a multitude of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are preſent with <hi>Candles</hi> to light them
at this <hi>holy Fire,</hi> which hath been a fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Practice kept up among them for many
hundred years. And the <hi>Emperor Cantacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenus</hi>
was ſo far impoſed on by this Cheat
that in his Third <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
againſt the <hi>Mahometans</hi> he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, and urgeth it againſt thoſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
as a <hi>Miracle,</hi> which being annually
performed in their ſight, ought to convince
them of the truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi>
and convert them thereto. But the <hi>Impoſture</hi>
hath all along been too well known to the
<hi>Mahometans</hi> to be of any ſuch effect with
them. For the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
compounds with the <hi>Mahometan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi>
to permit him to practiſe this Trick
for the ſake of the Gain which it brings to
his <hi>Church,</hi> and annually allows him his
ſhare in it. And therefore, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any effect to convert them, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a matter of continual ſcandal among
them againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And not
only this <hi>Author,</hi> but <hi>Ahmed Ebn Edris,</hi> and
moſt others of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that write
againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> object it as a
reproach thereto (as in truth it is) and urge
it with the ſame earneſtneſs againſt <hi>the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion,</hi> that <hi>Cantacuzenus</hi> doth for it.
<hi>Al Manſor Hakem Beamrilla, Calif</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
was ſo offended at it, that <hi>A. D.</hi> 1007. he
ordered the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
wherein this <hi>Chappel</hi> of the <hi>Sepulchre</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:43695:104"/>
ſtands, to be for this very reaſon pulled down
and raſed to the Ground, that he might
thereby put an end to ſo infamous a Cheat.
But the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> having
by the releaſe of Five thouſand <hi>Mahometan
Captives,</hi> obtained leave to have it rebuilt
again, the <hi>Impoſture</hi> hath ſtill gone on at the

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43695:111"/>
there are two Editions; the firſt <hi>A. D.</hi> 1651.
and the ſecond <hi>A. D.</hi> 1660. the later is
much enlarged. The <hi>Author</hi> was <hi>Profeſſor</hi>
of the <hi>Oriental Tongues,</hi> firſt at <hi>Zurich</hi> in
<hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Heidelbergh;</hi>
from whence being called to be <hi>Profeſſor</hi> at
<hi>Leiden,</hi> he was while on his removal thither,
unfortunately drowned in the <hi>Rhine.</hi> He
was a Man of great Induſtry and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but having written very much within
the compaſs of a few Years (for he died
young), his Books want Accuracy; though
all of them have their Uſe.</p>

The <hi>Author</hi> of this Book was
formerly an <hi>Alfaki,</hi> or a <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan
Law;</hi> but in the Year 1487. being
at <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> converted to the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion,</hi> he was received into Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and wrote this Book in <hi>Spainſh</hi> againſt
the <hi>Religion</hi> which he forſook; from whence
it was tranſlated into <hi>Italian,</hi> by <hi>Dominicus de
Gazelu,</hi> A. D. 1540. And out of that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,</hi>
it was publiſhed in <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Lauterbach,</hi> A. D. 1595. and reprinted
by <hi>Voetius</hi> at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> A. D. 1656. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
throughly underſtood the <hi>Religion</hi> which
he confutes, doth much more pertinently
write againſt it, than many others do, that
handle this Argument.</p>

and <hi>Arabic Tongues</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> who was
for Eminency of Goodneſs, as well as
Learning, the greateſt Ornament of the
Age in which he lived, and God bleſſed
him with a long Life to be uſeful thereto.
He was born <hi>A. D.</hi> 1604. and died at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi>
in <hi>Oxford</hi> in the Month of <hi>September,</hi>
A. D. 1691. He was for above ſixty Years
a conſtant Editor of learned and uſeful
Books. The firſt which he publiſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
an Edition of four of the <hi>Catholick Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
in <hi>Syriac,</hi> i. e. the ſecond of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the
ſecond and third of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> with Verſions and Notes, which
was printed at <hi>Leiden,</hi> A. D. 1630. by <hi>Voſſius,</hi>
to whom he preſented it the year before at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> on his coming thither to ſee that
<hi>Univerſity;</hi> and the laſt was his <hi>Commentary</hi>
on <hi>Joel,</hi> which came forth the year in which
he died. His <hi>Specimen Hiſtoriae Arabicae,</hi>
which I frequently make uſe of in this Tract,
was publiſhed <hi>A. D.</hi> 1650. and is a moſt
accurate and judicious Collection out of the
beſt <hi>Arab Writers,</hi> relating to the Subject
which he handles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richardi Confutatio Legis Saracenicae.</hi> The
<hi>Author</hi> was a <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> who in the
Year 1210. went to <hi>Bagdad</hi> of purpoſe to
ſtudy the <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> out of their
own Books in order to confute it; and on
his return publiſhed this Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43695:112"/>
Tract concerning it. <hi>Demetrius Cydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
tranſlated it into <hi>Greek</hi> for the <hi>Emperor
Cantacuzenus,</hi> who makes great uſe of it,
taking thence moſt of that which he hath
of any moment in his four <hi>Orations</hi> againſt
the <hi>Mahometan Religion.</hi> From this <hi>Greek
Verſion</hi> of <hi>Demetrius Cydonius,</hi> it was Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
back again into <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Bartholomaeus
Picenus,</hi> which Tranſlation is publiſhed with
the <hi>Latin Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Bibliander,</hi> and that is
all we now have of it, the Original being
loſt. This and <hi>Johannes Andreas</hi>'s Tract <hi>de
Confuſione Sectae Mahometanae,</hi> are the beſt of
any that have been formerly publiſhed by
the <hi>Weſtern Writers</hi> on this Argument, and
beſt accord with what the <hi>Mahometans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
teach of their <hi>Religion.</hi> Others have
too much ſpent themſelves on falſe Notions
concerning it, for want of an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that which they wrote againſt.</p>

of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to the Year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> 1150.
The <hi>Author</hi> was <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and was preſent at the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi>
A. D. 1215. His <hi>Hiſtory</hi> from the Tenth
Chapter is moſtly confined to the <hi>Saracens</hi>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and is but of little Credit, where
he relates any thing of them out of that
<hi>Country.</hi> It was publiſhed with <hi>Erpenius</hi>'s
