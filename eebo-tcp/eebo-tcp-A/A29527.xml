            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Their <hi>welfare</hi> (I say), and that both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi>; both which have a great dependance upon the Supream Governour of a Nation: who if he be wise and faithful, now he is a great blessing unto his People, so as they are blessed in him. So saith <hi>David</hi> of this his son <hi>Solomon</hi> in the verse next but one after the Text, ver. 17. <hi>Men shall be blessed in him.</hi> They should count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy in such a King, expecting all kind of blessings through him; Blessings (as I said) both <hi>Temporall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall,</hi> both which should be the fruit of his Government.

            </p>
            <p>Such are the <hi>blessings of a righteous Government</hi>: And are not all these worthy of the prayers of those who live under it? that they should be instant and earnest with God in the behalf of those whom he hath set over them? Upon this account the Apostle in that Text fore-cited, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. exhorts Christians, not to be wanting in this Duty. <hi>Pray for Kings, &amp;c. That we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and honesty.</hi> These are the chief blessings that Christians are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, or indeed can desire upon Earth; that they may live a <hi>quiet and peaceable life,</hi> as to <hi>Temporals</hi>; and that they may live in all <hi>Godlinesse and Honesty,</hi> as to <hi>Spirituals.</hi> Now these are no where to be enjoyed so well, as under a just and righteous Government. And therefore it behoveth them who would have their share in these blessings, to cast this <hi>Tribute</hi> into the common Treasury, to contribute their prayers and supplications, seeking God in the behalf of their Governours, that God would protect them, direct them, assist them, giving his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them, that so they may rule his People in his fear.</p>
            <p>Thus you see what Reasons there are why Christians should readily and willingly pay this <hi>Tribute</hi> to those whom God hath set over them; why they should <hi>pray</hi> as for all in Authority, so in a special manner for those who are <hi>Supream,</hi> which <hi>Kings</hi> are within their Dominions (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13).

Which having had, she departed fully satisfied, finding the reality of his worth far exceeding the report; which at her departure she acknowledged, as we find it, 1 King. 10.6, &amp;c. <hi>And she said unto the King, It was a true report that I heard in mine own Land of thy Acts, and of thy Wisdom.

            <p>And so he was of his own <hi>Subjects,</hi> who being (as I said) blessed in him, blessed him. Even as he, speaking of good Wife, who is wise and careful in ordering the businesse of her Family, saith, <hi>Her Children rise up, and call her blessed; her Husband also, and he praiseth her,</hi> Prov. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

daily praising of him. Thus was this <hi>Tribute</hi> payed unto him.</p>
            <p>And so let it be by us to our Royal <hi>Soveraign.</hi> And that upon a double account; the <hi>Vertues</hi> which are eminent in him, and the <hi>Benefits</hi> which we have received from him: His <hi>vertues,</hi> which are truly praise-worthy. Such is the <hi>Patience</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he hath shewen in bearing of so many, so great, so long continued Sufferings, as during his so many years exile he hath had experience of. And such is his <hi>Constan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithstanding his case was much like unto <hi>David</hi>'s, who complaining unto King <hi>Saul</hi> of his hard Usage from his malicious Enemies, saith, <hi>They have driven me out this day from abiding in the Inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go serve other gods,</hi> 1 Sam. 26.19. Being by their means driven and kept out of his own Land, where he enjoyed the Ordinances of God freely, he was forced to wander from place to place, from Country to Country, to have his abode in Idolatrous Nations; By which doing of theirs, they did as much in them lay, force and compel him to turn Idolater. And even such hath been the condition of this our dread <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and that for many years together; yet, through the good providence of God watching over him, he hath continued constant to his Religion, as <hi>David</hi> did. To these add his <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> wherein he is exemplary to his Subjects, setting a Copy for them to write after. As also his <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> which he hath declared by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such indulgence to consciences truly tender, which he would not have pressed under the burden of offensive &amp; unnecessary observances; as by desiring and endeavouring an accommodation of differences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there might be (as to matters of lesser concernment) a Christian compliance amongst persons of different perswasions.

            <p>THese words (as you lately heard) may be looked upon two wayes, <hi>Literally</hi> and <hi>Mystically. Literally,</hi> as relating to King <hi>Solomon; Mystically</hi> as relating to King <hi>Iesus.</hi> With the former of these I have done. It now remains that I come to the latter, to look upon the words as relating unto <hi>Christ</hi>; of whom King <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Type.</p>

And herein was he a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> whom we find described to be such a <hi>Prince,</hi> having this Name given unto him, Esay 9.6. <hi>His Name shall be called, The Prince of Peace; Shir Shalom,</hi> the <hi>mystical Solomon.</hi> To which we may

Which Name, how fitly it agreeth unto <hi>Christ,</hi> we may learn from that Voice from Heaven, which was heard at his Baptism; <hi>saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,</hi> Matth. 3.17.

augmented and increased. A prophecy which as yet hath not had the full accomplishment, so as it shall have in the time appointed. There is a day a coming when the Scepter of Christ shall be advanced: <hi>In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious</hi>; so saith the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap. 4. ver. 2. speaking of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom we find sometimes called a <hi>Branch, the Branch,</hi> as Zach. 3.8. <hi>I will bring forth my Servant the Branch.</hi> And again, Chap. 6. ver. 12. <hi>Behold the man, whose Name is the Branch</hi>; meaning the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> springing from the root of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and from whom all spiritual Graces and Blessings do spring, as leaves, and blossoms, and fruits do from the Branch. Of this <hi>Branch</hi> it is there said, it shall be <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And so it shall be <hi>in that day, viz.</hi> when the Church shall be increased and inlarged as it shall be, all Nations being brought under the Government of Jesus Christ.

And this promise (as already in part it is, so) it shall be fully made good to him in the latter dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> after the destruction of <hi>Anti-christ.</hi> So we find it foretold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. where we read of a gratulatory Acclamation made by the People of God at that great alteration and change that should be made in the Church. <hi>And the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great Voyces in Heaven, saying; The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever.</hi> The Roman <hi>Anti-christ</hi> being destroyed, now the Kingdom of Christ shall be inlarged; his visible Church shall be like an <hi>Empire,</hi> spreading through the World, and lasting to the end of it.</p>
            <p>Thus it shall be, the Kingdom of Christ upon Earth shall be a <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdom,</hi> his Church shall be setled and established, and it shall prosper and flourish, it shall be made a praise in the Earth. And for this are all that profess themselves the Subjects of Christ to pray. So they are called upon by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap. 62. ver. 67. <hi>Ye that mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Churche's Exaltation is his Exaltation: <hi>Behold my Servant</hi> (saith the Lord, speaking of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Son Christ, whom he calleth <hi>his Servant</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

And so he shall be in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> his Church, which he governing with so much prudence and wisdom as he doth, and shall do, it shall be exalted, and He exalted in its Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Thus is <hi>God</hi> said to be <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>lifted up,</hi> by doing great things for his Church and People against his and their Enemies. So the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> hath it, Esay 33. <hi>The Lord is exalted, for He dwelleth on High, He hath filled</hi> Zion <hi>with Iudgment and Righteousness.</hi> And again, ver. 10. <hi>Now will I arise</hi> (saith the Lord), <hi>now will I be exalted, now will I lift up my self.</hi> So he is said to be, when he manifesteth his Power and Goodness in shewing any special favour to his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and executing any signal Judgments upon his and their Enemies. Now his <hi>Name is exalted,</hi> as the same Prophet hath it, <hi>Esay</hi> 12.4. where exciting the People to bless God for his great mercies to his Church, <hi>In that day</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall ye say, Praise the Lord, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And upon this account are his Subjects to <hi>pray for him</hi>; which we find the <hi>Psalmist</hi> doing, Psal. 18.46. <hi>The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted.</hi>
