         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore that he might enioy Chriſt, and ſerue him with a quiet conſcience, he left the lands, liuings, and honoures of a Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the comſorts of his Lady and children, the pleaſures of <hi>Italy,</hi> his credit with the Emperour, his kinred with the Pope, and forſaking all for the loue of Ieſus Chriſt, came to <hi>Geneua,</hi> and there liued a poore and meane, but yet an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and an holy life for fortie yeares. And though his father, his Lady, his kinſemen; yea the Emperour and the Pope did all they could to reclaime him, yet continued he conſtant to the end, and liued and died the bleſſed ſeruant of God, about fifteene yeares agoe, leauing behind him a rare example to all ages.</p>
            <p>This (right Houourable) is a briefe of the whole, and it is a ſtory admirable and imitable if any other in this later age of the world.</p>

I meane of noble <hi>Galeacius,</hi> I ſay too little, when I haue ſaid all I can. But this I muſt needs ſay: So religions, ſo noble, ſo vertuous was the man, ſo reſolute, ſo holy, ſo heroicall was the fact, ſo ſtrange the beginning, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and extraordinary the perſeuerance, as if the ſtory were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed by the rudenes of my tranſlation; I durſt ſay, none ſo great but might reade it, nor ſo good but might follow it.

               </hi> ſo did <hi>Galeac us</hi> from the ſuperſtition of Popery. But all this is nothing to that which they both ſuffred for their conſcience. What <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffred Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs: <hi>Moſes when he was come to yeares refuſed to</hi>

               <hi>be called the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter: and choſe rather to ſuffer aduerſitie with the people of God, then to enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon; ſteeming the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of Egypt:</hi> Nay <hi>Moſes</hi> had rather be a baſe bricke-maker amongſt the oppreſſed <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being true Chriſtians; then to be the ſonne of a Kings daughter in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> amongſt Idolaters. In like caſe noble <hi>Galeacius,</hi> when he was come to yeares and knowledge of Chriſt, refuſed to be called ſonne and heire to a Marqueſſe, Cup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hearer to an Emperour, Nephew to a Pope; and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction, perſecution, baniſhment, loſſe of lands, liuings, wife, children; honours, and preferments, then to enioy the ſinfull pleaſures of <hi>Italy</hi> for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the rebuke of Chriſt grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riches then the honours of a Marqueſdome without Chriſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing hee muſt either want Chriſt or want them, hee diſpoyled himſelfe of all theſe to gaine Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If (right Honourable) the wife fooles of this world might haue the cenſuring of theſe two men and their actions, they would preſently iudge them a couple of impaſſionate and ſtoicall fellowes, or elſe melancholike and brame-ſicke men, to refuſe Marqueſdomes and Kingdomes for ſcruple of co nſcience: but no matter as long as the men are Saints in heauen, and their actions honoured of God and his Angels; admired of good men, and neglected of none, but thoſe who as they will not follow them on earth, ſo are they ſure neuer to follow them to heauen. So excellent was the fact of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo heroicall, that the holy Ghoſt vouchſafes it remembrance both in the olde and new Teſtament, that ſo the Church
<pb facs="tcp:637:3"/>
in all ages might know it and admire it: and doth Chronicle it in the Epiſtle to the <hi>H brewes,</hi> almoſt two thouſand yeares after it was done. If God himſelfe did ſo to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhall not Gods Church be carefull to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to poſterity this ſecond <hi>Moſes?</hi> whoſe loue to Chriſt Ieſus was ſo zealous, and ſo inflamed by the heauenly fire of Gods ſpirit, that no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temptations could either quench or abate it; but to winne Chriſt, and to enioy him in the liberty of his word and Sacraments, he delicately contemned the honors and pleaſures of the Marqueſdome of <hi>Vicum. Vicum</hi> one of the Paradiſes of <hi>Naples: Naples</hi> the Paradiſe of <hi>Italy: Italy</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: Europe</hi> o<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the earth: yet all theſe Paradiſes were nothing to him, in compariſon of attaining the celeſtiall Paradiſe, there to liue with Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If any Papiſts (muſing as they vſe, and meaſuring vs by themſelues) do ſuſpect the ſtory to be ſome fained thing, deuiſed to allure and intiſe the peoples minds; and to ſet a flouriſh vpon our Religion, as they by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand falſe and fained ſtories and mirables vſe to doe. I anſwere, firſt in the generall; farre be it from vs and our Religion to vſe ſuch meanes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our ſelues, or againſt our aduerſaries: No, we are content the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue the glory of that garland: Popery being a ſandie and a ſhaken, a rotten and a tottering building needs ſuch proppes to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſet it: but truth dare ſhew her ſelfe, and feares no colours. But for the particular, I anſwere: cunning liers (as many Monkes were) framed their tales of men that liued long agoe, and places a farre off and vnknowen; that ſo their reports may not too eaſily be brought to triall. But in this caſe it is far otherwiſe; the circumſtances are notorious; the perſons and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces famouſly knowen: <hi>Vicum, Naples, Italy, Geneua,</hi> are places wel knowen: <hi>Calantonius</hi> his father, <hi>Charles</hi> the fiſt, his Lord and Maſter, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth his vncle, were perſons well knowen: examine either places or perſons, and ſpare none; truth ſeekes no corners; diſproue the ſtory who can, we craue no ſparing: neither is the time too farre paſt, but may ſoone be examined. He was borne within theſe hundred years, and died at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> within theſe twenty yeares: and his ſonnes ſonne at this day is Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Vicum.</hi> Let any Papiſt doe what he can, he ſhall haue more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in following the example, then credit in ſeeking to diſproue the ſtorie.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of my poore reading (right Honourable) I haue often found mention of this noble Marqueſſe, and of his ſtrange conuerſion; but the ſtorie it ſelfe, I firſt found it in the exquiſit Library of the good gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Maſter <hi>Gee;</hi> one that honours learning in others, and cheriſheth it in himſelfe; and hauing not once red it, but often peruſed it, I thought it great loſſe to our Church to want ſo rare a iewel; and therfore could not but take the benefit of ſome ſtolne houres to put the ſame into our tongue, for the benefit of my brethren in this Realme, who want knowledge in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and Latine tongues. And now being tranſlated, I humbly offer and conſecrate it to my holy mother the Church of <hi>Fngland;</hi> who may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to ſee her Religion ſpredding it ſelfe priuily in the heart of <hi>Italy;</hi> and to ſee the Popes nephew become her ſonne. And next of all vnto you (right Honourable) to whom I am bound in ſo many bonds of duety, and
<pb facs="tcp:637:4"/>
to whom this ſtory doth ſo fitly appertaine. You (my honourable good Lord) may here ſee a noble gentleman of your own rank in deſcent, birth, education, aduancements like your ſelfe; to be like you alſo in the loue and liking of the ſame holy Religion. And you good Madam, may here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue &amp; iudge by your ſelfe, how much more happy this noble Marqueſſe had bin, if his Lady Madam <hi>Victoria</hi> had bin like your ſelfe. I meane, if ſhe had followed and accompanied her Lord in that his moſt holy and happy conuerſion. And you all (right Honourable) in this noble Marqueſſe as in a cryſtal glaſſe, may behold your ſelues: of whom I hope you wil giue me leaue to ſpeake (that which to the great glory of God you ſpare not to ſpeake of your ſelues) that you were once darknes, but now are light in the Lord: Bleſſed be that God the father of light, whoſe glorious light hath ſhined into your hearts: Behold (right honorable) you are not alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an <hi>Italian;</hi> behold a noble Marqueſſe hath broken the ice, and troden the path before you: In him you may ſee that Gods Religion is as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as in <hi>England:</hi> I meane that though the face of <hi>Italy</hi> be the ſeat of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> yet in the heart thereof there is a remnant of the Lord of hoſts. You may ſee this noble Marqueſſe in this ſtory now after his death, whom in his life time ſo many noble Princes deſired to ſee. His body hath lien in the bowels of the earth theſe ſeuenteene yeares, but his ſoule liues in heauen in the boſome of Ieſus Chriſt, and his Religion in your hearts, and his name ſhall liue for euer in this ſtory. Accept it therfore (right honourable) and if for my ſake you will vouchſafe to read it once ouer, I dare ſay that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for your owne ſake you will read it ouer and ouer againe: which if you do, you ſhall find it wil ſtir vp your pure minds, &amp; inflame your hearts with a yet more earneſt zeale to the truth: and wil be an effectuall meanes to increaſe your faith, your feare of God, your humility, patience, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy, and al other holy vertues of regeneration. And for my part, I freely &amp; true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe I haue bin often rauiſht with admiration of this noble example; to ſee an <hi>Italian,</hi> ſo excellent a Chriſtian, one ſo neere the Pope, ſo neere to Ieſus Chriſt; and ſuch bleſſed fruit to bloſſome in the Popes own garden; and to ſee a noble man of <hi>Italy</hi> forſake that for Chriſt, for which, I feare, many amongſt vs would forſake Chriſt himſelfe. And ſurely (I confeſſe truth) the ſerious conſideration of this ſo late, ſo true, ſo ſtrange an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath bin a ſpur to my ſlownes, &amp; whetted my dul ſpirits, and made me to eſteeme more highly of Religion then I did before. I know it is an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of my ſelfe, &amp; a diſcloſing of my own ſhame to confeſſe thus much; but it is a glory to God, an honour to Religion, a credit to the truth, and a praiſe to this noble Marqueſſe, and therefore I will not hide it.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould I ſhame to confeſſe it? when that famous &amp; renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man of God, holy <hi>Caluine</hi> freely confeſſeth (as in the ſequell of this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you ſhall heare) that this noble mans example did greatly confirme him in his Religion, and did reuiue and ſtrengthen his faith, and cheere vp all the holy graces of God in him. And ſurely (moſt worthy Lord, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ladies) this cannot but confirme and comfort you in your holy courſes, and as it were put a new life vnto the graces of God in you, when you ſee, what; not the common people, but euen ſuch as were like your

ſelues haue ſuffred for Religion; and when you ſee that not only the poore and baſer ſort of men, but euen the mighty and honourable (as your ſelues are) doe thinke themſelues honored by embracing Religion. Pardon my plainenes and too much boldnes with your honors, &amp; vouchſafe to accept it as proceeding from one who much tendreth your ſaluations, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth with many thouſands more, to behold the mighty &amp; gracious work of God in you. Goe forward right noble Lord, in the name of the Lord of hoſts, ſtill to honour that honorable place you hold, ſtil to defeat the vaine expectation of Gods enemies; and to ſatisfie the godly hopes and deſires of holy men: ſtill to diſcountenance Popery and all prophanenes: ſtil by your perſonall diligence in frequenting holy exerciſes, to bring on that backward citie: by your godly diſcipline in your familie, to reforme or to condemne the diſſolutnes and diſorder of the moſt great families in this country: ſtil to miniſter iuſtice without delay; to cut vp contentions, &amp; ſaue the lawyers labour: ſtill to relieue the fatherleſſe and the widow, and helpe the poore againſt their oppreſſors: and which is all in all, ſtill to ſupplant ſuperſtition, popery, ignorance, and wilfull blindnes; and to plant and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe true Religion in that citie, and theſe Northern countries. By al theſe meanes ſtill ſhewing your ſelfe an holy and zealous Phinehes (vnder the great Phinehes our moſt worthy Soueraigne) to execute Gods iudgement, and to take vengeance on the Zimri and Cozbi of our nation: namely, on Popery and prophanenes; the two great ſinnes which haue pulled downe Gods plagues on our land, and the due and zealous puniſhment whereof, will be the meanes againe to remoue them.</p>
            <p>But I wrong your Honours to trouble you with theſe my too many and too ragged lines: and I wrong this noble Gentleman to cloth his golden ſtory with this my rude and home-ſpun <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtile: and I wrong you all to keepe you ſo long from being acquainted with this noble Marqueſſe, ſo like your ſelues; at whoſe meeting and acquaintance I am ſure there will be ſo much reioycing, and mutuall congratulating at the mighty and gratious worke of God in you all. The ſame God and mercifull father I humbly beſeech, and euer will, to accompliſh his good worke in you, as he did in that noble Marqueſſe: and as he hath already made you ſo many waies bleſſed; bleſſed in your ſelues, bleſſed one in another, bleſſed in your conuerſions, bleſſed aboue many, in your many and religious children: ſo at laſt he may make you moſt of all bleſſed in your ends; that ſo after this life, you may attaine the eternall glory of a better world, whither this noble Marqueſſe is gone before you.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E was borne at <hi>Naples,</hi> a renowned Citie in <hi>Italie,</hi> in the moneth of Ianuary, in the yeare of Chriſt 1517.<note n="a" place="margin">The very yeare when <hi>Luther</hi> began to preach the Goſpell.</note> His fathers name was <hi>Calanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who was deſcended of the ancient and noble houſe of the <hi>Caracciolies</hi> in the Country of <hi>Capua.</hi> This <hi>Calantonius</hi> euen in his youth, was not onely well reſpected, but highly eſteemed, and a familiar friend of that noble Prince of <hi>Orarge,</hi> who after the taking and ſacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> was placed in the roome of the Duke of <hi>Borben:</hi> yea his faithfulneſſe and induſtry was ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued to the Prince (as often times afore, ſo eſpecially) at the ſiege of <hi>Naples,</hi> what time it was aſſaulted by <hi>Lotrechius,</hi> as that afterward, when the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fiſt of that name, (who then was at <hi>Rome</hi> to receiue the Imperiall crowne and other ornaments of the Empire) did appoint the ſaid Prince with certaine forces, to go and beſiege the Citie of <hi>Florence;</hi> he thought it needfull to take the ſaid <hi>Calantonius</hi> with him, for his wiſedome and graue counſell. From whence when that ſeruice was ended, he being ſent to <hi>Caſar</hi> himſelfe, he did ſo wiſely demeane himſelfe in all his affaires, and did ſo ſufficiently ſatisfie the Emperour in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:637:6"/>
all things, that he made good in euery point, that worthy teſtimony which the Prince had giuen of him; whereupon he being at that time moſt honourably entertained of the Emperour himſelfe, was by him not only aduanced to the ſtate and title of a Marqueſſe, but alſo equally ioyned in commiſſion with the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> (for his wiſedome and experience in all kind of affaires) to be aſſiſtant vnto him, and fellow with him in ſwaying the Scepter of that Kingdome. In which office and function hee ſo caried himſelfe, as he wonne the good will of both ſmall and great, as wel of the Nobles, as of the Commonalty: yea inſomuch as he was deepely inueſted in the fauour of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> and king <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne. And ſo he continued in this dignitie till the laſt day of his life, which was in the moneth of February, in the yeare 1562. he being himſelfe more then three ſcore and ten yeares of age.</p>
            <p>Such a father, and no worſe had this <hi>Galeacius.</hi> As for his mother, ſhe was deſcended of the noble familie of the <hi>Caraffi:</hi> and her owne brother was afterward<note n="*" place="margin">That is, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth.</note> Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which I affirm notto that end, as though this in it ſelf was any true praiſe or honour to <hi>Galeacius,</hi> but that his loue to true Religion, and his conſtancy in defence thereof, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt ſuch mighty ones) may appeare the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to all that heare it, as it hereby did to all that knew him. Ofwhich his loue to true Religion, we ſhall ſpeake more anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galeacius</hi> being twenty yeares olde, and the onely ſonne of his mother, who was now deceaſed; his father <hi>Calantoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being deſirous to continue his name, to preſerue his houſe and poſteritie, and to maintaine his eſtate and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, whoſe lands amounted to the ſumme of fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand poundes a yeare and vpward; did therefore prouide him a wife, a Virgin of noble birth, called <hi>Victoria,</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi>Nuceria,</hi> one of the principal Peeres of <hi>Italy,</hi> with whom he had in name of portion or dowrie ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fiue hundred pounds.

            <p>Now all theſe particulars doe I thus ſet downe to this end, that the perſeuerance of ſo great a man may appeare the better by all theſe circumſtances, which is no leſſe then a moſt glorious victory ouer ſo many temptations.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of his preferment at Court, and the firſt occaſion of his conuerſion.</head>
            <p>THe Marqueſſe <hi>Calantonius</hi> ſeeing ſo good hope of the continuance of his houſe and poſterity, deſiring not to preſerue onely, but to increaſe and augment the dignity of his houſe, purpoſed therefore that his ſonne <hi>Galeacius</hi> ſhould ſeeke further honour and follow the Court. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore making offer of him to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> he was moſt kindly entertained into the Emperours houſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ſoone after was made the Emperours Gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſewer. In which place and office within ſhort time, he both wonne the fauour of the Nobility, and the reſt of the Court, and grewe to be of ſpeciall account euen with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelfe: for all mens opinion and iudgement of him was, that there was not one of many to be compared with him, for innocency of life, elegancy of manners, ſound iudgement and knowledge of many things. Thus <hi>Galeaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in all mens opinions, in the high way to all honour and eſtimation: for the Prince whom he ſerued was moſt mighty, and the Monarch of the biggeſt part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. But all this was little: for God, the king of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:637:7"/>
kings, of his ſingular mercy and grace did purpoſe to call him to farre greater dignity, and to more certaine and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable riches. And this ſo great and rare a work did the Lord bring to paſſe, by ſtrange and ſpeciall meanes. So it was that in thoſe daies a certaine Spaniard, a noble man, did ſoiourne at <hi>Naplcs,</hi> who had to name <hi>Iohannes Waldeſius:</hi> this Gentleman being come to ſome knowledge of the truth of the Goſpell, and eſpecially of the doctrine of Iuſtification; vſed often to conferre with, and to inſtruct diuers other noble men his companions and familiars, in points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, confuting the falſe opinions of our owne inherent Iuſtification, and of the merits of good workes, and ſo conſequently detecting the vanity of many Popiſh points, and the fondneſſe of their ſuperſtitions: by which meanes he ſo preuailed, or rather the Lord by him, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of theſe noble Gentlemen began to creepe out of Popiſh darkeneſſe, and to perceiue ſome light of the truth: Amongſt theſe, was there one <hi>Iohannes Franciſcus Caeſarta,</hi> a noble Gentleman and kinſeman to this our <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leacius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Gentleman firſt of all did <hi>Galeacius</hi> heare diuers things in conference, which ſeemed to him much contrary to the courſe of the vaine world; yea much to croſſe euen his age and eſtate, and courſe of life; as namely of the true meanes of our Iuſtification, of the excellency and power of Gods word, of the vanity of the moſt of Popiſh ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. For <hi>Galeacius</hi> eſteemed and vſed this Gentleman as his familiar friend, both being neere of his blood, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for that hee was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Gentleman of very good parts. Now although the ſpeeches of this gentleman did not at the firſt ſo farre preuaile with him, as to make him forſake the vanities of this life; notwithſtanding it was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vaine: for that God which had ordeined him to be a ſpeciall inſtrument of his glory, would not ſuffer ſo good ſeed to periſh, though it ſeemed for a time to be caſt euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thornes: neither will it be beſide the purpoſe to ſet downe particularly the meanes, which it pleaſed God to

            <head type="sub">Of the meanes of his further Sanctification.</head>
            <p>AT that time <hi>Peter Martyr Vermilius</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> was a publik Preacher and Reader at <hi>Naples.</hi> This man was a Canon regular (as they call them) a man ſince then of great name, for his ſingular knowledge in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, his godly manners and behauiours, and for his ſweet and copious teaching; for he afterward caſting away his monkes coule, and renouncing the ſuperſtitions of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he ſhone ſo brightly in Gods Church, that he diſperſed and ſtrangely droue away the darkeneſſe and miſts of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. <hi>Galeacius</hi> was once content at <hi>Caeſerta</hi> his motion to be drawen to heare <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> Sermon; yet not ſo much for any deſire he had to learne, as moued and tickled with a curious humour, to heare ſo famous a man as then <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> was accounted. At that time <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was in hand with <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and as he was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the weakeneſſe and deceitfulnes of the iudgement of mans reaſon in ſpirituall things, as likewiſe the power and efficacy of the word of God, in thoſe men in whom the Lord worketh by his ſpirit; amongſt other things he vſed this ſimilie or compariſon: If a man walking in a large place, ſee a farre off men and women dancing together, and heare no ſound of inſtrument, he wil iudge them mad, or at leaſt fooliſh; but if he come neerer them, and perceiue their order and heare their muſicke, and marke their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and their courſes, he will then be of another minde, and not onely take delight in ſeeing them, but feele a deſire in himſelf to beare them company and dance with them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſame (ſaid <hi>Martyr)</hi> betides many men, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they behold in others a ſuddain and great change of their looks, apparell, behauiour, and whole courſe of life, at the firſt

ſight they impute it to melancholy or ſome other fooliſh humour; but if they looke more narrowly into the matter, and begin to heare and perceiue the harmony and ſweete concent of Gods ſpirit, and his word in them, (by the ioint power of which two, this change was made and wrought, which afore they counted folly,) then they change their opinion of them, and firſt of all begin to like them, and that change in them, and afterward feele in themſelues a motion and deſire to imitate them, and to be of the number of ſuch men, who forſaking the world and his vanities, doe thinke that they ought to reforme their liues by the rule of the Goſpell, that ſo they may come to true and ſound holineſſe.

To this purpoſe he began to reade the Scriptures euery day, being perſwaded, that truth of Religion and ſoundneſſe of wiſedome was to be drawen out of that fountaine, and that the high way to heauen was thence to be ſought. And further, all his acquaintance and familiarity did he turne into ſuch company, as out of whoſe life and conferences, he was perſwaded he might reape the fruit of godlineſſe and pure Religion. And thus farre in this ſhort time had the Lord wrought with him by that Sermon: as firſt, to conſiderwith himſelf ſeriouſly whether he was right or no: ſecondly, to take vp an exerciſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall of reading Scripture: thirdly, to change his former company, and make choice of better. And this was done in the yeare one thouſand fiue hundred fortie and one, and in the foure and twentieth yeare of his age.</p>

            <p>BVt when this ſudden alteration of this noble and yong <hi>Galeacius</hi> was ſeene and perceiued in <hi>Naples,</hi> it can be ſcarce ſet downe how greatly it amazed his old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which as yet cleaued to the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the affections of the fleſh: many of them able to render no cauſe of it, could not tell what to ſay of it; ſome iudged it but a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke paſſion; others thought it plaine follie, and feared he would become ſimple and doting and that his wit began by ſome meanes to be empaired Thus euery one gaue his verdict and cenſure of him, but all wondred, and doubted what it would turne to. But the better ſort of men and ſuch as feared God, and had their mind enlightned with ſome knowledge of Religion, as they wondred no leſſe to ſee ſo great a change in ſo great a man, ſo likewiſe they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with exceeding ioy to ſee it: for they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God had ſome great and extraordinary work in it; that a yong gallant, a noble man of ſuch wealth, and honor as he was, liuing in ſuch delight and pleaſures, in ſo general a corruption of life, both in court and countrey, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this age, nobility, wealth and honour being ioyned with the wanton deliciouſnes of the courtly life: I ſay, that ſuch a man ſhould bee indued with the ſpirit of holineſſe, and ſo farre affected with repentance, as that he ſhould contemne all thoſe in reſpect of heauen; they eſteemed of it (as it was indeed) a rare matter and ſeldome ſeene in the world: and therefore they greatly reioyced at it, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord on his behalfe.

                     <hi>many noble, not many wiſe, according to the fleſh, not many mightie are called: but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, and weake things to confound the mightie, and baſe things in the world, and things not accounted of, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> When I ſay, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe words ſo often, I admire at that rare bleſſing of God, which he hath vouchſafed to you a noble and mighty man: namely, that he ſhould grace you with that true and incomparable nobility, which is attained by true faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and a holy life. As much greater as this bleſſing is, ſo much the more holy and ſincere ought your life to be, and ſo much the more vprightly are you to walke with your God; leſt that your thornes (that is, riches, pleaſures, and honours,) ſhould choke the ſeede of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:637:9"/>
which is ſowne in you. For this I am ſure of, that God hath begun ſome great worke in you, which he will finiſh to the glory of his owne name, and will bring to paſſe; that as heretofore you had care ſo to liue a noble man, amongſt noble men, that you might obſerue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum and maintine the dignity of nobilitie: ſo hereafter that you may employ your whole ſelfe in this, that you may defend and vphold the honor &amp; dignity of the children of God; whoſe duety it is to aime at the perfection of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with al endeuors; and in their life vpon the earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that holy &amp; heauenly life, which they ſhal lead in the world to come. Call to mind continually (my good Lord) in all your words and deedes, that we are graced with this honour to be made the ſonnes of God by Ieſus Chriſt: for that mediation will by the helpe of the holy Ghoſt, worke this care in vs, that we neuer commit any thing vnworthy of that holy name of Chriſt, by which we are called. And yet alas, ſuch is our eſtate, as that if we do endeuour to pleaſe Chriſt, we are ſure to diſpleaſe men, and muſt bee content to contemne the vaine glory of the world, that we may enioy heauenly and eternall glory with God; for it is impoſſible (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>for him to beleeue in God, which</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeekes the honour and praiſe of men.</hi> I meane of the men of this world, which as the kingly Prophet ſaith, <hi>are lighter and</hi>

                     <hi>vainer then vanity it ſelfe.</hi> And therefore their iudgement is little worth, and leſſe to be eſteemed; but rather the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who ſeeth not all our actions onely, but euen our moſt hidden thoughts and purpoſes. Which being ſo, were it not folly and madneſſe to diſpleaſe ſuch a God, to pleaſe ſo fond a world? It were a ſhamefull thing if a wife ſhould endeuour to pleaſe other men, rather then her husband. How much more then vnworthy is it if our ſoules ſhould rather ayme to pleaſe the vaine world, then their moſt holy ſpouſe Chriſt Ieſus? If the onely ſonne of God was content, not only to be reuiled, yea and ſcourged; but euen to die vpon the croſſe as a curſed malefactor, and all for vs: why ſhould not we much more beare patiently
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:637:10"/>
the taunts and mockes, yea euen the ſlanders of Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Let vs therfore arme our ſelues as it were with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride, and (in a ſort) ſcorne and laugh at their mockes: and putting vpon vs mercy and pity as the feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, let vs bewaile ſo great blindneſſe in them, and let vs intreat the Lord for them, to pull them out of that palpable darkneſſe into his true and marueilous light, leſt Satan binde them to himſelfe in his euerlaſting prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe; and ſo being his bondſlanes, and hired ſworne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of his blacke guard, doe ſend them out to perſecute Ieſus Chriſt in his members. Which when they haue done all they can, and all that the diuell their maſter can teach them, though the diuell himſelfe ſhould burſt with malice, and they for anger grinde their teeth; yet ſhall it all tend to the magnifying of Gods glory, which they labour to obſcure, and to the furtherance of their ſaluation whom they ſo diſdained: yea to the increaſe of their glory in a better world, whom in this world they thought worthy of nothing, but of all diſgrace. And ſurely (my moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lord) he that is poſſeſſed with the certaintie of this faith, will without doubt make open warre with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections of his owne nature, and with all the world: yea euen with the diuell himſelfe, and will not doubt but in time euen to ouercome them al. Therfore let vs humble our ſelues to our God and Father euerlaſting, that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that ſaith in vs, &amp; bring forth in vs thoſe moſt bleſſed &amp; ſweet fruits of faith in our harts &amp; liues, which he vſeth to work in them whom he hath elected: that ſo our faith being fruitful of good works, may appeare to be not a fained but a true faith: not a dead but a liuing faith: not a humane but a diuine worke in vs: that ſo it may be to vs an infallible pledge of our ſaluation to come. Let vs labour to ſhew our ſelues the legitimate and vndoubted children of God, in ſeeking aboue all things, that his moſt holy name may be ſanctified in our ſelues and others; and in imitating his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable loue and gentleneſſe, which makes his ſunne to ſhine on good and badde. Let vs worſhip his heauenly

            <head type="sub">Of the many temptations the diuell vſed to pull him backe, as by his father, his wife, and by noble men of his acquaintance.</head>
            <p>BY this and other holy meanes <hi>Galeacius</hi> was confirmed in the doctrine of the truth, and went forward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the courſe of Gods calling, and the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But the more couragiouſly he went on, the more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diuell raged againſt him by his temptations; ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring thereby to hinder him in that happy courſe: yea and if it were poſsible to driue him backe againe, which courſe lie commonly takes againſt thoſe, who haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to themſelues to tame the rebellion of the ſleſh, and to relinquiſh the vanities of the world. And firſt of all, this zealous courſe of his in Religion procured him an infinit number of mockes, and made him ſubiect to moſt vile ſlanders; yea made him incurre the hatred of a great number, but eſpecially did he herein diſpleaſe &amp; vex his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as one that was not only of a contrary religion, but one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:637:13"/>
who onely intended the honour of his houſe, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing of his poſterity, which in reſpect of Religion <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acius</hi> cared not for at all: and therefore he did often ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chide him, and charged him with his fatherly authoritie, to put away thoſe melancholy conceits (as hee termed them.) No doubt but this was moſt grieuous to him, who alwaies was moſt ſubmiſſe and obedient to his father. But another griefe did more inwardly afflict him, which was in reſpect of his wife <hi>Victoria.</hi> Who though ſhe was alwaies a moſt kind and dutifull wife, as alſo very wiſe, yet ſhee would by no meanes yeelde to this motion and change of Religion; becauſe ſhe thought and feared it would breed infamy and reproch, to her ſelf and her houſe; and therfore was continually working on him by all meanes and deuices ſhe could: labouring to mooue him by teares and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and by all kinds of intreaty that a wife could vſe to her husband: and withall ſometimes vrging him with ſuch vaine and fond reaſons as commonly women of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are furniſhed withall. What a vexation this was, and what an impediment to his conuerſion, ſuch may iudge eaſily, who are cumbred with husbands or wiues of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion. And no little griefe and temptation was it to him, beſides all theſe, that the moſt part of the noble men in and about <hi>Naples</hi> (being either of his blood, or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or his familiar friends) vſed continually to reſort vnto him, to follow their old and ordinary ſports and pleaſures. Alas how hard a thing was it to ſhake off all theſe on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to take vpon him a direct contrary courſe of life to that he had ledde with them afore; which he muſt needs doe if he would goe on as he had begun? And further, it was no little vexation to his ſoule to liue in the Court, when his office and place called him thereunto: for there hee might heare of any thing rather then of Religion: and not a word by any meanes of Gods word, but talke enough of common and worldly preferments and pleaſures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing of meanes for the moſt cruell handling and diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the way all ſuch as ſhould depart from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

Any Chriſtian heart may eaſily conceiue how deepely thoſe temptations and hinderances vexed his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſoule in this his courſe towards God: inſomuch as a thouſand to one, they had turned him backe againe; and doubtleſſe they had done ſo indeed, had not God aſſiſted him with ſpeciall grace.</p>

            <p>BVt aboue all theſe, Satan had one aſſault ſtrongeſt of all, whereby he attempted to ſeduce him from the true and ſincere Religion of God. About that time the Realme of <hi>Naples</hi> was ſore peſtred with Arrians and Anabaptiſts: who daily broched their hereſies amongſt the common people, colouring them ouer with glorious ſhewes. Theſe fellowes perceiuing <hi>Galeacius</hi> not fully ſetled as yet in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor yet ſufficiently grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the ſcripture, tried al meanes they could to intangle him in their errours and blaſphemous fancies: wherein the mightie worke of God was admirable towards him: for he being a youth, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but a meane ſcholar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and little ſtudied, and but lately entred into the ſchoole of Chriſtian Religion; who would haue thought that euer he could haue reſiſted and eſcaped the ſnares of thoſe heretikes; many of them being great and grounded ſcholars, and throughly ſtudied in the Scripture? Notwithſtanding, by the ſincere ſimplicity and plainneſſe of Gods truth, and the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, hee not onely deſcried the fondneſſe of their hereſies, but euen vntied the knots, and brake their nets, and deliuered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and mightily confuted them: yea ſuch was the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, as being ſometime in their meetings, hee was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:637:14"/>
ſtrongly confirmed in the doctrine of the truth by ſeeing and hearing them. Thus by Gods mercie he eſcaped and was conquerour in this ſight.</p>
            <p>But the diuell had not ſo done with him, for another and more dangerous battell preſently followed. The Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſians, of whom wee ſpake before, were at that time in <hi>Naples</hi> in good number. With them did <hi>Galeacius</hi> daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, their courſes of life and ſtudy being not farre vnlike. Theſe diſciples of <hi>Waldeſius</hi> knew as yet no more in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the point of Iuſtification: and miſliked and eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome abuſes in Popery; and neuertheleſſe ſtill frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Popiſh Churches; heard Maſſes, and were preſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily at vile Idolatries. <hi>Galeacius</hi> for a time conuerſed with theſe men, and followed their way: which courſe doubtleſſe would haue ſpoiled him, as it did a great ſort of them; who afterwards being taken and committed for the truth, were eaſily brought to recant their Religion, becauſe they wanted the chiefe and the moſt excellent points, nor were ſufficiently ſetled: and yet afterwards againe, not daring to forſake their hold in Iuſtification; and therefore comming to it againe, were taken as relapſers and backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and put to extreame torments and cruell death. In the like danger had <hi>Galeacius</hi> beene, but that the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God otherwiſe diſpoſed, and better prouided for him: for his office and place that he bare in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Court, called him into <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſo withdrew him from his companions the Waldeſians: for the Lord had a greater worke to worke in him then the Waldeſians were able to teach him: for there in <hi>Germany</hi> hee learned (that he neuer knew afore) that the knowledge of the truth of Iuſtification was not ſufficient for ſaluation; whilſt in the meane time a man wittingly defiled himſelfe with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, which the Scripture cals ſpirituall whordome: and of no man did he reape more ſound and comfortable inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> of whom we ſpake afore, whom God had lately called out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and confirmed him in the truth. This <hi>Martyr</hi> inſtructed <hi>Galeacius</hi> ſoundly, in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:637:14"/>
way of the truth, and made it plaine vnto him, by priuate conferences as well as publicke reading: for he was at that time publick profeſſor of diuinity at <hi>Stransbrough</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Galeacius</hi> furniſhed with thoſe holy inſtructions, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Naples,</hi> and preſently reſorting to his companions, the Waldeſians, amongſt other points, conferred with them about the eſchewing of Idolatry, and deliuered his iudgement therein.

Now this their forſaking of him, and telling him of the danger of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, was another ſtrong temptation to keepe him wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their Idolatry, and to make him content himſelfe with their imperfect and peeced Religion. But GOD which had in his eternall election predeſtinate him, that he ſhould be a ſingular example of conſtancy to the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many, and the confuſion and condemnation of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme profeſſors; gaue him that excellent reſolution, and that heauenly courage, as he eſcaped at laſt conquerour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all thoſe temptations and aſſaults of Satan; and nothing could ſuffice or content him but the pure Religion, and alſo the profeſſion of it: and therefore ſeeing no hope of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Naples,</hi> nor any hope to haue the Waldeſians ioyne with him, and ſeeing plainely that he could not ſerue God in that countrey; he reſolued vndoubtedly that hee would forſake the countrey, and ſeeke for Chriſt and his Religion whereſoeuer hee might find them; and that hee would rather forſake father, wife, children, goods and lands, offices and preferments to winne Chriſt, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy them all and want Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the grieuous combats betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, when he reſolued of his departure.</head>
            <p>NOw heree by the way it may not be omitted, what kind of cogitations he hath often ſaid came into his mind, as he was deliberating about this great matter. For firſt of all, as often as he looked on his father, which he did almoſt euery houre, who decrely loued him, and whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he reſpected in all duety and reuerence: ſo often doubtleſſe he was ſtriken at the heart with vnſpeakeable griefe to thinke of his departure; his mind no doubt often thinking thus: What, and muſt I needes forſake my deere and louing fathr, and cannot I elſe haue God my Father? O miſerable and vnhappy father of my body, which muſt ſtand in compariſon with the Father of my ſoule! And muſt I needes faile in duety to him, if I performe my duety to God? O miſerable old man! for what deeper wound can pierce him, then thus to be depriued of the onely ſtaffe and comfort of his old age! Alas ſhall I thus leaue him in ſuch a ſea of troubles; and ſhall I bee the onely meanes to ſtrike into his heart the deepeſt wound of grieſe that yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pierced him in all his life? This my departure is ſure to make my ſelfe the obloquy of the world: yea to breede reproch and ſhame to the Marqueſſe my father, and to my whole ſtocke and kinred. How is it poſsible that the good old man can ouercome or indure ſo great a griefe, but rather he muſt needs be ſwallowed vp of it, &amp; ſo with woe and miſery end his life? Shall I then be the cauſe of death to my father, who would if neede had beene redeemed my life with his owne death? alas what a miſery is this like to be either to me, or him, or vs both? yet muſt I care leſſe for bringing his gray head with ſorrow vnto the graue, then for caſting my owne poore ſoule with horror into hell. And no leſſe inwardly was he grieued in reſpect ofhis noble wife
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:637:15"/>
               <hi>Victoria:</hi> for hauing no hope that ſhe would renounce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and go with him, therefore he durſt not make known vnto her the purpoſe of his departure; but rather reſolued for Chriſts ſake to leaue her and all, and to follow Chriſt. Shee was now as he was himſelfe in the prime of youth, a Lady of great birth, faire, wiſe and modeſt; but her loue and loyalty to her husband ſurpaſſed all. How was it poſsible patiently to leaue ſuch a wiſe, ſo that his perplexed mind diſcourſed on this faſhion when he lookt on her: And ſhall I ſo, yea ſo ſuddenly, and ſo vnkindly leaue and forſake my wife, my moſt deere and louing wife, the onely ioy of my heart in this world, my companion and partner in all my griefe and labour; the augmenter of my ioy, the leſſener of my woe? And ſhal I leaue her, not for a time, (as hertofore Idid when the Emperors ſeruice called me from her) but for euer, neuer againe to enioy her: yea it may be neuer to ſee her? And ſhall I depriue my ſelfe of her, &amp; thereby depriue my ſelfe ofal others alſo, &amp; of al the comfort of the coniug all life &amp; married eſtate? And ſhal I ſo leaue her deſolate &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in that eſtate &amp; age whereof ſhe is? Alas poore Lady, what ſhal ſhe doe, what ſhal become of her, and of her litle ones when I am gone? How many dolefull dayes without comfort, many waking nights without ſleep, ſhal ſhe paſſe ouer? What wil ſhe do but weep &amp; waile, &amp; pine away with grief? And as he caſt theſe things in his mind, he thought he euen ſaw his wife, how ſhe tooke on with her ſelf, ſighing &amp; ſobbing and weeping; yea howling &amp; crying, &amp; running after him with theſe pitifull out-cries: Ah my deere Lord, and ſweete husband; whither will you goe? and will you Ieaue me miſerable woman, comfortleſſe and ſuccourleſſe? What ſhal become of me when you are gone: what can ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, pompes, riches, gold, ſiluer, iewels, friends, company, all delights and pleaſures in the earth; what can they all do to my comfort when I want you? And what ioy can I haue in my children without you, but rather my griefe to be doubled to looke on them? And how can I or the world be perſwaded that you care for them, and for my ſelfe? Is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:637:16"/>
this the loue that thou haſt ſo often boaſted of? Ah, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loue which hath this iſſue! either neuer didſt thou loue me, elſe neuer had true loue ſo ſtrange an end as this of yours hath, And yet which is worſe then all this, you neuer ſhewed me cauſe of this your ſtrange departue; had I knowen cauſe, it would neuer haue grieued mee halfe ſo much: But now that the cauſe is not knowen, what will the world iudge, but that the fault is in me? at leaſt, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemne me for it; yet how reprochfull will it be to me, when euen euery baſe companion dare lay it in my diſh, and point at me with their fingers when I go by, and ſay, this is that fond woman who married him with whom ſhe could not liue, and whom her husband diſdained to liue withall? This is that ſimple foole, who is deſolate hauing a husband; and a widow, her husband yet beeing aliue. Either ſhall I be counted wicked, which haue cauſed thee to leaue me; or fooliſh, miſerable, and vnhappy, who choſe ſo fondly, as to take him, whom I could not be ſure of when I had him. In a word, I ſhall be depriued of thee: yea of all poſsibility of hauing any other, and ſo hauing a husband, I ſhal liue in al miſery altogether without a husband. Theſe two cogitations of his father and his wife greatly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and the more becauſe hee laboured to keepe cloſe this fire, which burned and boiled in hisheart: namely, to conceale his departure, leſt by being knowne it might haue beene hindred, which he would not for a world.</p>
            <p>Yet there was a third and ſpeciall care that pinched him, and that was for his children, which were ſixe in all; goodly and towardly children, and worthy of ſo noble pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: the more griefe was it, in that they were ſo yong, as that they could not yet conceiue what it was to wanta fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the eldeſt was ſcarce fifteene, and the yongeſt ſcarce foure yeares old: hee loued them with moſt tender and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection, and was againe loued and honoured of them. It is wonderfull to thinke, how when his wife the Lady did giue into his armes his yongeſt childe to play withall (as oftentimes wiues vſe to doe) how it were poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:637:16"/>
for him, and what a do he had with himſelfe to containe from floods of teares; eſpecially becauſe his eyes ſeeing them, and his hands holding them, and his heart taking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure in them, his minde could not but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this manner: And ſhall I within theſe few daies vtterly forſake theſe ſweete babes, and leaue them to the wide and wicked world, as though they had neuer beene my children nor I their father? Yea happy had I bin if I had either neuer had them, or hauing them might enioy them. To be a father is a comfort, but a father of no children, and yet to haue children, that is a miſery. And you poore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, what ſhal become of you whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am gone? your hap is hard euen to be fatherleſſe, your father yet liuing: and what can your great birth now helpe you? for by my departure you ſhall loſe all your honour, all your liuing and wealth, and all dignity whatſoeuer; which otherwiſe you had bin ſure of: nay my departure ſhall not onely depriue you of al this, but lay you open to all infamy, reproch, and ſlander, and bring vpon you all kind of miſery: and thus miſerable man that I am, ſhall the time be curſed that euer they had me to their father. And what can your wofull mother doe when ſhe looketh on you, but weepe and wring her hands, her griefe ſtill increaſing as ſhe lookes vpon you? Yet thus muſt I leaue you al confounded together in heaps of griefe, weeping and wailing one with another, and I in the meane time weeping and wailing for you all. Many other griefes, temptations, and hinderances aſſaulted him, though they were not ſo weighty as theſe formerly named, yet which might haue beene able to haue hindred any mans depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being in his caſe; as to leaue the company of ſo many gallant noblemen and gentlemen, his kinred and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taince; to loſe ſo honourable an office and place as he bare in the Emperours Court; to leaue for euer his natiue ſoile the delicate <hi>Italy;</hi> to depriue himſelfe and his poſterity of the noble tittle and rich liuing of a Marqueſdome; to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a moſt long and tedious iourney; to caſt himſelfe into exile, pouerty, ſhame, and many other miſeries without
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:637:17"/>
hope of recouery for euer: to change his former pleaſant life into all hardneſſe, and to giue a farewel to al the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein he was brought vppe; to leaue that goodly garden of his father the Marqueſſes, which once ſhould be his owne; the goodlieſt garden almoſt in all <hi>Italy</hi> or all Criſtendome; which was furniſhed with plants of all ſorts; and theſe not onely of all ſuch as grow in <hi>Italy,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuch as were to be got out of all other countries: this garden and Orchard was ſo exquiſite both this way, and in diuers other ſorts of elegancies, that a great number of men of all qualities reſorted daily out of all countries to ſee it. But this and all other the pleaſures and delicacies of this preſent life could doe nothing with him to remooue him from his purpoſe; but he renounced them all, and reſolued to leaue them all to follow Chriſt: ſo ſtrong and admirable was the conſtancy of this noble Gentleman.</p>

            <p>BVt it may be asked, whereupon was grounded ſo great vnmoueableneſſe of this purpoſe, or whence came it? If we aske the world and common iudgement, they will anſwere, that doubtleſſe melancholike humours preuailing in him, ſpoiled the man of his iudgement and naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and empaired common ſenſe and reaſon; and thence proceeded this obſtinate and deſperate purpoſe, as the world iudgeth of it. But if a man lift vp his eyes higher and behold the matter more ſeriouſly, he might haue manifeſtly ſeene that it came to paſſe by the mercifull bleſsing and ſtrong hand of God, who from al eternity had predeſtinate him, that hee ſhould ſtand ſo vnmoueable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

all temptations, and continue in one tenour ſteady and ſtedfaſt, vntill he had made voyde all the attempts of Satan, and remoued all the ſtumbling blockes which his fleſh and blood and carnall reaſon could caſt in the way; for the which purpoſe the ſpirit of God enabled him to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with himſelfe on this ſort: Thou Lord art hee who drew and deliueredſt me out of the thick and miſty darknes of ignorance, and haſt enlightned my mind with the light of thy holy ſpirit, and with the heauenly knowledge of thy truth: thou haſt made knowen to me the way of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and haſt ranſomed me to thy ſelfe by the blood of thy Sonne. Now therefore good Lord and holy father, I am wholly thine, and conſecrated to thy glory; and as I am thine, I will follow thee, and obey thee, and walke in the way of thy will whitherſoeuer thou ſhalt call me. Not my father, nor my wife, nor my children, nor my honours, nor my lands, nor my riches, nor all my delicacies and pleaſures ſhall hold or hinder me one houre from following thee. I denie my ſelfe O Lord, and I deny this whole world for thee and thy ſake: O Lord thou knoweſt me, and the readineſſe of my mind to wait vpon thee; and how that my heart is inflamed with the fire of thy loue: yet thou ſeeſt againe how many enemies compaſſe mee, how many hinderances lie in me way, and how many temptations and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lie vpon me, ſo that I am ſcarce able to moue or lift vp my head vnto thee: O Lord I am now in the depthes of thoſe troubles, out of which the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> once cried to thee as I doe now; <hi>O Lord haue mercy on me and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my ſoule.</hi> And although Satan and my owne fleſh doe affright me in this my purpoſe, whilſt they ſet before my eyes, the croſſe, and the infamy, and the pouerty, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſeries, which I am like in this my new profeſſion to vndergoe: notwithſtanding O Lord, I lift vp my ſelfe in the contemplation and beholding of thy infinite Maieſty; and therein I ſee and confeſſe that that croſſe and affliction is bleſſed and glorious, which makes me like and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Chriſt my head; and that infamy to be honorable

which ſets me in the way to true honour; and that pouerty to be deſired, which depriuing a man of ſome temporall goods, wil reward him with an heauenly inheritance, then which, there is nothing more pretious: I meane O Lord with thy owne ſelfe, and thy glory O euerlaſting God, and that by thy onely ſon Ieſus Chriſt; that ſo I enioying thy glorious preſence, may liue for euer with thee in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenly ſociety: O bleſſed and happy theſe miſeries which pull me out of the worlds vanities, and ſinke of ſinne; that I may be made heire of an euerlaſting glory. Welcome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the croſſe of Chriſt, I wil take it vp O Lord, and wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee: With theſe &amp; ſuch like holy meditations &amp; other holy meanes, he ouercame at laſt all the attempts of Satan, al his owne natural and carnal affections: yea and the world it ſelfe, and verified that in himſelfe which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth of Gods true elect, that <hi>they that are Chriſts haue crucified the fleſh with the affections and the luſts:</hi> that is, haue crucified their ſoules for Chriſt, who crucified himſelfe for them. O Satan, Gods enemy and his childrens, how vaine were all thy attempts, and how light al thy aſſaults? In vaine doſt thou ſet vpon thoſe for whom Chriſt vouchſafed to die, and ſuffer on the croſſe: vpon which croſſe he ſo brake thy head and thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſo trampled ouer thee, that now thou ſhalt not be able to touch the leaſt haire of the head of any of thoſe for whom he died. And as for <hi>Galeacius,</hi> hee had builded his houſe on the rocke, and founded it ſo ſure, that no wind, no raine, nay no floods of griefes, nor tempeſts of troubles, nor whirlewind of temptations could once remoue him: and ſo he continued reſolute as a Chriſtian ſouldier &amp; conqueror; fully minded to leaue his country at the next opportunity he could take: his mind I cannot tell whether more rauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ioy one way, or more perplexed with griefe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; but betwixt ioy and griefe he ſtill continued his purpoſe, vntill at laſt his ſpiritual ioy ouercomming his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and carnal griefe, he fully concluded that in deſpight of the diuell and all impediments in the world, hee would ſurely goe.</p>

But how deepe and vnſearchable the iudgements of God are, the euent afterward ſhewed: for diuers of them (though not all) who for a time ſeemed to be indued and led with a moſt earneſt zeale of Gods glorie in this action; when they came to the borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what they forſooke, and to what they now tooke themſelues: firſt began to looke backe againe to <hi>Italy;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went backe againe indeed, and ſo turned againe to the vomit of their pleaſures. But this ingratitude to the Lord for ſo great a fauour offred them, the Lord purſued with a iuſt reuenge: for purpoſing to ſerue God in their pleaſures, and in the midſt of Popery, they were after taken by the Spaniſh Inquiſition; and ſo publikely recanting and abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſtian Religion, they were afterward ſubiect to all miſery &amp; infamy; neither truſted nor loued of the one ſide nor the other.

Courly &amp; Lordly life, here amongſt vs to betake himſelf to an eaſie rate and frugal kind of life, euen as though he were no better then one of vs: and yet I ſo recite al this to others, as I let it not paſſe without vſe to my ſelfe. For if I do ſet out your vertues in this my Epiſtle, as on the toppe of a Towre for all men to ſee them; that ſo they may conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the imitation of them; it ſhould be ſhame for my ſelfe not to be much more neerely and inwardly touched with a loue of them, who am continually an eye witneſſe of them, and daily behold them, not in an Epiſtle, but in the cleare glaſſe of your owne life: and therefore becauſe that I find in experience how much your example preuailes in me, for the ſtrengthning of my faith, and the increaſe of godlines in me (yea and all other holy men who dwel in the city, doe acknowledge as well as I, that this your example hath beene greatly to their edification in al grace) I thought it therefore a neceſſary duety to impart this rare example of yours to the world; that ſo the profit and benefit of vs might inlarge it ſelfe, and ſpread out of this citie into all the Churches of God; for otherwiſe it were a needleſſe labour to make knowne to the furtheſt parts of Chriſtendome, the vertues of ſuch a man, whoſe nature and diſpoſition is ſo out of loue with pride, and ſo farre remoued from all oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Now if it ſhall pleaſe God that many others (who dwelling farre off, haue not hitherto heard of you;) ſhall by the ſtrangeneſſe of this your example addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the imitation of it, and leaue their pleaſant neſts, whereto the world hath ſetled them ſo faſt; I ſhall thinke my ſelfe bountifully rewarded for theſe my paines: for out of queſtion it ſhould be common and vſuall amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not onely to leaue liuings and lord ſhips, and caſtles and townes, and offices and promotions, when the caſe ſo ſtands that a man may not enioy both Chriſt and them: but euen willingly and cheerefully to deſpiſe and ſhake off whatſoeuer vnder the Sunne (though it be neuer ſo deere and pretious, ſo pleaſant and comfortable) in reſpect and compariſon of Chriſt. But ſuch is the ſlowneſſe and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:637:21"/>
of the moſt of vs, that we doe but coldly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally profeſſe the Goſpell: but not one of a hundred, if he haue but ſome little land, or peece of a Lordſhip, that will forſake and deſpiſe it for the Goſpel, ſake: yea not one of many, but very hardly is drawn to renounce euen the leaſt gaine or pleaſure, to follow Chriſt without it: ſo farre are they from denying themſelues and laying downe their liues for the defence of it. I wiſh theſe men would looke at you, and obſerue what it is you haue forſaken for loue of Chriſt; and eſpecially I wiſh that all men who haue taken vpon them already the profeſſion of Religion, would labor to reſemble you in the denial of themſelues, (which indeed is the chiefe of all heauenly vertues:) for you can very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifie with me, as I can with you, how little ioy we take in theſe mens companies; whoſe liues make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that though they haue left their countries, yet they haue brought hither with them the ſame affections and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which they had at home: which if they had alſo renounced, as wel as they did their countries; then had they beene indeed true deniers of themſelues, and beene parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with you of that true praiſe; wherein alas, you haue but few compartners. But becauſe I had rather the Reader ſhould gather the truth and ſtrangenes of this your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then I ſhould goe about in words to expreſſe it; I will therefore ſpare further ſpeech, and turne my ſelfe to God in praier, deſiring of his mercy, that as he hath indued you hitherto with an heroicall courage, and ſpiritual boldneſſe; ſo he would furniſh you with an inuincible conſtancy to endure to the end: for I am not ignorant how ſtrangely the Lord hath exerciſed you heretofore, and what dangerous pikes you haue paſſed ere you came to this: by which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience your ſpiritual wiſdome is able to conclude, that a hard and toilſome warfare doeth ſtill remaine and wait for you; and what neede there is to haue the hand of God from heauen raught out to aſsiſt vs, you haue ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently lea rned in your former conflicts, as I am ſure you will ioyne with me in prayer, for the gift of perſeuerance to

with great hope for their ancient and faithful loue to haue preuailed with <hi>Galeacius.</hi> Where by the way wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Galeacius</hi> did alwaies ſo loue him, that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was not ſo ſorrowful for his departure: but <hi>Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> was much more ſorowfull that he could not winne him to haue gone with him, in this holy pilgrimage for religions ſake; but he ſo much feared to haue bin hindred himſelfe, that he durſt not deale with this gentleman his deareſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, no nor with his wife, to perſwade them to haue gone with him.

This was the ſubſtance of his meſſage. <hi>Galeacius</hi> taking not long time to aduiſe himſelfe, in this which the world would thinke ſo waighty a caſe, addreſſed him immediatly this anſwere in briefe: that he perceiued very wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al to be true that he ſaid; but as for his departure it was not done raſhly, nor vpon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:637:23"/>
any fond conceit, but vpon mature deliberation; that the Lord was the author of the action, that Gods grace was the cauſe mouing him, and the meanes whereby he brought it to paſſe: which grace of God, he ſaid, had opened his eyes, and enlightned his mind with the knowledge of the truth; and made him ſee and diſcerne the coſenages, and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Idolatry of Popery, which by an impious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious diſtribution diuideth the glory of God (which is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable) &amp; imparteth the ſame with fained &amp; filthy Idols: he likewiſe told him that he wel foreſaw all the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies &amp; miſeries which would enſue vpon this his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and al the danger &amp; damage which therby his houſe and children were likely to incur.

And as for them all, hee was ſorie that either they would not come to him, or that hee might not more ſafely liue with them, thereby to comfort them. But as for himſelfe, hee ſaid, hee had riches, and honour, and ioy enough: yea all ſufficient happineſſe, as long as (with theſe two ſeruants and his little cotage) he might liue in the true Church of God, and might
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:637:24"/>
priuily ſerue him, and might enioy Gods word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not being mixed and defiled with the ſuperſtitious deuiſes of mans braine; and as long as he might liue in the company of godly men; and haue time and liberty to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate by himſelfe, and to conferre with them of the great bleſſings which in his conuerſion his good God had vouch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſafed to him: that ſo he might with true contentation and perfect peace of conſcience, aime &amp; aſpire at that immortal glory which Chriſt Ieſus hath prepared for al his children: yea he concluded, that his want was abundance, his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pleaſant, and his meane eſtate honourable in his eyes, as long as he indured them for theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>This his anſwere was as hardly entertained of his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as it was vnlooked for afore it came: but ſeeing he could not reply with any reaſon, nor anſwere him with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhew of argument; and perceiued it hard, or rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to remoue the man one iot from his reſolution; for that he had grounded it, not on any reaſon or will of man, but vpon the holy word of God, and his powerfull and vnreſiſtable calling; therefore with a ſorrowfull heart hee held his tongue, bitterly complaining within himſelf of his ſo hard hap, and vncomfortable ſucceſſe: and ſo reſolued to returne home againe; heartily wiſhing he had neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that iourney in hand: and ſo at laſt he went indeed and tooke his leaue of his beloued <hi>Galeacius,</hi> but not without plenty of teares on both ſides, with many a wofull crie and pitifull farewell. And no maruell: for beſides neerenes in blood, their likeneſſe in manners and daily conuerſation together, had linked them in a ſure bond of friendſhippe: but there wanted in one of them the ſureſt linke in that chaine, that is, Religion, and ſo it could not hold: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world pulling one of them from Chriſt, and Chriſt pulling the other of them from the world: ſo theſe two friends left each other, being in feare neuer to ſee one the other againe.</p>

Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſetling himſelfe downe againe at <hi>Geneua,</hi> and deuiſing how to ſpend his time in doing good; he began to conſider ſeriouſly of ſetling the diſcipline in the Church of the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which was then at <hi>Geneua</hi> (for thither had a great number of <hi>Italians</hi> tranſported themſelues and their families for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions ſake, flying the tyranny of the vnholy inquiſition.) And about that time it fell out fitly that <hi>Calume</hi> going Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour from <hi>Geneua</hi> to <hi>Baſill</hi> in cauſes of Religion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters; intreated <hi>Galeacius</hi> to beare him company: whereunto he willingly condeſcended.

               <hi>Geneua</hi> with him, where he might liue in the fellowſhip of a great number of his country men <hi>Italians,</hi> and inioy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the company, conference and familiarity of many worthy men, but eſpecially the moſt ſweete acquaintance of that great <hi>Caluin,</hi> and al thoſe, with the liberty of a good conſcience.

            <p>NExt ſucceeded in order the yere 1555. wherein Satan aſſauted him with new ſtratagems and deuices: for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:637:27"/>
that yere his vncle which was <hi>Paulus quartus,</hi> his mothers brother, attained the feate of the Papacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby the Marqueſſe his father conceiued good hope, by this meanes either to draw his ſonne home againe, or at leaſt to procure him liberty of conſcience, and leaue to liue in ſome Citie of <hi>Italy,</hi> where he might inioy the ſociety of his wife and children, and they of him. Whereupon hauing occaſion of buſineſſe to trauel that way, hee ſent letters to his ſonne to <hi>Geneua,</hi> commaunding him to meete him at <hi>Mantua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and for his eaſier diſpatch hee ſent him prouiſion of money for the iourney. <hi>Galeacius</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe his fathers will, tooke his iourney from <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> and came to <hi>Mantua</hi> the fifteenth of Iune, where hee was entertayned by his father with more then ordinarie kindneſſe, and in more louing maner then heretofore was accuſtomed. And at laſt hee opened his minde vnto him, the ſubſtance and effect whereof was: that hee had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his vncle, who now was Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a diſpenſation for him; whereby liberty was granted him, to liue in any City within the iuristiction of the Venetians, whereſoeuer he would without any moleſtation to be offred him, about his Religion or conſcience. His father tels him that if he doe this, this will bee a greater ſolace to his olde age, then his departure and abſence hath beene griefe vnto him: beſides all this, the good old man moſt earneſtly intreated him (though hee was the father and ſpake to the ſonne) that hee would gratifie him in this his requeſt: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many beſeechings, who in any lawfull thing might by his authoritie haue commanded him: and euery word that he ſpake was ſo ſeaſoned, as comming from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a father; and at laſt with many ſtrong reaſons perſwaded him, not to reiect this ſo extraordinary a fauor offered him by the Pope in ſo ſpeciall and rare clemency, whereby he might without hurt of his conſcience liue more commodiouſly then euer afore, and be reſtored to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer honour, and place, and eſtate: and recouer the former loue and eſtimation of all his friends: yea and of many
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:637:27"/>
ſtrangers, who hearing of this his obedience to his father, would loue him for it, vnto which obedience to me (ſaith the father to his ſonne) thou art bound both by the bond of nature, and by the law and word of God, which thou ſo much talkeſt of and vrgeſt to me: therefore, ſaith he, if there be in thee either ſparke of naturall affection, or any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſcience of thy duety, thou wilt yeelde vnto me in this, eſpecially ſeeing thou maiſt doe it without hurt or endangering of thy conſcience and Religion. This talke and requeſt of the Marqueſſe diuerſly affected <hi>Galeacius:</hi> for the thing he requeſted, and the reaſons he vrged ſeemed to be ſuch, as he could with no good reaſon contradict them; and yet he durſt not preſently entertaine the motion: beſides that, the preſence, authority, and reuerent regard of his father, the vehemency and affection of his mind, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the naturall bond and obligation, wherein the ſon ſtands tied to the father in things law full and indifferent (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when by that obedience no violence is offred to good conſcience) all theſe did greatly moue him. Alſo naturall and carnall reaſon for their parts, aſſaulted him no leſſe violently with ſuch kind of arguments, as for the moſt part preuaile with all men. For his father offred him year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenues, competent and fit for his eſtate, the ſolace of his children, and ſociety of his wife: which two things he deſired aboue all other in the world. So that to this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and requeſt of his father the Marqueſſe, <hi>Galeacius</hi> knew not well what to anſwere on the ſudden, but ſtood for a time muſing and doubtfull what to ſay; and the rather, for that he then wanted his ſpeciall friend, faithfull <hi>Caluine,</hi> with whom he might conſult in ſo waighty a cauſe. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him impious and vngodly, not to yeeld to his father in ſo lawfull and reaſonable a requeſt, and he ſaw no way how he might denie it, but he muſt needes incurre and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe his fathers extreame diſpleaſure: and yet how hee might yeelde to it with ſafety of conſcience he much doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for he feared that more danger to his profeſſion and Religion, and conſequently more hurt to his ſoule might
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:637:28"/>
hereupon inſue, then he could preſently perceiue: ſo that he ſtood altogether vnreſolued in his owne reaſon what to doe; therefore in this extremity he denied himſelfe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his owne wit, and in humble and feruent prayer betooke himſelfe in this difficulty to the bleſſing and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his God and Sauiour, the author and true fountain of wiſedome and conſtancy: humbly crauing of the Lord to aſſiſt him with his holy ſpirit, that in this extreamity hee might aduiſe and reſolue of the beſt and ſafeſt courſe, for Gods glory and his owne ſound comfort. (O how truely ſung that ſweete ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> King <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>How happy and bleſſed are they that feare God, for God will teach them the way they ſhould walke!) Galeacius</hi> found it moſt true in his owne experience; for vpon this his ſubmiſſion and prayer, the Lord from heauen reſolued him in this ſort: That ſeeing the Pope did (Antichriſt-like) directly oppoſe himſelfe to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Religion and Church; that therefore he might by no meanes ſue for, or accept any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at his hands, nor be by any meanes beholden to him at all. Becauſe what ſhew of ſeruice ſoeuer was done to him by the enemy of Chriſt, ſeemed to bee taken from Chriſt himſelfe. Further, Gods ſpirit perſwaded him it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried too great a ſhew of Apoſtaſie, or backſliding; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the company of godly profeſſors, and the fellowſhip of Chriſts Church; and to liue amongſt Idolaters in the midſt of all abominations. The ſame ſpirit of God ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes that ſcandall and offence, which this fact of his would breed in the minds of the faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which would thinke that he had taken his farewel at Religion, and would now ſhake hands again, &amp; renue his acquaintance with his old friend the world: that he had lightly eſteemed the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſings &amp; heauenly iewels of graces, which God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributeth daily in his Church; and would now betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again to the olde affections of his fleſh. The ſame ſpirit reſolued him, that thus to forſake the ordinary meanes, and depriue himſelfe of the true vſe of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to liue in a place where was nothing but Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:637:28"/>
was to tempt God in the higheſt degree. God like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe opened his eyes, that he perceiued the ſleight of Satan by this his fathers d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t: namely, to entangle him againe in the net of worldly cares, to wrappe his mind in the ſnards of <hi>Italian</hi> pleaſures; and ſo to dazle his eies with the honours, and pleaſures, and ſenſuall delights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which once he had bin brought vp in, that his Religion might decay by little and little and that all godlineſſe might by the heat of theſe new pleaſures, fall and melt away like as waxe before the fire: and laſtly, the Lord vpon his prayer granted him the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his holy ſpirit, to anſwere al his fathers obiections, and confute all his arguments. And amongſt many other, he earneſtly intreated his father that he would not do that vnto him, which afterward hee would repent that euer hee had done: namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would not be a meanes to make him a prey to the Papiſts; which had confirmed for a law, and ratified it by many examples, that promiſe, faith, nor oath is to be kept with any man whom they call heretikes. Whereupon, ſaid he, it is better for me, and more ioy to you, to liue as I doe with this poore eſtate, then with hope of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to endanger my life, and ſo our whole poſterity. By theſe, and ſuch like perſwaſions it pleaſed God ſo to worke vpon the Marqueſſe, that hee was ouercome in this ſute, wherein he ſuppoſed to haue preuailed; and therefore he yeelded againſt his will: and ſo with a ſorrowfull heart he returned to <hi>Naples.</hi> And as he went, he certified the Pope the obſtinacy of his ſonne, and ſo the father and the vncle bewailed together their ill ſucceſſe.</p>

This <hi>Portus</hi> bought <hi>Galeacius</hi> into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the noble Dutches of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him honourably: and after much conferrence had with him of the alteration of his Religion, of the ſucceſſe of his long voyages, and tedious iourneies; of the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> of <hi>Caluine,</hi> and of many chiefe points of Chriſtian Religion; ſhe diſmiſſed him, and left him to his iourney; but not without all courteſies that ſhe could affoord him: and namely for one, to relieue the length and tediouſnes of the way, ſhe lent him her owne chariot: and thus <hi>Galeacius</hi> was conueyed in the chariot of ſo great a Princeſſe as far as to the towne of <hi>Francolium:</hi> from whence hauing a pleaſant tide down the riuer of Po, or Padus, he came by water into <hi>Venice:</hi> where taking ſhippe and croſſing the ſea, he went thorow <hi>Switzerland</hi> to <hi>Geneua,</hi> and thither came the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of October in the ſame yeare, the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially his chiefe friends, reioycing with ioy vnſpeakeable, for the ſafety of his returne.

            <head type="sub">The fourth aſſault that Satan vſed to bring him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, was by his wife, who by her letters won him to come and meete her in Italy: which he yeelded vnto, and gaue her meeting.</head>
            <p>HIS wife <hi>Victoria</hi> burned in long loue and hearty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction toward her husband <hi>Galeacius,</hi> ſo that it cannot be vttered how vehemently ſhe deſired his company: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhee neuer ceaſed writing to him, and intreating him to returne againe to her and his children. But when ſhee ſaw her womanly arguments and vaine ſcribling did no good, at laſt ſhee in all earneſt manner deſired him to meete her in ſome City within the territorie of the Venetians, not farre from the kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi> To this motion <hi>Galeacius</hi> yeelded: and thus the husband and wife promiſed to meet; but the ends that they aymed at were diuers: ſhe hoped by her ſlattery and faire ſpeeches, her teares and lamentations, to winne her husband home againe: on the other ſide he was much more buſie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing how he might perſwade her to deliuer her ſelfe out of the filth of Popery, and come and dwell with him. With theſe reſolutions they both going forward, ſhee came to <hi>Vico,</hi> to her father in law the Marqueſſe. He came from <hi>Geneua</hi> to <hi>Laeſina,</hi> a citie in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> This <hi>Laeſina</hi> is diſtant from <hi>Vicum</hi> an hundred <hi>Italian</hi> miles by water; and ſtandeth iuſt ouer againſt <hi>Vicum;</hi> and the ſea called the Venetian gulfe lieth betwixt them. <hi>Galeacius</hi> here abode and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<note place="margin">Sinus Adriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</note> his wife: but at that time ſhe came not as ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and he expected. Yet he could neuer learn the cauſe of her ſtaying at that time, nor what it was that moued her ſo to diſappoint him; yet though ſhe came not her ſelfe ſhe ſent two of her eldeſt ſons to their father; whoſe ſight was moſt welcome, &amp; their company moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable to <hi>Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius:</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:637:30"/>
but one way it grieued him the more; becauſe the ſight and company of them more affected him with the abſence of his wife; for whoſe ſake and company eſpecially he had taken ſo long a iourney: therefore ſending them ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter home againe, he went away ſorowfull to <hi>Geneua.</hi> Where he had reſted but a few daies, but another packet of letters came poſting from his wife, beſeeching him not to thinke much at her former negligence, and to vouchſafe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to come to the ſame place; where, without all faile, ſhe would moſt gladly attend him, and ſolemnly vowed with largeproteſtations ſhe would not diſappoint him. The requeſt was very vnreaſonable, &amp; it was a hard caſe for <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leacius</hi> thus to ſpend his time, and wearie his mind and body in ſo long and dangerous iournies, and to ſo little purpoſe as hitherto he had. Notwithſtanding, one thing mooued him to yeelde euen to this motion alſo: namely, a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that he had, that when he firſt forſoke his country, he did not fully diſcharge his duety, in labouring to winne his wife to haue gone with him; by explaining to her the chiefe heads of Chriſtian doctrine, whereby ſhe might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly haue receiued ſome taſt, and ſo haue taken ſome liking of true Religion: deſiring therefore now if it were poſſible to make amends for his former negligence, he yeelded to goe. And ſo obtayning for his better ſecurity in going and returning, a paſport or ſafe-conduct from the high Court of <hi>Rhoetia;</hi> he departed from <hi>Geneua</hi> the ſeuenth of March, in the yeare 1558. and came to <hi>Laeſina</hi> in <hi>Dolmatia,</hi> ouer againſt <hi>Vicum:</hi> where he had intelligence that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe his father, his wife, his children, and his vncles ſonne (he of whom we heard before) were already come to <hi>Vicum,</hi> with purpoſe to haue beene by that time at <hi>Laeſina</hi> with <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leacius;</hi> but they could not, by reaſon that a mariner of <hi>Venice</hi> had broken promiſe with them, and diſappointed them: by reaſon whereof, and of other dangers of the ſea, they could not as yet take ſhipping, nor durſt venture ouer the water. Whereupon <hi>Galeacius</hi> not induring patiently ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, reſolued to goe himſelfe ouer to <hi>Vicum.</hi> Such was

his faith in the Lord, and his loue to his friends, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected not the imminent danger: but conſtantly relied on the Lords protection; knowing that no fleſhly affections droue him to his iourney, but a ſincere zeale to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the ſoules health of his kinred, and the diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his owne duety vnto them; whereunto he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he had a ſpeciall calling.</p>

            <p>AND ſo arriuing by Gods mercy on the coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> not farre from <hi>Vicum,</hi> he gaue intelligence of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to his father the Marqueſſe; who preſently ſent his children to meete their father: and all his retinue to attend him into the caſtle; at whoſe entrance, it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed how great ioy was in all that houſe and noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie; and how all the Nobles and Gentlemen of his kinred and acquaintance reioyced at his returne; and beganne to cheere vp their hearts with a new hope which hitherto had beene caſt downe and oppreſſed with griefe and deſpaire. But aboue all other his wife (Madam <hi>Victoria)</hi> ſurpaſſed in ioy and new conceiued delight; hoping ſhe had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered her moſt deere Lord and beloued husband, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort and the ſweete ſolace of her life. All (but <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acius)</hi> exceedingly reioyced at this meeting here; though indeed it greatly ioyed his naturall affection, to enioy the company of his friends, ſo many, ſo neere, and ſo deere vnto him: yet his ioy was tempered and allayed with a certaine doubting feare which ranne in his minde night and day.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:637:31"/>
for the wiſe Gentleman well foreſaw, that the fruition of that pleaſure was but to laſt a while, and ſoone would haue an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the end of his comming was not that which they imagined: and euery day new matters ranne in his heads the conſideration whereof did not a little trouble him. Hee hath often ſince diſcourſed vn to his friends, that all thoſe dayes he liued in continuall feare, to be ſuddenly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and caſt into ſome filthy priſon; where he ſhould ſpend his daies in languiſhing and lamentations, without any ſolace of his friends: yea and be vtterly debarred of the comfortable reading of Gods holy word. But returne to the matter. At his firſt arriuall hee was entertained with much ioy on all ſides, and many cherefull countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and kind welcomes. But alas, within a few daies all this mirth and ioy was turned into teares and lamentation, and vnmeaſurable griefe: for when once he had opened to his father the Marqueſſe his conſtant purpoſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in the truth of that Religion hee had begunne to profeſſe; and that hee would rather die in the defence of it, then be drawen from it; then alas, what fighing, what crying, yea what dolefull lamentation did it moue in them all! But then let the Chriſtian reader iudge what a troubled ſpirit and wofull heart that good man had in this ſo fearefull a combatte betwixt the grace of God and his naturall affections; and what a torment it was vnto him, to ſee them all ſo neere and deere vnto him, labour to withdraw him from God; and to ſee his conſtancy in Religion ſo to grieue them, which was the ioy of his owne heart. Yet taking vp with himſelfe as well as nature could, and comforting himſelfe in his God, he afterward dealt with his wife in all louing and yet earneſt manner that ſhe would follow him her husband, and delay no longer time, but come and liue with him according as the law of God and nature required: which if ſhe would doe, he promiſed her liberty of her conſcience and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to liue as ſhe would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But for his owne part, he told her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, as ſhe ſhould after find; namely, that he was firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:637:31"/>
eſolued to liue and die in that Religion, which (by the hand of God leading him) hee had vndertaken; and for the which he had forſaken countrey, kinred, and all thoſe excellent and comfortable bleſſings of thus life, which God had giuen him. Here I leaue it to the reader, but eſpecially to the harts of ſuch women, as being wiues, do truely loue their husbands, to iudge with what ſobs and heart-breaking the ſilly Gentlewoman heard theſe words of her husband, whom ſhe now ſaw paſt all hope to be perſwaded to ſtay with her; which ſhe deſired aboue all worldly things. Yet it appears it was but in meere carnal and worldly reſpects, as the conſequent ſhewed: for though ſhe loued him and deſired his company neuer ſo much; yet beeing a wiſe, worldly, wilfull, and indeed a right Papiſt, ſhe anſwered him plainely (though with many teares) that ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer go with him to <hi>Geneua,</hi> nor to any other place, where was any other Religion, but that of <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; that ſhe would not liue with him as long as he was intangled with thoſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies (as ſhe called them) wherby it appeares that ſhe was a carnall politike Papiſt. She loued him, but where? in <hi>Italy;</hi> and there would line with him, but not at <hi>Geneua:</hi> and why? for in <hi>Italy</hi> he might aduance her to the ſtate of a Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; in <hi>Geneua</hi> he could not: there ſhe might liue with him a life ful of al delights; but in <hi>Geneua</hi> a hard, baſe, &amp; obſcure life, and ſubiect to many outward dangers and miſeries. In which reſpects it was that ſhe was ſo inſtant vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to ſtay with her. But the concluſion was, her deſire was to enioy him &amp; <hi>Italy</hi> both: but rather then ſhe would leaue <hi>Italy</hi> and the delicacies therof, ſhe choſe plainely to forſake him; &amp; to withdraw the duty of a wife from him. For it may in no caſe be omitted (which afterward hee imparted to ſome his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiereſt and moſt inward friends) that ſhee euen then and there denied him that duetie which a wife is bound to yeeld to her husband by the law of God and nature: that is, ſhe would by no meanes giue him due beneuolence, nor conſent to lie with him as man and wife: and gaue this reaſon; that ſhee was expreſly forbidden of her
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:637:32"/>
Confeſſor, vnder paine of excommunication, becauſe hee was an heretike. Where behold Popiſh Religion what it is, that can ſeparate man and wife for diſparity in Religion; and can diſcharge men and women from thoſe dueties of marriage with which God hath charged them. How this monſtrous vnkindnes and vnwomanly anſwer pierced his heart, let any Chriſtian man iudge, whom God hath hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be an husband. Yet he ouercame and euen deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all theſe tormenting griefes, and beare them with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible conſtancy and quietnes of mind. Yet he purpoſed not to beare ſo great an iniury for cuer, but to redreſſe and helpe it if it were poſſible: and therefore he further procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with her, and openly and plainely denounced to her, that vnleſſe ſhe would yeeld him that matrimoniall duety, which by Gods law ſhe ought: namely, to eate, and lie, and liue with him; it would be a cauſe to make him ſue out a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce againſt her, and ſo procure a finall ſeparation; which if ſhe were the cauſe of, ſhe might thanke or rather blame her ſelfe, who withdrew her necke from that yoke of duety towards him which marriage required, and which he for his part ſaid, he would neuer haue done to her, though her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was ſo farre differing from his. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid, that ſhe firſt refuſing him, hee had then iuſt cauſe to refuſe her, who had firſt by refuſall of that duety refuſed her ſelfe as it were, and denied her ſelfe to bee his wife. And ſo he concluded with her, that vnleſſe ſhe would be his wife, he would no longer be her husband. This proteſtation no doubt, amazed and troubled her not a little, and vexed the ſilly womans mind; eſpecially for that he was and had alwaies beene ſuch a husband to her, ſo good and kind, and euery way ſo well deſeruing, that ſhe loued him as her owne eyes (therefore more was ſhe to blame, that ſhe eſteemed him not as the light of her eyes:) but though this troubled her ſore, yet it moued her not to her duety; ſo good a ſcholar was ſhe in this Popiſh lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that ſhe would rather incur her husbands, yea Gods diſpleaſure then her Confeſſors; and rather breake their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:637:32"/>
commandements ſo holy and iuſt, then his, which was ſo vngodlie, and ſo vnreaſonable: and it alſo leſſe preuayled with her becauſe ſhe imagined he would not ſo doe (though he ſpake ſo) but onely did it to feare her, and ſo in feare hereof to make her yeeld vnto him.</p>

            <head type="sub">Seeing he could not reclaime his Ladie, he reſolued to returne to <hi>Geneua:</hi> and of the greeuous temptations he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: where he tooke his laſt farewell of his father, wife, children, and friends: and of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly courage, in bearing and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thorow them all.</head>
            <p>WHen therefore the good gentleman ſaw all things ſo farre amiſſe, that euen his wife was againſt him of all other, and gaue him a deeper wound then all other his friends; denying him that ſocietie and fellowſhip which the bond of marriage yeeldeth, &amp; ſeeing that the time paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without any good doing, but rather to the increaſing of griefe on all ſides; hee theerfore reſolued to depart, and ſo calling his wife <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictoria</hi> againe, he iterated vnto her his former proteſtation; and ſo bad her take it as his laſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The dolefull day of his departing being come, hee held on his purpoſe, and ſo entred into the chamber of his father the Marqueſſe to do his duetie vnto him, and to take his leaue: Who ſeeing his ſon thus paſt al hope of recouery, quenching his fatherly affection in fury and raging mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, like a frantike or deſperate man, reuiled him in moſt diſpitefull termes, and at laſt giues him his farewel with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a heauy and bitter curſe. This ſo ſtrange and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſecution, did this good gentleman ſuffer for Chriſts ſake; and it is marueile that it did not cauſe him to looke backe againe, and turne his courſe. But it was Gods doing that his father ſhould vſe theſe extreme and violent curſes,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:637:33"/>
rather then to goe about to winne him by allurements and gentle perſwaſions: for hee hath often vſed to tell his friends, that this monſtrous inhumanity and vnnaturalnes of his father did rather confirme and ſettle his minde; his nature being rather to be ledde then drawen, and rather to be wonne by friendlineſſe and faire meanes, then to be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by extremities. But God would haue his ſeruant to be tried by both meanes: namely, the allurements of his wife and the minacings of his father. Thus God would purge him in the fire of all kind of temptations. And thus by the power of Gods grace hauing paſſed thorow this fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a hotter is to be ventured on. Departing his fathers chamber, with that burden of curſes (which the Lord tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into bleſſings) he came into the great chamber, and ſo into the hall; where he found his wife, his children, his vncles ſonne (afore ſpoken of) diuers noble gentlemen his kinsfolks, and ſome his ancient familiars and domeſtick friends: all fraught with griefe, and making heauy cheere; nothing was heard but ſighes, and ſobbes, and cries; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſeene but teares and wringing of hands: his wife embracing him, and taking him about the necke, beſeeched him in moſt louing and moſt pitifull maner, that be would haue care of himſelfe, of her, and of all his children, and whole houſe; and not ſo wilfully to caſt them all away. His yong children all vpon their knees, with armes ſtretched ou t, and hands holden vp, and faces ſwolne with teares, cried vnto him to haue pitie on them his owne bowels; and not to make them fatherleſſe before the time. His coſen and other kinſmen with heauie countenances and watrie eyes looked rufully on him; and though for griefe they were not able to ſpeake one word to him; yet euery looke, and euery countenance, and euery geſture was a loud crie, and a ſtrong intreatie, that he would ſtay, and not leaue ſo ancient and noble a houſe in ſuch woſull and deſolate caſe. No words can ſuffice to expreſſe the griefe of that doleful company, nor that lamentable departure that there was to be ſeene. Vnutterable was the griefe on their ſide,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:637:33"/>
and vnſpeakeable was the torment &amp; temptation which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gentleman felt in this agonv, when he muſt either leaue Chriſt Ieſus or leaue all theſe for him. But amongſt &amp; aboue al, there was one moſt lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table ſight, which would euen haue wrung tears fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hart of flint. Amongſt al his children he had one daughter, a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly &amp; goodly yong gentlewoman of xij. yeres old, who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out amain &amp; wallowing in teares, fell downe, &amp; catching faſt hold about his thighes and knees, held him ſo hard as he could by no means ſhake her off: &amp; the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a father wroght ſo with him, as he could not offer with violence to hurt her; he labored to be looſe, but ſhe held faſter; he went away, but ſhe trailed after, crying to him not to be ſo cruell to her his childe; who came into the world by him. This ſo wonderfully wrought with his nature, he being a man of a moſt louing &amp; kind affection; that he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reported he thought that all his bowels rowled about within him &amp; that his hart would haue burſt preſently, &amp; there inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue died, his child ſo hauing him faſt about the legs.

But one thing pierced his heart
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:637:34"/>
to ſee his wife, and children, and other his alliance ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the ſhore; who when they could not ſpeake to him, looked at him; and when they could not ſee him cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to looke after the ſhippe as long as it was in ſight; neither could hee refraine but with a wofull countenance looke at them againe as long as hee could diſcerne them: and withall he called to minde the bitter words and heauy farewell which the Marqueſſe his father gaue him at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; all which cogitations running in his head, did doubtleſſe wring from his ſorrowfull heart many a deepe ſigh and heauy grone, and many a bitter teare from his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie eyes: and yet notwithſtanding all theſe, the ſpirituall ſtrength and courage of his minde was conſtant and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. And euen as a good Pilot in a raging ſea, when clouds and darkeneſſe, thunder and lightnings, ſtorme and tempeſt runne together, and toſſe the ſhippe from waue to waue, as lightly as a ball from hand to hand; yet for all that he ſits ſtill at the helme, with vndanted courage, and markes his compaſſe; and by his courage and skill toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepes on a right and ſtedfaſt courſe thorow all the rage of ſea and weather: euen ſo this our thrice noble <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leacius</hi> taking hold of the holy and heauenly anchor; namely, a liuely faith in Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt hope in God, he ſurmounts the clouds, and fixeth thoſe anchor-holdes in heauen, and looking ſtedfaſtly with a ſpirituall eye, at the true load ſtarre: namely, Chriſt Ieſus and the hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe; he directs his courſe towards the ſame with an heroicall ſpirit, and heauenly reſolution thorow the tempeſtuous waues of thoſe fearefull temptations: and the ſhippe that caried his body, did not ſo faſt tranſport him from delicate <hi>Italy</hi> towards <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> as the ſhippe of heauenly conſtancy and loue of God withdrew his minde and meditation from all naturall reſpects and worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and made it mount aloſt in holy contemplation. And thus the preſence and grace of Gods ſpirit, hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the power of naturall affections; he began to cheere vp himſelfe after this tempeſt: and firſt of all, bending the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:637:34"/>
knees of his heart to the eternall father in heauen; hee yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Maieſty moſt hearty thankes, for that he had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his ſoule with ſuch a portion of his grace, as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and conquere Satan in ſuch a perillous battell: and for that hee had deliuered him from the danger of Popiſh thraldome, from the inquiſition, and from that perpetuall impriſonment both of conſcience and body which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church would haue brought him vnto, had he not thus eſcaped their hands. Hee likewiſe praiſed God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly, that he vouchſafed to giue him time, opportunity, and grace to diſcharge that duety to his wife the yong Marchioneſſe, which at his firſt departure he had omitted, and which oftentimes he had with great griefe bewailed, and that he had enabled him to omit nothing which might haue perſwaded her to haue left <hi>Sodome,</hi> and to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with him this bleſſed pilgrimage towards the heauenly Ieruſalem. The remembrance of theſe things much refreſhed his troubled minde. It alſo much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſatisfied his conſcience, that vpon that monſtrous and vndutifull behauiour of his wife towards him (ſpoken of before) hee had made that proteſtation which hee did: namely, that he would vſe the lawfull meanes to be diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from her, who had firſt of al diuorced &amp; cut off her ſelfe from him, by denying that duety of loue, which the wife may not denie to the husband, nor the husband to the wife: he perſwaded himſelfe that this proteſtation would worke well with her, and make her more confirmeable to her due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when ſhe had aduiſedly thought of it.</p>

            <p>REuiuing his troubled ſpirits with theſe cogitations, he arriued at <hi>Laſina</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which is the countrey o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt <hi>Italy;</hi> from whence he paſſed in a very quiet paſſage, and calme ſea to <hi>Venice:</hi> where hee found many faithfull ſeruants of God, and good Chriſtians; who hauing heard afore that he was gone to <hi>Vicum,</hi> were exceedingly afraid for that imminent and ineuitable danger they ſaw he was in, either to haue his conſcience a ſlaue to Popiſh vanity, or his perſon a priſoner to Popiſh cruelty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ceaſed not to pray for him night and day: and yet for all that they feared greatly what would become of him.

But when he had diſcourſt vnto them particularly the whole courſe of the proceedings: firſt, what a ſtrong battry of temptations and aſſaults the diuell and the world had planted againſt him, then how manfully he fought and withſtood, and at laſt ouercame them all; they fell into admiration of ſo rare conſtancy, and thought him worthy of all honour, to whom it is giuen (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) to ſuffer ſo much for Chriſt and for Religions ſake: and in all earneſt manner they magnified the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grace and mercy of God towards him, and towards the whole Church in him; which had not ſuffred his ſeruant (this noble <hi>Galeacius)</hi> to be ſeduced out of the way of that holy calling whereto the Lord had called him: and who had deliuered him from ſo ſubtile a traine, laid by the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the enemy Satan, to haue intrapt his ſoule and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by ouerturning him in the race of his Religion: and they all acknowledged that this noble and godly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man found it verified in himſelfe, which the kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith in the Pſalme: <hi>Becauſe he hath truſted in me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſet him free: I will be with him in his troubles, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him, and crowne him with honour:</hi> and in another place, <hi>he that truſteth in the Lord ſhall neuer be confounded.</hi> And thus the Church receiued a double benefit by him: for firſt, his practiſe was an example vnto them all of a moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and heauenly conſtancy in the loue and profeſſion of true Religion: ſecondly, the mercifull dealing of the Lord with him, was a notable confirmation of their faith, and an encouragement to them to perſeuere and ſtand to the truth, with aſſurance that the Lord himſelfe would ſtand by them.</p>

obſeruing the due forme of Law, and the ordinary courſe of Iuſtice in ſuch caſes, he craued publikely of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that he might be diuorced, that is, that he might bee pronounced to be free and diſcharged from that wife, who had already cut off her felfe from him. The Magiſtrate conſidering the trueth and circumſtance of the caſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the iudgement of the Diuines, wherunto alſo was agreable the iudgement of the Law, graunted vnto him, as by his aduocates it was required; &amp; ſo in publik Court, and by ſentence definite, and irreuocable he was diuorced, and was pronounced to be free, and diſcharged of his former wife <hi>Victoria;</hi> and that it was lawful for him and in his choice to liue vnmaried, or to marrie as hee himſelfe would. After which liberty obtained, hee imparted the matter to his friends, and applying himſelfe to thinke of another wife, he asked their aduices in this point alſo. And herein hee tooke that courſe, which generally men in the world take, not; for in his choice he reſpected not ſo much wealth, birth nor beauty, but onely to find a fit companion of his life, and ſuch a one, as with whom he might lead that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his life, in a comfortable contentment, in tranquillity of minde and peace of conſcience; that ſo hee might the more cheerefully ſerue the Lord, and waite for the comming of Ieſus Chriſt. Which courſe of his is more to be noted, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in ſo great a man, and ſo honorably diſcended; and the rather to croſſe and controle the carnall and worldly courſes, which men for the moſt part and women alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in their mariages; reſpecting thoſe things firſt, which ſhould be laſt, and that laſt or not at al which ſhould be firſt and aboue all. <hi>Galeacius</hi> continuing this his purpoſe, and looking about for his choice, the prouidence of God (which doth neuerfaile his children, eſpecially in ſo great matters) did offer vnto him a fit opportunity. For ſo it was that at the ſame time, a certaine gentlewoman of <hi>France,</hi> a wido we came from <hi>Roan</hi> to <hi>Geneua,</hi> for true religions ſake, which ſhe loued and profeſſed, and for the loue of it left her country, &amp; came thither for liberty of her conſcience. She was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronelie,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:637:38"/>
and a graue woman, and well reported of for her modeſty, honeſty, feare of God, and for manifold good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: her name was <hi>Anna Fremeria,</hi> and was about fortie yeares of age. All which circumſtances <hi>Galeacius</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing, thought her a fit and conuenient wife for him: and ſo with the conſent and liking of other his good friends, he tooke her to wife, and married her the ſixteenth day of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, in the yeare 1560. and in the three and fortieth yeare of his age; and they liued together many yeares after with much comfort one of another, &amp; in an excellent agreement, being both of the ſame Religion, and of one mind; alwaies drawing in one yoke, and bearing one burden; diuiding it betwixt them; whether it was ioy or ſorrow: ſo that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes of his life paſt, was now recompenced with a life full ofall contentment; and ſo louing her, and being truely loued ofher, they ſpent their daies in all mutuall comfort, ſolacing themſelues in their quiet and priuate life, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mutuall faithfulnes and loyalty which one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to another.

His attire was plaine and homely,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:637:38"/>
but alwaies comely, cleane and handſome: and he that in his owne countrey might haue beene Lord of ſo many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and commander of ſo many ſeruants, did now walke the ſtreets of <hi>Geneua</hi> alone, often not hauing the attendance of one man: yea he would not diſdain to come himſelfe into<note place="margin">His humilitie and lowly minde.</note> the market, nor think ſcorn to prouide himſelf of neceſſaries: and ſometime would buy and cary home fruits, herbs, roots, and ſuch other things. And this courſe of life, together with liberty oftrue Religion, he eſteemed greater happines then the Marqueſdome of <hi>Vicum.</hi> And although by this courſe of life he could ſcarce be diſcerned from an ordinary man, and from the common ſort of people: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Euidences of nobility ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his actions and behauiours.</note> in his countenance appeared that grauity in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, behauiours, and in his whole body ſhone that comely maieſty; as any wiſe man to haue ſeene him, and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him, would haue preſently iudged that he came of noble race; and that he had beene fit for the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the world: which alſo was ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe that with his excellency of birth and perſon, &amp; perfection of all gentlemanly behauiours was ioyned true godlines, &amp; the feare of God; which of it ſelfe is of ſuch force as it is able euen to honour him, who wanteth theſe worldly ornaments and outward perfections.

By alwhich it came to paſſe that ſo many parts of the chiefeſt excellencies meeting in that one man, made him to ſhine aboue other the members of the Church, euen as the moone amongſt the ſtars. So that the <hi>Italian</hi> Church, though but little of it ſelfe; yet by the vertues and worthineſſe of this one noble gentleman, ſeemed worthy to be compared with the whole Church of <hi>Geneua.</hi> And as he was a credit<note place="margin">How greatly he was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua.</note> and honour vnto that Church, ſo was he againe moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie eſteemed of that Church: yea not onely of that Church, but of the whole Church and State of <hi>Geneua:</hi> for not one Senator nor Magiſtrate of the City, not one of the Preachers &amp; Miniſters of the church was to be found, which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:637:39"/>
had not alwaies in their mouthes, the commendation of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Galeacius:</hi> yea he was honored and highly eſteemed of bythem all, and it was hard to ſay whether hee was more loued, or admired amongſt them. In a word, he was loued of all men, lookt at of all men, ſpoken of by all men, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and extolled, yea wondred at of all men; and though he knew not many himſelfe, yet all men laboured to knowe him. No publike meeting was appointed, no ſolemne feaſt was made, wherto this our <hi>Galeacius</hi> was not moſt ſolemnly called: yea euery man was deſirous of him, and happy was he that might haue his company: yea they thought their meetings graced, and their houſes honoured with his preſence; and in all aſſemblies the chiefeſt and higheſt roome was offred him: yeawas thruſt vpon him, though<note place="margin">They ſtil cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by the title of Marqueſſe.</note> he nothing at all reſpected it. And although he refuſed the name and title of Marqueſſe; becauſe, he ſaid, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had cut off his ſucceſſion, and depriued him of that honour becauſe of his Religion: notwithſtanding, do what he could, he was called byno other name al his life long, and that not by ſome few his friends and fauorites, but by all ſorts of men, euen ſtrangers themſelues, and ſuch as were not of his Religion.

               <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the yong Dukes of <hi>Ferrara, Octauius</hi> the Prince of <hi>Selerum:</hi> and thus did <hi>Ferneſius</hi> the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and diuers other: who in their trauell comming by <hi>Geneua</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him in all the complements of courteſie and of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no leſſe then if he had beene at <hi>Naples</hi> in his former glorie; or if he had ſtill beene a courtier in the Emperours Court, as heretofore he had beene. In a word, no Noble man, no Embaſſador, no great ſcholar, no man of note, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forraine nation came that way, but preſently they vſed meanes to haue a ſight of this noble Marqueſſe; and for the moſt part deſired to haue ſome company and conference with him: So that he was reſorted vnto continually by men of all ſorts; as though he had not beene a priuate man, keeping a meane eſtate and dwelling in a little houſe; but rather as though he had beene a great Prince in the Court, or one neere in place to the Emperour himſelfe. But though all men deſired his acquaintance and company, and he againe was not curious in that point, but courteous to<note place="margin">His company and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> all as occaſion was offred: yet for the moſt part, his moſt familiar conuerſation was with the men of his owne nation: namely, with his countrimen the <hi>Italians,</hi> of whom there was a flouriſhing Church at <hi>Geneua</hi> at the ſame time; and which alſo flouriſhed the better by his meanes, as heretofore hath beene declared. Amongſt whom though he behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it is doubtfull whether more ciuilly, or more humbly; yet for all that he was honoured of them all, and vſed more like a Lord then a priuate man: which although he in euery reſpect deſerued, yet by no meanes deſired. And ſo beſides all his worthy and excellent parts, his humble minde and<note place="margin">His courteſie and affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> friendly conuerſation made him more honourable. And to ſpeake but truth of him, out of all queſtion hee was not onely a good Chriſtian, but (which is not alwaies ſeene) a perfect and an abſolute man: yea a man can hardly name any of thoſe good parts and amiable qualities; which for<note place="margin">His rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> the moſt part doe winne a man loue in the world; which were not to be found in this noble gentleman. For beſides his noble birth and Princely education, his Religion and

true feare of God; he was alſo humble minded, affable, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and friendly to all men: he was wiſe, diſcreete, of good<note place="margin">His elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and ability of ſpeech.</note> conceit, and of an excellent ſpeech and diſcourſe. It would haue delighted a man to haue heard him ſpeake; for as his memory was exceeding good, ſo his naturall eloquence, his ſmooth ſtile, his eaſie, quiet and ſeemely deliuerie, made his ſpeech to be greatly commended of all that heard him. A man would haue wondred to haue ſeene how many, euen of the beſt ſort, would haue laboured to haue bin in his company, and as it were haue catcht vp &amp; eaten his words from his mouth, when it pleaſed him to diſcourſe of ſome of thoſe exploits and aduentures, which had fallen within the compaſſe of his own knowledg: as of the Emperor Charles the fift his voiage into Prouence, and of his warres which he waged in <hi>Gelderland,</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Cleeue,</hi> and of many other great affaires and ſpecial imployments. Neither was hee onely a fit companion for gentlemen and men of<note place="margin">His mildneſſe to his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</note> eſtate, but ſuch was the mildnes of his nature and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he was alſo kind and courteous to men of lower place, and moſt ofall to the poore, amongſt whom, if they were godly and honeſt he would conuerſe as familiarly, as with his equals, or with men of greater place. He was alſo of a free and liberall hart, no poore or diſtreſſed man did euer<note place="margin">His charity to the poore.</note> require his aſſiſtance, or craue his helpe, but preſently hee would reach vuto them his helping hand, and relieue them by all meanes he could, yea the want of his former wealth and loſſe of his Marqueſdome, did neuer grieue him, but when he had not wherewithall to exerciſe his charitie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poore ſoules of God: it was his ioy and delight to be lending and giuing to thoſe that wanted, and in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect onely he often wiſhed himſelfe as great a man in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> as he was in <hi>Italy:</hi> but to his power and ability his good workes did farre exceed the proude and phariſaical pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,<note place="margin">His good workes and charitable deedes.</note> who glorie in their workes, and will bee ſaued by them. Priſoners &amp; men in danger did often feele his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; hee omitted not to viſite his ſicke brethren, and that moſt diligently: ſuch as were poore hee relieued; yea the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:637:40"/>
richeſt and learnedſt of all, did thinke themſelues in their ſickneſſes happy to haue him with them; his preſence and<note place="margin">His ordinary exerciſes of Religion, publike and priuate.</note> company, but eſpecially his talke and Chriſtian exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo comfortable vnto them. His ordinary exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were theſe; euery day hee repaired to the Church and heard diuine ſeruice, and miſſed not to be preſent at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the congregation, eſpecially he neuer omitted to heare the Sermons and the word preached; which he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with wonderful deuotion &amp; reuerence to the word of God; for he iudged and eſteemed that the true happines of a man, and the onely ſweete and pleaſant life conſiſted in liuing holily, in walking in Gods waies, in meeting with Satans temptations, in bridling the corruptions of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in ſeruing God truely and ſincerely without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: vnto all which ſteps of happines he thought he could neuer attaine, but by the preaching of the word; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he alſo adioyned a daily courſe of reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thus labouring out of the Scriptures to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he applied to the profit and comfort, not ofhimſelfe, alone, but of many others with him.</p>
            <p>Beſides al this, for the loue he beare vnto the Church, and the deſire he had to do al good he could; he tooke vpon him<note place="margin">His particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall calling.</note> the office of an Elder in the Church: the duety whereof he ſupplied daily, carefully obſeruing and inquiring into the maners and liues of profeſſors; allowing &amp; incouraging the good, and cenſuring the offenders, which he did with great care &amp; conſcience, leſt that ſcandals &amp; offences might ariſe<note place="margin">His courage and iuſtice.</note> in the Church, whereby either the quiet and good eſtate ofthe Church at home might be diſturbed, or the enemie might haue any occaſion to ſlander the profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither ſtayed he here, but beſide this publike care and<note place="margin">His loue of peace, and continuall ending of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and ſetting men at vnity that were at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> labour, hee alſo was daily well occupied in more priuate matters: for where euer he ſaw, obſerued, or heard of any diſſenſions, ſutes in law, or controuerſies amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian neighbours, hee was exceeding carefull to end and compaſſe them; and for that end, as he had a ripe wit and a good conceit and deepe inſight, ſo hee would imploy them all to the finding out the trueth and ſtate of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:637:41"/>
cauſe: and hauing found it, hee would vſe all his authority, yea he would make himſelfe beholden to men, on condition they would yeelde one to another, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

In a word, his whole courſe of life ſauoured of grace, and did ſhew him to to be a ſanctified man; yet doubtleſſe he thoght himſelfe borne not for himſelfe, but for God and for the Church; and he thought no time ſo well ſpent, nor any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſo wel diſpatcht, as that wherin, not any priuate gain, or pleaſure to himſelfe was ſought or obtained, but only Gods glory aduanced, his Church edified, religion maintained, and the good worke of Gods grace confirmed in himſelfe and others.</p>

For firſt of all, he fell ſicke of a grieuous, doubtful &amp; dangerous diſeaſe, which had bred vpon him by abundance of rheume, wherby he became ſo ſhort winded that he could hardly draw his breath; by force of ſuch weakenes he was exceedingly tormented night and day: for the good gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was conſtrained oftentimes to ſit vp whole nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

But the heauenly conſtancy of this holy man, droue this frantike papiſt from his bias, into an extreme choller, for he according to the nature of his Popes holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion thought that when all arguments had failed, yet money would haue wonne him, and therfore ſeeing him ſo highly to ſcorne, and ſo diſdainfully to contemne ſo great offers, hee thought it very ſtrange; and therefore ſeeing all his labor loſt, and his beſt hold proue ſo weake, he fell from mony to meere madnes; and forgetting himſelfe, and his duty, brake out into ill words, and reproohfull termes: But when the Magiſtrate was informed of it, and ſaw that this arrogant papiſt durſt ſo far abuſe the patience of ſo honorable a man, therfore by their authority, they forbad him the Citie (as the manner of that place is in ſuch cafes) and ſo this newes bringer had his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be packing, and to go home and count his siluer; and there to bragge of his good ſucceſſe; for he now could ſay by good experience, that ſo much money as was enough to lead an hundred popiſh friers to and fro whither a man would, like Beares by the noſe, could not touch the conſcience of one proteſtant, much leſſe make him a papiſt.</p>

            <p>His long and languiſhing ſickenes grew and increaſed vpon him in ſuch meaſure, as his paine was moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous; but hee bare it all with an heroicall and heauenly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: ſo that it might manifeſtly appeare that euen the Lord from heauen did lend him ſtrength; and as the torments and pangs of the diſeaſe increaſed, ſo hisfaith and patience and all heauenly vertues ſhone in him more and more: ſo that it was moſt true of him which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as the outward man periſhed ſo the inward man was renued daily.</hi> His body pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away, buthis minde and ſoule grew from ſtrength to ſtrength: and as a by-ſtander feeles not the paines of him that is tormented or racked before his eyes: ſo his ſoule and mind ſtood as it were a farre off, beholding the paines and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body; and being vntoucht it ſelfe, did as it were laugh at Satan, ſinne, death, and damnation; who by all their ioynt power could doe no more, but onely to vex and racke this poore carcaſe with bodily diſeaſe, but were not able to touch the ſoule, to vexe the minde, or wound the conſcience. If any man aske the reaſon why his mind and conſeience were ſo quiet in this ſo great torment of the body: the reaſon was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that his mind was imployed in holy meditations, as of the ſingular loue of God his father vnto him in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; whereby he aſſured himſelfe vndoubtedly of ſaluation, of the manifold holy graces, wherewith God had adorned him: by the force whereof, he ſaid, he had borne off ſo many buffets of Satan, had paſſed ſo many pikes of troubles, and come away conquerer in ſo many fearefull fights, as had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues againſt him in his conuerſion. Theſe gifts and graces of God he weighed with the croſſes of his ſicknes, and found them far heauier; and he compared theſe momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany and light afflictions, with that exceeding and eternall weight of glory, which, he ſaid, he knew was laid vp for him in heauen. Theſe and ſuch like meditations cheered vp his ſpirit more then the force of his ſickenes could appall him.</p>
            <p>But aboue al things he felt vnſpeakable comfort and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

So that the ſaying of the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was verified in him, <hi>As the ſuffrings of Chriſt abounded in us, ſo conſolation by Chriſt abounded much more.</hi> In his ſickenes he wanted no helpe of the Phyſitions, for they came to him out of all parts of the citie: and willingly did they all do their diligence about his body; whoſe ſoule they knew had Chriſt Ieſus to be the Phyſition for it. His friends alſo continually viſited him, who were of the chiefe men in the citie; and they were all welcome to him rich and poore: and it is hard to ſay whether he receiued more comfort by them, or they more ſpirituall edification by him; his ſpeeches and behauiours were ſo full of patience, and ſo well ſeaſoned with all grace. All his friends performed to him what duety ſoeuer was in their power, but eſpecially his worthy wife did then ſhew her ſelfe moſt louing and loyall, for ſhe was neuer from about him, and ſaw that he wanted nothing which the world could yeelde for the recouery of his health. But all was in vaine, for the time of his diſſolution was at hand, and he had runne the royall race of a moſt holy Chriſtian life; and now nothing remained but a bleſſed death. He might ſay as the Apoſtle did with much ioy of heart: <hi>I haue run my race, I haue finiſhed my courſe, I haue kept the faith: from henceforth is laid vp for me a crown of righteouſnes, which Chriſt the righteous Iudge will giue to me, and to all ſuch as wait for his appearing.</hi>

            <p>After few daies the violence of his ſickenes was ſuch, as it ouercame all power of phyſicke; ſo that it was manifeſt, that that bleſſed houre approched, wherin the Lord had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to accompliſh his owne good worke in him; therefore he ſequeſtred himſelf altogether from any more care of his body, and from al worldly cogitations; he renounced the world and all in it; he tooke his farewell of his wife, and all his Chriſtian friends, and ſaid, hee ſhould lead them the way to heauen. Hee fixed all his thoughts vpon his ſoule, and

And thus as all his friends ſat about him, and as the Preachers and Miniſters were occupied in holy praiers and reading of the Scriptures, and applying to him the heauenly conſolations of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> word, in the performance of theſe exerciſes he ended his dales, wherein hee had taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delight all his life long: and as hee reioyced to haue them in this life, ſo it pleaſed the Lord that he ſhould haue them at his death. And ſo in the midſt of all his friends, in the preſence of the Miniſters, euen in the fight of them all, he peaceablie and quietly yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp his ſpirit, and rendred his ſoule into the hands of his mercifull God and faithfull Creator, of whom he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it; who immediatly by the miniſtery of his holy Angels receiuing it at his hands, and waſhing it pure in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, crowned it with the crown of eternal &amp; heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happines. And thus this holy man was tranſlated from a noble man on earth, to be a noble Saint in heauen: and of a Marqueſſe on earth in bare name and title, he was aduanced to be a glorious &amp; triumphing King in heauen: where he now raignes in glory with that God whom he ſo faithfully ſerued on earth. That God and mereifull father grant that all we that reade this admirable ſtory, may be allured to take vpon vs the ſame moſt holy profeſſion, that this thrice noble Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe did; and may renounce and caſt off what euer in this world we ſee doth hinder vs from the holy fellowſhippe of Chriſt Ieſus; and ſtrengthen vs that we may be faithful to the end: that ſo we may obtaine the crowne of life in that glory, where this noble <hi>Galeacius</hi> and all the heauenly hoſt of Gods Saints do wait for vs. Amen.
