         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Love of Chriſt in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ones, and the great uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch Hiſtory, command
me to take it as a pleaſing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to commend this real deſcription of
a Saint, to thy ſerious peruſal and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The good acceptance and ſucceſs of
the late publiſhed Life and Death of
Mr. <hi>Joſeph Alleine,</hi> the more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
me to ſerve thee in this. As to the
credit of the Narrative, let it be enough
to tell thee, that his worthy Brother
Mr. <hi>James Janeway</hi> (intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his moſt ſecret life) is the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it (I have no hand in it my
ſelf) And if thou live in or neer <hi>London,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33153:3"/>
where he is now well known. I will not
be beholden to thee to believe it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
if you alſo know the other moſt
credible atteſtors. I know that many
ſuch Hiſtories ſhew more what the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
could ſay, than what the Perſon <hi>was</hi>
or <hi>did:</hi> But here both He and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and thoſe whom he lived with,
were all ſo neer us, and are many of
them yet ſo intimately known to me,
and others, that there is no place for
doubting left us.</p>
            <p>I confeſs ſuch inſtances are very ſad
to my thoughts, while I am deſiring
the welfare of mankind on earth. To
hear of the death of an Infant, who
might have proved we know not what;
or of an uſeleſs perſon, or of an aged
Chriſtian, who hath profitably run
out the courſe of nature, is nothing ſo
ſad to me, as to hear of the removal of
ſuch excellent young men, when they
are prepared for their work, and juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
it! But God is infinitely Wiſe,
and Juſt, and more Merciful too than we
can be. He knoweth what he doth and
why; and is accountable to none about
the <hi>meaſure</hi> of his <hi>benefits,</hi> nor the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33153:3"/>
of his <hi>various diſpoſals.</hi> But the
great Judgments which ſince his death
have befallen theſe Kingdomss do part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell us that it is no wonder, if ſuch men
were taken from the evil to come, of
whom the world hath ſo notoriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it ſelf unworthy. It is fitter for ſuch
lights to ſhine in Heaven, than to be put
under a buſhel here on earth.</p>
            <p>And <hi>for himſelf,</hi> he hath run long
enough who hath toucht the prize: He
hath ſailed long enough who is come ſafe
to the harbour: And he hath lived long
enough, who is readieſt to die? Though
I wonder at the lengthning of my own
life, which hath been threatned by God
and Man theſe thirty three years or more,
yet, alas, how much leſs have I lived
than this man did, who am yet far ſhort
of his heavenly preparations? I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to read that any thing of mine was
a help to his attainments, and to find
that at almoſt ſixty years of age, I am
much below what he was raiſed to at
twenty three. O that God would give
my frozen age, ſuch warm reflections from
theſe his remains, that (according to my
need) I may receive more from him that
<pb facs="tcp:33153:4"/>
is dead, than ever he did from me alive!
If his own Reverend Father received ſo
much from him, why may not I alſo have
ſome quickning even by the dead,
through the fruits of the ſpirit left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, and the ſame ſpirits quickning
influx upon me? And may I but ſo <hi>Die,</hi>
how harmleſs, how welcome will Death
be?</p>
            <p>We think it great pity, that he lived
to preach but two Sermons in the world!
That ſame poor ignorant dull Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had not been inſtructed and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Doctrine; and his ſpiritual
ſervour had not by diſperſed writings, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
the ſouls of thouſands with the
ſame Heavenly Love and Zeal. But who
knoweth yet but that this one Narrative
of his Holy exemplary Life and Death,
may do as much as more numerous or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
writings? The many Volumes
of holy Lives, of antient Docters, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and later Divines, Philoſophers and
others in <hi>Germany, England</hi> and other
Lands, have done much good, and are
ſtill very uſeful, and a pleaſant and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
recreation, (O how much better
than play-Books and Romances)? But
<pb facs="tcp:33153:4"/>
experience tells us, that God ſtill poureth
forth as large meaſures of his ſpirit, as
heretofore he did. If holy <hi>Augustines</hi>
life, after ſo much pollution, and holy
<hi>Hieroms</hi> life, <hi>qui fatetur ſe non fuiſſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem,</hi>
were ſo laudible and examplary;
O how much praiſe do I owe to God, for
his grace upon his Servants, who am
yet acquainted with ſo great a number of
holy laborious faithful miniſters, who I
have great reaſon to believe, not only
to have all their lives been free from all
groſs heynous ſins, but alſo to have laid
out their zeal, their time, their labours,
ſo ſincerely and ſelf-denyingly for God,
and the good of ſouls, as that I cannot but
hope that, if thoſe who are againſt their
Preaching of the Goſpel, were but as well
acquainted with them as I am, they
would be their friend and forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their work.</p>
            <p>I know one Temptation the Reader is
like to meet with, to hinder his profiting
by this example: Even to think that
Mr. <hi>Alleine</hi> and Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> by <hi>Overdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
did but cut ſhort their own Lives;
and that their exceſſive lobours in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
prayer and other duties did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb facs="tcp:33153:5"/>
the Church of the benefit of much
more, which they might have lived to do:
and therefore that ſuch examples are not
to be imitated, but ſtand as warnings to
us, not to over do and deſtroy our bodies
as they did. To which I anſwer, 1. I
am one my ſelf, that wiſh both of them
had done ſomewhot leſs, in that part of
<hi>duty</hi> which hurt the body, and overmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their ſtrength. And I am not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
you, that every man muſt needs
Preach as oft as Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> or <hi>ſtudy</hi> aud
<hi>meditate</hi> as long as Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> and he
did: Men have their various capacities
and oportunities, and works. 2. But
yet I dare not charge either of them with
ſin, becauſe I know not their particular
motives. 3. And perhaps their lives had
been as ſhort if they had done leſs; as
are the lives of many hundred Students,
who favour themſelves more than any
wiſe men would wiſh. And it was Gods
mercy that they who had but a ſhort life
to live, ſhould do more than any that
live to the period of natures courſe. And
<hi>Methuſalems</hi> life and theirs is equalled
now. Whom have you known that by
longer living, hath got more holy readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:33153:5"/>
to die? 4. But I beſeech you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
well, between that part of their
work, which was really like to overthrow
their natures, and the reſt which had no
ſuch tendency; and do not make the
avoiding of the former a pretence, againſt
your imitating of the latter. It is not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying,
meditating, praying, preaching,
according to the meaſures of natures
ſtrength, that much ſhortnerh life. I think
that Learned man wrote not fooliſhly,
who maintaineth that <hi>ſtudies tend to long
life?</hi> For my own part I was ſeeble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was a hard Student: And ſtudies
have been a conſtant pleaſure to me; And
let any man judge whether conſtant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
tend to ſhorten any mans life? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that which deſtroyeth the health of
Students is, 1. The ſedentarineſs of their
lives, 2. And want of temperance or due
care of their diet, 3. And want of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cheerfulneſs, 4. And taking colds.
Could Students but more imitate the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring-man,</hi>
and take <hi>juſt hours</hi> and <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities</hi>
for <hi>bodily labour</hi> (not playful
walks and exerciſes, that never warm and
purge the blood,) and did they <hi>eat</hi> and
<hi>drink wiſely,</hi> and live <hi>joyfully,</hi> and avoid
<pb facs="tcp:33153:6"/>
colds, they might beſtow the reſt of their
time in the hardeſt ſtudies, with little
hurt; (except here and there a melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or diſeaſed man.) I doubt not but
ſuch narratives as this, will tempt many a
ſlothful ſenſual Scholar, to indulge his
ſenſuality as the wiſer way; but at a dying
hour he will find the difference. O what
a comfort then is the review of a Holy,
Heavenly well-ſpent life!</p>
            <p>I have oft thought what the Reaſon is
that among the Papiſts, if the lives of
their Saints be deſcribed in the higheſt
ſtrain, or their books have even unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
pretenſions of devotion, even to
the laying by of our underſtandings, or
to a kind of Deification, (like <hi>Barban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Benedictus, de Benedictis,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others) it doth not offend men, but
the vulger themſelves do glory in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of them. Whereas if with us a
man riſe higher in holineſs, and in devote
contemplation, yea or action, than others,
he is preſently the great <hi>eye-ſore</hi> and <hi>oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy</hi>
of the world, I mean of the <hi>envious</hi>
and <hi>ungodly</hi> part, which is too great.
But the reaſon I perceive is, that among
the Papiſts, to be a <hi>Religious man</hi> is to
<pb facs="tcp:33153:6"/>
be a <hi>Perfectest</hi> who doth more than is
commanded him or is necceſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and ſo the people being taught that
they may be ſaved without being ſuch
themſelves, their ſpleen is not ſtirred up
againſt them, as the troubles of their
Conſciences peace; but they are intreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in their honour, and being the honour
of their way and Church: But with us
men are taught that they muſt be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
themſelves in ſincerity if ever they
will be ſaved, and that without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
none ſhall ſee God, and that they
are not ſincere if they deſire not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
And ſo they that will not be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
themſelves, do think that the lives of
the godly do condemn them.</p>
            <p>I write not this to caſt any diſgrace on
the true Hiſtory of any holy mens lives:
Nor ſhall it ever be my employment to
reproach or hide Gods Graces in any, nor
to make men believe that they are
worſe than they are. Whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
me for it, I will magnifie and love
that of God which appeareth in any
of his ſervants, of any ſect or party what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover.
When I read ſuch writings as

the pernicious tympanite of the Church,

the more men glory in their dogmatical
knowledge, to the contempt and hurt of
ſuch as differ from them, the leſs they
know as they ought to know. And if
any man have knowledge enough to
kindle in his ſoul the Love of God, the

            <p>Reader, Learn by this Hiſtory to place
thy Religion in love and praiſe, and a
heavenly life. Learn to keep ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, and to find ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb facs="tcp:33153:7"/>
with thy heart by meditation,
as thy <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>opertunity,</hi> and <hi>other
duties</hi> will allow thee: (for I urge thee
to no more) Learn hence to thirſt after
the good of ſouls, and to fill up thy
hours with fruitful duty! And O that
we could here learn the hardeſt leſſon, to
get above the love of life, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the fears of death, and to long to
ſee the glory of Chriſt, and triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to paſs by Joy to Joy. O bleſſed world
of holy ſpirits! whoſe <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>work,</hi>
and <hi>happineſs</hi> is <hi>Love:</hi> not Love of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-ſelf,</hi>
and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> which
here maketh thoſe ſeek our deſtruction
moſt, who have the higheſt eſteem of our
<hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> (as thinking our
diſſent will moſt effectually croſs their
partial Intereſt:) But the Love of God
in Himſelf and in his Saints, checked by
no ſin; hindred by no diſtance, darkneſs,
deadneſs or diſaffection: diverted by
no carnal worldly baits; tempted by no
perſecutions or afflictions; damped by no
fears of death, nor of any decaies or ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
through Eternity. To teach me
better how to live and die, in <hi>Faith,
Hope</hi> ane <hi>Love,</hi> is that for which I read
<pb facs="tcp:33153:8"/>
this narrarive; and that thou maiſt learn

to thee! The Lord teach it effectual to

            <p>MY own mean eſteem of the ſingle
weight of that Teſtimony expected
from me concerning my dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the account of my intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with him in Kings Colledge (the <hi>known</hi> me.
morable paſſages of whoſe exemplary life and
death are now happily compiled and publiſhed
for <hi>your ſpecial peruſal</hi>) moves me to call in
<pb facs="tcp:33153:9"/>
a twofold recommendation thereof from you to
thoſe that knew him not, who being confirmed in
the truth of this Narrative, may thereby be won
to believe, admire and emulate the ſignal grace
of God in him.</p>
            <p>1. That remembring ſo much thereof your
ſelves, and what opportnity I had of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the certainty of all: you would aſſure thoſe
who may enquire of you; That the imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
compiler hath kept within the bounds of truth
and ſobriety in proſecution of his honeſt aims,
to advance the glory of Gods rich mercy to
this choſen veſſel, and by reviving what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
he could collect of this burning as well
as ſhining light (alaſs how ſoon extinct!) to
awaken and quicken the formal profeſſors, if
he may not induce the profane ſcoffers of this
age, to a more ſerious ſtudy and improvement
of thoſe inviſible Realities, the clear evidence
and powerful influence whereof, our good friend
did ſo abundantly experience. The truth is,
the Tranſcriber (though beſt accompliſhed,
and moſt inwardly acquainted with what,
might conduce thereto) doth and could not
but fall ſhort of declaring the tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celencies
of this ſublime ſoul and precious Saint,
which till toward his end, when his heart was
too full to hold in what could be uttered)
were much concealed even to thoſe who knew
him beſt, by reaſon of his great humility and
modeſty. Theſe diſpoſed him rather to receive
than communicate; except where he had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb facs="tcp:33153:9"/>
of the former, and either familiar
intercourſe ingaged, or the apprehended exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of thoſe his heart was drawn out to in
Chriſtian love and compaſſion, conſtrained to
the latter. Yet many of thoſe precious ſtreams
that did flow from him we muſt lament the loſs
of, through default of careful rececivers or
faithful retainers. He was of clear intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
and a large heart both for craving and
comprehending what was worthy his perſuit:
which being happily improved by his education,
and timely ſeaſoned with a ſpiritual ſavour of
Goſpel myſteries (for obtaining of which he
had then with others, choiſe advantages) was
a great help to his proficiency in acquaintance
with the vital exerciſes and ſoul ſatisfying en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the divine life, above not only his
equals, but ſeniors and inſtructors. He was
much diſſatisfied with himſelf under any decays
or abatements, till he could (if not alone, by
imploring the aſſiſtance of Christian friends)
recover what he ſometime had had ſuch ſweet
experience of. And not content with any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
was ſtill preſſing on to what his
proſpect in the promiſes, encouraged by his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
praelibations, aſſured him was attainable.
He was to this end a chearful embracer and
diligent improver of ſpiritual opportunities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in his Chriſtian watch, much wreſtling,
(and very prevalent) with God in prayer,
and with himſelf in his ſolitudes, ſtriving to
diſentangle his heart from what might diveri
<pb facs="tcp:33153:10"/>
his holy ambition, and to raiſe it to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
activity and capacity for glorifying and
enjoying God in Chriſt, for the excellency of
the knowledge of whom he accounted all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
attainments but loſs. What he had taſted
and ſeen, he was grieved to ſee others neglect,
deſirous to bring others to experience, by earneſt
commending them to God, deſigning with himſelf,
and contriving with his ſpiritual confidence what
might conduce thereto.</p>
            <p>He had a true ſympathy with thoſe that were
bound with him Heaven-ward. Their preſſures
and conflicts, were his burdens: His prayers and
counſels, their ready aſſiſtants: their <hi>refreſhments,</hi>
his <hi>revivings:</hi> and their ſpiritual proficiency, his
joy.</p>
            <p>He was a ſecret and compaſſionate mourner;
as in general for the worlds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> degeneracy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Chriſtians unthankfulneſs for the Goſpel,
the hazards run by innumerable precious ſouls;
ſo eſpecially for the dreadful apoſtacies of ſome;
the then threatning decay amd growing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of others: ſometime ſeemingly forward;
which brought him nigher to God, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
his holy zeal. But this chiefly was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out to advance the power of Religion in
the family and perſons he was peculiarly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to: apprehending there to lie his best oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
as well as ſtrongeſt obligations. And his
ſucceſs was very encouraging.</p>
            <p>This is part of what I knew of him in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
who refer you for farther reviewing your
<pb facs="tcp:33153:10"/>
remembrance to the narrative. But both his
ſpiritual receipts and expences were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the two laſt years of his life, when I
had not opportunity of perſonal converſe with
him: And by reaſon of our diſtance (and at
that time ignorance of his weak condition) I was
not ſo happy as to ſhare in the priviledge of thoſe
who had the conveniencie of receiving his laſt and
ſweeteſt breath. Though I ſoon after had the
account (while things were freſh in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
and warm on their hearts) from the
eye and ear witneſſes, that ſome of them have
now been induced to make more publick. But next
and chiefly,</p>
            <p>2. I intreat you to recommend the truth of
this narrative, by your faithful adhering to, and
diligent promoting of what ſome of you learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him, and others profeſſed with him.
That by imitating his good example, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
his experiences with your longer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
you may be ſuch proficients in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
as ſhining like lights your ſelves to
hold forth the word of life for convincing the
incredulous: That the myſteries of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a life of faith in Chriſt, the fruitful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of union and communion with him
to a proſpicuous conformity to him, crucifixion
to the world by his croſs, and a converſation
with him in Heaven while on earth (therein
propoſed, herein exemplified) be no figments,
but great realities; no ſlight matters, but of
greateſt conſequence: not ſuch ſingularities,
<pb facs="tcp:33153:11"/>
but that others according to their meaſure, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the like courſe, may be experimentally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the ſurpaſſing ſweetneſs of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
therein. And the rather am I bold to
intreat this of you, becauſe I was privy to his
ſouls concern, for the concernments of your
ſouls. How paſſionatly he deſired to ſee Chriſt
formed in you, and rejoyced at any evidence
thereof. How earneſtly he would pray for you all;
and eſpecially for thoſe he had more occaſion to deal
with, or cauſe to be jealous of. How affected
he was with your dangers and ſnares. And
what a deſire he had you might out-ſtrip himſelf,
who could not take up his reſt on this ſide Heaven.
The good Lord help every one of us to ſhew
the ſame diligence to the full aſſureance of hope
to the end, that we may not be ſlothful, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of them who by faith and patience inherit
the promiſes.</p>
            <p>I have one farther requeſt, that you would
purſue by your moſt earneſt ſupplications the
deſign of publiſhing this narrative, that God
would make it proſperous to the pious ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
propoſed, and for which I hope in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it is reſerved now for publick view. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that it may provoke to holy emulation; not
only thoſe who were more peculiarly endeared to
our pretious Friend by natural or ſpiritual bonds;
(And that if any of theſe be fallen from their
firſt love, they may be excited to repent, do
their firſt works, and ſtrengthen the things
that remain; leſt having begun in the ſpirit,
<pb facs="tcp:33153:11"/>
they wretchedly end in the fleſh, and draw back
to perdition) but alſo, ſome at leaſt of them that
ſueceed in the Chambers and Studies, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
were ſanctified with the word and prayer, by
thoſe that ſingly and joyntly (as Bhamber fellows
and Colleagues) earnestly implored the divine
benediction on thoſe two royal foundations he was
member of: That the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh
would make them fruitful nurſeries of ſuch as might
be eminent inſtruments of Gods glory here, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many to righteouſneſs, might ſhine as the ſtars
for ever and ever. Wherein you may expect the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>I Can aſſure thee from my own
knowledge, that this Mr. <hi>John
Janeway</hi> was an excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
in reſpect of his natural parts,
acquired gifts, and divine graces,
wherewith his heavenly Father
<pb facs="tcp:33153:12"/>
adorned him (conſidering his
age) even far above the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rate of the beſt ſort of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
and Chriſtians: All which he
exceedingly improved for the
good of others (eſpecially in his
neer Relations) both in health
and ſickneſs, even to the laſt hour
of his life. And when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

ſhew of humane frailty) as if
with bodily eyes he ſaw the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ready to receive and carry his

lovely in his life, and yet more

The proſecution of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
I could not more effectnally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
than by the preſenting this
inſuing narrative to the world. As
for the truth of it, if the ſolemn
teſtimony of ſeveral Miniſters (which
were eye and ear witneſſes of the moſt
ſubſtantial things here preſented)
may be credited; here thou haſt three
of them. As for my ſelf I think I had
as great an advantage to acquaint
my ſelf with the ſecret practices of this
pretious Saint, as any one could well
have; beſides my dearest intimacy,
and ſpecial obſervation and peruſal
of his papers, I had a long account
from his own mouth upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of his ſecret and conſtant practice
and his experiences. And let me tell
<pb facs="tcp:33153:14"/>
you, the half is not told you. For the
treachery of my memory hath not a
little injured thee and him. Had
this work been done exactly, I am

I could not justly word it in his

matter and ſubstance. The weakneſs
of the Relator is no ſmall diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the ſubject; but I might a
little excuſe this, by telling thee that
I think that none living had the
ſame opportunity in all things to do
this work as I had. I might alſo tell
you that ſome Reverend, Learned and
Holy men, whoſe authority and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
I could not deny, put me upon
it. And I was not altogether without
ſome hopes of drawing ſome, to the
love and liking of Religion, that had

of God, and praiſe him with the

<hi>Octob.</hi> 27. of Religious Parents, in
<hi>Lylly,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford.</hi> He
ſoon gave his Parents the hope of
much comfort, and the ſymptoms of ſomething
more than ordinary quickly appeared in him, fo
that ſome which ſaw this <hi>Child</hi> much feared that,
his life would be but <hi>ſhort,</hi> others hoped that God
had ſome rare piece of work to do by or for this
<hi>Child</hi> before he died; he ſhewed that neither
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33153:17"/>
of them were much miſtaken in their conjecture
concerning him. He ſoon out-ran his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
for age in <hi>learning.</hi> And it was thought
by no incompetent Judges that for pregnacy of
<hi>wit,</hi> ſolidity of <hi>judgment,</hi> the vaſtneſs of his
<hi>intellectuals,</hi> and the greatneſs of his <hi>memory,</hi>
that he had no <hi>ſuperiours,</hi> few <hi>equals</hi> conſidering
his age and education.</p>
            <p>He was initiated in the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue by his
own <hi>Father;</hi> afterward he was brought up for
ſome time at <hi>Pauls</hi> School in <hi>London,</hi> where he
made a conſiderable proficiencie in <hi>Latine</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> under the care of Mr. <hi>Langly</hi> When
he was about eleven years old he took a great
fancy to <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time his Parents removing into a
little Village called <hi>Aspoden,</hi> had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of having this their <hi>Son</hi> inſtructed, by a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neighbour who was pleaſed to count it a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
diverſion, to read <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then about twelve years old; and he made
ſuch progreſs in thoſe profound ſtudies; that
he read <hi>Oughthred</hi> with underſtanding, before
he was thirteen years old. A perſon of quality,
hearing of the admirable proficiency of this Boy,
ſent for him up to <hi>London,</hi> and kept him with
him for ſome time, to Read Mathematicks to
him; that which made him the more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
was, that he did what he did with the
greateſt facility. He had no ſmall skill in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and other concomitants of Mathematicks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33153:17"/>
In the year 1646. he was choſen by that
Learned Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> the Provoſt of
<hi>Eton</hi> Colledge one of the foundation of that
Shool being examined by <hi>provoſt</hi> and <hi>poſiers</hi> in
the <hi>Hebrew tongue,</hi> which was thought was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
preſident. Where he gave no unſuitable
returns to the high expectations that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him.</p>
            <p>After a little continuance at <hi>Eton</hi> he obtained
leave of his Maſter to go to <hi>Oxford</hi> to perfect
himſelf in the ſtudy of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> where
being owned by that great Scholar Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi>
one of the Profeſſors of the Univerſity, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to a ſtrange exactneſs in that <hi>ſtudy,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being within the reach of a <hi>man,</hi> but he
would undertake and graſp. That great Doctor
gave him great help and incouragement, and
looked upon him as one of the <hi>wonders of his age,</hi>
loved him dearly, and could for ſome time after
his <hi>death</hi> ſcarce mention his name without <hi>tears.</hi>
When he had ſpent about a quarter of a year
with Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was commanded
to return again to <hi>Eton,</hi> where he ſoon gave
proof of his great improvement of his time
while he was <hi>abſent;</hi> by making an Almanack,
and calculating of the Eclipſes for many years
before hand; ſo that by this time he had many
<hi>eyes</hi> upon him as the glory of the <hi>School.</hi> That
which put an accent upon his real worth was
that he did not diſcover the leaſt affectation
or ſelf-conceit, neither did any diſcernable
pride attend theſe excelencies. So that every
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33153:18"/>
one took more notice of his <hi>parts</hi> than himſelf.</p>
            <p>At about ſeventeen years old he was choſen to
<hi>Kings Colledge</hi> in <hi>Camebridge,</hi> at which time
the Electioners did even contend for the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of this <hi>Scholar.</hi> He was choſed firſt that
year, and an elder brother of his in the ſixth
place; but he was very willing to change places
with his elder brother; letting him have the
firſt, and thankfully accepting of the ſixth place.</p>
            <p>Beſides his great learning, and many other
ornaments of nature, his deportment was ſo
ſweet and lovely, his demeanour ſo courteous
and obliging, even when he ſeemed unconverted,
that he muſt be vile with a witneſs that did not
love him. Yea many of them which had little
kindneſs for morality, much leſs for grace;
could not but ſpeak well of him. His great
wiſdom and learning did even command reſpect,
where they did not find it: he had an excellent
power over his paſſions, and was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
free from the vices which uſually attend
ſuch an age and place.</p>
            <p>But all this while it is to be feared, that he
underſtood little of the worth of Chriſt, and his
own ſoul; he ſtudied indeed the heavens, and
knew the motion of the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
but that was his higheſt; he thought yet but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of God, which made all theſe things, he
pried but little into the motions of his own
heart; he did not as yet much buſie himſelf, in
the ſerious obſervation of the wandring of his
ſpirit; the Creature had not yet led him to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33153:18"/>
Creator; but he was ſtill too ready to take up
with meer ſpeculation; but God, who from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
had choſen him to be one of thoſe, who
ſhould ſhine as the Sun in the Firmament for
ever in glory; did when he was about eighteen
years old, ſhine in upon his ſoul with power;
and did convince him what a poor thing it was
to know ſo much of the heavens and, never
come there. And that the greateſt knowledge in
the world without Chriſt, was but an empty dry
buſineſs. He now thought Mr. <hi>Bolten</hi> had ſome
reaſon on his ſide, when he ſaid; <q>Give me the
moſt magnificent glorious worldling, that
ever trod upon earthly mould, richly crowned
with all the Ornaments and excellencies of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
art, policy, preferment, or what heart
can wiſh beſides; yet without the life of grace,
to animate and ennoble them; he were to the
eye of heavenly wiſdom, but as a rotten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,
ſtuck over with flowers; magnified dung,
guilded rottenneſs, golden damnation.</q> He
began now to be of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>'s mind, that his
work upon earth, it was to ſtudy Heaven and to
get thither, and that except a man might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to greater preferment than this world
can beſtow upon her favorites, it were ſcarce
worth while to be born.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of his Converſion, with viſible proofs thereof.</head>
            <p>THE great work of <hi>Converſion,</hi> it was not
carried on upon his ſoul, in that dreadful
manner that it is upon ſome, that God intends
to communicate much to, and make great uſe
of; but the Lord was pleaſed, ſweetly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
his heart, by the exemplary life, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and powerful diſcourſe, of a young man
in the Colledge, whoſe heart God had inflamed
with love to his ſoul, he quickly made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon this hopeful young man, and the
ſpirit of God did ſet home his counſels with
ſuch power, that they proved effectual, for his
awakening; being accompanied with the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe two famous worthies, Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Arrowſmith,</hi> together with the reading ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Saints Everlaſting
Reſt.</p>
            <p>Now a mighty alteration might eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned
in him, he quickly looks quite like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man. He is now ſo much taken up with
things above the Moon and Stars, that he had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
leiſure to think of theſe things, only as they
pointed higher. He began now not to taſt ſo much
ſweetneſs in thoſe kind of ſtudies, which he did
ſo greedily imploy himſelf in formerly. He now
began to pity them which were curious in their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33153:19"/>
inquiries after every thing but that which is
moſt needful to be known, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Themſelves,</hi>
and that which ſometimes was his gain, he now
counted loſs for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea doubtleſs he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things but as dung and droſs in compariſon
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deſired to know nothing but
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and him <hi>crucified.</hi> Not that he looked
upon humane learning as uſeleſs: but when
fixed below Chriſt, and not improved for Chriſt;
he looked upon wiſdom as folly, and learning
as madneſs, and that which would make one
more like the Devil, more fit for his ſervice, and
put a greater accent upon their miſery in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> now begins to caſt about how he
might beſt improve what he did already know,
and turn all his ſtudies into the right chanel;
grace did not take him off from, but made him
more diligent and ſpiritual in his ſtudy. And
now Chriſt was at the end and bottom of every
thing; how did he plot and contrive how he
might moſt expreſs his love and thankfulneſs to
him who had brought him out of darkneſs into
his marvellous light; to this end he ſent up and
down packets of divine letters, in which he did
diſcourſe ſo ſubſtantially and experimentally of
the great things of God, that it would not at all
have unbecome ſome gray head to have owned
what he did write.</p>
            <p>He was not in a little like young <hi>Elihu,</hi> whoſe
words he uſed to excuſe his freedom with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of years, whoſe ſouls he did dearly pity.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33153:20"/>
He ſaid <hi>days ſhould ſpeak, and multitude of years
ſhould teach wiſdom, but there is a ſpirit in a man,
and the inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;
I am full of matter, the ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me, conſtraineth me, behold my belly is as
wine which hath no vent, it is ready to burſt like
new bottles, I will ſpeak that I may be refreſhed,</hi> &amp;c.
O then how ſweet was the favour of his graces!
He could not but ſpeak the things which he had
ſeen and heard, and even invite all the world to
taſte and ſee how good the Lord was.</p>
            <p>He began firſt with his Relations, begging
and wooing of them to think of their precious
and immortal ſouls, and to lay in ſpeedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for a death-bed, and eternity. O with
what compaſſion did he plead the cauſe of
Chriſt with their ſouls! what Pathetical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
did he uſe, what vehement expoſtulations,
how frequent, how particular in his applications,
to them? O with what gravity and majeſty
would he ſpeak of the myſteries of the Goſpel!</p>
            <p>Read what his language was (when he was
between <hi>eighteen</hi> and <hi>nineteen</hi> years old) in a
Letter to an <hi>antient Miniſter</hi> that he ſtood rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>THere are two things, the want of which, I
have had xperience of in your Family,
though not in every degree; yet in that intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of degree wherein they ought to be; which
are the real power of Godlineſs and Religion;
and then that which is the fruit of the former,
that chearfulneſs, delight, ſpiritual joy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renety
of mind which is to be had in Religion
and no where elſe; and that not in Religion
in its weakeſt degrees, but in a real vigor,
power and life, and in a more cloſe conſtant
walking with God; from a tender ſenſe of
the worth of ſouls, eſpecially thoſe of your family;
and knowing the duty which my relation to it
doth lay upon me, and having confidence of their
will acceptance of it; I have undertaken to open
my thoughts unto them.</p>
                  <p>In moſt Families in <hi>England</hi> I fear there
is neither the form nor the power of Godlineſs,
where there is no fear of God, no regard of
him, no acting under him or in reference to
him. Theſe are in my opinion twice dead, nay
not ſo much as having the dead carcaſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
objects of pity they are, and O how few
are there that ſpend one paſſionate thought upon
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:33153:21"/>
Others there are who ſome way or other, it
may be from tradition from good Parents, it
may be from knowing the faſhion of thoſe in
their rank; it may be from the frequent inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of good inſtructions from Chriſtian Friends,
or Godly Miniſters; or ſome ſtrugling erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Conſcience; have gotten the outward
husk or ſhell of Religion; without any kernel, or
ſolidity at all: and this generation doth uſually
truſt to this their Religion; that it will bring
them to a place like a ſleeping place in Heaven,
or keep them out of Hell; though they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the World. Theſe are poor creatures
too; making haſte to their own deſtruction, and
know it not, yea thinking that they are in a fair
way for Heaven. O that there were never a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
to which we are related which gave too ſad
cauſe of fear, that it were in ſuch a caſe, or
neer ſuch a caſe as this is. A third ſort of
people there are (and but few of theſe neither)
which have the reality of Religion; but yet in
much weakneſs, coldneſs, faintnefſ, dimneſs and
intermiſſion; like <hi>Nilus</hi>'s brood above half mud
ſtill; beginning to have ſome life in their
head, a little in their heart, but the feet of their
affections and actions have little or no motion.
And where ſhall we find a Chriſtian that is got
any higher than this, yea that doth in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
ſtrive to get any higher! Now there are
higher attainments to be reached after; there
is a having our converſation in Heaven while
we are upon Earth, neither doth this conſist in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33153:21"/>
ſome weak diſconrſes about God, Heaven and
the things of Religion, it conſiſts not in the meer
praying twice a day, and in keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in an uſual manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in its order, it conſiſts
not in a few thoughts of Religious objects come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the mind in a common way and as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
got as loſt. But true Religion raiſeth the
ſoul to longings, hungrings and thirſtings not
without ſome enjoyments. Religion in power is
to act for God with ſtrength, vigor, earneſtneſs,
intenſeneſs, delight, cheerfulneſs, ſerenety and
calmneſs of mind. The fruits of the ſpirit are
joy in the Holy Ghost and Peace: fear, diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and terrors are uſually the introduction to a
better ſtate, but they are not of the eſſentials
of Religion; yea the contrary frame of ſpirit
is to be ſtriven for. To ſpeak yet more
plainly and to tell you, Honoured Sir, what fears
and jealouſies are, with reverence to your ſelf,
and tender affection to all your family, I fear
that you your ſelf are ſubject to too many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding
melancholy thoughts. The cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
give me leave with ſubmiſſion to gueſs at.
The firſt I think may be your reflecting on your
entring upon the miniſtry without that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
care, holy zeal for God, love to Chriſt
and compaſſion to ſouls, which is required of
every one that undertakes that holy office; it may
be there was rather a reſpect to your own living
in the world than of living to God in the world,
be it thus, be it not as bad, or be it worſe; the
remedy is the ſame. Theſe have a wondring
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33153:22"/>
power in them, which will be felt to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
when felt as they are in themſelves, but
continual ſorrow and ſad thoughts do keep this
wound open too long, and are not available to
the having of it cured. Wounds indeed muſt
be firſt opened that they may be cleanſed, they
muſt be opened, that their filth may be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in reference to a purging and healing; but
no longer than the balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> is to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they may be healed. And when Chriſt
is made uſe of aright he leaveth joy and comfort,
yet a conſtant humility of ſpirit is no way inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with this peace of God.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond cauſe of your heavineſs may be a
ſenſe of the ſtate of the people which God hath
committed to you, and indeed who can but mourn
over people in ſuch a condition, objects of pity
they are, and the more becauſe they pity not
themſelves. I have often wreſtled with God
that he would direct you in what is your duty
concerning them, which I perſwade my ſelf is
your earnest request. Now if after your ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
examining of your ſelf what your Conſcience
doth conclude to be your duty, you do it, and
ſee you do it; you are then to reſt upon God
for his effectual working. Let not any think to
be nore merciful than God, for wherein he doth,
he goes beyond his bounds: and this is no more
cauſe of heavineſs to you than the oppoſition
that the Apoſtles found at any time was, who
notwithſtanding rejoyced in tribulation. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe of heavineſs may be what diviſions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33153:22"/>
are between your ſelf and ſome of your Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
O that a ſpirit of meekneſs and wiſdom
might remove all cauſe of ſorrow for that.
But were the power of Godlineſs more in hearts
and Families, all the cauſes of ſuch trouble
would ſoon be removed, there would be leſs
that would deſerve reprehenſion, and there
would be a fittedneſs of ſpirit to give and
bear reproof; to give in meekneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and to bear in humility, patience and
thankfulneſs. Some cares and thoughts you
may have concerning your Family when you
are gone. But let Faith and former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teach you to drive away all ſuch thoughts.
Your conſtitution and ſolitaryneſs may alſo be
ſome cauſe of melancholy; but there is a duty
which if it were exerciſed would diſpel all;
which is heavenly meditation, and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the things which true Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
tends to. If we did but walk cloſely with
God one hour in a day in this duty, O what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
would it have into the whole day beſides,
and duly performed into the whole life. This
duty with the uſefulneſs, manner and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I knew in ſeme meaſure before, but
had it more preſſed upon me by Mr. <hi>Baxters
Saints Everlaſting Reſt,</hi> that can ſcarce be
overvalued, for which I have cauſe for ever to
bleſs God. As for your dear Wife, I fear the
cares and troubles of the world take off her
mind too much from walking with God ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as ſhe ought to do, and from that earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33153:23"/>
after higher degrees of grace. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
therefore to her all this excellent Duty
of Meditation; It is a bitter ſweet Duty, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to corrupt nature, but ſweet to the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
part, if performed. I intreat her and your
ſelf, yea I charge it upon you with humility
and tenderneſs, that God have at leaſt half an
hour allowed him in a day for this exerciſe:
O this moſt precious Soul-raiſing, Soul-raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Soul-perfecting duty! Take this from your
dear Friend, as ſpoke with reverence, and real
love, and faithfulneſs. My fear and jealouſie
left I ſhould ſpeak in vain, maketh me ſay
again; I, or God by me, doth charge this upon
you.</p>
                  <p>One more direction let me give, that none in
your family ſatisfie themſelves in family prayer.
But let every one twice a day, if it may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
draw near to God in ſecret duty. Here
ſecret wants may be laid open; here great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
may be begged with great earneſtneſs; here
what wandrings and coldneſs was in family-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be repented of and mended. This is the
way to get ſeriouſneſs, reality, ſincerity, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in Religion: and thus the joy of the Lord
may be your ſtrength. Let thoſe which know
their duty do it; if any think it not a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty, let them fear lest they loſe the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
help for a holy, uſeful, joyful life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, whilſt they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
that which they think unneceſſary. Take
ſome of theſe directions from ſincere affection,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33153:23"/>
ſome from my own experience, and all from a
real and compaſſionate deſire of your joy and
comfort: The Lord teach you in this, and in
the reſt. I intreat you never to reſt labouring
till you have attained to true ſpiritual joy, and
peace in the Lord. The God of Peace give
you his direction, and the foretaſts of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
in this life, and perfection in eternal life,
in the enjoying of infinite holineſs, purity, and
excellencie through Chriſt. Thus praying, I

            <p>WHen he was about twenty years old, he
was made Fellow of the Colledge,
which did not a little advance thoſe noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which he had in his head for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the intereſt of the <hi>Lord Chriſt.</hi> Then
how ſweetly would he inſinuate into the young

he could along with him to Heaven: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
attempts he made upon ſome of the ſame
houſe, that he might ſeaſon them with Grace,
and animate and incourage thoſe which were
<hi>looking towards Heaven.</hi> And as for his own
Relations, never was there a more compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and tender-hearted Brother. How many
pathetical Letters did he ſend to them? and
how did he follow them with <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>tears</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33153:24"/>
that they might prove ſucceſsful! how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would he addreſs himſelf to them in private!
and how ready to improve providences and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
that he might ſet them home upon them?
How excellent would he ſet forth the beauty
of <hi>Chriſt!</hi> He earneſtly would perſwade them
to inquire into the ſtate of their ſouls. How
would he indeavour to bring them off from
ſandy foundations, and reſting upon their own
<hi>righteouſneſs!</hi> In a word, he was ſcarce content
to go to <hi>Heaven without,</hi> and through mercy
he was very ſucceſsful among his <hi>own Relations,</hi>
and the whole family ſoon ſavoured of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
how were the Children put upon getting
choice Scripture and their Catechiſms, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in ſecret prayer and meditation. Father,
Mother, Brethren, Siſters, Boarders were the
better for his excellent example and holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations.
He was a good <hi>Nurſe</hi> if not a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Father</hi> to his <hi>natural Father,</hi> as you

have cauſe to bleſs God for ever, that ever they
ſaw his face, and heard his words, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his converſation, which had ſo much of
lovelineſs and beauty in it, that it could not but
commend Religion to any that did take notice

Distance of place cannot at all leſſen that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Bond whereby we are conjoyned in blood,
neither ought to leſſen that of love. Nay,
where true love is it cannot; for love towards
you I can only ſay this, that I feel it better
than I can expreſs it; as it is wont to be with
all affections: but love felt, and not expreſſed, is
little worth: I therefore deſire to make my love
manifeſt in the beſt way I can. Let us look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one another not as Brethren only, but as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the ſame Body whereof Chriſt is the
Head. Happy day will that be wherein the
Lord will diſcover that <hi>Union;</hi> let us therefore
breathe and hunger after this, ſo that our clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
knot may meet in Chriſt: if we are in
Chriſt, and Chriſt in us, then we ſhall be one
with one another. This I know, you cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
for want of inſtruction, God hath not been
to us a dry Wilderneſs, or a barren heath; you
have had Line upon Line, and Precept upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
he hath planted you by the Rivers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
it is the Lord alone indeed who maketh fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but yet we are not to ſtand ſtill, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
There is a Crown worth ſeeking for; ſeek
therefore, and that earneſtly. O ſeek by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
prayer, keep your ſoul in a praying frame; this
is a great and neceſſary duty, nay, a high and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
priviledge. If thou canſt ſay nothing, come
and lay thy ſelf in an humble manner before the
Lord. You may believe me, for I have through
mercy experienced what I ſay. There is more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be got in one glimpſe of Gods love, than
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33153:25"/>
in all that the world can afford. O do but try; O
taſte and ſee how good the Lord is. Get into a
corner, and throw your ſelf down before the Lord,
and beg of God to make you ſenſible of your lost
undone ſtate by nature, and of the excellency and
neceſſity of Chriſt. Say, Lord, give me a broken
heart, ſoften, melt me: Any thing in the world,
ſo I may be but inabled to value Chriſt, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to accept of him, as he is tendred in the
Goſpel. O that I may be delivered from the wrath
to come; O a bleſſing for me, even for me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
not to be content till the Lord have in ſome
meaſure anſwered you. O my bowels yern towards
you, my heart works: O that you did but know
with what affection I write now to you, and what
prayers and tears have been mingled with theſe
lines! The Lord ſet theſe things home, and give
you an heart to apply them to your ſelf; the Lord
bleſs all the means that you enjoy, for his bleſſing
is all in all. Give me leave to deal plainly, and to
come yet a little cloſer to you, for I love your
ſoul ſo well, that I cannot bear the thoughts of the
loſs of it. Know this, that there is ſuch a thing
as the New birth, and except a man be born again,
he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; Gods
favour is not to be recovered without it. This
New birth hath its Foundation laid in a ſenſe of
ſin, and a godly ſorrow for it, and a heart ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it; without this there can be no Salvation.
Look well about you, and ſee into your ſelf, and
thou wilt ſee that thou art at Hells mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this firſt ſtep, and nothing but Free Grace,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33153:26"/>
and pure Mercy is between you and the ſtate of
the Devils. The Lord deliver us from a ſecure
careleſs heart! Here you ſee a natural mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
How dareſt thou then lye down in ſecurity?
O look about for your Souls ſake. What ſhall I
ſay, what ſhall I do to awaken your poor Soul! I
ſay again, without repentance there is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and repentance it ſelf may loſe its labour if
it be not in the right manner. Then tears, and
groans, and prayers will not do without Chriſt;
moſt when they are convinced of ſin, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
fears of Hell, run to duty, and reform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and thus the wound is healed, and by this
thouſands fall ſhort of Heaven. For if we be not
brought off from our ſelves, and our righteouſneſs,
as well as our ſins, we are never like to be ſaved.
We muſt ſee an abſolute need of a Chriſt, and
give our ſelves up to him, and count all but dung
and droſs in compariſon of Chriſts righteouſneſs.
Look therefore for mercy only in Chriſt, for his
ſake relye upon Gods mercy. The terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
are repent and believe, gracious terms! Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for fetching, nay mercy for deſiring, nay for
nothing but receiving. Doſt thou deſire mercy and
grace, I know thou doſt; even this is the gift of
God to deſire, hunger after Chriſt; let deſires put
you upon endeavour, the work it ſelf is ſweet;
yea, repentance and mourning it ſelf hath more
ſweetneſs in it, than all the Worlds comforts.
Vpon repentance and believing comes Juſtification,
after this Sanctification, by the Spirit dwelling in
us. By this we come to be the Children of God, to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33153:26"/>
be made partakers of the Divine Nature, to lead
new lives, to have a ſuitableneſs to God. It's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Chriſtian to have ſuch a narrow ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as not to act for Chriſt with all ones heart,
and ſoul, and ſtrength, and might. Be not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of Chriſt, be not afraid of the frowns and
jeers of the wicked. Be ſure to keep a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
void of offence, and yield by no means to any
known ſin; be much in prayer, in ſecret prayer,
and in reading the Scriptures: Therein are laid
up the glorious Myſteries which are hid from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eyes. My greatest deſire is, that God would
work his own great work in you. I deſire to ſee
you not as formerly, but that the Lord would
make me an inſtrument of your Souls good, for
which I greatly long.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:33153:27"/>
One time perceiving one of his Brothers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
at Prayer in the Family, he preſently took
occaſion to ſhow him what a high contempt it
was of <hi>God,</hi> what a little ſenſe ſuch a man muſt
have of his own danger, what dreadful hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
what a Miracle of Patience that he was
not awakened in flames. After he had been a
while affectionately pleading with him, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Lord to ſtrike in with ſome power, and
to melt and ſoften his Brothers heart when he
was about eleven years old; ſo that it was to be
hoped, that then the Lord began ſavingly to
work upon the heart of that Child: For from
that time forward a conſiderable alteration
might be diſcerned in him. When he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, he was not a little pleaſed. This put him
upon carrying on the work, that Conviction
might not wear off till it ended in Converſion.
To this end he wrote to him, <hi>to put him in mind
of what God had done for his Soul, begging of
him not to reſt ſatisfied till he knew what a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
change and effectual calling meant. I hope,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>that God hath a good work to do in you,
for you, and by you; yea, I hope he hath already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
it. But O take not up with ſome beginnings,
faint deſires, lazy ſeekings; O remember your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
tears; one may weep a little for ſin, and yet
go to Hell for ſin; many that are under ſome ſuch
work, ſhake of the ſenſe of ſin, murder their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
and return again to folly. O! take heed!
if any draw back, the Lord will take no pleaſure

He would alſo obſerve how his Brethren car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it after Duty, whether they ſeemed to run
preſently to the World with greedineſs, as if
Duty were a task, or whether there ſeemed to
be an abiding impreſſion of God, and the things
of God, upon them.</p>
            <p>His vehement love and compaſſion to Souls
may be further judged of by theſe following
expreſſions, which he uſed to one of his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
After he had been ſpeaking how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was below <hi>a Chriſtian</hi> to purſue with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
the things which will be but as gravel

better things of you; did I not hope, why

            <head type="sub">His great love to, and frequency in the duty of
Prayers: with remarkable ſucceſs.</head>
            <p>HE was mighty in Prayer, and his ſpirit
was oftentimes ſo tranſported in it, that
he forgot the weakneſs of his own body, and
of others ſpirits: Indeed the acquaintance that
he had with God was ſo ſweet, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with him ſo frequent, that when he was
ingaged in duty, he ſcarce knew how to leave
that which was ſo delightful and ſuited to his
ſpirit. His conſtant courſe for ſome years was
this: He prayed at leaſt three times a day in
ſecret, ſometimes ſeven times; twice a day in
the Family, or Colledge: And he found the
ſweetneſs of it beyond imagination, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
wonderful Communion with God, and
taſted much of the pleaſantneſs of a Heavenly
Life: And he could ſay by experience, that
the ways of wiſdom were ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and all her paths peace. He knew what it
was to wreſtle with God, and was come to that
paſs, that he could ſcarce come off his knees
without his Fathers bleſſing. He was uſed to
converſe with God with a <hi>holy familiarity</hi> as a
<hi>Friend,</hi> and would upon all occaſions run to
him for advice, and had many ſtrange and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>Anſwers</hi> of Prayer. One of which I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33153:28"/>
think it not altogether impertinent to give the
World an account of.</p>
            <p>His Honoured Father, Mr. <hi>William Janeway,</hi>
Miniſter of <hi>Kelſhall</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> being ſick,
and being under ſomewhat dark apprehenſions
as to the ſtate of his Soul, he would often ſay
to his Son <hi>John:</hi> O Son! this paſſing upon Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is a great thing, this dying is a ſolemn
buſineſs, and enough to make any ones heart
ake that hath not his Pardon ſealed, and his
Evidences for Heaven clear. And truly Son, I
am under no ſmall fears, as to my own eſtate, for
another world. O that God would clear his
love! O that I could ſay chearfully I can die,
and upon good grounds be able to look Death
in the face, and venture upon Eternity with
well-grounded peace and comfort!</p>
            <p>His ſweet and dutiful Son made a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
at preſent; but ſeeing his dear Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
under deſpondings of ſpirit (though no
Chriſtians that knew him but had a high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of him for his uprightneſs) he got by
himſelf, and ſpent ſome time in wreſtling with
God upon his Fathers account, earneſtly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of God, that he would fill him with joy
unſpeakable in believing, and that he would
ſpeedily give him ſome token for good, that he
might joyfully and honourably leave this world
to go to a better. After he was riſen from his
knees, he came down to his ſick Father, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him how he felt himſelf. His Father made
no anſwer for ſome time, but wept exceedingly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33153:29"/>
(a paſſion that he was not ſubject to) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for ſome conſiderable time in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
paſſion of weeping, ſo that he was
not able to ſpeak. But at laſt having recovered
himſelf, with unſpeakable joy he burſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch expreſſions as theſe: O Son! now it
is come, it is come, it is come. I bleſs God I
can die: The Spirit of God hath witneſſed with
my ſpirit, that I am his Child: Now I can look
up to God as my dear Father, and Chriſt as
my Redeemer; I can now ſay this is my Friend,
and this is my Beloved. My heart is full, it is
brim full, I can hold no more: I know now
what that ſentence means, the Peace of God
which paſſeth underſtanding; I know now what
that white ſtone is wherein a new name is
written, which none know but they which
have it. And that fit of weeping which you
ſaw me in, was a fit of over-powring love and
joy, ſo great, that I could not for my heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my ſelf; neither can I expreſs what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſcoveries God hath made of himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me: And had that joy been greater, I
queſtion whether I could have born it, and
whether it would not have ſeparated ſoul and
body. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that
is within me bleſs his holy Name that hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
all my ſins, and ſealed the pardon. He
hath healed my wounds, and cauſed the bones
which he had broken to rejoyce. O help me to
bleſs the Lord! he hath put a new Song into my
mouth: O bleſs the Lord for his infinite goodneſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33153:29"/>
and rich mercy! O now I can die! it is nothing,
I bleſs God I can die: I deſire to be diſſolved,
and to be with Chriſt. You may well think
that his Sons heart was not a little refreſhed to
hear ſuch words, and ſee ſuch a ſight, and to
meet the Meſſenger that he had ſent to Heaven
returned back again ſo ſpeedily. He counted
himſelf a ſharer with his Father in this mercy,
and it was upon a double account welcome,
as it did ſo wonderfully ſatisfie his Father, and
as it was ſo immediate and clear an Anſwer of
his own prayers, as if God had from Heaven
ſaid unto him, thy tears and prayers are heard
for thy Father: thou haſt like a Prince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with God; thou haſt got the bleſſing;
thy fervent prayers have been effectual; go
down and ſee elſe.</p>
            <p>Upon this, this precious young man broke
forth into praiſes, and even into another exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of joy, that God ſhould deal ſo familiarly
with him; and the Father and Son together
were ſo full of joy, light, life, love and praiſe,
that there was a little Heaven in the place. He
could not then but expreſs himſelf in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
O bleſſed, and for ever bleſſed be God
for his infinite grace! O who would not pray
unto God! verily he is a God that heareth
prayers, and that my ſoul knows right well!
And then he told his joyful Father how much
he was affected with his former deſpondings,
and what he had been praying for juſt before
with all the earneſtneſs he could for his ſoul, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33153:30"/>
how the Lord had immediately anſwered him.
His Father hearing this, and perceiving that his
former comforts came in in a way of prayer,
and his own childs prayer too, was the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed,
and was the more confirmed that it was
from the Spirit of God, and no deluſion. And
immediately, his Son ſtanding by, he fell into
another fit of triumphing joy, his weak body
being almoſt ready to ſink under that great
weight of Glory that did ſhine in ſo powerfully
upon his Soul. He could then ſay, now let thy
ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen
thy Salvation. He could now walk through the
valley of the ſhadow of death, and fear no evil.
O how ſweet a thing is it to have ones intereſt
in Chriſt cleared, how comfortable to have our
calling and election made ſure! How lovely is
the ſight of a ſmiling Jeſus when one is dying!
How refreſhing is it, when heart, and fleſh, and
all are failing, to have God for the ſtrength of
our heart and our portion for ever! O did the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
unexperienced world but know what theſe

joys as infinitely ſhort of one <hi>glimpſe of Gods
love!</hi> After this, his <hi>Reverent Father</hi> had a ſweet
calm upon his ſpirits, and went in the ſtrength
of that proviſion, that rich Grace laid in, till he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33153:30"/>

to ſee if any way we may find a glimpſe
of Gods love ſhining in towards us, and ſo to
raiſe up our ſouls nearer God? Is there not
enough in God, and the Holy Scriptures, to
bear up our ſpirits under any afflictions, let
them be never ſo great? What do you ſay to
that word, Who is there among you that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Lord, and that obeyeth the voice of his
ſervant that walketh in darkneſs, and ſeeth no
light, let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and
ſtay himſelf upon his God? Though all earthly
comforts were fled away, and though you could
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33153:32"/>
ſee no light from any of theſe things below;
yet if you look upward to God in Chriſt, there
there is comfort to be found, there is light to
be eſpied; yea, a great and glorious light;
which if we can rightly diſcern, it would put
out the light of all lower comforts, and cauſe
them to be vilely accounted of. But alas!
alas! thoſe heavenly comforts, though they
are in themſelves ſo precious, and if really
and ſenſibly felt, able to raiſe a mans Soul
from Earth, yea from Hell, to the foretaſte
of Heaven it ſelf; yet for want of a ſpiritual
ſenſe, they are by moſt of the world under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued,
ſlighted, and thought to be but fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Nay, let me ſpeak freely, Chriſtians
themſelves, and thoſe that we have cauſe to
hope are men of another world, and truly born
again, yet for want of a ſpiritual quickneſs in
this ſpiritual ſight and ſenſe, theſe comforts are
too lowly and meanly eſteemed of.</p>
               <p>It is a ſpiritual ſenſe that inableth a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to behold a glorious luſtre and beauty in
Inviſibles, and raiſeth the Soul up to the Gate
of Heaven it ſelf; and when he is there, how
can he chuſe but look down with a holy
ſlighting and contempt upon the ſweeteſt of
all Earthly enjoyments? How can he chuſe
but think all Creature-comforts but ſmall,
compared with one look of love from Chriſt?
This heavenly comfort was that which <hi>David</hi>
did ſo much deſire: Lord, lift up the light of
thy countenance upon me, was the language of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33153:32"/>
his ſoul, and when this was come, how was his
heart inlarged? Thou haſt put joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in my heart more than in the time when
their Corn and Wine increaſed. He then that
in afflictions would find comfort muſt ſtrive
to ſee ſpiritual comforts, to be the greateſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that comfort which is from God, in the
face of Jeſus Chriſt; this, this will be a cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
this will be as marrow and fatneſs to the
ſoul. They that have intereſt in Chriſt, what
need they be moved and diſcomfited with any
worldly trouble? Is not Chriſt better than
ten children? is not his loving-kindneſs better
than life? Is not all the world a ſhadow, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with one quarter of an hours injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him, even on this ſide of Glory in
ſome of his own Ordinances? O therefore
ſtrive to get your intereſt in this comfort ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
and then all's well. He that hath Chriſt,
hath all things. If God be reconciled to you
through him, then he will withhold no good
thing from you.</p>
               <p>We poor fooliſh creatures do ſcarce know
what is good for our ſelves, but it's no ſmall
incouragement to the people of God that
Wiſdom it ſelf takes care of them, and one
that loves them better than they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<hi>looks after them: And he hath given his
promiſe</hi> for it, that all ſhall work together for
their good. And what better foundation of
comfort can there be in the whole world
than this! Why may you not then ſay with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33153:33"/>
the Pſaſmiſt, Why art thou caſt down, O my
ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?
hope in God. <hi>Let not your ſoul ſink under
afflictions, for what reaſon have you to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited
under them? Can you gather from
thence that the Lord doth not love you? No
ſurely, but rather the contrary, for whom the</hi>
Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Son whom he receiveth: What Son is he
whom the Father chaſteneth not? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lift up the hands which hang down, and
the feeble knees.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Let this ſerve as a remedy againſt exceſſive
grief. Get your love to God increaſed, which
if you do, the love of all other things will wax
cold. And if you have given God your heart,
you will give him leave to take what he will
that is yours, and what he hath you will judge
rather well kept than loſt.</p>
            <p>Remember that Scripture, and let it have its
due impreſſion upon your ſpirit; <hi>He that loves
Father or Mother, Brother or Siſter, yea or
Children more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> O
labour to have your affections therefore more
raiſed up to him who is moſt worthy of them,
let him have the uppermoſt &amp; greateſt room in
your heart, and let your love to all other things
be placed in ſubjection to your love of God, be
ruled by it, and directed to it. Be our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afflictions never ſo great, yet let this love
to God poiſe our Souls ſo that they may not
be overweighed with grief on the one ſide,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33153:33"/>
or ſtupidneſs on the other ſide. Again let our
ſouls be awed by that glorious power and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
of God, who is able to do any thing,
and who will do whatſoever pleaſeth him both
in Heaven and in Earth; at whoſe word and
for whoſe Glory all things that are were made.
And what are we poor creatures that we ſhould
dare to entertain any hard thought of this God!
'Tis dangerous contending with God! Let us
learn that great leſſon of reſigning up our ſelves
and all we have to God; let us put our ſelves
as inſtruments into the hands of the Lord to
do what he pleaſeth with us, and let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that it was our promiſe and covenant with
God to yield our ſelves up to him, and to be
wholly at his diſpoſal. The Soul is then in a
ſweet frame when it can <hi>cordially ſay, It is the
Lord, let him do what ſeemeth good in his eyes.
Not my will, but thine be done.</hi> Again, let us know
that though we cannot alwaies ſee into the
reaſonableneſs of the ways of God, (for his
ways are often in the thick Cloud, and our
weak Eyes cannot look into thoſe depths in
which he walketh) yet all the ways of God
are juſt, holy and good. Let us therefore have
a care of ſo much as moving, much more of
entertaining any unworthy thoughts againſt
God. But let us ſubmit willingly to the yoak
which he is pleaſed to lay upon us, leſt he
break us with his terrible judgments. And now
it hath ſeemed good to God to lay this ſtroak
upon you, I pray labour rightly to improve it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33153:34"/>
and let this trial prepare you for greater. And
ſeeing the uncertainty of all worldy things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
with all your might to get your heart
above them; and I beſeech the Lord, who is the
great Phyſitian of Souls, and knows how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Salve to every Sore of his, to comfort
you with his ſpiritual comforts, that he would
favourably ſhine upon you, and receive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a nearer union and communion with himſelf.
Into his hands I commit you, with him I leave
you, praying that he would make up all in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>He was an excellent Example to his younger
brethren; and his wiſe inſtructions, and holy
practices, did not a little influence them. He was
a prudent Counſellor, and an aſſiſtant that could
not well be ſpared to his eldeſt Brother; who
was not a little ſenſible of that perſonal worth
that was in his younger Brother; whom he
would prefer before himſelf, as one whom he
judged, God had honoured with far greater
parts, graces, and experiences, than himſelf. The

and honour him; as, a ſerious Chriſtian,
a Miniſter, and his elder Brother, who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him with more than ordinary kindneſs!</p>
            <p>When he was but young, yet he began to be
taken notice of by antient Miniſters, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
though his modeſty was ſo great, that his
huge parts were not a little obſcured thereby;
and his vaſt worth was ſo ballaſted with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that he made no great noiſe in the world,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33153:34"/>
and moſt were ignorant of his ſingular worth. A
wiſe man that was intimately acquainted with
him, would ſay of him that he was like deep
waters, that were moſt ſtill; a man of hidden
excellency. There were few that knew, how
cloſe he walked with God, and at what a high
rate he lived, and how great a trade he drave
for the riches of that other world: All which
he laboured, as much as might be, to conceal.</p>

ſome hopes of his living to be eminently

            <p>After he was recovered in ſome meaſure, he
fell again to his former practice of ingaging
deeply in the ſecret &amp; great duties of Religion,
which he conſtantly practiſed (except when
God diſcharged him by ſickneſs:) ſecret prayer,
at leaſt three times a day ſomtimes ſeven times,
yeamore; beſides family, and Colledge-duties,
which were before hinted, he ſet a part an hour
every day for ſet and ſolemn meditation; which
duty he found unſpeakably to improve his
graces, &amp; to make no ſmall addition to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
His time for that duty was moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the evening, when he uſually walked into
the field, if the weather would permit; if not, he
retired into the Church, or any empty ſolitary
room. Where (obſerving his conſtant practice,
that, if poſſible, I might be acquainted with the
reaſon of his retiredneſs) I once hid my ſelf that
I might take the more exact notice of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that, I judged, was kept up between him
&amp; God. But, O what a ſpectacle did I ſee! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a man walking with God, converſing inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
with his Maker, and maintaining a holy
familiarity with the great <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Me-thought,
I ſaw one talking with God; me-thoughts, I

ſaw a ſpiritual Merchant in an heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
driving a rich trade for the treaſures of

was! Me-thinks, I ſee him ſtill; how ſweetly,

his body oft reaching up, as if he would

known what he was then feeding on! Sure, he
had <hi>meat to eat which the world knew not of!</hi>
Did we but know how welcome God made him
when he brought him into his banqueting-houſe!
That which one might eaſily perceive his heart
to be moſt fixed upon, was, The infinite love
of God in Chriſt, to the poor loſt Sons and
Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> What elſe meant his

            <p>Dear ſoul, come near and look upon his face,

Fall upon him, imbrace him, give him thy dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

Come near, ſtill contemplate his excellency,

Thus ſhalt thou find a new life to animate thy

ſoul; thou ſhall then feel a new warmth to melt
thy heart; a divine fire to burn up corruption,
and to break forth into a flame of heavenly love;
Dwell in this love, and thou ſhalt dwell in God,
and God in thee. But now, me-thinks, I ſee
you almoſt all in tears becauſe thou feeleſt not

but, <hi>leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there
was a Meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would make a Chriſtians heart even ake to
hear and read what ſtrange temptations this
gratious ſoul was exerciſed with. But he was
well armed for ſuch a conflict, having on the
ſhield of faith whereby he quenched the fiery
darts of that Wicked-One: yet, this fight coſt
him the ſweating of his very body for agonies of
ſpirit; and tears and ſtrong cries to Heaven, for
freſh help. As for himſelf, he was wont to take
an arrow out of Gods quiver, and diſcharge it
by faith and prayer, for the diſcomfiture of his
violent enemy, who at laſt was ſain to fly.</p>
            <p>Theſe temptations and conflicts with Satan
did not a little help him afterwards in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with one that was ſorely afflicted with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of the like nature. And becauſe I
judge it of ſingular uſe to tempted-ones, and
find very many of late to be exerciſed in this
kind, I ſhall inſert a Letter of his ſuitable to
all Chriſtians in the like caſe.</p>

                  <head>A Letter of Mr. John Janeway.</head>

                     <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur Letters are bitter in the mouth, but
ſweet in the belly; they contain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of joy, under a diſmal aſpect: they are
good news, brought by a meſſenger in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I had rather hear of that which is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſubſtantial real joy, though mixed with
many ſighs, and interrupted with many
groans and ſobs; than of that laughter, in the
midſt of which the heart is ſad.</p>
                  <p>You ſay that you are troubled with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
thoughts: ſo then, though they are
blaſphemous, yet they are your trouble; and
thoughts they are too, and that neither ſent
for, nor welcome; and ſo are not aſſented to
in your mind. What then ſhall we think of
them? If they were of your own production,
your heart would be delighted in its own
iſſue: but you do nothing leſs. Sure then, they
are the injections of that wicked one, who is
the accuſer of the brethren, and the diſturber
of the peace of the people of God. But, doth
Satan uſe to imploy thoſe weapons but
againſt thoſe that he is in ſome fear of loſing?
He is not wont to aſſault and fight againſt his
ſureſt friends, in this manner. Thoſe that he
hath faſt in his own poſſeſſion, he leads on, as
ſoftlyand quietly as he can; fearing leſt ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33153:40"/>
diſturbance ſhould make them look about
them, and ſo they ſhould awake, and ſee their
danger. But as for thoſe, that have, in ſome
meaſure, eſcaped his ſnares; he follows them
hard, with all the diſcouragements he can.
Surely, theſe things can be no other but a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reliſh of thoſe things which you know to
be bitter after that you have taſted the hony
and the hony-comb; after you have ſeen, how
good the Lord is. What then ſhall I call theſe
motions of your mind? They are the ſouls
loathing the morſels which Satan would have
it to ſwallow down: yea, they are the ſouls
ſtriving with Satan, whilſt he would raviſh
the Spouſe of Jeſus: And let the enemy of all
goodneſs know, that he ſhall e're long pay
dearly for ſuch attempts. But you will ſay,
If theſe horrible thoughts be not your ſin, yet
they are your trouble and miſery, and you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be freed from them; and the moſt loyal
and loving Spouſe, had rather be delivered
from thoſe aſſaults; But you will ask; How
ſhall I get free from them? <hi>Firſt,</hi> See that
you poſſeſs your ſoul in patience; and know
this, that God hath an over-ruling hand in all
this: and wait upon him; for he can, and will
bring forth good out of all this ſeeming evil.
At preſent, you are in the dark and ſee no
light: yet, <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and ſtay your
ſelf upon your God.</hi> Can Chriſt forget the
purchaſe of his own blood, the price of his
ſoul, thoſe whom he hath ſo intimately indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33153:40"/>
to himſelf? <hi>Can a mother forget her ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
child?</hi> Yet, <hi>God cannot forget his.</hi>
God hath loving and gratious intents in all
this, and his bowels yearn towards his. Yes,
our Saviour ſuffers with us, through his ardent
love by ſympathy, as well as he hath ſuffered
for us. But, for your being berid of theſe
thoughts, you know who hath all power in
his hand who doth imploy this power in a
way of love towards his. This power is
made yours through the prayer of faith: but,
for your own work, do this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let not ſuch thoughts have any time
of abode in your mind; but turn them out,
with all the loathing and abhorrence you
can; but, not with ſo much trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
of mind, as, I believe, you do.
For, by this the Devil is pleaſed, and he makes
you your own Tormentor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> always then divert your thoughts
to ſome good thing, and let thoſe very injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be conſtantly the occaſion of your more
ſpiritual meditation. Think the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or fall a praying with earneſtneſs:
and the Devil will be weary if he find his
deſigns thus broken, and that thoſe ſparks of
Hell (which he ſtruck into the ſoul, to kindle
and inflame corruption) do put warmth into
grace, and ſet Faith and Prayer a working,
when he perceives, that, what he intended
as water to cool your love to God, proves
like oyl to make it flame the more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33153:41"/>
he will be diſcouraged. Thus reſiſt him,
and he will flee from you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that this is no new thing:
For, we are not in this ignorant of Satans
wiles, that, if any ſoul hath eſcaped out of
the chains of darkneſs, if he will have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
he ſhall have it with as much trouble, as
the Devil can lay on; and if he and his had
their wills, no good man ſhould have one
peaceable hour: But, bleſſed be God for his
everlaſting and unchangeable love to his that
the Devil cannot pluck us out of thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
arms, with which he doth imbrace his
dear children.</p>
                  <p>Dear heart, my prayer for thee, is, that
God would give thee the peaceable fruit of
righteouſneſs, after all thy afflictions; and
that thou maiſt come out of theſe trials, refin'd
and purified and more fit for thy Maſters uſe;
having this the end of all, to purge away thy
droſs, and take away thy ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thus hoping that, as the length, God will
turn thy mourning into joy, thy trouble into
triumph, and all thy ſorrows into a ſure and
ſtable peace; I leave you with Him, and reſt,</p>
                  <closer>

He was much afraid of any decays in grace,
of apoſtacy, yea, of flatneſs of ſpirit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in himſelf or others: and if he ſuſpected
any thing of this nature in his neareſt relations,
he would do what he could poſſibly, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them out of the ſnares of Satan, and to
quicken them to higher &amp; more noble vigorous
ſpiritual acts of religion. He laboured to
maintain a conſtant tenderneſs and ſenſibility
upon his heart, and to take notice of the leaſt
departure of his ſoul from God, or Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
of Himſelf from the ſoul, (which was
an expreſſion that was much in his mouth). He
had a godly jealouſie over his brother: One of
which, was awakened by his ſerious and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
application of himſelf to him, when he was
about eleven years old: But he knew, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and Converſion are two things, and that
many are ſomewhat affected by a warm exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
who quickly wear off thoſe impreſſions,
and return to their former trifling with God,
and neglect of their ſouls. Wherefore, he
deſired to carry on the work that he had ſome
hopes was well begun: he laboured to build
ſure, and build up; that he might be rooted
and grounded in the faith ſtedfaſt and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
always abounding in the work of the Lord.
Wherefore he followed him, not only with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
warnings, and frequent patheticall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and directions; but with letters, one of
which ſpoke in this language.</p>

their company; and Gods own children are
too apt to forget their firſt love: our hearts
are apt to be careleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to neglect our
watch; we are ready to grow formal in
duty or leſs ſpiritual, and then, it may be,
leſs frequent: and Conſcience is put off with
ſome poor excuſe: and thus Religion withers,
and one that ſeemed once a zealot may come
to be Laodicean; and ſome that looked once
as if they were eminent ſaints, may fall to
juſt nothing. It's too common, <hi>to have a
name to be alive and yet to be dead:</hi> Read
this, and tremble leſt it ſhould be your caſe.
When we are lazy and aſleep, our adverſary
is awake: when we are ſloathful and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
then he is diligent. I conſider your
age, I know where you dwell, I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with your temptations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I cannot but be afraid of you, leſt, by
both inward and outward fire, the buſh be
ſinged: Though, if God be in it, it cannot
be burnt up.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to be in ſome meaſure fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of you, and jealous over you, and to mind
you of what you know already. Principles
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33153:42"/>
of civility will be but as broken reeds, to ſtay
our ſouls upon; without thoſe higher princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which are planted in the ſoul, by the
working of the ſpirit of God. O, remember
what meltings ſometimes you have had: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
how ſolicitouſly you did inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt, how earneſtly you ſeemed to <hi>ask
the way to</hi> Zion <hi>with your face thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Oh, take heed of loſing thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
you once had, take not up with a
ſleight work. True converſion is a great
thing, and another kind of buſineſs, than
moſt of the world take it to be. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be not ſatisfied with ſome convictions,
taking them for converſion; much leſs, with
reſting in a formal lifeleſs profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>There is ſuch a thing as being almoſt a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
nay, as drawing back unto perdition:
and ſome, that are not far from the kingdom
of Heaven, may never come there. Beware
leſt you loſe the reward; the promiſe is made
to him that holdeth faſt, and holdeth out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end and overcometh.</p>
                  <p>Labour to forget what is behind, and to
preſs forward towards things that are before.
He that is contented with juſt grace enough
to get to Heaven and eſcape Hell, and deſires
no more; may be ſure, he hath none at all:
&amp; is far from being made partaker of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature. Labour to know what it is, To
converſe with God; ſtrive to do every thing
as in His preſence; deſign Him in all; act,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33153:43"/>
as one that ſtands within ſight of the Grave
and Eternity. I ſay again, do what you do,
as if you were ſure God ſtood by and looked
upon you, and exactly obſerved and recorded
every thought word and action; and you may
very well ſuppoſe that, which cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Let's awake, and fall to our work in good
earneſt: Heaven or Hell are before us, and
death behind us. What do we mean to ſleep!
dulneſs in Gods ſervice is very uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and at the beſt will coſt us dear: and, to
be contented with ſuch a frame, is a certain
ſymptom of a hypocrite. O, How will ſuch
tremble, when God ſhall call them to give an
account of their ſtewardſhip; and tell them,
<hi>They may no longer be ſtewards.</hi> Should
they fall ſick, and the Devil, and Conſcience
fall upon them, what inconceivable perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would they then be in!</p>
                  <p>O, live more upon inviſibles and let the
thoughts of their excellency put life into your
performances. You muſt be contented to be
laughed at for preciſeneſs and ſingularity. A
Chriſtians walking is not with men but with
God; and, he hath great cauſe to ſuſpect his
love to God, who doth not delight more in
converſing with God and being conformed to
Him than in converſing with the world, and
being conformed to it.</p>
                  <p>How can the love of God dwell in that
man, who liveth without God in the world?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33153:43"/>
without both continual vvalking vvith him in
his whole converſation, and thoſe more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
viſits of him in prayer, meditation, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ejaculations, and other duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and the workings of faith, love, holy
deſires, delight, joy and ſpiritual ſorrow in
them! Think not, that our vvalking vvith
God cannot conſiſt vvith vvorldly buſineſs:
yes, but Religion makes us ſpiritual in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
actions, and there is not any action in a
mans life, in vvhich a man is not to labour to
make it a religious act, by a looking to the
Rule in it, and eying of Gods glory; and
thus, he may be ſaid to vvalk vvith God. To
this vve muſt indeavour to riſe, and never be
content, till vve reach to it, and if this ſeem
tedious (as to degenerate nature it vvill) vve
muſt know that vve have ſo much of enmity
againſt God ſtill remaining, and are under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
and darkneſs &amp; know not our true
happineſs: Such a ſoul is ſick and it hath loſt
its taſte, vvhich doth not perceive an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
ſweetneſs in vvalking vvith God,
without whom all things elſe under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are gall and bitterneſs, and to be little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by very true Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>But, We are all apt even at the worſt, to
ſay, that we prefer God above all things;
But we muſt know that we have very deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hearts: And thoſe who, being inlightned,
know for vvhat high ends they ſhould act, and
vvhat a fearful condition even a hazard in our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33153:44"/>
caſe, is; theſe I ſay, will not believe their
own hearts without diligent ſearch and good
grounds.</p>
                  <p>Reſt not in any condition in which your ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is not founded upon that ſure bottom, the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Labour to attain to this,
to love God for himſelf, and to have your
heart naturalized &amp; ſuited to ſpiritual things.
O for a heart to rejoyce and work righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!
O, that we could do the will of God,
with more activity, delight and conſtancy!
If we did know more of God, we ſhould
love him more; and then God would ſtill
reveal more of Himſelf to us, and then we
ſhould ſee more and more cauſe to love him,
and wonder that we love him no more. O
this this, is our happineſs, To have a fuller
ſight of God, to be wrapped up, and filled
with the love of Chriſt; O, let my ſoul for
ever be thus imployed! Lord, <hi>whom have I
in Heaven but thee, and there is none in
earth, that I can deſire in compariſon of
Thee.</hi>

            <p>You hear what kind of language he ſpake;
and you may eaſily perceive what it was that
ſwallowed up his heart, and where his delight,
treaſure, and life was. O, How much do moſt
of us, who go for Chriſtians, fall ſhort of theſe
things: and, How vaſt a diſtance between his
experience, and ours; and, what reaſon have
we, to read theſe lines with bluſhing, and to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33153:44"/>
blot the paper with tears? and to lay aſide this
book a while, and to fall upon our faces before
the Lord, &amp; bemoan the curſed unſuitableneſs
of our hearts unto God; and to bewail, that
we do ſo little underſtand what this walking
with God, &amp; living by faith means! O, at what a
rate do ſome Chriſtians live! and how low,
flat and dull, are others. His love to Chriſt,
and ſouls, made him very deſirous <hi>to ſpend, and
be ſpent in the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
he did comply with the firſt loud and
clear Call to preach the everlaſting Goſpel;
and, though he was but about two and twenty
years old, yet he came to that work like one
that underſtood what kind of employment,
Preaching was. He was a workman that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to be aſhamed, that was throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for every good word and work; one
that was able to anſwer gainſayers, one in
whom <hi>the Word of God dwelt richly;</hi> one
full of the ſpirit and power; one, that hated
ſin with a perfect hatred, and loved holineſs
with all his ſoul; in whom Religion in its beauty
did ſhine: one, that knew <hi>the terrors of the
Lord,</hi> and knew how to beſeech ſinners, <hi>in
Chriſts ſtead, to be reconciled unto God:</hi> One
that was a <hi>Son of thunder,</hi> and <hi>a Son of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi>
In a word, I may ſpeak that of him
which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that, <hi>I know
none like-minded, that did naturally care for
ſouls.</hi> And, had he lived to have preached of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
O what uſe might ſuch a man have been of,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33153:45"/>
in his generation! one, in whom learning and
holineſs did as it were ſtrive which ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
He never preached publickly but twice,
and then he came to it as if he had been uſed to
that work forty years; delivering the Word of
God with that power and Majeſty, with that
tenderneſs and compaſſion, with that readineſs
and freedom, that it made his hearers almoſt
amazed: He was led into the Myſterie of the
Goſpel, and he ſpoke nothing to others but
what was the language of his heart, and the
fruit of great experience, and which one might
eaſily perceive had no ſmall impreſſion firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own ſpirit.</p>
            <p>His <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> Sermons they were upon
Communion and intimate converſe with God,
out of <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. A ſubject that few Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
under Heaven were better able to manage
than himſelf, and that ſcarce any could handle
ſo feelingly as he; for, he did for ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time maintain ſuch an intimate familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with God, that he ſeemed to converſe with
Him, as one friend doth converſe with another.
This text he made ſome entrance into, whilſt
he was here: but, the perfecting of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God was a work fitter for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world.</p>
            <p>He was one that kept an exact watch over
his thoughts, words and actions, and made a
review of all that paſſed him, at leaſt once a
day, in a ſolemn manner. He kept a <hi>Diary,</hi>
in which he did write down every evening
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33153:45"/>
what the frame of his ſpirit had been all the
day long, eſpecially in every duty. He took
notice what incomes and profit he received, in
his ſpiritual traffique; what returns from that
far-country, what anſwers of prayer, what
deadneſs and flatneſs, and what obſervable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
did preſent themſelves, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of what he had been doing; and any
wandrings of thoughts, inordinancy in any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
which, though the world could not diſcern
he could. It cannot be conceived by them
which do not practiſe the ſame, to what a good
account did this return! This, made him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a grateful remembrance of mercy, and to
live in a conſtant admiring &amp; adoring of divine
goodneſs; this, brought him to a very intimate
acquaintance with his own heart; this, kept his
ſpirit low and fitted him for freer communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from God; this, made him more lively
and active; this, helped him to walk humbly
with God, this made him ſpeak more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
&amp; experimentally to others of the things
of God: and, in a word, this left a ſweet
calm upon his ſpirits, becauſe he every night
made even his accounts, and if his ſheets ſhould
prove his widing-ſheet, it had been all one:
for, he could ſay his work was done, ſo that
death could not ſurprize him.</p>
            <p>Could this book [of his experiences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
of his actions] have been read, it might
have contributed much to the compleating of
this diſcourſe, &amp; the quickning of ſome, and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33153:46"/>
comforting of others. But theſe things being
written in characters, the world hath loſt that
jewel.</p>
            <p>He ſtudied the Scriptures much, and they
were ſweeter to him than his food; and he had
an excellent faculty in opening the mind of
God in dark places.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of his life he ſeemed quite
ſwallowed up with the thoughts of Chriſt,
Heaven, and eternity, and the neerer he came
to this the more ſwift his motion was to it, and
the more unmixed his deſigns for it; and he
would much perſwade others to an univerſal
free reſpect to the glory of God, in all things;
and making Religion ones buſineſs, and not to
mind theſe great things by the by.</p>

            <p>He was very ready to debaſe himſelf; and
humbly to acknowledge, what he found amiſs
in himſelf, and laboured to amend himſelf and
others. <q>This, ſaith he, I muſt ſeriouſly
confeſs, that I muſt needs reproach my ſelf
for deficiency in a Chriſtian ſpiritual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of you (ſpeaking to a dear friend);
and for a decay in a quick tender touch, as of
other things, ſo of what relates to your ſelf
in the ſpirituality of it. Not that I think not
of you or of God; but, that my thoughts
of you, and ſpiritual things, are not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
ſavoury and affectionate, as they ought
to be.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>By this reflection you may eaſily perceive
that I ſee further in duty than I do in practice.
The truth of it is, I grudge that thoughts and
affections ſhould run out any whither freely,
but to God. And what I now deſire for my
ſelf, I deſire for you likewiſe, that God
would ſweeten the fountain, our natures I
mean, that every drop flowing from thence
may ſavour of ſomething of God within.
Thoughts are pretious, affections are more
pretious, the beſt that we are worth; and,
when they flow in a wrong chanel, all Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
pretious diſpenſations towards us are loſt;
all that God hath ſpent upon us, is loſt, and
ſpent in vanity. I ſpeak this, out of a dear
reſpect to your ſoul, and Gods honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33153:47"/>
whom, I am loth, ſhould be a loſer by his
kindneſſes. I know, you have many objects,
upon which you may be too apt to let out
your dear affections. I ſay again my jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,
is leſt (there being ſo many chanels,
wherein they may run) God loſe his due. I
deſire therefore, in humility and tenderneſs,
that this may be as a hint to you from the
ſpirit of God, to look inwards to the frame
and diſpoſition of your ſoul, and to make
trial thereof, by the natural out-goings of
your affections; and then, expoſtulate
the caſe with your own ſoul. If Chriſt have
my warmeſt love, why is it thus with me?
If God have my heart, why am I ſo thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
about the world? If I indeed love him
beſt, How cometh it to paſs, that I find more
ſtrong delightful conſtant acting of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards my Relations, my ſelf, or
any worldly thing than, I do after him? O,
the depth of the hearts deceitfulneſs!</p>
               <p>Dear and Honoured Friend, truſt not a
ſurmiſal, truſt not to a ſlight view of your
heart, or the firſt apprehenſions you may
have of your ſelf; but, go down into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of your heart, try and fear, fear and
try. An Evidence is abundantly more worth
than all the trouble that you can be at, in the
acquiring of it: And the trouble, that there
is good ground for, in an unevidenced ſtate;
is far greater than that which may ſeem to
be in ſearching for it. Yea, to an awakened
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33153:47"/>
ſoul, what is the trouble in clearing its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
but their ſenſe or fear of their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clear, and of the deceitfulneſs of their
hearts. The reality of that evil, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſoules ſo dread, doth lie in its full
weight, (though not felt), upon the drouſie
ungroundedly ſecure ſinner.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak in love; give me leave, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you of ſome touches that you had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
upon your ſpirit under the means of
grace; remember, how much you were
ſometimes affected under Preaching. Did
you never ſay, that theſe <hi>ſermons upon hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of heart,</hi> ſoftned yours? Inquire I pray,
whether thoſe convictions which were then
upon your heart, are not worn off, by the
incumbrances of the world: If, upon inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
you find that they are, it's high time for
you to look about you, and repent, and not
only to do your firſt works, but to ſtrive to
outgo them.</p>
               <p>I have vvith grief, taken a review of the
frame of my ovvn ſpirit, vvhen I vvas at your
houſe; and I have no ſmall ſenſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
of my ſoul, vvhereby I vvas betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to too great an indifference in the things
of God: and, finding by ſad experience,
that I vvas more apt (amongſt thoſe carnal
comforts and affairs) to loſe that relliſh, and
ſavour of divine things that I vvas vvont to
have; and thoſe delightful appearances of
God vvhich I vvas through rich grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33153:48"/>
with, while I was more ſequeſtred
from the world and earthly delights [not,
but that I find my heart at the beſt, under
the higheſt advantages of cloſeſt communion
too unwilling to endeavour after, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that gratious ſenſe and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God which I would fain obtain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to]:
I ſay, obſerving mine own experiences,
and knowing that your heart was ſomething
akin to mine, fearing leſt multiplicity of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
ſhould expoſe you alſo, to the ſame
hazard; Chriſtian compaſſion could not but
put me upon arming of you againſt thoſe
temptations, to which your occaſions make
you ſubject.</p>
               <p>The deſire of my ſoul for you is, that you
may travel ſafely through a dangerous wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to a bleſſed <hi>Canaan;</hi> that you may quit
your ſelf like a Chriſtian in the oppoſing
and conquering all your enemies; and, at
laſt, come triumphing out of the field, and
that you may behave your ſelf like a Pilgrim
and ſtranger in a far Country, who are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a City that hath foundations; and
that we may meet together with joy at our
Fathers houſe, and ſit down with him in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory. O that word glory is ſo weighty,
if we did believe it, that it would make the
greateſt diligence we can uſe to ſecure it ſeem
light. O that far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory! O for more faith! Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
our faith and then there would be no
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33153:48"/>
thing wanting to make us put forth the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtrength of our ſoul, and to improve
every moment of time, to catch hold of all
advantages and to make uſe of all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for the attainment of ſuch glorious ends.</p>
               <p>But, O theſe unbelieving hearts! let us join
our complaints and let us all break forth into
bitter lamentations over them. May not we
with as good reaſon, as that diſtreſſed Father
over his poſſeſſed Child, bring our hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the preſence of our Saviour, and cry out
with tears, and ſay that it is theſe unbelieving
hearts, which ſometimes caſt us into the fire,
and ſometimes into the water: yea, worſe,
every time we forſake God, and prefer any
thing before him, we part with life for death,
with Heaven for Hell.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to come yet a little nearer to
you: What an advantage would a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of the truth and excellency of Goſpel
diſcoveries, bring to your ſoul, if you would
but ſeriouſly, and with all your ſtrength,
drive on true ſpiritual deſigns. O, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
might you then go under all your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
If your care for the things of this
world were but rightly ſubordinate to the
things of eternity how chearfully might you
go on with your buſineſs! If you ſought <hi>firſt
the Kingdom of Heaven and the righteouſneſs
thereof:</hi> then all other things would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(ſo far as they are neceſſary or good for
you),</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:33153:49"/>
Let me therefore at this time put you upon
that duty of raiſing your mind from Earth to
Heaven, from the Creature to the Creator,
from the VVorld to God. Indeed, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of no ſmall difficulty, to diſcover that
diſorder that is in our ſouls, when we are
ſolicitous about temporary objects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:
But, there are but few ſurer
diſcoveries of it, than inſenſibility and not
complaining of it. For, when the ſoul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
raiſed to ſpiritual objects, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
clearly its eternal intereſt; when it
doth in good earneſt, take God for its porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and prefer him above all, then it will
quickly be ſenſible of the ſouls outgoings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
other objects, and even grudge that any
time ſhould be taken up in the purſuit of the
creature, and that any below God ſhould be
followed with earneſt pleaſure and conſtancy.
It would have God have the beſt, and it would
do nothing elſe but love, ſerve and injoy God.
For my own part I cannot but wonder that
God will give us leave to love him. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
goodneſs, O infinite condeſcenſion! Thoſe
that believingly ſeek him he is not aſhamed to
be called their God. I am ſenſible in ſome
meaſure of your burdens, and indeed that
muſt needs be a burden that keeps the ſoul
from purſuing its chiefeſt good. My prayers
for you are that you may have ſuch teachings
from God as may make you underſtand how
far heavenly things are more pretious than
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33153:49"/>
earthly, and that you may with all your
might ſeek, mind and love that which hath
moſt of true excellency in it, which hath the
only ground of real comfort here and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happineſs hereafter.</p>

            <p>HE was full of pity and compaſſion to ſouls,
and yet greatly grieved and aſhamed that
he did no more to expreſs his ſenſe of the
worth of ſouls and that his bowels did no more
ſenſibly yern over them, who he had juſt cauſe
to fear, were in a Chriſtleſs ſtate. Though
there were few of his Kindred and Relations,
nay of his neighbours and acquaintance but he
did make a perſonal application to, either by
letters or conference: Yet for all this, who
more ready to cry out of want of love to ſouls,
and unprofitableneſs to others in his generation,
that he was no more full of compaſſion, and
that he made no better improvement of all the
viſits that he made; in which, we ſhould not
make carnal pleaſure and recreation our end;
but the imparting &amp; receiving of ſome ſpiritual
gift. This made him, after a conſiderable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
from a dear friend, to groan out theſe
complaints. <q>God by his providence hath
off brought us together; but, to how little
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33153:50"/>
purpoſe, God and our Conſciences know.
As for my part, I may juſtly bewail my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneſs.
Oh, that I ſhould be of ſo little
uſe where I come! Oh, that my tongue and
heart ſhould be ſtill ſo unfruitful! I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to hope ſometimes, that, if it ſhould pleaſe
God in his providence to bring us again toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we may be more profitable one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And this indeed makes me more deſirous of
coming to you again, than any thing elſe. That
I may do ſome good among you. Oh, how
few ſtudy to advance the intereſt of Chriſt
and the benefit of one anothers ſouls in their
viſits, as they ſhould and might do! I am not
able, at preſent, to order my affairs ſo as to
come comfortably over to you, but I hope,
e're long, the Lord will give me leave to ſee
you, and be refreſhed by you, I deſire to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
my abſence by this ſure token of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of you, and alſo that I might
have an opportunity for that which we ought
to eye moſt in the injoyment of one anothers
ſociety. But I have found, that partly becauſe
of the narrowneſs of my heart, not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
to bring forth into act what I have
greatly deſired, partly becauſe of the malice
of the Enemy of our ſouls, who indeavours all
that poſſible he can, to lay ſtumbling blocks
in our way to real union and nearer acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with God and Chriſtian communion:
from theſe, and other cauſes, it is, that I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33153:50"/>
have been too little beneficial to you for
mercy.</p>
               <p>It may be, I may write that with freedom,
which in preſence I ſhould not have ſpoken.
I ſhall take occaſion from your deſire of my
preſence with you to look higher to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of our ſouls to be in conjunction and
communion with the higheſt good, who fills
up all relations to our ſouls; who is our Father,
our Husband, our Friend, our God; yea our
all in all. But, when I ſay, He is all in all; I
mean more than that which we count all; For
every one doth confeſs, that it is God alone,
that doth bleſs all other things to us, and that
it is not out of the nature of thoſe things that
we injoy, that they are bleſſings; but it is God,
which makes them comforts to us. And thus
God is to be acknowledged <hi>All in all common
injoyment!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, beſides this, God is ſomething to the
ſoul, which he is by himſelf and not in the
mediation of the creatures, where God is as
a portion, and lived upon as our true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
He is, not only the complement of
other things, but He himſelf is the ſouls ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.
I am a little obſcure, I deſire to be
plainer, I mean, that through the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Goſpel, God is to be lived upon,
delighted in, and choſen before all, for, for
this very end, hath Chriſt appeared, that he
might make God approachable by man, and
that we who are a far off, may be mad nigh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:33153:51"/>
There is a nearneſs to God which we are
not only allowed but called to in the loving
diſpenſations of the Goſpel, ſo that now we
are not to be ſtrangers any longer, but friends;
we are to have fellowſhip and communion
with God. Why do not our hearts even
leap for joy, why do not our ſouls triumph
in theſe diſcoveries of love? Even becauſe,
we know not the greatneſs of our priviledges,
the highneſs of our calling, the excellency of
our advancement, the bleſſedneſs of this life,
the ſweetneſs of theſe imployments, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of theſe injoyments, the comfort of
this heavenly life, the delights of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God. We know not the things
which belong to our peace: and thus when
God calls us to that which he ſent his Son
for, when Chriſt offers us, that which coſt him
ſo dear; we with the greateſt unworthineſs, the
vileſt ingratitude, refuſe, ſlight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it. What think we! doth it not go even
to the heart of Chriſt; and (to ſpeak after
the manner of men) doth it not grieve him to
the ſoul to behold his greateſt love ſcorned, &amp;
the end of his agony to be more vilely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of than the baſeſt of our luſts?</p>
               <p>Let us therefore according to that high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
wherewith we are called, enter into a
more intimate acquaintance with God, and as
we find our ſouls acting naturally towards
thoſe things, which are naturally dear to us;
ſo let us ſtrive to highten our ſpiritual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:33153:51"/>
We are very apt to look upon duties as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
rather than priviledges and ſeaſons of
injoying the greateſt refreſhments; but theſe
apprehenſions are very low and earthly. O
that we could at length ſet our ſelves to live a
ſpiritual life, to walk with God, and out of a
new nature, to ſavour and relliſh thoſe things
which are above! Could we but really, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely,
believingly deſire that which is real
happineſs, and the Heaven of Heaven, union
and communion with God; theſe deſires
would bring in ſome comfort.</p>
               <p>As for me, you muſt give me allowance to
get my affections more emptied into God;
though it be with a diminution of love to
you; and bleſſed will that day be, when all
love will be fully ſwallowed up into God.
But ſpiritual love doth not deſtroy natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
or relative obligations, but perfect
and rectifie them; and ſo I may, giving up
my ſelf to God be ſtill yours.</p>

to improve them, for the building up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

folly of common diſcourſe among Chriſtians
might appear more, and that he might diſcover
how little ſuch language did become thoſe that

him Gods cauſe; to do all for God, and to
act as under God, to be Gods inſtruments in
our ſouls and bodies which are Gods: Thus
did God create man for His own glory, and
not that man ſhould ſeek himſelf. And when
man fell, he fell out of God into himſelf;
out of that divine order and compoſure of
mind in which God had made him, into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
from a love of God, into a corrupt
ſelf-love and ſelf-ſeeking. Now if we do but
deſcend into our ſouls, &amp; obſerve the actings,
intents and contrivances of them, we cannot
but obſerve how confuſedly and abominably
all work together for the pampering, pleaſing
and advancing of ſelf. We are not to
think that if we do not preſently diſcover
this in our ſelves, that it is not ſo with us:
For, in ſome degree it is in every one, even
in the truly regenerate; as far as they have the
relicks of corruption in them, ſo far they have
in their ſouls this ſelf-love. Now this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in our minds whereby they are taken off
from their right ends is that very natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and depravedneſs which we received
from <hi>Adam,</hi> and it is, and, to a ſpiritual ſenſe,
ought to be, worſe than Hell it ſelf; in as
much as the cauſe doth eminently contain all
and more evil than the effect.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſpiritual death, whereby we are
dead in ſin, the fruit of the firſt curſe, <hi>Thou
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33153:54"/>
ſhalt die the death.</hi> The ſouls life in this
world, is its being in God and living to God,
and injoyment of God; and the ſouls eternal
life will be, ſo to know God as to be formed
into his likeneſs, and to be received into a full
participation of, and communion with God.
The ſouls death here, is its being fallen off
from God, and its being carried into its ſelf;
and its eternal death will be, an utter ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him.</p>
                  <p>Now mankind being thus fallen from God,
Chriſt is ſent for this very end, to bring man
back again to God; and then man is brought
unto God, when he is brought out of that
ſtate of ſelf-love into that ſtate whereby he
gives up himſelf wholly to God. Thus the
ſoul being quickened by the ſpirit of God,
leaveth off living to its ſelf, which was its
death; and lives to God, which is its life.
Here comes in the great duty of denying of
our ſelves for Chriſts ſake; which indeed
were no duty, if there were nothing in us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God.</p>
                  <p>This then is our duty not to ſeek our own
things, before the things of God; to lay
Gods glory as the foundation of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and if there be any thing in us contrary
to that, to give it no leave to ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with God.</p>
                  <p>Now, were this deeply rooted in our hearts,
how would contention, anger, wrath and
heart-burning and all things of this nature
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33153:55"/>
ceaſe? Such influence would the taking Gods
part againſt ſelf have, into the quiet and peace
of men, that it cannot be without it.</p>
                  <p>We ſee, how wiſely God hath ordered
things, that the very act of mans being off
from God, ſhould be the cauſe of confuſion,
war and miſery: and what can be more juſt
and equal than this, that God, who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our being, ſhould be the end of our
being? O then, that once our minds were
again reduced to this frame, <hi>To live wholly to
God!</hi> O that we were wrought into a through
prejudice againſt ſelf which ſtands between us
and true peace! I beg of you to ſpare ſome
time from the world, and retire into privacie,
where you may apply this to your own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>My prayer to God for you, out of the
ſtrong yearnings of my ſoul towards you is,
that he would make this effectual to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
end, for the inward peace of your ſoul,
for your comfortable walking with God, in
this life, and that condition wherein the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God hath placed you. I writ theſe lines
with the ſtrength of affection; I feel fear,
grief, compaſſion, working ſtrongly. O pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
me in the midſt of all theſe, whileſt I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
call to remembrance the cauſe of theſe
without a flood of tears. <hi>Fulfill</hi> therefore <hi>my
joy in being of one mind: yea, if there be
any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort in
love, if any-fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any
bowels of mercy; fulfill ye my joy, and be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33153:55"/>
like-minded, having the ſame love, being of
one accord, of one mind,</hi> Phil. 2. 1, 2. I leave
you to the love and mercy of God, and to
the working of his ſpirit, which alone is able
to put life and power into theſe words.
Which that he would do, is the earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
and ſervent prayer of yours,</p>

            <p>Now upon a faithful peruſal of this Letter,
it pleaſed the Lord to give a meek and more
complying ſpirit, and in a great meaſure it
wrought its intended effect. The noble deſign
of this ſweet peace-maker, took ſo far as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an ingenious acknowledgement, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
bewailing of the want of that ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
humility, meekneſs, and love, which doth
ſo much become our ſacred profeſſion. Upon
the hearing of this good news, how ſtrangely
was this good man tranſported! Upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of a letter from the former friend, which
gave no ſmall ſatisfaction &amp; hopes that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
indeavours were not in vain. And, that he
might drive the nail to the head, he ſpeedily
backs his for former Letter with a ſecond;
which ſpeaks theſe words.</p>

                  <p>MY ſoul is inlarged towards you and my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
work within me; and yet give
me leave now to lay aſide thoſe weak flames
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33153:56"/>
of natural affection, and to kindle my ſoul with
divine love. Here there is no fear of running
out too far while all is in Chriſt, and for Chriſt.
O that now I could let out the ſtrength of my
ſoul, not as to your ſelf but as to God! O that
my heart were more inlarged, that it may be
comprehenſive of a more full true Chriſtian
love! God is altogether lovely, and to be loved
for himſelf, and we are ſo far dark, ignorant
and blind, as we do not ſee and account him
moſt amiable. O let me have ſuch diſcoveries
of his excellency, that my heart may pant,
thirſt and break for its earneſt longings after
the richeſt participations of him; that I may
for ever be ſwallowed up of his love! O that
I may love him a thouſand times more than I
do! That I may rejoyce in him, and take the
ſweeteſt complacencie, &amp; delight in him alone;
&amp; that I could let out my affections moſt, where
I ſee any thing of himſelf, any beams of the
image of his holineſs, and that beareth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his ſpirit. Had you viſited me from
the dead, could my affections have moved more
ſtrongly, or my rejoycings have been greater
than they were at the receipt of thoſe lines
which I had from you, wherein ſo much of
Chriſt in you, and the goodneſs of Chriſt to me
did appear. Fulfil my joy in the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
my bowels, and let not my rejoycing be in
vain. If it hath pleaſed the Lord to make the
imperfect &amp; weak indeavours of his unworthy
ſervant, any way ſubſervient to his own glory
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33153:56"/>
in you, it is that which I account my ſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, &amp; deſire to receive it from him as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of the riches of his free goodneſs to
my ſelf; knowing my ſelf to be unworthy to
be his inſtrument in the meaneſt ſervice, much
more in ſo great a one as this is. Hoping and
perſwading my ſelf of the effectual vvork of my
former letter, I am incouraged to write again
both becauſe of my promiſe, and your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the vveighty nature of the ſubject that
I vvas then upon, vvhich vvas <hi>Love.</hi> True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
love, which is a thing ſo comly, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and ſweet, and of ſuch vveighty power in
all actions to make them divine &amp; excellent, that
there is no labour loſt in indeavouring to get
more of it, even in thoſe in vvhom it moſt
aboundeth. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 9, 10.
Though he knew that they vvere taught of God
to love one another, and that they did it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all the Brethren, yet, even them he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched
to abound more and more in that grace
of love. The former principal out of which
this love doth ariſe, (as I informed you in my
former Letter) was the putting off our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
and putting on Gods. Now I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in minding you of another Chriſtian duty,
which is effectual to the knitting us together in
a firm operative love, and that is this; That a
Chriſtian is to walk as one that is a member of
Chriſt Jeſus. Into what near and cloſe Union
are thoſe that are given him by the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
How hath the Holy-Ghoſt choſen out
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33153:57"/>
all the neareſt natural relations to expreſs and
ſhadow out the cloſeneſs of that ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that is between Chriſt and his! Chriſt is
our King and we his People, he is our Maſter
and we are his Servants, he is our Shepherd and
we the Sheep of his Paſture, he is our friend
and we his, he is our Husband and we are his
Spouſe; he is the Vine we the Branches, he our
Head and we are his Members; he is in us and
we in him, he is our Life. This duty will have
influence upon our affections theſe ways.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As Chriſt is our Head and we are his
Members, ſo he hath an abſolute command
over us. And where this relation is real, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the commands of Chriſt is ſweet
and without conſtraint and force; now this is
Chriſts command that we ſhould love one
another; by this ſaith he ſhall all men know
you are my Diſciples if you love one another.
Thoſe relations into which Chriſt, receiveth
his, ſpeak and hold forth a willing cheerful
full ſubmiſſion to the commands of Chriſt, and
what duty is there in all the Goſpel which is
more frequently and earneſtly preſſed than
this. A new commandment give I unto you
that you love one another as I have loved you,
ſo love one another. So full is the whole
Scripture of obligations, both upon Conſcience
and Ingenuity to this duty, that the whole
ſtream of it ſeems to run into this chanel of
Love. But Chriſts command is ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
as one that hath any ſpiritual ſenſe to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33153:57"/>
feel the ſtrength of it, cannot break. It is
Chriſt hath commanded, and ſhall not we
obey? Shall not the love of Chriſt conſtrain
us? Shall we be ſo unkind to him who hath
been ſo kind to us, as to ſtand it out with
him in ſo equal a command? Shall not the
ſweetneſs of Chriſt overcome us; that ſeeing
his love was ſo great, as not to ſpare his life
for us, yea, and ſuffer more for us I believe
than we think he did, nay, I may ſay than
we can conceive he did, and that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
his love to us is, that he ſhould do
and ſuffer ſo much for us, that of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
we were become his Enemies? Why
ſhould we not then cheerfully ſubmit to him in
this one command, love one another? Doth
not the very word Love carry in it at the firſt
hearing abundance of alluring violence? This
is Chriſts yoak, and here we may well ſay,
his yoak is eaſie and his burthen is light.
What is there in a life of divine love that we
need be afraid of? What is there is this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that is grievous? How can this yoak be
uneaſLy? What reaſon to be loath to take it
on? But ſuch is the baſe degeneracy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs
of corrupted nature, that when
any thing comes in competition with ſelf-love,
then all bonds muſt be broken, all yoaks
muſt be caſt off, and nothing will then keep
us in, but we muſt and will take our own
part though never ſo bad. And our own
part in the heart of paſſion muſt ſeem beſt,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33153:58"/>
though it be contrary to infinite Righteouſneſs,
which is God himſelf. O that we could once
learn to lay aſide this natural prejudice, which
we have againſt vvhatſoever doth thwart our
humours, though it be never ſo juſt, holy and
rational. O that we could look more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
and ſearch more exactly into our ſelves
vvith a ſpiritual Eye, and then vve could not
but ſee that vvhich would make us loath our
ſelves, and to become abominable in our own
Eyes, and rather take any part than our own,
vve ſhould ſee ſo much deceitfulneſs in our
ſelves, as that vve ſhould think our caſe bad
though it ſeem never ſo good to our natural
ſelf, till we apply it to the rule. Rule, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vvould have none but it ſelf; and though
in our better compoſure of mind, vve may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome other rule; yet in our paſſions vve
cannot ſpare time to go to any other rule, but
we take that vvhich is next to hand, and ſelf
vvill be ſure to be that. But we muſt, if vve
vvill be true Chriſtians, learn to deny ſelf, and
vvholly to ſubmit our ſelves to the Command
of Chriſt, as our only Rule. O, let the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Chriſts love, and command, make us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to this command of love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If vve are to walk as Members of
Chriſt, vvho is our Head; this hath influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon our affections to oblige us to love
one another, as, from the command vvhich
the Head hath over the Members, ſo, from
the conformity that is to be in the Members
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33153:58"/>
to the Head. The Head and the Members are
not of two ſeveral Natures; But, the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
paſſeth from the Head through all the
Members: Now, if vve be ingrafted into Chriſt,
vve muſt become of the ſame nature vvith him;
let us be <hi>followers of Chriſt as dear Children,
and walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved
us. Paul</hi> bids us to be followers of himſelf,
as he vvas follower of Chriſt; Chriſt then is
to be our great pattern: He commands us to
<hi>learn of him,</hi> for <hi>he was meek.</hi> For us to
think to attain unto a perfect conformity to
him, is in vain; but, as much as our natures
are capable of vve are to ſtrive for it. Chriſts
love to us, hath breadth, and length, and
depth, and heighth, vvhich paſſeth knowledge.
Greater love hath no man than this, that a
man ſhould lay down his life for his friend,
but herein Chriſt commended his love to us,
in that vvhile vve vvere enemies, Chriſt died
for us. Behold what manner of love is this,
that Chriſt hath beſtowed on us! Hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
vve the love of God (that is Chriſt)
becauſe he laid down his life for us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.
His inference is there the ſame with mine, and
that in a higher degree; <hi>we ought to lay down
our lives for the Brethren.</hi> If Life, then ſin;
then paſſion and vvrath; then a baſe proud ſelf-pleaſing
and contradicting humour. Do vve
ſee any Lovelineſs or Beauty in Chriſt Jeſus?
Is there no excellency in his ſweetneſs pity, and
patience? Is not his loving-kindneſs amiable?
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33153:59"/>
And would not ſomthing like this in us, be
deſirable? Had he more reaſon to love us than
we have to love one another? O, let our ſouls
be overcome with the thoughts of this love of
Chriſt: Let our hearts be kindled and blown
up into a flame of Love, by it. O, when ſhall
this dear, precious, pure, eternal love of His,
over-power our ſouls? When ſhall it have its
proper effect upon us, to make us to deſire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to be like our beloved! When ſhall we
put on his beauty! O how lovely ſhould we
then look! Let us put off that deformity that
is upon our Souls, which makes us ſo unlike to
Chriſt; yea, which makes us loathſome in his
Eyes, Pride, Paſſions, Worldlineſs, are thoſe
Soul-deformities, which keep Chriſt at ſuch a
diſtance from us, and which hinder his more
ſweet frequent and intimate converſe with us.</p>
                  <p>It is only that of Himſelf which Chriſt ſeeth
in us, which he delighteth in. For, in Him is
the perfection of all Beauty and excellency, and
whatſoever lovelineſs is in any thing elſe, comes
from him, is like him, and leads to him. Would
we know, how much we are beloved of him, let
us ſee how much we are like him; for, He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but love that which is like himſelf, and if
we would be like him, we muſt put on love,
for <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in God and god in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we ought to walk towards one
another as members of the ſame body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Chriſt is the Head, what can ſpeak a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33153:59"/>
union than commemberſhip? No man ever
yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
it. But we do not feel the power of
this oneneſs, as we ought to do. We are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and where there is diviſion, there will be
diſſention; that we may therefore, be more
one, let us be more in putting off our ſelf, and
going into Chriſt. Here, let us look into the
loathſomneſs of our natures, whileſt off from
God; which is the cauſe of all this confuſion, and
if we cannot ſee its deformity in its ſelf, let us
ſee it in reflection in its bitter effects; and
when we ſee our own deformity, we ſhall ſee
leſs cauſe to love our ſelves, and more cauſe to
love others. Let us look upon our oneneſs in
Chriſt, and ſee if we can thence become one
in affections. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I and the children
which thou haſt given me;</hi> we have one ſpiritual
Father, we are brethren; let us love as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
The cauſe of this union is our being made
partakers of Chriſts nature, and baptized into
the ſame ſpirit with him: and, if we have at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time experienced the more lively and full
incomes of this ſpirit of Chriſt, how did it ſet
the heart on fire! The ſoul is then too narrow
to contain its own affections; how dearly then
could we look upon a Saint! How did pride
and wrath vaniſh and melt down into meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
humility and love! Did we never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
what this meaneth? Then, let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the ſweetneſs of it, renew it in us.
O, a life of ſpiritual love is a life indeed, a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33153:60"/>
Heaven upon earth! This is a good rule; when
vve find our ſelves in a ſpiritual temper, let us
examine our ſelves then, and inquire how vve
like ſuch a frame: Let us remember the Voice
of the ſpirit in us, and labour to have our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and affections always after, ſo ballanced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Are vve members of Chriſt, vve do
not ſay, vve do not love Chriſt. If vve do
indeed love Chriſt, let us love him vvherever
vve find Him. Chriſt is in all thoſe, that are
His. Let us fear offending Chriſt in his, for
vvhat is done to them, He vvill take as done
to himſelf. It vvill be ſaid in that great Day,
<hi>In as much as ye did it unto theſe, ye did it unto
me.</hi> Let us think vvhat vve vvill of it at preſent,
the vvorld vvill find this true to their coſt. And
if vve act as in Chriſt, vve ſhall find our ſelves
as much concerned for him as for our ſelves, and
more too. Oh the vvrongs that are done to him,
vve ſhall reckon done to us. If vve are Chriſts,
Chriſts intereſt vvill be ours, and his injuries
ours. If vve are Chriſts, vve vvill be as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of offending of any of his, as of vvronging
of our ſelves. Chriſt himſelf is above the reach
of our vvrongs, to be touched by them in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
but, in his Members he ſuffers to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day. If then Chriſt and vve are one, and
Chriſt and all his are one; let us love Chriſt
in his, let us rejoice in Chriſt in his members, let
us indeavour to requite Chriſt in his members:
let us fear grieving the ſpirit of Chriſt, in grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſpirits of any of his dear ones. Wound
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33153:60"/>
not Chriſt in vvounding the heart of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
O the pretiouſneſs, pleaſure and profit of
this love, I beg of God to give you a full injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that ſweetneſs and the joyful fruits of
it, the Lord refreſh you vvith a quick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſence and ſight of his eternal love towards
your ſoul; to vvhich the aſſurance of true
Chriſtian love by the effectual vvork of the
Comforter, may bring you. By this vve know,
that vve are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe
vve love the Brethren. If it ſhall pleaſe the Lord
to give me leave to ſee you again, I ſhall come
vvith ſtrong expectations, and earneſt deſires of
ſeeing a ſweet alteration for the better in you,
in your deportment, and carriage towards one
that did deſerve better at your hands. And
vvhat an effect hopes of this nature fruſtrated,
vvill produce; I beſeech you to judge. I pray
God fill you vvith peace and joy. My hand is
vveary vvith vvriting, but my mind ſtill runs
forth in deſires and prayers for you. I hope the
Lord vvill take away all cauſe of vvriting any
more of this ſubject unto you. Your Letter
gave me hopes of a good beginning: I beſeech
the Lord to carry on vvhat he hath begun to the
glory of his goodneſs, that I may at every ſight
of you, ſee more of the image of Chriſt in you,
and more of the power and beauty of this grace
of love, and that I may find you drawn nearer
to Heaven, and ſee you vvith Chriſt in Heaven
vvhen time ſhall be no more. I leave you in
the Arms of Love.</p>

            <p>By all this you may eaſily perceive what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
acted him, and how much he was troubled
for any diviſions amongſt the people of God.
Indeed, he was of ſo loving, and lovely a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,

            <p>I can never forget a ſtrang expreſſion, that
I have heard from him, concerning one that
had a very ardent love for him. <hi>I know this</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>that I love no love but what is purely
for Chriſts ſake, would Chriſt might have all the
love, He alone deſerves it: for my part, I am
afraid and aſhamed of the love and reſpects of
Chriſtians.</hi> He ſaw ſo much pride, peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and diviſion amongſt Profeſſors, that it did
not a little vex his righteous Soul, and made
him think long, to be in a ſweeter Air, where
there ſhould be nothing but union, joy and
love. He could not indure to hear Chriſtians
ſpeak reproachfully one of another, becauſe
they were of different judgments and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
There where he ſaw moſt holineſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and love, there he let out moſt of his
affections. And he was of that holy mans mind,
that it were pity that the very name of diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <head type="sub">An account of the latter part of his Life.</head>
            <p>FOR the latter part of his Life; he lived
liked a man that was quite weary of the
world, and that looked upon himſelf as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
here, and that lived in the conſtant ſight of
a better world. He plainly declared himſelf
but a Pilgrim that looked for a better Country,
a City that had foundations, whoſe builder and
maker was God. His habit, his language, his
deportment, all ſpoke him one of another
world. His meditations were ſo intenſe, long
and frequent, that they ripened him apace for
Heaven; but, ſomewhat weakned his body.
Few Chriſtians attain to ſuch a holy contempt
of the world, and to ſuch clear believing, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
conſtant apprehenſions of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
glories of the unſeen world.</p>
            <p>He made it his whole buſineſs to keep up ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
communion with God, and to grow into
a humble familiarity with God, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. And if by reaſon of company or any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
diverſions, this was in any meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted;
he would complain, like one out of
his element, till his ſpirit was recovered into a
delightful more unmixed free intercourſe with
God. He was never ſo well ſatisfied, as when
he was more immediately ingaged in what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33153:62"/>
brought him nearer to God; and by this he
injoyed thoſe comforts frequently, which other
Chriſtians rarely meet with. His graces and
experiences, toward his end grew to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
His faith got up to a full aſſurance; his
deſires into a kind of injoyment and delight.
He was oft brought into the banqueting houſe,
and there Chriſts Banner over him was love;
and he ſate down under his ſhadow with great
delight, and his Fruit was pleaſant unto his taſt.
His Eyes beheld the King in his Beauty, and
while he ſate at his Table, his ſpicknard did
ſpend forth its pleaſant ſmell: he had frequent
viſions of Glory, and this <hi>John</hi> lay in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of his Maſter, and was ſure a very beloved
Diſciple, and highly favored. His Lord oft
called him up to the Mount to him, and let
him ſee his excellent Glory, O the ſweet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſts
that he had of thoſe pleaſures that are at
the right Hand of God. How oft was he feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the feaſt of fat things thoſe wines on
the lees well refined; and ſometimes he was like
a Giant refreſht with new wine, rejoycing to run
the race that was ſet before him, whether of
doing or of ſuffering. He was even ſick of love
and he could ſay to the poor unexperienced
World, <hi>O taſt and ſee!</hi> and to Chriſtians <hi>come
and I well tell you what God hath done for
my Soul.</hi> O what do Chriſtians mean that they
do no more labour to get their ſences ſpiritually
exerciſed? O, why do they not make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very buſineſs of their lives? O, why is the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33153:62"/>
Soul, Chriſt and Glory thus diſpiſed? Is there
nothing in communion with God? Are all thoſe
comforts of Chriſtians, that follow hard after
him, worth nothing? Is it not worth the while
to make ones calling and Election ſure. O, why
do men and women jeſt, and dally in the great
matters of Eternity? Little do people think,
what they ſlight, when they are ſeldom and
formal in ſecret duties, and when they neglect
that great duty of <hi>Meditation,</hi> which I have
through rich mercy, found ſo ſweet and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
O, what do Chriſtians mean, that they
keep at ſuch a diſtance from Chriſt? Did they
but know the thouſandth part of that ſweetneſs
that is in him, they could not chooſe but follow
him hard; they would run and not be weary,
and walk and not be faint.</p>
            <p>He could ſenſibly and experimentally, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the ways of God to the poor unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
world, and ſay, <hi>His ways are pleaſantneſs;</hi>
and juſtifie wiſdom and ſay, <hi>her paths were peace.</hi>
He could take off thoſe aſperſions which the
Devil, and the atheiſtical frantick ſots, do caſt
upon Godlineſs in the power of it. Here is one
that could challenge all the Atheiſts in the world
to diſpute; here is one could bring ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
to prove a deity, &amp; the reality and
excellency of inviſibles; which theſe ignorant
fools and mad men, make the ſubject of their
ſcorn: Here is one that would not change de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
with the greateſt epicures living, and vie
pleaſure with all the ſenſual rich gallants of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33153:63"/>
world. Which of them all could in the midſt
of their jollity ſay, <hi>This is the pleaſure, that
ſhall laſt for ever?</hi> Which of them can ſay,
among their Cups and Whores, <hi>I can now look
Death in the Face,</hi> and, <hi>this very Moment I can
be content,</hi> yea glad, <hi>to leave theſe delights, as
knowing, I ſhall injoy better.</hi> And this he
could do, when he fared deliciouſly in ſpiritual
banquets every day: He could, upon better
reaſon than he did, ſay, <hi>Soul, thou haſt goods laid
up for many years;</hi> He knew full well, that what
he did here injoy, was but a little to what he
ſhould have ſhortly. <hi>In his preſence there is
fulneſs of joy; at his right hand there are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
for evermore.</hi> Where is the <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi>
that would not quake in the midſt of his Cups,
whilſt he is quaffing and carouzing in bowls of
the richeſt Wine, if he ſhould ſee a hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wall, writing bitter things againſt him;
telling him that his joys are at an end, and that
this night his ſoul muſt be required of him; that
now, he muſt come away, and give an account
of all his ungodly pleaſures, before the mighty
God. Where is the ſinner, that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to hear the Lord roaring out of <hi>Zion,</hi>
whileſt he is roaring in the Tavern? Which of
them would be glad to hear the trumpet ſound,
and to hear that voice, <hi>Ariſe you dead and come
to judgment?</hi> Which of them would rejoyce to
ſee the Mountains quaking, the Elements mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with fervent heat, and the Earth conſumed
with flames; &amp; the Lord Chriſt whom they deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33153:63"/>
coming in the clouds with Millions of his
Saints and Angels, to be avenged upon thoſe
that knew not God and obeyed not his Goſpel.
Is not that a bleſſed ſtate, when a man can lift
up his head with joy, when others tremble with
fear, and ſink with ſorrow? And this was the
condition of this holy young man. In the
midſt of all worldly comforts he longed for
death: &amp; the thought of the day of Judgment,
made all his injoyments ſweeter. O, how did
he long for the coming of Chriſt! Whilſt ſome
have been diſcourſing by him of that great and
terrible day of the Lord, he would ſmile, and
humbly expreſs his delight in the forethought
of that approaching hour.</p>
            <p>I remember, once there was a great talk that
one had foretold that Doomſday ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a day: although he blamed their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
folly, that would pretend to know that
which was hid from the Angels themſelves, and
that the Devil could not acquaint them with; yet
granting their ſuppoſition to be true, what then
ſaid he? What if the day of Judgmennt were
come, as it will moſt certainly come ſhortly? If
I were ſure, the day of Judgment were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
within an hour, I ſhould be glad with all my
heart. If at this very inſtant, I ſhould hear ſuch
thunderings, and ſee ſuch lightnings, as <hi>Iſrael</hi>
did at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> I am perſwaded, my very
heart would leap for joy. But this I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of, through infinite mercy, that the very
meditation of that day hath even raviſhed my
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33153:64"/>
ſoul, and the thought of the certainty and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it, is more refreſhing to me than the
comforts of the whole world. Surely, nothing
can more revive my Spirits, than to behold the
bleſſed Jeſus; the joy, life, and beauty of my
ſoul. Would it not more rejoyce me, than <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
wagons did old <hi>Jacob?</hi> I lately dreamed
that the day of Judgment was come: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought,
I heard terrible cracks of thunder, and
ſaw dreadful lightnings; the foundations of the
earth did ſhake, and the Heavens were roled
together as a garment; yea, all things viſible
were in a flame; methought, I ſaw the graves
opened, and the earth and Sea giving up their
dead; methought, I ſaw millions of Angels, and
Chriſt comming in the clouds. Methought, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the antient of days ſitting upon his Throne,
and all other Thrones caſt down: Methought,
I beheld him whoſe Garments were white as
Snow, and the hair of his head like pure Wool:
His Throne was like the firely flame, and his
wheels as burning fire; a firey ſtream iſſued and
came forth from him; thouſands of thouſands
miniſtred unto him; and ten thouſand times ten
thouſand ſtood before him; and the Judgment
was ſet and the books were opened. O, but
with what an extaſie of joy was I ſurprized!
Methought, it was the moſt heart-raiſing, and
ſoul-raviſhing ſight, that ever my eyes beheld:
and then I cried out, <hi>I have waited for thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
O God;</hi> and ſo I mounted into the Air,
to meet my Lord in the Clouds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:33153:64"/>
This I record, only to ſhew, how far he was
from being daunted at the thoughts of death or
Judgement: and to let other Chriſtians know,
what is attainable in this life; and what folly it
is, for us to take up with ſo little, when our
Lord is pleaſed to make ſuch noble proviſions
for us, and by a wiſe and diligent improvement
of thoſe means which God hath offered us, we
may have an entrance adminiſtred to us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
into the everlaſting Kingdom of our
Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>O how comfortable, how honourable, and
how profitable is this ſtate! Theſe are your
men that quit themſelves like Chriſtians This
is true gallantry, noble manhood, real valour!
This was the condition of Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> for
about three years before he died; I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but that he had ſome clouds; but, he uſually
walked in a ſweet, even, humble ſerenity of
ſpirit, and his refreſhing joys were more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
than his diſpondings; and though he
daily queſtioned many actions; yet, did not
queſtion his ſtate, but had his heart fixed upon
that rock that neither waves nor winds could
ſhake. His ſenſes were ſtill ſo ſpiritually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
as that he could look up to Heaven as his
Country and Inheritance, and to God as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to Chriſt as his Redeemer; and (that
which is ſcarce to be heard of) he counted it
the higheſt act of patience to be willing to die,
and a very great pitch of ſelf-denial to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be in this world, and to dwell on this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33153:65"/>
ſide a full and eternal injoyment of that royal
glorious One whom his ſoul was ſo much in
love with. In a word, he had the moſt earneſt
deſires to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt that
I ever ſaw, read, or heard of, ſince the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
times.</p>

               <p>His body is now ſhaken again, and he falls
into a deep Conſumption; but, this meſſenger
of God did not in the leaſt damp him. Spitting
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33153:65"/>
of blood, was no ghaſtly thing to one that had
his eye upon the blood of Jeſus; faint ſweats
did not daunt him that had always ſuch reviving
cordials at hand. It's matter of joy to him,
that he was now in ſome hopes of having his
earneſt deſires ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>After he had been a while ſick, a ſudden dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeized upon his eyes; by and by his ſight
quite failed; and there was ſuch a viſible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in him, that he and others judged theſe
things to be the ſymptoms of death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But when he was thus taken, he was not
in the leaſt ſurprized; but was lifted up with
joy to think, what a life he was going to, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon death it ſelf as one of his Fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and his friend that was ſent as a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to conduct him ſafely to his glorious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
               <p>When he felt his body ready to faint, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to his Mother and ſaid, <q>Dear Mother I
am dying, but I beſeech you be not troubled;
for, I am through mercy, quite above the
fears of death, it's no great matter, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubles me but the apprehenſions of
your grief. I am going to Him, whom I
love above life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it pleaſed the Lord to raiſe him again a
little out of this fainting fit, for his maſter had
yet more work for him to do before he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his wages. Although his outward man
decayed apace, yet he is renewed in the inward
man day by day: His graces were never more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33153:66"/>
active, and his experiences were never greater.
When one would have thought, he ſhould have
been taken up with his diſtemper, and that it
had been enough for him to grapple with his
pains, then he quite forgets his weakneſs; and is
ſo ſwallowed up of the life to come, that he had
ſcarce leiſure to think of his ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral weeks together, I never heard
the leaſt word that ſavoured of any complaint
or wearineſs under the hand of God; except,
his eager deſire to be with Chriſt, be counted
complaining, and his haſte to be in Heaven be
called impatience. Now's the time when one
might have ſeen Heaven and the Glory of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee
world realized to ſenſe. His faith grew
exceedingly and his love was proportionable,
and his joys were equal to both.</p>
               <p>O the rare attainments! The high and divine
expreſſions, that dropped from his mouth! I
have not words to expreſs what a ſtrange, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant,
angelical frame, he was in, for ſome
conſiderable time together. It was a very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon earth, to ſee and hear a man admiring
God at ſuch a rate, as I never heard any, nor
ever expect to hear or ſee more, till I come to
Heaven. Thoſe that did not ſee cannot well
conceive, what a ſweet frame he was in, for at
leaſt ſix weeks before he died. His ſoul was
almoſt alwaies filled with thoſe joys unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and full of glory. How oft vvould he cry
out; <hi>O, that I could but let you know what I
now feel! O, that I could ſhow you what I ſee:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33153:66"/>
O, that I could expreſs the thouſandth part of
that ſweetneſs that I now find in Chriſt! You
would all then think it well worth the while to
make it your buſineſs to be religious.</hi> O my dear
friends, we little think what a Chriſt is worth
upon a death-bed. I would not for a world, nay
for millions of worlds, be now without a Chriſt
and a pardon. I would not for a world be to live
any longer: the very thoughts of a poſſibility
of recovery, makes me even tremble.</p>
               <p>When one came to viſit him, and told him,
that he hoped it might pleaſe God to raiſe him
again, and that he had ſeen many a weaker man
reſtored to health, and that lived many a good
year after: <hi>And do you think to pleaſe me</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>by ſuch diſcourſe as this?</hi> No,
Friend, you are much miſtaken in me, if you
think that the thoughts of life, and health, and
the world, are pleaſing to me. The world hath
quite loſt its excellency in my judgement. O
how poor and contemptible a thing is it in all
its glory, compared with the glory of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
world which I now live in the ſight of!
And as for life, Chriſt is my life, health and
ſtrength; and I know, I ſhall have another
kind of life, when I leave this. I tell you it
would incomparably more pleaſe me, if you
ſhould ſay to me, [You are no man of this
world; you cannot poſſibly hold out long; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to morrow you will be in eternity]. I till
you I do ſo long to be with Chriſt, that I could
be contented to be cut apeices, &amp; to be put to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33153:67"/>
the moſt exquiſite torments, ſo I might but die,
and be with Chriſt. O, how ſweet is Jeſus! <hi>Come,
Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Death do thy worſt!
Death hath loſt his terribleneſs. Death it is
nothing. I ſay, Death is nothing (through
grace) to me. I can as eaſily die as ſhut my
eyes, or turn my head and ſleep: <hi>I long to be
with Chriſt; I long to die;</hi> that was ſtill his
note.</p>
               <p>His Mother and Brethen ſtanding by him he
ſaid; <q>
                     <hi>Dear Mother,</hi> I beſeech you as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as ever I deſired any thing of you in my life,
that you would cheerfully give me up to
Chriſt; I beſeech you, do not hinder me, now
I am going to reſt and glory. I am afraid of
your prayers, leſt they pull one way and mine
another.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then turning to his Brethren he ſpake
thus to them, <q>I charge you all, do not pray
for my life any more: you do me wrong, if
you do! O that glory, the unſpeakable glory
that I behold. My heart is full, my heart is
full. Chriſt ſmiles, and I cannot choſe but
ſmile: can you find in your heart, to ſtop me
who am now going to the compleat and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
injoyment of Chriſt? Would you keep
me from my Crown? The arms of my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour are open to imbrace me; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
ſtand ready to carry my ſoul into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.
O, did you but ſee what I ſee: you
would all cry out with me, how long, dear
Lord, come Lord Jeſus come quickly! O,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33153:67"/>
why are his Chariot-wheels ſo long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</q>
               </p>
               <p>And all this while he lay like a triumphing
conqueror, ſmiling and rejoicing in ſpirit.</p>
               <p>There was never a day towards his end but
(as weak as he was) he did ſome ſpecial piece
of ſervice in, for his great Maſter. Yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every hour did produce freſh wonders.</p>
               <p>A Reverend, Judicious and holy <hi>Miniſter</hi>
came often to viſit him, and diſcourſed with
him of the excellency of Chriſt, and the glory
of the inviſible world. <hi>Sir, ſaid</hi> he, <hi>I feel
ſomething of it; my heart is as full as it can
hold in this lower ſtate; I can hold no more
here. O that I could but let you know what I
feel!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This holy Miniſter praying with him his
ſoul was raviſhed with the abundant incomes of
light, life and love; ſo that he could ſcarce
bear it, nor the thought of ſtaying any longer
in the world, but longed to be in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
wherein he ſhould have yet more grace
and more comfort, and be better able to bear
that weight of glory; ſome manifeſtations
whereof did even almoſt ſink his weak body, &amp;
had he not been ſuſtained by a great power, his
very joys would have overwhelmed him; and
whilſt he was in theſe extaſies of joy and love,
he was wont to cry out,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Who am I Lord, who am I, that thou
ſhouldſt be mindful of me! Why me Lord,
why me, and paſs by thouſands &amp; look upon
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33153:68"/>
ſuch a wretch as me, O, what ſhall I ſay
unto thee, O thou preſerver of men? O, why
me Lord, why me? O bleſſed, and for ever
bleſſed, be free grace! How is it, Lord, that
thou ſhouldſt manifeſt thy ſelf unto me, and
not unto others, even ſo Father, becauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good in thy eyes, Thou wilt have mercy
becauſe thou wilt have mercy. And if thou
wilt look upon ſuch a poor worm who can
hinder! Who would not love thee! O bleſſed
Father! O how ſweet and gratious haſt thou
been unto me? O, that he ſhould have me in
his thoughts of love, before the foundations of
the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus he went on, admiring and adoring
of God, in a more high and heavenly manner
than I can clothe with words. Suppoſe what you
can on this ſide Heaven, and I am perſwaded
you might have ſeen it in him. He was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
taken with the goodneſs of God to him
in ſending that aged experienced Miniſter to
help him in his laſt great work upon earth.
<q>Who am I, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that God ſhould ſend to
me a meſſenger one among a thouſand (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him with tears of joy).</q>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33153:68"/>
up to the higheſt pitch of thankfulneſs, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Love; he would with great ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan

What meaneſt thou, O my ſoul, that thou
doſt not conſtantly adore and praiſe this rare,
ſtrong, and unſpeakable Love! Is it true, O
my ſoul, doth God deal familiarly with man,
and are his humble, zealous, and conſtant
love, praiſe, and ſervice too good for God?
Why art not thou O my ſoul, ſwallowed up
every moment with this free unparalell'd ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Love.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And then he breaks out again into another
triumphant Extaſie of praiſe and joy; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
a little of that which was unexpreſſible
in ſome ſuch words as theſe,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Stand aſtoniſhed ye Heavens, and wonder
O ye Angels, at this infinite grace! Was
ever any under Heaven more beholding to
free grace than I? Doth God uſe to do thus,
with his creatures? Admire him for over and
ever, O ye redeemed ones! O thoſe joys,
the taſt of which I have! Thoſe everlaſting
joys, which are at his right hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more!
Eternity, Eternity it ſelf, is too ſhort
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33153:69"/>
to praiſe this God in. O bleſs the Lord with
me, come let us ſhout for joy and boaſt in the
God of our Salvation. O, help me to praiſe
the Lord for his mercy indureth for ever!</p>
               </q>
               <p>One of his brethren (that had formerly been
wrought upon by his holy exhortations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
praying with him, and ſeeing of him,
(as he apprehended) near his Diſſolution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
that the Lord would be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
thoſe aſtoniſhing and ſoul ſupporting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to the laſt moment of his breath, and that
he might go from one Heaven to another, from
grace and joy imperfect, to perfect grace and
glory; and when his work was done here, give
him, if it were his will, the moſt eaſie and
triumphant paſſage to reſt; and that he might
have an abundant entrance adminiſtred into the
everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>At the end of the Duty he burſt out into a
wonderful Paſſion of joy. (Sure that was joy
unſpeakable and full of glory!) O what an
Amen did he ſpeak, <hi>Amen, Amen, Amen,
Hallelujah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would have made any Chriſtians heart to
leap, to have ſeen and heard, what ſome ſaw and
heard, at that time; and I queſtion not, but that
it will ſomewhat affect them to hear and read
it; though it be ſcarce poſſible to ſpeak the half
of what was admirable in him: for, it being
ſo much beyond preſident, it did even aſtoniſh
and amaze thoſe of us that were about him,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33153:69"/>
that our relation muſt fall hugely ſhort of what
was real.</p>
               <p>I verily believe that it exceeds the higheſt
Rhetorick, to ſet out to the life, what this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
creature did then deliver. I ſay again, I
want words to ſpeak, and ſo did he; for, he ſaw
things unutterable: But yet, ſo much he ſpake
as juſtly drew the admiration of all that ſaw
him; and I heard an old experienced Chriſtian
and Miniſter ſay it again and again, That <hi>He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw, nor read, nor heard the like:</hi> Neither
could we ever expect to ſee the glories of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
more demonſtrated to ſenſe, in this World.
He talked as if he had been in the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and broke out into ſuch words as theſe,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>O, He is come! He is come! O how
ſweet! How glorious is the bleſſed Jeſus!
How ſhall I do to ſpeak the thouſandth part
of his praiſes! O for words, to ſet out a little
of that excellency! But it is unexpreſſible!
O how excellent, glorious, and lovely is the
precious Jeſus! He is ſweet, He is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lovely! And now I am ſick of Love, he
hath raviſhed my ſoul with his beauty! I ſhall
die ſick of Love.</p>
                  <p>O my friends ſtand by and wonder, come
look upon a dying man, and wonder; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
my ſelf but ſtand and wonder! Was
there ever a greater kindneſs, was there ever
ſenſibler manifeſtations of rich Grace! O,
why me, Lord, why me! Sure this is akin
to Heaven, and if I were never to enjoy any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33153:70"/>
more than this; it were well worth all the
torments that men and Devils could invent;
to come thorow yea even a Hell to ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
joys as theſe. If this be dying, dying
is ſweet: Let no true Chriſtian ever be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of dying. O Death is ſweet to me.
This Bed is ſoft. Chriſts Arms and Kiſſes,
his Smiles and Viſits, ſure they would turn
Hell into Heaven. O that you did but ſee and
feel what I do! Come and behold a dying
man more chearful than you ever ſaw any
healthful man in the midſt of his ſweeteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments?
O Sirs, Worldly pleaſures are
pitiful poor ſorry things, compared with one
glimps of this glory, which ſhines in ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into my Soul! O why ſhould any of you
be ſo ſad, when I am ſo glad? This, this is
the hour that I have waited for!</p>
               </q>
               <p>About eight and forty hours before his
Death, his eyes were dim, and his ſight much
failed; his Jaws ſhook and trembled, and his
Feet were cold, and all the ſymtoms of Death
were upon him, and his extream parts were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
almoſt dead and ſenſeleſs, and yet, even
then, his joys were (if poſſible) greater ſtill:
He had ſo many fits of joy unſpeakable, that he
ſeemed to be in one continued act of Seraphick
Love, and praiſe. He ſpake like one that was
juſt entring into the gates of the new <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
the greateſt part of him was now in Heaven;
not a word drop'd from his mouth but it
breathed Chriſt and Heaven. O what incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33153:70"/>
did he give to them which did ſtand by,
to follow hard after God, and to follow Chriſt
in a humble, believing, zealous courſe of life,
and adding one degree of grace to another, and
uſing all diligence to make their Calling and
Ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion ſure; and that then, they alſo ſhould
find, that they ſhould have a glorious paſſage
into a bleſſed Eternity.</p>
               <p>But moſt of his work vvas <hi>Praiſe,</hi> a hundred
times admiring of the bottomleſs love of God
to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O, vvhy me, Lord, vvhy me! And
then he vvould give inſtructions to them that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſee him. He vvas ſcarce ever ſilent,
becauſe the Love of Chriſt and Souls, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him. There vvas ſo much work done for
Chriſt in his laſt hours, that I am ready to
think, he did as much in an hour as ſome do in
a year.</p>
               <p>Every particular perſon had a faithful affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
vvarning. And that good Miniſter,
that vvas ſo much vvith him, uſed this as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to perſwade him to be vvilling to live
a little longer, and to be patient to tarry Gods
leiſure; ſure God hath ſomthing for thee to do
that is yet undone; ſome vvord of exhortation
to ſome poor ſoul, that you have forgot.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, he vvas ſo filled vvith the
love of Chriſt, that he could ſcarce bear ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
from Him a moment. He knew that he
ſhould be capable of bearing of greater Glory
above, than he could hear. It was the Judgment
of ſome that were with him, that his heart was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33153:71"/>
not only habitual, but actually ſet on God all
the day long; and nothing of humane frailty,
that could be thought a ſin, did appear for ſome
time; except it vvere his paſſionate deſire to
die, and difficulty to bring himſelf to be vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſtay below Heaven.</p>
               <p>He vvas wont every evening to take his leave
of his friends, hoping not to ſee them, till the
morning of the Reſurrection; and he deſired
that they would be ſure to make ſure of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
meeting at our Fathers houſe, in that
other World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> cannot relate the twentieth part of that
vvhich deſerved to be vvritten in letters of
Gold. And one that vvas one of the vveakeſt,
ſaid, that he did verily believe, that if we had
been exact in our taking his ſentences, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his daily experiences, he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
a Book could be publiſhed of greater
uſe to the World, next the Bible it ſelf.</p>
               <p>One rare paſſage <hi>I</hi> can't omit, vvhich vvas
this, that vvhen Miniſters or Chriſtians came to
him, he would beg of them, to ſpend all the
time that they had vvith him in Praiſe. <q>O help
me to praiſe God, I have now nothing elſe to
do from this time to Eternity, but to praiſe
and love God. <hi>I</hi> have what my ſoul deſires
upon Earth, <hi>I</hi> can't tell what to pray for but
what <hi>I</hi> have gratiouſly given in. The wants
that are capable of ſupplying in this World,
are ſupplyed. <hi>I</hi> want but one thing, and that is,
<hi>Aſpeedy life to Heaven. I</hi> expect no more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33153:71"/>
here, I can't deſire more, I can't hear more.
O praiſe, praiſe, praiſe that infinite boundleſs
love that hath, to a wonder, looked upon my
ſoul, and done more for me than thouſands of
his dear children. O bleſs the Lord, O my
ſoul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy
name. O help me, help me, O my friends, to
praiſe and admire him that hath done ſuch
aſtoniſhing wonders for my ſoul; he hath
pardoned all my ſins, he hath filled me with
his goodneſs; he hath given me grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and no good thing hath he withheld from
me.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Come, help me with praiſes, all's too little:
come, help me, O ye glorious and mighty
Angels, who are ſo well skilled in this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
work of praiſe. Praiſe him, all ye crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
upon the Earth, let every thing that
hath being, help me to praiſe him. Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah: Praiſe is now
my work, and I ſhall be engaged in this
ſweet imployment for ever. Bring the Bible,
turn to <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> and let us ſing a
<hi>Pſalm</hi> of praiſe; Come let's lift up our voice
in the praiſe of the moſt high, I will ſing
with you as long as my breath doth laſt; and
when I have none, I ſhall do it better.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And then turning to ſome of his friends that
were weeping, he deſired them, rather to rejoyce
than weep upon his account. It may juſtly ſeem
a wonder, how he could ſpeak ſo much as he did,
when he was ſo weak; but the joy of the Lord
did ſtrengthen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:33153:72"/>
In his ſickneſs, the ſcriptures that he took
much delight in, were the fourteenth, fifteenth,
ſixteenth, and ſeventeenth of <hi>John.</hi> The fifty
fourth of <hi>Iſay</hi> was very refreſhing alſo to him;
he would repeat that word <hi>[with everlaſting
mercies will I gather]</hi> with abundance of
joy.</p>
               <p>He commended the ſtudy of the Promiſes to
Believers, and deſired that they would be ſure
to make good their claim to them, and then
they might come to the Wells of Conſolation,
and drink thereof, their fill.</p>
               <p>According to his deſire moſt of the time that
was ſpent with him, was ſpent in Praiſe; and
he would ſtill be calling out, <q>
                     <hi>More Praiſe
ſtill.</hi> O, help me to praiſe him: I have
now nothing elſe to do; I have done with
Prayer, and all other Ordinances; I have
almoſt done converſing with mortals. I ſhall
preſently be beholding Chriſt hinſelf, that
dyed for me, and loved me, and waſhed me
in his Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>I ſhall before a few hours are over, be in
Eternity ſinging the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
Song of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> I ſhall preſently ſtand
upon <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> with an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Angels, and the Spirits of the juſt
made perfect, and Jeſus the mediator of the
New Covenant, I ſhall hear the voice of
much people, and be one amongſt them,
which ſhall ſay Hallelujah, Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Glory,
Honour, and power unto the Lord our God;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33153:72"/>
and again, we ſhall ſay Hallelujah. And yet
a very little while, and I ſhall ſing unto the
<hi>Lamb,</hi> a Song of Praiſe, ſaying, Worthy
art thou to receive Praiſe who wert ſlain,
and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood,
out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and
People, and Nation, and haſt made us unto
our God, Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall
reign with thee for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I ſtand, as it were, with one foot
in Heaven, and the other upon Earth; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
I here the melody of Heaven, and
by Faith, I ſee the Angels waiting to carry
my Soul to the boſom of Jeſus, and I ſhall
be for ever with the Lord in Glory. And who
can chooſe but rejoyce in all this.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In ſeveral times, he ſpake in this Language,
and repeated many of theſe words often, over,
and over again, with far greater affection, than
can be well worded. And I <hi>ſolemnly profeſs,</hi>
that what is here written, is no Hyperbole,
and that the twentieth part of what was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in him is not Recorded, and though we
can't word it exactly as he did, yet you have
the ſubſtance, and many things in his own words
with little or no variation.</p>
               <p>The day before his Death, he looked ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
earneſtly upon his Brother <hi>James,</hi> who
ſtood by him very ſad; of whom he Judged
that he was putting up ſome Ejaculations to
God upon his account, <hi>I thank thee, dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for thy love,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou art now praying
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33153:73"/>
for me, and I know thou loveſt me dearly: but
Chriſt loveth me ten thouſand times more than
thou doſt; Come, and Kiſs me, dear Brother,
before I Die;</hi> And ſo with his cold dying Lips,
he Kiſſed him, and ſaid, <hi>I ſhall go before, and I
hope thou ſhalt follow after to Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he was almoſt always praiſing God,
and exhorting them that were about him to
mind their everlaſting concerns, and ſecure an
intereſt in Chriſt; and though he ſlept but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little for ſome nights; yet he was not in the
leaſt impaired in his intellectuals, but his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were all decent, and becoming a man; and
his Diſcourſe to a ſpiritual underſtanding, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rational, ſolid, divine. And ſo he continued
to the laſt minute of his breath.</p>
               <p>A few hours before his Death, he called all
his relations and Brethren together; that he
might give them one ſolemn Warning more,
and bleſs them, and Pray for them, as his
Breath and Strength would give him leave.
Which he did with abundance of authority, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and ſpirituallity: which take briefly
as it follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He thanked his dear Mother, for her
tender love to him, and deſired that ſhe might
be in travail to ſee Chriſt formed in the ſouls of
the reſt of her Children, and ſee of the travail
of her ſoul, and meet them with joy in that
great day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then,</hi> He charged all his Brethren and Siſters
in general, as they would anſwer it before
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33153:73"/>
God, that they ſhould carry it dutiful to their
dear Mother. As for his eldeſt Brother <hi>William,</hi>
(at whoſe houſe he lay ſick) his prayer vvas,
that he might be ſwallowed up of Chriſt, and
Love to ſouls; and be more and more exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
in his life, and ſucceſsful in his Miniſtry,
and finiſh his courſe vvith joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His next Brothers name vvas</hi> Andrew, <hi>a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of</hi> London, <hi>who was with him and ſaw
him in this triumphing ſtate; but (his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
buſineſs calling him away) he could not
then be by; yet, he vvas not forgot, but he was
thus bleſſed,</hi> The God of Heaven remember my
poor Brother at <hi>London!</hi> The Lord make him
truly rich in giving him the Pearl of great price,
and make him a Fellow-Citizen with the Saints,
and of the Houſe-hold of God; the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him from the ſins of that City, may the
world be kept out of his heart, and Chriſt dwell
there. O that he may be as his name is, a ſtrong
man, and that I may meet him with Joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> he called his next Brother, whoſe name
was <hi>James</hi> (whom he hoped God had made
him a ſpiritual Father to) to whom he thus
addreſſed himſelf; <hi>Brother</hi> James, <hi>I hope the
Lord hath given thee a goodly heritage, the
lines are fallen to thee in pleaſant places; the
Lord is thy portion. I hope the Lord hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee the worth of a Chriſt:</hi> Hold on dear
Brother; Chriſt, Heaven and Glory, are
worth ſtriving for: The Lord give thee more
abundance of his grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:33153:74"/>
                  <hi>Then,</hi> His next Brother <hi>Abraham</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
to whom he ſpake to this purpoſe, <hi>The
bleſſing of the God of</hi> Abraham <hi>reſt upon thee,
the Lord make thee a Father of many ſpiritual
Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His</hi> fifth <hi>Brother, was</hi> Joſeph, <hi>whom he
bleſſed in this manner,</hi> Let him bleſs thee, O
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> that bleſſed him that was ſeparated
from his Brothren. O that his everlaſting
Arms may take hold on thee! It is enough, if
yet thou mayeſt live in his ſight. My heart hath
been working towards thee, poor <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and
I am not without hopes, that the Arms of the
Almighty will mbrace thee. The God of thy
Father, bleſs thee with the bleſſings of Heaven
above.</p>
               <p>The next, <hi>was his Siſter</hi> Mary, <hi>to whom
he ſpoke thus,</hi> Poor Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> thy body is
weak and thy daies will be filled with bitterneſs;
thy name is <hi>Marah,</hi> the Lord ſweeten all with
his Grace and Peace, and give thee health in
thy Soul. <hi>Be</hi> patient, and make ſure of Chriſt,
and all is well.</p>
               <p>Then, <hi>His other Siſter, whoſe name was</hi>
Sarah, <hi>was called; whom he thus bleſſed,</hi> Siſter
<hi>Sarah,</hi> thy body is ſtrong, and healthful; O that
thy Soul may be ſo too! The Lord make thee firſt
a wiſe Virgin, and then a Mother in <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
a pattren of Modeſty, Humility, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then another Brother,</hi> Jacob <hi>was called;
whom he bleſſed after this manner,</hi> The Lord
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33153:74"/>
make thee an Iſraelite indeed in whom there in no
guile! O that thou maiſt learn to wreſtle with
God, and like a Prince, maiſt prevail, and not go
without the bleſſing!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he prayed for his youngeſt Brother</hi>
Benjamin, <hi>who was then but an Infant;</hi> Poor
little <hi>Benjamin,</hi> O that the Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs,
would take care of thee poor Child, that
thou, which never ſaweſt thy Father upon Earth,
maieſt ſee him with joy in Heaven; the Lord be
thy Father, and Portion; maiſt thou prove the
Son of thy Mothers right Hand, and the joy
of her Age!</p>
               <q>
                  <p>O that none of us all, may be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the unconverted in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
O that every one of us may appear
(with our Honoured Father, and dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
before Chriſt with joy that they may ſay
Lord here are we, and the Children which
thou haſt gratiouſly given us. O that we may
live to God here, and live with him hereafter.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And now, my dear Mother, Brethren, and
Siſters, Farewel; I leave you for a while,
and I commend you to God, and to the word
of his grace, which is able to build you up, and
to give you an inheritance among all them
which are ſanctified,</p>
               <p>And now, dear Lord, my work is done, I
have finiſhed my Courſe, I have fought the

               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:33153:75"/>
Then that Godly Miniſter came to give him
his laſt viſit, and to do the office of an inferiour
Angel, to help to convey this bleſſed ſoul to
Glory who was now even upon <hi>Mount Piſga,</hi>
and had a full ſight of that goodly Land at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

               <p>And indeed moſt did, as well as they could
help him in praiſe. So that I never heard, nor
knew more praiſes given to God in one Room,
than in his Chamber.</p>
               <p>A little before he died, in the Prayer, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Praiſes, he was ſo wrapped up with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and joy, that he could ſcarce forbear
ſhouting for joy. In the concluſion of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with abundance of Faith, and fervency, he
ſaid aloud, <hi>Amen, Amen!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now his deſires ſhall ſoon be ſatisfied.
He ſeeth Death coming apace to do his office,
his jaws are looſened more and more, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
greatly; his Hands and Feet are as cold
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33153:75"/>
as clay, and a cold ſweat is upon him: but, O
how glad was he when he felt his Spirit juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going!
Never was Death more welcom to any
mortal, <hi>I</hi> think. Though the pangs of Death
where ſtrong: yet, that far-more-exceeding and
Eternal weight of Glory, made him indure
thoſe bitter paines, with much patience and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
In the extremity of his pains, he deſired
his eldeſt Brother to lay him a little lower, and
to take away one Pillow from him, that he
might die with the more eaſe; His Brother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that he durſt not for a world, do any
thing that might haſten his Death a moment.
Then he was vvell ſatisfied, and did ſweetly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
himſelf up vvholly to Gods diſpoſal; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a few minutes, vvith a ſudden motion gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up all his ſtrength, he gave himſelf a little
turne on one ſide; and in the twinkling of an
eye, departed to the Lord, ſleeping in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now bleſſed ſoul, thy longings are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and thou ſeeſt and feeleſt a thouſand times
more than thou didſt upon Earth, and yet thou
canſt bear it vvith delight, thou art now vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
to thy Fathers houſe by Chriſt, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of thy Soul; now thou haſt heard him
ſay, Come, thou bleſſed of my Father, and,
Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter thou
into the joy of the Lord, and vvear that Crown
vvhich vvas prepared for thee, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World.</p>
               <p>O that all the Relations vvhich thou haſt left
behind thee, may live thy Life, and die thy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33153:76"/>
Death, and live vvith Chriſt, and thee, for
ever and ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
