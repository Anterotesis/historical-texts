         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F in the Church of God,
there were many such as
<hi>Gilpin</hi> was, I should holde
it needlesse, to recommend
the memoriall of this Man
vnto the world. But seeing
there are so few, or (to speak freely what I
think) none at all, who (following the rule of
sorare piety, and sanctimony) have propounded
so notable an example, to all those who doe aspire
to ablessed life, and constantly walked in the
same) I conceiue that such a patterne, would
kindle the zeale of many good men, to walke in
so faire a way, though happily they were not able
to attaine to the perfection thereof. Examples of
<pb facs="tcp:7935:3"/>
the like piety in holy men we haue heard of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in auncient histories, &amp; often read of them in
their writings, but in men of this our age it is
not to be found: For so farre short are we from
this zeale in furtherance of piety, that now it is
to be feared, left Religion (so eagerly and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vndertaken, and professed at first) will come
to be euen <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oathed, and reiected of many, and so
finally come to confusion: seeing experience of
former times hath confirmed this truth vnto vs
that profanesse of life and manners hath drawne
withall the ruine of Religion, thereby to giue vs
a taste now of what it is like to doe hereafter;
Now we make no doubt, but (in so great a decay
of auncient holinesse) <hi>Gilpins</hi> name (like the
Owle amongst other Birds) when it comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
will proue hatefull to many; Yet I held
this no sufficient reason why to suppresse it:
Wherein though some pick out matter for their
derision and scorne, yet other some may meete
with matter for their admiration, others for
their Imitation to work on. As for you (Worthy
Sir) you hereby inioy the harvest of your earnest
and often desire. Many yeeres this writing hath
lyne by me from the common view, the edition
whereof I did therefore of purpose defer, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb facs="tcp:7935:3"/>
them, (who may seeme to stand at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
farre off from this forme of holinesse)
from iudging themselues preiudized hereby: But
as my purpose is to further all, as much as I
might, so it was not to hurt any: If any good or
furtherance redound to any by this my labour, he
must thank you whose importunity hath extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, such as it is, out of my hands. And seeing
you liue in the very place, where <hi>Gilpins</hi> life
and vertue was notoriously famous, and your
selfe haue beene so earnest with me for the same,
this very carefull desire of yours to preserue
and perpetuate <hi>Gilpins</hi> memory, is a most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
proofe and an vndeniable testimony of the
ingenuity and goodnesse of our owne minde:
which worthy disposition of yours hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to dedicate this little work to your name,
to stand for euer as a pledge of your Religious
affection to <hi>Gilpin,</hi> and my true loue vnto you.
So Fare you well.</p>

the County of <hi>Westmorland</hi> in the yeare
of our Lord 1517. of an ancient and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
family, being the son of <hi>Edwin Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi>
the elder brother of which <hi>Edwin</hi> was
slain in the battle of <hi>Bosworth,</hi> being heire
in the fifth descent of <hi>Richard Gilpin,</hi> who in the Raign of
King <hi>Iohn</hi> was enfeoffed in the Lordship of <hi>Kentmire</hi> hall
by the Baron of <hi>Kendall</hi> for his singular deserts both in
peace and warre. This was that <hi>Richard Gilpin</hi> who slew
the wilde Boore, that rageing in the mountaines adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as sometimes did that of <hi>Erimanthus,</hi> had much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged
the Country-people: whence it is that the
<hi>Gilpins</hi> in their Coate Armes giue the Boore. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Bernard Gilpin</hi> was <hi>'Margaret</hi> the Daughter of

            <p>This <hi>Bernard</hi> being yet a very childe gaue testimony
of future holinesse vpon this occasion. A certaine beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Frier the better to dispose the hearts of the people
to liberality towards him, professed himselfe a Zealous
Preacher: how beit the Friers of those dayes, and that
ranke were but a fordid and dishonest people, some of
them, yea the greatest part labouring for a forme of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but denying the power of it in their liues and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7935:6"/>
whereas others of them retained not so much

               </gap>dring companion was
come vpon the Saturday to the house of this <hi>Gilpins</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as purposing to preach the next morrow being the
Lords day; where he was enterteined respectiuely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
for at that time it was a sinne vnpardonable to
offend the least of these locusts. The holy Frier at supper
time eate like a glutton, and like a beast could not giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tossing the pot, vntill being overcome with drinke
he exposed himselfe a shamefull spectacle to so chast and
sober a family. But in the morning as if he had beene
some young Saint lately dropped from heaven, he causeth
the Bell to towle to the Sermon, and in the midst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
blustering out certaine good words, he presumed to
grow hot against some sinnes of the time, and amongst
the rest to thunder bouldly against drunkennesse. Young
<hi>Gilpin</hi> who had but newly got the vse of his tongue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
observed (as it seemed) the hatefull basenesse of the
man by his oversight the night before, and now hearing
the beast cry out so loud against these crimes which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
had so lately beene guilty of, as he was sitting neere
to his Mothers lap in the Church sodainly crieth out in
these words: O Mother, doe you heare how this fellow
dare speak against drunkennesse, who was drunke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
yesternight at our house? The Mother made speed
to stop the childes mouth with her hand, that he might
speake no further. After this the parents of the boy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his disposition by many evident testimonies
were diligently carefull to make him a scholler. He had a
schoolfellow one <hi>Edwin Airy</hi> whom afterwards he loved
intirely for his good disposition and approoved honesty,
but <hi>Gilpin</hi> did farre excell the rest in acutenesse of wit.
Having therefore with great approbation passed his time
in the Grammar-schoole, he is by his parents, (who had
now conceived great hope of their sonne) sent to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
At that time in <hi>Oxford</hi> both learning and Relligion were
in all things out of ioynt, and over-grown with the rust of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7935:6"/>
Barbarisme. And now was young <hi>Gilpi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> sixteene yeares
of age at his comming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> being in the yeare of
our Lord 1533. Being entred in Queenes Colledge, he
profited wondrously in humane learning: He became, as
almost all the good wits of that time very conversant in
the writings of <hi>Erasmus.</hi> He fell very close to the study
Logick and Philosophy, wherein he was observed to
grow excellent, and to beare away the bell in schooles.
He added to this his humane learning, the singular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Greeke and Hebrew, wherein he made vse
of the assistance and friendship of one <hi>Neale,</hi> betwixt
whom and this <hi>Gilpin</hi> was growne much familiarity by
the affinity of their studies. This <hi>Neale</hi> was a Fellow of
New-Colledge, and afterwards Professour of the Hebrew
in <hi>Oxford.</hi> And now after some few yeares carefully spent
in these studies <hi>Gilpin</hi> began to be so famous, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that there was hardly any place of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
for a scholler, whereof the eminency of <hi>Gup<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns</hi>
vertue had not rendred him worthy in the publick esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
There was then an enquiry made for men of
more then ordinary learning and fame, who might make
vp a number of schollers in Christ-Church at that time
newly begun, and honour it with the commendation of
learning. Amongst these was our <hi>Gilpin</hi> one of the first
elected. At that time he had not fully attained to truth
and sincerity in Relligion, as having beene alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for in
those dayes the most part of men did not regulate their
Relligion and peity by the rule of Gods word, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Traditions of their Fathers received from
hand to hand. His minde although disposed to holinesse
did for a while remaine in darknesse, and being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded
with preiudiciall respects laboured vnder the
burthen of superstition not without some shadow of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
being more earnest against vices and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the time, then against the traditions of the Fathers.
Therefore at that time <hi>Gilpin</hi> seemed a great vphoulder
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7935:7"/>
of the Popish Relligion. He held disputation publickly
against <hi>Iohn H<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>per,</hi> who was afterwards Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
and at the last a glorious Martyr of Christ. After
the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, when <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt
was King, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> induced by the piety and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of such a Prince read the Divinity Lecture in
<hi>Oxford.</hi> Against whom the Sophisters indeavoured to
make opposition, <hi>Chedsey, Weston,</hi> and <hi>Morgan,</hi> who
desired also to draw in <hi>Gilpin</hi> on their side, that by his
advise and help they might the more distract <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir:</hi>
and the matter at last came to this push, that <hi>Gilpin</hi>
was produced to hould disputation against the positions
of <hi>Peter Martir.</hi> Vpon occasion of which dispute <hi>Gilpin</hi>
to the end that he might defend his cause in hand adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth
more diligently then ordinary to examine the
Scriptures and the auncient Fathers: And by how much
the more he studied to defend the cause which he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
so much the lesse confidence he began to haue
therein, because he supposed that he ought to stand for
the truth, which he stroue with all his might to discover
and finde out. But whiles he was zealously searching for
the truth, he began by little and little to haue a sight of his
owne errours. Whereupon <hi>Peter Martir</hi> was wont often
to say, that he was not much troubled either for <hi>Weston,
Morgan,</hi> or the like, but as for that <hi>Gilpin,</hi> (saith he) I
am very much mooved concerning him, for he doth and
speaketh all things with an vpright heart. The rest seeme
to me to be men, who regard their bellies most of all, and
being most vnconstant are carried away as it were with
every blast of ambition and covetousnesse. But <hi>Gilpin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

firmely vpon gravity of manners, and the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a most laudable life seemeth to honour with his
owne goodnesse the cause which he vndertaketh. Yea,
and he did often pray vnto God that he would be pleased
at the last to convert vnto his truth the heart of <hi>Gilpin,</hi>
being so inclinable to all honest desires. And doubtlesse
God heard the prayer of <hi>Peter Martir:</hi> For from that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7935:7"/>
time forward <hi>Gilpin</hi> drew neere to the knowledge of the
truth, not vpon a sodaine, but as himselfe confessed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter
Martir</hi> had much illuminated <hi>Oxford</hi> with the
truth of Divinity and the knowledge of humane learning.
Whereupon <hi>Gilpin</hi> resolved more earnestly to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
both by study and prayer to search out the truth. To
which purpose he determined to put in writing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
which had beene betwixt himselfe and <hi>Hooper.</hi>
But in the expressing and vnfoulding of the said contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
while he dwelt for a time vpon an accurate exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the points which he had resolved to confute,
whiles he searcheth them to the bottome, and regulateth
the institutions of the Church to the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without which he well vnderstood that there could
be no true Church at all, he felt himselfe easily overcome,
and was not sory to be overcome by the truth. Those
draughts being found amongst Mr. <hi>Gilpi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in his private deske doe testifie his ingenuous
and free confession, together with the power of the
truth and Gods great mercy in his conversion. Whiles
he curiously pryeth into the Popish relligion, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to acknowledge that very many errours were
crept into the Church which hinder and obs<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure the

not so much as word touching seven Sacraments before
<hi>Peter Lumbard:</hi> and that the vse of the Supper was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

vtterly astonished him. For he had observed out of the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inas,</hi> and the rest, that the rule of faith
was to be drawne onely from the holy Scriptures, but in
the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> he beheld humane traditions made
equall wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the Scriptures. And seeing he vnderstood
these traditions to be nothing else but peevish and crosse
expositions of the holy Scriptures, devised by the Bishops
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thrust in among the Decretall Epistles, as
also that the said Decretall Epistles were meerely feigned
and suppositions, as is confirmed by the testimonies of
many learned men, and indeed by the confession of the
very Papists themselues is acknowledged to be out of all
doubt, this so great a confusion of things being risen in
the Church in these latter ages enforced <hi>Gilpin</hi> now ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desiring nothing so much as true piety, to begin to
doubt whether the Pope might not be that Antichrist
foretould in the Scriptures, and the Popish Church plainly
Antichristian. For what is it to exalt and set vp himselfe
against all that is called God, insomuch that he sitteth as
God in the Temple of God, behaving himselfe as God, if
not this, that the Pope is head of the vniversall Church,
the Lord, the Monarch, and as it were the God thereof?
And that the word of the Pope is defended as the very
word of God? For how shall not he whose word is as
the word of God, be as God, opposing himselfe to God,
and shewing himselfe that he is God? But this word is
called the vnwritten word, or <hi>verbum non script<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is
drawne out of the stinking puddles of the Decretals, that
is to say, patched vp together out of false and fictitious
writings. And this word which is in no respect worthy
to be compared with the word of an honest man, is the
vnwritten word of God, and to be enterteined with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7935:8"/>
same pious affection as are the holy Scriptures. Can An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
when he shall come, (if yet there be another to
come) more grievously wrong and blaspheme Christ and
the holy Scriptures then the Pope doeth? And here at
the last he demurred as in an exceeding great doubt. For
who would haue thought the Pope to be Antichrist? who
durst to speake such a word before <hi>Martin Luther?</hi>
Therefore, thus he argued with himselfe: If the Pope be
Antichrist, I fee not onely probable but even necessary
causes to depart from the Popish Church. But if the Pope
be not Antichrist, I see no sufficient ground for such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
It is not lawfull to make a seperation from
the Church: but we are not onely enioyned to come out
of the Church of Antichrist, but we see the fearefull anger
of the living God, and heare his dreadfull threates thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
out against those who shall remaine in <hi>Babilo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> that
Sinagogue of Antichrist. Forasmuch as a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
speaketh vnto vs. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18 Come out of her my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
&amp; it is denounced that they shal receiue of her plagues
whosoever haue beene partakers of her sinnes. Here
therfore he stoppeda while: because except the Pope were
manifestly detected to be Antichrist, he did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how he might seperate from the Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he applied himselfe by searching, reading, prayer and
meditation, to be resolved of this truth. He observed out
of the Auncient Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

should keepe possession vntill Antichrist shall come, who

                  </gap> first,</hi> he observed
this thing to be fulfilled likewise. He perceived first a
very maine departure of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from her
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7935:9"/>
primitiue simplicity and truth. And secondly, a second
departure or seperation no lesse manifest, to wit, of that
of the Reformed Churches from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> would often say that the Churches of the
Protestants were not able to giue any firme and solid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their seperation besides this, to wit, that the Pope
is Antichrist. For he vnderstood that a departure was
commanded from the Church of Antichrist by that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
iniunction, <hi>Goe out of her my people, and be not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of her sinnes, lest ye reciue also of her plagues,</hi> Revel.
18. 4. In which place <hi>S. lohn</hi> wisely foretelleth that the
people of God should be called out of the Synagogue of
Antichrist: that here was no third thing to be thought
vpon: that either the Church of Christ was not to be
forsaken, or the Pope to be accounted Antichrist, out of
whose Church the Church of God is called forth by an
heavenly voice &amp; command. And now event which is the
most vndoubted interpreter of Prophecies hath prooved
all these things vnto vs: We haue seene already many
Ages agoe that Kingdome taken away, which ruled over
all in the time of the Apostles: and in the roome thereof
an Ecclesiasticall Kingdome erected, such an one as was
never seene in the Church in former Ages. We haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the fearfull departure of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from
the auncient purity and integrity of the Church. We haue
observed and doe daily the people called as it were by a
voice from heaven, comming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is to
say, out of the Church of Antichrist. Our eyes haue seene
these things fulfilled, which we haue read of as being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould
so many Ages agoe. These things mooved the mind
of Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> wonderfully to follow that Church which
was shewed vnto him out of the word of God. The
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> kept the rule of faith intire, vntill that
rule was changed and altered by the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi>
And from that time it seemed vnto him a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
to come out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that so that
Church which is true &amp; called out of from thence might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7935:9"/>
follow the word of God. For this calling out seemed to
point out vnto vs a peculiar estate of the Church: so <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
was called out from <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> the people
of <hi>Israel</hi> were called out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
after the captivity of seventy yeeres: and at the last after
the selfe same manner the Reformed Church called out of
Mysticall <hi>Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> These things
were seene to haue beene brought to passe by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
providence and powerfull hand of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saw that there was a necessity of commi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g out of
her, and that that Apostaticall Church was to be forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
But he did not these things violently, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
In the meane while <hi>Cuthbert Tonstall</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Durham</hi> had a purpose to send Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> to visit the
Churches in forrane parts allowing him meanes for his
travell. This <hi>Tonstall</hi> was Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> Mothers Vncle.
But before he vndertooke his voyage being commanded
to Court he preached before King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Sacriledge; which Sermon is publick in print.
Then he applied his mind to thinke vpon his travell.
Now so it was that he had a Parsonage bestowed vpon
him by the care of his friends. This Parsonage Bishop
<hi>Tonstall</hi> persuaded Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> to keepe still in his hands, as
meanes to furnish him with allowance for his travell,
that he might demeane himselfe more honestly and more
Gentleman like therein. But <hi>Gilpin</hi> who had reteined this
Parsonage but a short while, before he would betake
himselfe to travell called vnto him a friend, whom he
knew to be relligious, and a scholler, and one that would
not be idle in the function of the holy Ministry, and vnto
him he made a resignation of his place but a little while
before bestowed vpon himselfe. Which thing when Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>To<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stat</hi> came to know of, he chid with Mr. <hi>Gilpin:</hi>
And, I (saith he) haue a care of thee, and thou reiectest it
as impertinent. But I tell thee this before hand, that by
these courses thou wilt die a begger. At the first <hi>Gilpin</hi>
indeavoureth with faire language to appease the mind of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7935:10"/>
the Bishop his especiall good friend. Afterwards he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he had left his Parsonage vpon necessity, because
he could not keepe it in his hands with any peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
But (saith the Bishop) thou maist hould it with
a dispensation, and in this case thou shalt be dispensed
withall. But (answered <hi>Gilpin</hi>) the Divell will not be
restrained by any bonds of dispensation from labouring
in mine absence the destruction of my people committed
to my charge: And I feare that when God sha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ue my
turne to make answer that I was dispensed withall whiles
the Divell made havock of my flock. At which answer
the Bishop seemed offended: but having hereby made
triall of the sincerity of <hi>Gilpins</hi> heart he began to vse him
with more and more respect. Yet he did often threaten
him, as Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was wont to say, that <hi>Fathers soule,</hi> (a
familiar word of the Bishops) <hi>Gilp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n</hi> would die a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
In his travell abroad he first visited his brother
<hi>George</hi> at <hi>Mechlin,</hi> who had written vnto him to that
purpose: then he lived for a while at <hi>Lovaine,</hi> and at
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> and at <hi>Paris.</hi> After he was departed out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he received letters a second time from his brother
<hi>George,</hi> whereby he was directed to meet him at <hi>Mec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
because he had something to deliver vnto him by
word of mouth that he could not conveniently write. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were met, Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> vnderstood the reasons
why he had sent for him thither to be nothing else, but
onely to persuade him to take vpon him a Parsonage,
which might affoord him maintenance while he should
visite forraigne Vniversities. <hi>Gilpin</hi> now seemed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be in a strait, for he knew that he had lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

that in this matter his brother was put vpon him
by the Bishop. At last therefore he writes backe to the

                        </gap>.</hi> For now I confesse I haue
discussed it with all the learned, but especially with the
holy Prophets, and with the most auncient and most
godly writers since the time of our Saviour: so that I am
fully resolved so long as I liue never to burden my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in this case, nor to keepe a living in mine owne
charge with condition to liue from it. He answered that
your Lordship had written vnto him that you would
gladly conferre a living vpon me, and that your Lordship
and mine other friends, whereof himselfe was one, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
mee too scrupulous in conscience in this case. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I answered, if I be somewhat too scrupulous, (as I
thinke I am not) yet it is a matter of that nature, that I
had rather be little too strict, then to giue my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
too much scope herein. Forasmuch as I am once
perswaded, that I shall not offend God in refusing such a
living as I cannot be resident vpon: so long as I doe not
censure evill of other men, as I hope I never shall: yea I
pray daily for all those who haue the care of soules, that
they may be able so to giue an account vnto God of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7935:11"/>
charge committed vnto them as may be most for the
glory of God and the edification of his Church. He tould
me also that your Lordship would not confer any charge
vpon me but such a one as should be served as well, or
perhaps better in mine absence, then if I were there my
selfe. Whereunto I answered, that I doubted not but that
there might be in <hi>England</hi> a great number of men farre
more able then my selfe to take the cure vpon them: And
therefore I wish aboue all things that they may retaine
both the place and the benefit, and feede both the bodies
and the soules as I suppose all good Pastors bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to doe. But for mine owne part I cannot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
reape benefit from that place, wherein another
man bestoweth his indeavours. For though any other
should teach and preach for me as constantly and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
as ever Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> did, yet cannot I thinke
my selfe discharged by another mans paines-taking. But
if yet I should be persuaded thus to offer violence to my
conscience vpon condition to remaine either here or in
any other Vniversity, my disquiet of conscience would
never permit me to profit in my study. At his present,
I praise God, I haue obtained a comfortable privacy in
my studies neere to a Monastery of Minorite Friers, so
that I haue opportunity to make vse of an excellent libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of theirs so often as I will. I frequent the company of
the best schollers, nor was I ever more desirous to learne.
Hereupon being given to vnderstand by my brother
<hi>George,</hi> that your Lordship had some thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
a living vpon me, which thing might interrupt
the course of my studies, I emboldened my selfe (vpon
the experience which I haue had of your Lordships loue
towards me) to vnlock the closet of my thoughts vnto
your goodnesse freely: Humbly beseeching that your
Lordship will be pleased to permit me to live free from a
Pastorall charge, that I may the more quietly apply my
studies. And forasmuch as I vnderstand that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is sollicitous, how I should be provided for, if God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7935:11"/>
should call your Lordship, (who are now well in yeares)
out of this world, I beseech you that the thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may no more disturbe you. For if I shall be brought
low in meanes, I doubt not but in short time to be able to
obtaine some lecture either in this Vniversity or else
where, where I shall not lose my time, a course which is
much more pleasing vnto me, then if I should take vpon
me a Pastorall charge. I beseech Christ preserue your
Lordship.</p>

            <p>Now tell me, what one of all those gaping rookes of our
time hath indeavoured with more art to acquire the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
this man to decline a spirituall living? At his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
over into the parts beyond the Seas, he resided for
the most part at <hi>Lovaine,</hi> afterwards he went to <hi>Paris.</hi>
Whiles he abode in <hi>Paris,</hi> Bishop <hi>Tonstall</hi> was carefull
that a certaine booke which himselfe had written at that
time concerning the truth of the body &amp; blood of Christ
our Lord in the Eucharist should be published in print
by the diligence of Mr. <hi>Gilpin.</hi> I am not ignorant that some
Papists haue obiected to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> that the same worke
was by him corrupted co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the mind of the Author.
And even in mine hearing, when after these things I was
a scholler vnder him at <hi>Houghto<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Francis Wickliff:</hi> gaue
notice vnto Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> what was mattered touching the
corrupt edition: Whereupon he having disprooved that
suspicion by many reasons, at the last produced the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Cuthbert Tonstall,</hi> wherein the Bishop gaue him
very great thankes, because he had beene both faithfull
and diligent in the edition of that worke. At <hi>Paris</hi> Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> resided in the house of <hi>Vascos<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nus,</hi> and conversed
with learned men. And whiles he asked the opinions of
learned men concerning these things which had troubled
his minde, for the most part they answered him in that
manner, not as if they regarded the pacification of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which he aimed at onely, but the establishment
of the traditions of the Church. At that time was <hi>Neal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:7935:12"/>
at <hi>Paris</hi> also, with whom Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> dealt somewhat
freely, that both of them together might ioyne in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of the truth. They had by chance some discourse tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the adoration of Images; Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was much
troubled hearing the Papists condemne Idolatry in their
discourses and yet permitting to the people every where
the adoration of Images. He demaunded with what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of conscience any man could bow himselfe before an
Image: and is not this (saith he) the idolatry forbidden
in the second commandement? This did Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of him the rather, because he observed the man a
little too much addicted to the Popish opinions. <hi>Neale</hi>
answered with that vsuall distinction of an Idol and an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
That the Images of the Saints were not Idols, and
so consequently that the worshipping of their Images
was no idolatry. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> replyed, there is no mention
of an Idol in the second commandement, but there is a
prohibition of bowing before a g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aven Image, or the
likenesse of any thing that is in heaven aboue, or in the
earth beneath, or in the waters vnder the earth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they are, we are forbidden to fall downe before
the likenesse of them. And what (saith he) maketh an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol.
The workeman frameth the similitude of some man,
the graven Image is not an Idol, but ado<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation maketh it
an Idol. Therefore the Apostle saith, that an Idol is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because there is but one God. In the opinion of
the person adoring it seemeth to be something, but that
which the fancy of the party adoring apprehendeth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dced
nothing in the world: therefore Idolatry is when
the worship due to God onely is bestowed vpon the
creature. But whosoever in prayer boweth downe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before any creature whatsoever giveth vnto the
creature the worship due to God alone. The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God forbiddeth vs to make vnto our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
graven Image, or the likenesse of any creature. But
they make it vnto themselues who make it for a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vse. We are also forbidden to bow downe ourselues
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7935:12"/>
before any such creature; for those who doe so, doe
serue and worship the same creature. And in this place
that distinction of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> is frivolous, which
are words of the same signification, forasmuch as that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
is taken away by the express words of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement;
<hi>Thou shalt not bow down vnto them.</hi> So that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
downe vnto them is forbidden, notwithstanding
we see it practised every where. To this <hi>Neale</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that the ordinances of the Church are not to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without mature deliberation, <hi>Gilpin</hi> replyeth that it
is not in ourpower to alter the ordinances of the Church.
But seeing I cannot alter things already determined in
the Church, it remaineth that I especially indeavour
to charge my selfe, and to draw neere to the sincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, as his grace shall inable me.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> did often professe that when he lived amongst
the Papists, he had observed many things which had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
his heart from that religion. He vnderstood
that a mans chiefest comfort consisted in the Article of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
which Article he saw so obscured in Popery
that true consolation was vtterly excluded. Therefore he
did with all diligence enquire into the Scriptures and
writings of the Fachers. Returning into <hi>England</hi> in the
dayes of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> he beheld to his great griefe the
Church oppressed with blood and fire: and being placed
by Bishop <hi>Tonstall</hi> in the Rectory of <hi>Essingdon,</hi> he began
to preach the word of God, and sharply to taxe some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which then raigned in the Church. He propounded
the doctrine of salvation plainly and soundly, which thing
procured him many back friends, especially among the
Clergy whose faults he had touched to the quick. There
was at that time among the Clergy of the Bishoprick of
<hi>Durham</hi> one <hi>Tonstall</hi> Parson of a Church in that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
This man was very hot against <hi>Gilpin,</hi> &amp; accused him
often to the Bishop as an heretick, and one that deserved
to be burnt as other hereticks were. But the Bishop could
not indure to shed blood, and therefore dealt mildly with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7935:13"/>
him, and preserved him from the proiects of his enemies.
I haue heard <hi>Anthony Carleton</hi> relate, (and he at that time
lived in the Bishops house) that the Bishops Chaplains
at a certaine time had some discourse with <hi>Gilpin</hi> about
<hi>Luther:</hi> and that one of them had asked him what hee
thought of <hi>Luther</hi> and his writings. <hi>Gilpin</hi> confessed that
had not read the writings of <hi>Luther,</hi> I propounded vnto
my selfe, (said he) this course; first of all to search the
Scriptures diligently, and to be acquainted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of the Fathers vpon them. As for the writings
of the <hi>Neoterickes,</hi> I haue onely looked vpon them: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I refuse them not when and where they agree with
the Auncients. One of them commended Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and said, it would be well with the Church, if
all men would duely respect the writings of the Fathers:
for then the vpstart opinions of late writers would not
so much disturbe the Church, such as are of these of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
But <hi>Gilpin</hi> answered, if <hi>Neoterickes</hi> and late writers
produce the opinions of the auncient Fathers, the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the men is not to be disdained, but the antiquity of
the doctrine is to be reverenced.</p>
            <p>They hereupon subtilly draw on <hi>Gilpin</hi> into a disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning the Sacrament of the Altar; propounding
therein two questions, the one concerning the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
the other concerning Transubstantiation. Touching
the Reall presence <hi>Gilpin</hi> confessed that he had no very
strong Argument wherewith in his iudgement he might
oppose the Reall presence: For I suppose, (saith he) that
therein lieth hid a great mystery, such a one as is aboue
my capacity, rather to be adored then disputed vpon.
They asked then what he thought of Transubstantiation?
He answered that there was no necessity why we should
beleeue those things which haue no solid foundation in
the word of God. Doe you not then beleeue, (said they)
as the Church beleeues? <hi>Gilpin</hi> replyeth that the Church
had not alwayes held that as an Article of faith: I am
(saith he) of the Catholick faith, and the Catholick faith
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7935:13"/>
changeth not. But in this point I see alterations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such
as the Catholicke faith is not capable of. They deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what alterations in faith he had observed touching
the Sacrament of the Altar. He replyeth: I doe not finde
that in the Church in former ages, there was any thing
spoken, or writen about Transubstantiation. <hi>Peter Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>
was either the first, or at least one of the first that
brought in the alteration of the auncient faith. And
what doe you your selues thinke? Is the bread in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
converted into the flesh and blood of
Christ? They answer, that they beleeue so absolutely.
But, saith <hi>Gilpin, Peter Lumbard</hi> who was the first man
that made an alteration of the faith of our forefathers in
this point, himselfe did not beleeue as you doe. For
in his fourth booke the eleuenth distinction, F. thus
he hath it: there is no Transubstantiation but of bread
into flesh, and wine into blood. And if that be true,
then doubtlesse it followes consequently, that in the
Transubstantiation of the bread there is no blood. And
now (saith he) how will you reconcile these thinges.
They stood at a stand, as hauing nothing to answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the words of <hi>Lumbard</hi> plainely deny that in the
Transubstantiated bread can be any blood, or in the wine
his flesh. Whom when <hi>Gilpin</hi> had obserued to stagger
in this point, take notice now (saith he) of the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabillity
of the Catholicke faith: we see the alteration
of Transubstantiation. For when <hi>Lumbard</hi> had broached
this doctrine, that there was a kinde of change, he
would haue it non otherwise vnderstood then thus: that
the bread onely should be changed into flesh, and the
wine onely into blood.</p>
            <p>Nor did men at that time dreame of any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
in the Sacrament of the Altar, vntill the fiction
of concomitancy was broached by <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> He
was a man that vnderstood well the difficulty of this
point, and therefore he vnderpropped it with <hi>Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ancy,</hi>
that forsooth by reason of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>comitancy</hi> there is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7935:14"/>
both flesh and blood in the Transubstantiated bread.
But these are the inventions of later men, whereas the
Catholicke relligion abhorreth invented, alterations in
matters of faith. While they were houlding this dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
without speakeing aloud, because they were close
at the Bishops backe, who at that time sate before the
fire, for it was in the winter season: the Bishop leaned
his chaire somewhat backwards, and harkened what
they said. And when they had done speaking, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
turning to his Chaplaines, vseth these words. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
soule, let him alone, for he hath more learning then
you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest he liued at <hi>Essingdon,</hi> he preached the word
of God constantly to the people. Now so it was that the
<hi>Archdeaconry</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> was annexed to the rectory of
<hi>Essingdon.</hi> Therevpon Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> for a time supplyed
both places. And when by chance he had notice that
the Bishop was so carefull of him, that he had a purpose
to encrease his maintenance, he made answer that he
was provided for sufficiently and even somewhat more
then sufficient already; and desired the Bishop that he
might haue his good leaue to resigne either the Rectory
or the Archdeacons place: for (saith he) the one of
them will be sufficient, me thinkes both together are
to heauie a burthen for me. Hereat ihe Bishop seemed
to be mooued with him, and said: haue nor I tould thee
before hand, that thou wilt die a begger? I found them
both combined; and combined I will leaue them.</p>
            <p>Not long after he bestowed vpon Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> the
Rectory of <hi>Houghton</hi> being a very large Parish contayning
14. Villages with very large possessions, Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
setled at <hi>Houghton</hi> persevered most constantly in the
duties of the Ministry, and repaired the decayed houses.
His Parsonage house seemed like a Bishops Pallace; nor
shall a man lightly finde one Bishops house amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
worthy to be compared to this house of his, if he
consider the variety of buildings, and neatnesse of the
s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ituation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:7935:14"/>
Whiles Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> liued at <hi>Houghton</hi> he was touched
with a care not of that parish onely but of many more:
for he sawe and was much greiued to see many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
through the distast of impropriation, as they call
it, to be even dispersed and destitute of Pastors. For
the parsonages being in the possession of Laymen, there
remained not maintenance for a Minister, for the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
sought out for poore base preistes, who were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to read prayers to the people morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
nor did the one vse to require, or they take care
to performe any more. This desolation of the Church,
and ignorance of the common sort much troubled the
holy heart of Mr. <hi>Gilpin.</hi> He therefore purposed with
himselfe, with asmuch care and vigilancy as he could,
not to make vp the breach wholy (for that was a thing
impossible for him to dooe) but to doe this owne duty
to the best of his indeauours, that the truth may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated,
and God glorified. This desolation of the
congregations appeared most of all in <hi>Northumb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rland</hi>
and the ports adioyning which are called <hi>Riddesdale,</hi> and
<hi>Tindale.</hi> For in these quarters, especially, in that time,
the word of God was neuer heard of to be preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them but by Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> Ministry. So that once
a yeare it was his custome to make a iourney amongst
them. For which purpose he would vsually take the
opportunity of Christmas Holidayes, when in respect
of frost and snowe other men were loth to travell. That
time he liked best, because then there came many Holy-dayes
together, &amp; the people would more vsually assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vpon the Holy-dayes, whereas at other times they
neither would come together so easily, nor so often.</p>
            <p>He got himselfe a great deale of estimation and respect
amongst this people both by preaching and by distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of monies to the poore in his Iourney, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
benighted before he was well aware, and forced
to lodge in the snowe all night. In which extremity, he
commanded <hi>William Airy,</hi> who for the most part at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7935:15"/>
vpon him to tro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the horses vp and downe and
neither to permit them nor himselfe to stand still, whiles
he himselfe in the meane while did bestirre himselfe
sometimes running, sometimes walking, as not able to
stand still for could. At home his daily care was for the
discharge of his Ministry and provision for the poore.
Now there was in this towne of <hi>Houghton</hi> a streete of
poore people: for their releife he tooke order that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thursday through the yeare a very great pot should
be providedfull of boyled meat purposely for the poore.
And not at <hi>Houghton</hi> alone, but even wheresoever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tunity
presented it selfe, he was carefull for the poore,
insomuch that by the common consent of the Country
people he was stiled a father of the poore.</p>
            <p>Vpon a time as he was returning home vpon a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
there was a certaine husbandman at plow, in whose
teame of horse one vpon a sodaine fell downe, whether
with being overwrought or vpon some disease it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.
The husbandman and those who were with
him did their best to raise the horse againe with all the
strength they had: but it was in vaine, for the horse
was dead. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> passing by accidentally stayed to
obserue the issue of the matter: And perceiving that the
horse could not be raised againe, and that the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was exceedingly grieved for the death of his beast,
and that he cryed out he was even vndone by that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
accident, he commanded his man to alight from
the horse he had vnder him, and patiently to carry the
saddle and bridle to the next towne, and to giue to the
poore man the horse whereon he rode. The husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
thereupon cryed out, Alas Sir, I am not able to pay
you the price of so good an horse. Be of good cheare
(saith Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>) thou shalt never pay me for him till I
demand it, in the meane while goe on with thy worke.
Yea, and many a time as he travailed was he accustomed
thus to help poore men. When at any time he chanced
to meete any naked poore, he would put off part of his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7935:15"/>
apparrell to cover their nakednesse: and at his table he
vsually fed many poore persons. When that blessed
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of never dying memory after the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
times of her sisters Raigne came to the Crowne, the
scarsity of learned men who were able to preach the
word of God, mooved not onely many religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but even the very Counsell of the Queene to seeke
a salue for this sore by all the meanes they could. Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> observing the laudable endeavours of many in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the Churches want in this kinde, himselfe also
was exceeding studious to doe what good he could
possibly in his owne charge. Whereupon he began to
conceiue thoughts of a seminary of good literature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a
Grammer-schoole; and builded a schoole allowing main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for a Master and Vsher. Himselfe also made
choice out of the same schoole of such as he liked<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>best to
be privately instructed by himselfe. Which resolution
of his much benefited Mr. <hi>Gilpnn</hi> himselfe, and the whole
Church of God all <hi>England</hi> over. For in that schoole of
his were bred very many learned men, who very much
graced the Church by their indeavours and vprightnesse
of life. There was great resort of schollers to that
schoole of his, many of whom were boorded in the
towne, and many at Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> house. He boorded the
sonnes of Knights and Esquires at a small rate: those
who were of his kindred were free: yea and he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
poore, mens sonnes vpon whom he bestowed both
meate, and drinke, and cloth, and education. Whereby
Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> schoole was every where spoken of to his
credit, but himselfe much more. Out of this schoole of
his he sent daily very many to both Vniversities, vnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
whereof he also allowed maintenance in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
at his owne cost and charges. And now while
he was wholly taken vp with these imployments, glory
and reputation which followeth him that flyeth from it,
and flyeth from him that had pursued it, had made the
name of Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> most renowned, insomuch that he was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7935:16"/>
vvas not onely honoured among the Fathers of the
Clergy, but amongst all the Nobility of the Kingdome.
Amongst the Nobles at Court the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> vvas
one that marvelously respected Mr. <hi>Gilpin.</hi> This Earle
earnestly desired of the Queene that the Bishoprick of
<hi>Carlile,</hi> at that time vacant vpon the death of <hi>Owen Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe,</hi>
should be bestovved vpon Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it. And thereupon the Earle dispatcheth his letters
to Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> to gather that povver of election vvhich
is termed <hi>Congedes<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

together vvith the <hi>Congedeslier,</hi> sent back a messenger
out of hand vvith letters to the Earle, vvherein having
returned all hearty tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kes to the Queene, and to the
Earle, he humbly beseecheth the Earle to be mediatour
to the Queene for him, and to get him excused as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Bishoprick, alledging that he was best acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his owne strength, and conscious to himselfe of
his owne insufficiency for the discharge of so great a
place: if in the meane-while he could be any other way
serviceable to the Church, he would be diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in some meaner imployment. At that time was <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win
Sandes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> a man venerable for his
approved wisdome, learning, and holinesse of life, who
vvas aftervvards translated to <hi>London,</hi> and thence to
<hi>Yorke.</hi> This Bishop hapned to be in <hi>London</hi> at the same
time when the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> was busy about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> to a Bishoprick: and he, either by
the persuasion of the Earle, or out of the intire loue
which he bore to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> (for he was neere a kin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him) dispatched letters to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> whereby he
persuadeth him to accept of, and to keep the Bishoprick
thus offered. The Letter was found amongst Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi>
papers in these words.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> returneth thankes to the reverend Bishop
his kinseman. But as touching the Bishoprick, he
desireth to be excused, and in that resolution he became
vnmooueable. And many there were who thought him
blameworthy because he had so stiffely reiected a Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick.
But amongst some Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> reputation seemed
to grow greater by this refusall, then if he had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the offer. I remember that I my selfe haue heard him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7935:17"/>
discoursing amongst his friends touching this occasion,
when one of them asked him vpon what grounds he had
so stiffely refused a Bishoprick: to whom he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he refused not so much the Bishopricke, as
the inconvenience of the place. For (saith he) if I had
beene chosen in this kinde to any Bishopricke elsewhere
I would not haue refused it, but in that place I haue
beene willing to avoide the trouble of it, seeing I had
there many of my freinds and kindred, at whom I must
conniue in many thinges, not without hurt to my selfe,
or else deny them many thinges not without offence to
them: which difficulties I haue easily avoided by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall

            <p>Vpon this refusall of Mr. <hi>Gilpins,</hi> Doctor <hi>Iohn B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

learned and religious man was made choice of for the
place: but whether he had it conferred vpon him vpon
the same termes at it was proffered to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> that
no diminution should be made of any part thereof that
I know not. Not long after this his refusall of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
he was set vpon by another request, to witt,
that he would take vpon him to be Provost of Queenes
Colledge, in <hi>Oxford,</hi> wherevnto he was chosen, or at

            <p>ANd all this while Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> seemed even to supply

of other Churches, by erecting of schooles, and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
men learned and fitting for the holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

of such dilligence, and abundance of all things with
so compleat service in the entertainment of so great a
stranger, and so vnlooked for a guest, being now ready
to depart thence, he spoke on this wise: that he had
heard much be the report of others touching Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi>
but what he now had seene and tried was much more
then that which he had formerly heard. Therefore
speaking in very friendly manner to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> he said:
Sir, if you haue any occasion or suite at Court or before
the Counsell, I pray you to make vse of me as a mediator
for you.</p>
            <p>The honourable Baron being returned towards <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
when he came to the hill called <hi>Rai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ton</hi> hill, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
his eye vpon the whole champion Country
which he had now passed, he looked backe very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
both vpon Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> house and the scituation
thereof; and vseth these words, I doe not blame this
man (saith he) for refusing a Bishopricke: for what
doth he want that a Bishopricke could more enrich him
withall? Besides that he is free from the greater waight
of cares. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> did not omit to visite the people
of <hi>Ridsdale</hi> and <hi>Tindal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> once every yeare. Amongst
whom he was esteemed a very Prophet, and little lesse
then adored by that halfe barbarous &amp; rusti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k people. It
happened by chance that whiles Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> preacht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, a certaine good-fellow had stolne away
Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> horses: vpon the missing whereof, there
is Hue and Cry raised through the Country, that Mr.
<hi>Gilpins</hi> horses were stolne, and must be searched for with
all possible diligence. The fellow who had stolne them
so soone as he heare that they were Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> horses
(for he knew not whose they were when he took them
away) was in great feare and trembling. The theft did
not much trouble his conscience, but when he heard
the name of Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> it cast hin into trouble and
distraction of heart. Therefore in much trembling, and
with all the speede he could he brought backe Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:7935:18"/>
horses, and humly craved the pardon and benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Father <hi>Gilpin:</hi> and protested that after it came
to his knowledge that they were Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> horses he
was afraid to be thrust downe quicke into Hell, if hee
should doe him any wrong.</p>
            <p>Vppon a time when Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was in these parts
at a towne called <hi>Rothbury,</hi> there was a pestilent facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongst some of them who were wont to resort to
that Church. The men being bloodily minded practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a bloody manner of revenge, termed by them Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-feod.
If the faction on the one side did perhaps come
to the Church, the other side kept away because they
were not accustomed to meet to gether without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
Now so it was that when Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was in the
pulpit in that Church, both parties came to Church in
the presence of Mr. <hi>Gilpin;</hi> and both of them stood, the
one of them in the vpper part of the Church, or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
the other in the body thereof armed with swords
and iavelins in their hands. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> somewhat moved
with this vnaccustomed spectacle goeth on neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in his Sermon: and now a second time their weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make a clashing sound, and the one side drew neerer
to the other, so that they were in danger to fall to blowes
in the middest of the Church. Herevpon Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
downe from the pulpit, and stepping to the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
of either faction, first of all he appeased the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.
Next, he labowreth to establishe peace betwixt
them, but he could not prevaile in that: onely they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to keepe the peace vnbroken so long as Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>
should remaine in the Church. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> seeing he could
not vtterly extinguish the hatred which was now inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
betwixt them, desired them that yet they would
forbeare hostility so long as he should remaine in those
quarters: and this they consented vnto. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>
therevpon goeth vp into the pulpit againe (for he had
not made an end of his Sermon) and spent the rest of the
allotted time which remained in in disgracing that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7935:19"/>
and bloody custome of theirs, and (if it were
possible) in the vtter banishing of it for ever. So often as
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> came into those parts afterwardes, if any man
amongst them stood in feare of a deadly foe, he resorted
vsually where Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was, supposing himselfe more
safe in his company, then if he went with a guard.</p>
            <p>Vpon a certaine Lords-day Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> comming to a
Church in those parts before the people were assembled,
and walking vp and down therein espied a gloue hanged
on high in the Church. Wherevpon he demanded of
the Sexton, what should be the meanning thereof, and
wherefore it hanged in that place? The Sexton maketh
answer that it was a gloue of one of the Parish who had
hanged it vp there as a challenge to his enemy, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby that he was ready to enter combate with his
enemy hand to hand, or with any one else who should
dare to take downe that challenge. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sexton by some meanes or other to take it down.
Not I Sir, (replied the Sexton) I dare doe no such thing.
But (said Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>) if thou wilt but bring me hither
a long staffe, I will take it downe my selfe: and so when
a long stafe was brought, Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> tooke downe the
gloue and put it vp in his bosom. By and by came the
people to Church in abundance, and Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> when
he saw his time went vp into the pulpit: In his Sermon
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e took occasion to reprooue these in huma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e challenges,
and rebuked them sharpely for that custome which they
had of making challenges by the hanging vp of a gloue,
I heare saith he, that there is one amongst you, who even
in this sacred place hath hanged vp a gloue to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
&amp; threatneth to enter into combate with whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall take it downe. Behold, I haue taken it downe
my selfe, and at that word plucking out the gloue shewed
it openly, and then instructed them how vnbeseeming
those barbarous conditions were for any man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himselfe a Christian, and so laboured to perswade
them to a reconciliation, and to the practise of mutuall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7935:19"/>
loue and charity amongst themselues. After his Sermon
it was his custome to distribute money amongst the
poorer sorte, and many times to visit them who were im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prisoned,
and after he had preached vnto them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to bestow money largely amongst the prisoners:
many of whom hee brought home to repentance for
their former passed life, and to honest conversation: and
for many who were condemned to die he procured par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and saued their liues.</p>
            <p>When we were children a rebellion was raised in the
North by the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
Which Mr, <hi>Gilpin</hi> perceiued before hand by certaine
evident signes. And because he vnderstood that in so
trouble-some a time he should want power to defend
himselfe and his owne, he conceived thoughts of going
aside for a while. Therefore after a speech made to the
Maisters and Schollers that they should demeane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
carefully and peaceably vntill his returne, himselfe
went to <hi>Oxford:</hi> residing there vntill the Queens Army
vnder the command of the Earle of <hi>Suff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x</hi> should make
speed to <hi>Durham</hi> for discomfiture of the rebels. The
rebels were now within <hi>Durham,</hi> but at the report of
the Queens Army they dispersed themselues and fled.
After they were put to flight, there was sharpe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
proceedings against the simpler sort, whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
had drawne to their faction vnder pretence of seru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Queene: for the silly people were sollicited as
for the Queenes service, the rebels in all places giuing
it out that they stood for the Queene. During the time
that the rebels had possession of <hi>Durham</hi> with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Masse was sung in the Cathedrall Church day by
day; some of them flew out as farre as <hi>Houghton.</hi> There
they found Mr. <hi>Gilpi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> barnes full of corne, young cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
ready fatted, and many things provided for hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:
but they make wast of all, selling the corne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
the fatted ware, and basely making havocke of
all those things which Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> had provided for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7935:20"/>
and honest vses. There was among them one fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow
whom Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> had sometimes saued from the
gallowes, and this knaue was the wickedest of all the
rest in rioting away Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> goods. Now after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
were dispersed, &amp; proceeding made against the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
people somewhat more sharply then was fitting, Sir
<hi>George Bowes,</hi> who was constituted marshall for that
purpose, Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> who was now come home againe
begged the liues of many by his intercession: for hee
knew well enough that many men were drawne as it
were into the snare, not wilfully, but through ignorance,
and through the fraudulent practises of others. And now
the whole trouble being over, Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> returneth to
his accustomed indeavours of studies and charity. There
was betwixt the most learned and reverend <hi>Iames Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington</hi>
then Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> more
then ordinary friendship through their long acquaintanc
and pari<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie of dispositions. The Bishop was wont of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
to visitt Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> at his house, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
also incited the rather by Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> example buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a schoole at <hi>Lancester,</hi> and brought the statutes of
the schoole to be over looked and examined by Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin.</hi>
He vvas also familiarly acquainted vvith, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaylously
respected <hi>Thomas Levery</hi> a godly and learned

published a booke of <hi>Thomas Cartwrights</hi> touching Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall

by many in those dayes. <hi>William Bir<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Durham,</hi> a man learned, but too hastily inclining to that
forme of discipline vvhich <hi>Cartwright</hi> had proposed sent
one of these bookes to Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> to read over; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
him to looke over the booke, and that he
vvould be pleased to vvrit backe his opinion concerning
the same. <hi>Birch</hi> seemed to be somevvhat in hast vpon
the matter: for very shortly after he vvrote againe to
Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> requesting him to send over his book vvith
his censure of it, before M. <hi>Gilpin</hi> had read it all over.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7935:20"/>
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> did accordingly send backe the booke, and a
letter to Mr. <hi>Birch,</hi> and as he had an excellent veine in
versifying, in the end of his letter he wrote certaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which are these that follow,

            <p>THere came vnto Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> a certaine <hi>Cambridge</hi>
man, who seemed a very great Scholler, and hee
dealt earnestly with Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> touching the discipline
and reformation of the Church. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> tould him
that he could not allowe that an human invention should
take place in the Church in stead of a divine institution.
And how? Doe you thinke, saith the man that this
forme of discipline is an human invention? I am, saith
Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> altogether of that mind. And as many as
dilligently turned over the writings of the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will be of mine opinion. I suspect that forme of
discipline which appeareth not to haue beene received in
any auncient Church. But yet, saith the man, latter men
doe see many things which those auncient fathers sawe
not: and the present Church seemeth better provided
of many ingenious and industrious men. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
somewhat moved at that word, and replyed: I for
my part do not hould the vertues of the latter men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be compared to the infirmities of the fathers.
The other man made answer that hee supposed Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> to be in an errour in that point. But Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>
vsed these words purposely because he perceived that
this fellow had a strong conceit of I know not what rare
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7935:21"/>
vertues in himselfe, which opinion Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to roote out of him. <hi>George Gilpin</hi> who had most
elegantly translated out of low Dutch into English the

Beehiue of the Romane Church came out of the low
Countries vnto <hi>Bernard.</hi> This man was brother to
<hi>Bernard</hi> and Agent for the Queene with the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> amongst whom he left behind him a famous
memory of himselfe for his singular wisdome. And
hauing liued for some space most louingly with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bernard</hi> being about to returne from <hi>Holland,</hi> he had
advised with the Queene and Councell of the Kingdome
touching the affaires which he had to treat vpon with
the States in the Queenes name. The Earles of <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
and <hi>Bedford</hi> exceedingly favored the two brothers,
<hi>George</hi> for his wisdome in affaires of state, and <hi>Bernard</hi>
for his holinesse of life. These requested <hi>George</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his brother <hi>Bernard</hi> to declare in wrighting the
motiues and meanes of his conversion from the Romane
superstition to the light of the Gospell. To which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> answered that he would do it plainely
and sincerely without any dissimulation. The copy of
his letter to that purpose I found among his papers to be
thus.</p>

                  <p>YOu doe request (brother) that I should relate vnto
you somewhat at large the manner and meanes of
my conversion from superstition to the light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
a thing, which I suppose, is not vnknowne vnto
you to haue beene a worke of many yeares: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
as time and health shall giue leaue I will conceale
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7935:21"/>
nothing from you herein. I will confesse mine owne
shame to the confusion of the Divell; I will say with the
Apostle, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 13. I was received to mercy, for I did it
ignorantly.</hi> In the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> I was drawne
to dispute against certaine positions of <hi>Peter Martirs:</hi>
howbeit out of a naturall inclination I haue alwayes so
farre as I could avoided controversies and disputations.
And when I was but a young Divine, and had found out
by holding that disputation that the foundation where to
I trusted was not so solid as I formerly supposed it, I
thereupon began somewhat seriously to read over the
Scriptures and writings of the Fathers, that I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
my selfe in my received opinions. But God freed
my minde from that preiudicate conceit by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and the zeale which I had for the Popish religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to coole in me every day more and more. But on
the other side I felt certaine sparkling desires which vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to search out the truth. In the meane while I
repaired to the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> that I might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instructed; who tolde me, that in the matter of
Transubstantiation, <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Pope the third of that
name had done vnadvisedly, seeing he had made it an
Article of faith. And he did further confesse that the
Pope had committed a great fault in that touching Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
and other things he had taken no better order for
the quiet of the Church. Afterwards I conferred with
Doctor <hi>Redman,</hi> in whom I reposed much hope in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his eminent vertues, and great schollership. He
affirmed vnto me that the booke of Common Prayer,
was an holy booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and agreeable to the Gospell. These
things cast me into many distractiue thoughts. After this
one of the fellowes of Queenes Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> told
me that he heard Doctour <hi>Chedsey</hi> saying among his
friends, that it must come to this point, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
must grant vs a reall presence of Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and we likewise giue way vnto them in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Transubstantiation, and so we shall accord.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7935:22"/>
Doctor <hi>Weston</hi> made a long Oration touching the Supper
of the Lord to bee administred vnder both kindes.
Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> tolde me that Doctor <hi>War<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> a man most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for life and learning had affirmed vnto him that
the principall sacrifice of the Church of God was the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of thanksgiving. This was his answer when I
had demanded of him what could be said for the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Masse. The most learned Bishops in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
at that time confuted the primacy of the Pope both
in words and writing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> being newly returned home out of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
in a long and famous oration so plainly set out and
painted to the life the Friers and vnlearned Bishops, who
had met at the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in their greene gownes,
that it abated in me and in very many others a great deale
of that opinion and confidence which we had reposed in
<hi>Generall Councels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things and many others gaue me occasion dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to search the Scriptures and the writings of the
Fathers: whence I had began to obserue very many and
very great abuses, and some enormities oftentimes vsed,
and as oft defended in Popery, and to iudge reformation
necessary on the other part. Whiles I went on in this
manner, I was overruled by the persuasions of some
friends to accept of a Parsonage; whereunto I was
drawne against my will. If I offended God in vndertaking
the charge before I was a more sufficient scholler, and
better grounded in Religion, I aske God forgiuenesse.
Nor doe I doubt but I haue obtained mercy in his sight.
Before I was entred vpon that Parsonage I preacht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
King <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Greenwich</hi> a Sermon which had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of many good men.</p>

for me from the King licence as a generall Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
throughout the Kingdome so long as the King lived
which time fell out to be not much aboue the space of
halfe a yeare after. In my Sermons I handled those points
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7935:22"/>
wherein I was best grounded, and wherein I was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
resolved o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t of the Scriptures. I examined
the Masse; and the abuse so farre as I was able to obserue
at that time consisted in the too much reverence, and
grosser worship of the people; because I beleeved not
Transubstantiation. Neverthelesse at some times I read
Masse, but seldome and privately. Then was I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

                        </gap>,</hi> and in some other places
very grosse Idolatry. This thing did more and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange
me from the Popish religion: most of all because
the learneder Papists did in their disputations in schooles
deny, the adoration of images, yet allowed the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
abuse thereof in their Churches. And now whiles
with all earnestnesse I advised with the holy Scriptures,
and writings of the Fathers, I observed many things
alienated mine heart from the Popish Church. I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that Church notable corruptions of the doctrine
of the Bible, many things in the Sacraments instituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Scripture, some Sacraments lately added: In the
Sacrament of the Supper the one halfe taken away: the
fiction of Transubstantiation brought in: traditions of
the Church made equall to the word of God, and to the
holy Scriptures, and to be imbraced with the same pious
affection: the worship of Images brought into the
Church: all things performed in the Church before the
people in an vnknowne language: but aboue all the rest
the question concerning Antichrist troubled me most,
because it seemed not to me a safe thing to make a sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Popish Church, except I were first fully
resolved that the Pope is Antichrist: and in this point I
cannot easily expresse with how many difficulties and
distractions I was daily opposed. Afterwards I was sent
for home againe by the Bishop, who conferred vpon me
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7935:23"/>
the Rectory of <hi>Essi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>don:</hi> where when I had indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be constant in preaching, I observed that I had vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a sodaine procured to my selfe many and heavy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thereby: for I had preached against plurality of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,
and Non-residency. Mine adversaries cryed out
that all such as broached that doctrine would prooue he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
quickly. Others were much displeased with me
for that I had preached repentance &amp; salvation by Christ.
They laid to my charge that I did not make whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
about Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Holy water,
the worshipping of Images, the invocation of Saints,
and the like; which they could never heare come from
me. And by how much the people were more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to resort to my Sermons, so much the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
they tooke offence at mee and hated mee. A
very small matter brought me into danger. An honest
Matron, because in her pangs of childbirth she had often
called vpon God, was grievously checked by the other
good women, because she had not called vpon the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin. To whom she made answer: I haue heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(saith she) a certaine famous Preacher, one <hi>Gilpin,</hi> a man
that came lately out of <hi>France,</hi> if he will advise me to
call vpon the Saints, I will take his counsell in that point.
I tolde them that I durst not persuade any one to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Saints, but that those who call onely vpon God
for help in all their da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gers, haue a commandement from
God so to doe, and a firme promise for the infallible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
of their conscience. This occasion stirred me vp
many foes. In the meane while I often conversed wit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
learned men, my very loving friends and kindred. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
how it came to paste that there was no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of so many abuses touching Images, Reliques,
Pilgrimages, buying and selling of Masses and Trentalls,
with many other errours which in the time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Papists had not onely confessed to be superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but had promised reformation of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that it was meete the Church should be purged of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7935:23"/>
them: which thing they said they would gladly doe, if
ever the power came into their hands againe. When I
asked of them in which of these points reformation
should begin, in expectation of which thing I returned
from <hi>Paris</hi> the more willingly, answer was made vnto
me, that no way m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st be given to the ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
If (say they) we once confesse any errours at all,
they will straightway cry out that many other things
also are worthy to be reformed, besides those which we
shall yeeld vnto them, and so they will be still growing
vpon vs, that we shall never haue done reforming. These
things wounded me grievously, and draue me to seeke
out for peace of conscience. After these things, having
preached two or three Sermons at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> I began to
explaine my conscience more at large, where there were
gathered twelue or thirteene Articles against me, and
sent to the Bishop. And now had mine adversaries of
the Clergy whom I had grievously provoked, obtained
what they had long looked for. Nor would they giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
vntill the Bishop had called me before their faces, to
examine me in the point of the Sacrament. The Bishop
shewed me as much favour, I suppose, as he durst. In
Transubstantiation he would not trouble me, onely he
inquired concerning the reall presence, which I granted,
and so was freed out of that danger. And as touching the
reall presence, I found not my selfe fully resolved. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that therein lay hid a mystery aboue my capacity.
Neverthelesse my conscience did sometimes chide me,
for that I had before them yeelded in expresse words to
a point which seemed vnto me doubtfull. But I hoped
that God would pardon mine ig<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orance, and in time
bring me to a greater light of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The winter following Q<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eene <hi>Mary</hi> departed this
life, and then I had begun to explaine my minde more
fully. For before that time (for I must needes confesse
the truth) weaknesse, ignorance, and the terrours of mine
adversaries had somewhat restrained me. About <hi>Easter</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:7935:24"/>
I was accused to the Bishop vpon many Articles, both
out of the Diocesse of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and of <hi>Durham,</hi> all which
things neverthelesse hurt me no further then thus, that
the Bishop incited thereto by the complaints of mine
adversaries struck my name out of his last Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
forasmuch as the Plebeians and ordinary sort of
people were extremely offended with me. Now I in
that I lost the Bishops Exequutorship found my selfe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of a great burthen, and was glad thereof. But as for
the favour of the multitude, I hoped in time through the
goodnesse of God to recover it againe, that my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
might profit the more to edification, for otherwise
I never desired the loue of the vulgar. In harvest came
the visitors, and Doctor <hi>Sandes</hi> sent for me to <hi>Aukland,</hi>
and appointed me both time and place to preach against
the primacy of <hi>Durham.</hi> But he himselfe preaching the
day before, whiles he seemed vtterly to deny a reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
had so wounded my tender conscience, that the
night following I could not sleep at all; and I was much
troubled in my minde, whether I should preach the next
day or not. At the last I went almost out of my bed into
the pulpit, where, I know not how it happened, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was through my disquiet of conscience, or want
of sleep, or in that I had offended God to goe vp against
my conscience, but me thought I did never feele such a
want of vtterance, and yet in my iudgement I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
matter enough, and waighty reasons. The next day
all the Ministers in the Diocesse were met to subscribe.
Now so it was that in a point or two of the Articles my
conscience did not appeare to me so well resolved, as I
could haue wished. Therefore I stept a little out of the
way hoping that I might escape from being called. But
when my Curate came to the booke, who, I supposed,
would never haue stood at it by reason of some discourse
I had formerly with him, he withdrew himselfe as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to subscribe; and thereupon I was called for, and
the booke held out vnto me; when straightwayes I had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7935:24"/>
these thoughts in my selfe: My greatest confidence is
reposed in this religion, because it giveth glory to God,
and authority to the word of God for the rooting out of
superstition, and humane doctrines. Onely mine heart
doubted in certaine points of smaller consequence,
which God (as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

many and grievous temptations, which would not let

together with the pride and carnall liberty, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <p>THou seest (Reader) Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> vpright dealing:
He speaketh nothing of his owne vertues, but he is
wholly taken vp with the acknowledgement and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
of his weaknesses. Perhaps some Criticks will
laugh at the simplicity of the man, but I herein admire
his Apostolick spirit, who after the example of blessed
<hi>Paul</hi> dare not boast of himselfe, but boasteth in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
that Christ may dwell in him. Neverthelesse
howsoever he is wholly taken vp with declaration of
his owne infirmities, and hath of set purpose spoke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his owne vertues, yet this is apparant that he
was twice accused by his back-friends to Bishop <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall</hi>
in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary:</hi> But Bishop <hi>Tonstall</hi>
who abhorred to shed blood was a sweet defence to Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> against the divers informations of his enemies. At
the last he was accused to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nner</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> who
gaue order to a Messenger for his apprehension. Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi>
perceived the imminent danger, (for he had notice
that a Messenger was dispatched to attach his body) and
perceiving the reliefe which he had found in <hi>Tonstalls</hi>
clemency would now faile him, he prepared his holy
soule for Martyrdome: commanding <hi>William Airy</hi> the
Steward of his house to provide him a long garment,
that he might goe the more comely to the stake. But the
sodaine death of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> freed the man from this
danger. After the publication of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi>
when by chance there happened some discourse betwixt
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> and <hi>Thomas Levery,</hi> and <hi>Levery</hi> had asked the
question what Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> thought touching that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7935:26"/>
The Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (saith he)
haue done the Church a very shrewd turne: for that
which was indifferent before times they leaue not so
now. I remember that Bishop <hi>Tonstall</hi> often tolde me
that Pope <hi>Inn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cent</hi> the third had done very vnadvisedly,
in that he had made the opinion of Transubstantiation
an Article of faith: seeing in former times it was free
to holde or refuse that opinion. Moreover the Bishop
tolde me that he did not doubt but that himselfe, if he
had beene in that Councell, could haue prevailed with
the Pope to haue let that businesse alone. And what he
iudged concerning Transubstantiation, the same may a
man resolue touching all Popery after the publication of
the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> for that which was indifferent
before, now they doe not suffer so to be. Therefore I
suppose that the times of our forefathers though oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with much ignorance were happier farre then the
ensuing Ages can be vnder the Papists: because they
haue now altered in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> many institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the auncient Church. For whereas they haue
placed a part of the rule of faith in Traditions, that is
a thing which was never done in the Church before.
Many things which were permitted to be taught in the
Church formerly touching Iustification and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not now tolerated. And vpon these occasions
the Fathers of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> haue laid vpon other
Churches a necessity of making a seperation from the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> wherein me thinks that they haue not
dealt advisedly: For the Church is thereby distracted
into differences and factions, and whatsoever was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
indifferent in doubtfull points, the Fathers of
<hi>Tren<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> haue made it all necessary, and tooke vpon them a
very hard taske. There were some Papists, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> quite alienated from the Popish religion
which he had first beene of in the dayes of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in his youth, tooke many courses to haue recalled
him, if they could possibly. Amongst them was one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7935:26"/>
               <hi>Thomas Gelthrop</hi> a man well descended, and a kinsman of
Mr. <hi>Gilpins.</hi> This man wrote a letter to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he dealt earnestly with him not to forsake the religion
of his forefathers. In that letter <hi>Gelthrop</hi> amongst other
things inserted these words. <q>You haue a great and a
good report both at <hi>London</hi> and in all other places: And
I am of this opinion that either you will doe the Church
a great deale of good if you adhere vnto it, or else (which
God forbid) you will stirre vp more mischiefe in the
Church then ever <hi>Arrius</hi> did. That sinne aboundeth it
is not the fault of the Masse or of the Mattins, but the
pernicious doctrine and filthy life of the Clergy and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
They haue already reformed the Communion,
and haue published a booke of the reformed Leiturgy.
But this reformation hath not removed the evill, because
we see the people growne farre worse then before.</q> These
things I found out amongst M. <hi>Gilpins</hi> papers, but I could
not possibly get any more out of them, the most of them
were so exceeding worne and defaced.</p>
            <p>Vnto this letter Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> made answer, which I
found entire. The Letter had this superscription.</p>
            <q>To his Coozen THOMAS GELTHROP.</q>
            <p>And thus it was.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>GRace and peace. Your large Letter was brought
vnto me, when I had small leisure to answer it, as
he can tell you who bringeth back this vnto you. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I thought it not fit to let him come back without an
answer, albeit the conclusion of your letter gaue me
small incouragement to write. For who would take the
paines to write vnto you, seeing you are fully resolved
and determined, as you affirme, never to be perswaded
from your opinions by any argument a man can bring?
It could not chuse but be a most grieuous thing to the
Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> vvhen he cryed out to the people, <hi>Hear
the word of the Lord,</hi> that they should ansvver vvith a
stiffe necke, <hi>we will not heare.</hi> But let vs leaue these things
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7935:27"/>
to the divine operation, vvhich is able to mollifie your
heart, and to open the eares of the deafe Adder that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the same against the voice of the charmer, charme
he never so wisely. You looke back vpon the ages pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
you doe well, if also you looke back to the times
of the Patriarkes, the Prophets, of Christ, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and other holy men, with whom if you advise
without preiudice of blinded affection, they will lead
you farre from that blindnesse, from that errour, I may
well say, from that grosse idolatry, which crept into the
Church while men slept. Whereas you are grieved at
the fall of Monasteries and suppression of Abbeys, I am
sory you should be blinded in this case. For very many
of your owne religion haue confessed that they could not
possibly subsist any longer, because the cry of them like
the cry of <hi>Sodome</hi> was ascended into the eares of God.
Their Sodomiticall crimes were so manifest that they
could not be longer concealed, the Lord could indure
those wicked men no longer. But if you call to minde
what enemies those men were to the Ministry of the
word of God, taking away most sacrilegiously the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
allowed for the Ministers of the word, hardly
leaving in the most Countries any one Rectory vnspoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
you would easily iudge that those men could not
possibly stand and flourish any longer. This is the fruit
of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, and the whole word of God truely
preached, that God shall destroy that wicked one with
the breath of his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you say that he which commeth to God
must belieue, I wish you would consider that thing right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that faith and religion can never finde peace and quiet
but in the sacred word of God. Faith commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and hearing by the word of God. Whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that whoso beleeveth in Buls, Indulgences, Images,
and many other vaine constitutions of men cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
haue true faith. All those things vanish away, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the word of God hath power and authority. That
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7935:27"/>
rest which you say that you finde in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
your Catholick Church forsooth, if you take not the
better heed, will vndoubtedly faile you in your greatest
necessity. You say that you doe not finde in that religion
any thing opposite to the Gospell. But if you looke nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into it, you may see in that religion the word of
God reiected, the golden Legends and Festivalls, with
Bulls, Indulgences, and many other things of that sort
for the most part obtruded vpon men in stead of the
word of God. But here is a large field and I want leisure.
I hope I shall get opportunity to write vnto you more at
large concerning these things. God open your eyes that
you may see the abomination of that Citty which is
built vpon seven hills: <hi>Apoc</hi> 17. Looke over <hi>Hierome</hi>
vpon that place. If in that Church the Sacraments be
corrupted, will you reiect the grace of God when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
the eyes of his servants to reforme these corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Beware of that fearefull sentence of Saint <hi>lohn:
He that is filthy let him be filthy still.</hi> You alledge that if
you should now begin to drink of another cup, &amp;c. quite
forgetting that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> your selfe and all
other Laymen are vtterly excluded from the cup, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the manifest commandement of God, <hi>Drinke ye
all of this.</hi> Your learnedest Doctors of <hi>Lovaine</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others were not able to defend so great an abuse of the

we haue forsaken so great abuses, superstitions and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
to the end that we might draw neere to the sacred
word of God, and holy institutions of Christ, we can
appeale from your vncharitable preiudice, and are able to

the Lord which iudgeth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you alledge that it is a perillous thing to heare our

7. and stopped their eares. So spoke <hi>Amazia</hi> touching
<hi>Amos</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Amos.</hi> 7. The land is not able to
beare all his words. Like vnto which are those whom
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7935:28"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> compareth to the deafe Adder which stoppeth
her eares, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. Like vnto whom were many in the
time of the Apostles vnto whom the Gospell was hid,
in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds
of vnbelievers, that the light of the Gospell should not
shine vpon them. Touching those Romane thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps
there is no great cause why we should be afraid,
those bugbeares were invented to affright children, they
are not to be feared by men of years. <hi>Erasmus</hi> calleth
them <hi>Brutafulmina,</hi> foolish false-fires. If there were in
the Pope and his Cardinalls who curse vs with so much
bitternesse but the least resemblance of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi>
had they the servent charity of those holy men, and their
exquisite diligence to feed the flocke of Christ day and
night, with other Apostolick vertues: then were their
threats to be feared: but they haue changed the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Peter</hi> into the pride of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the poverty and
daily labours of the Apostles into the riches of <hi>Cresus,</hi>
and into the lazinesse and luxury of <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi> To
co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>clude, what agreement is there betwixt light and
darknesse. God hath promised in the second of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
that he will curse their blessings, or turne their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
into curses, who consider not in their hearts to giue
glory vnto his name. See <hi>Hierom</hi> vpon the third of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say:</hi>
Those which call you blessed, seduce you: How
many thousands of men are seduced by Indulgences,
which are extended to many thousands of years, if the
price be according? The world seeth and is grieved to
beholde how the brothers of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Hospitall, had
granted licences to those who had laid violent hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselues to enioy the buriall of other Christians
with many such like flattering fictions. As touching the
life of your grandmother, I never heard bur well; but I
suppose she was a superstitious woman. If she kept you
at home with her out of her tender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and naturall affection
onely, and not to prevent your knowledge of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
I shall desire pardon for my mistaking. Yet many
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7935:28"/>
men are persuaded that she and your vncles withheld
both from your selfe and your sisters a great part of the
portion which was left vnto you. But let these things
passe, seeing I haue not beene able to effect, nor haue ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
as yet any thing for you, that money which was
given to me by legacy, I will bestow vpon your sister, if
it please her, with some addition also, because I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
she hath more need of it. As concerning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, God is my witnesse, that it is the whole
desire of mine heart, and mine assured confidence, that I
shall die a member of it. But if I shall be so farre misled
by the pompous outside of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
those intollerable abuses, superstitions, and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
which so many wayes rob God of his honour,
I should not believe my selfe a member of Iesus Christ.
If you approoue of none interpretation of Scriptures,
but what proceeds from <hi>Rome,</hi> you may easily affirme
whatsoever you please. There is nothing so absurd, or so
contrary to the truth of the eternall God, which may not
be wrested by their corrupt glosses, as it may seeme to
serue to a wicked cause. With such kinde of men is no
disputation to be held. As for that which you inferre
touching <hi>Arrius,</hi> and the rest of that ranke, it is nothing
to the purpose. For all the writings of the Prophets, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with other manifest Scriptures, whereunto we
ought to haue recourse in doubts of this nature, and to
be concluded by them, doe evidently confound <hi>Arrius,</hi>
and all the rest his partakers. <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> which
the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> , is confirmed by very many
evident testimonies of Scripture. But so is not Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
which hath so molested the braines of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Occam, Biel,</hi> and all the schoole Divines, that many
a time they are shrowdly put to it, what they had best
stay for removing the absurdities which arise therefrom.
Therefore it is apparant that it is a meere fiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any foundation of Scripture. So that <hi>Scotus,</hi> (as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Tonstall</hi> did many times ingenuously confesse) was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7935:29"/>
of opinion that the Church might better, and with
more ease make vse of some more commodious expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those words in the holy Supper. And the Bishop
was of the minde that we ought to speake reverently of
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the opinion of Transubstantiation might well be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
This thing also the same Bishop <hi>Tonstall</hi> was
wont to affirme both in words and writings, that <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the third knew not what he did when he put Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
among the Articles of faith, and he said
that <hi>Innocentius</hi> wanted learned men about him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
(saith the Bishop) if I had beene of his Councell,
I make no doubt but I might haue beene able to haue
disswaded him from that resolution. When Mr.
<hi>Cheasey</hi> said that the Catholicks should doe well to
giue way in the Article of Transubstantiation, I heard
not himselfe speak the words, but one which heard him
tolde me. Whereas you write touching the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him and others, truly I am of the opinion, that as
for this present life, they liue most quietly. Nor doe I
think that themselues could haue made choice of a more
retired kinde of life, if the sting of conscience trouble
them not, for maintaining a cause that is not good, but
built vpon the sand. But if you will needes haue it that
men must of necessity conniue at the beastly and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
liues of so many Romane Bishops, aboue thirty,
you may also finde fault with our Saviour himselfe, for
discovering so plainly the pernicious enormities, both of
the Pharises, (who in those times were accounted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footh
the holy Fathers) and also of their Fathers then
dead: you may blame also the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> who will
not haue evill men to be called good, denouncing a curse
against that man, who calleth him holy that is not holy:
find fault also with Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> who calleth them the
Ministers of Antichrist. Those things which other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men haue written to this purpose, doe worthily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
vs. He blameth those things openly concerning
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7935:29"/>
which he confesseth that it is a shame to speake: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
not hidden things (saith he) but I reprooue things
publickely knowne: vnto which thing we are even ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by the commandement of God. <hi>Esaia. 58. 1. Shew
my people their sinnes:</hi> whereas you say that fiue Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are rejected by vs, you doe not say well, rejected,
for wee vse them reverently, according to the word of
God, nor doe we take away the name of a Sacrament,
as the word Sacrament is generally vsed, as was the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of feete, and many other things which may retaine
the name of a Sacrament in generall, as also they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Fathers. But the auncient Fathers and some
Schoole men doe a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Eucharist are properly called Sacraments: It is also the
testimony of <hi>Bessarion:</hi> We read (saith he) of these two
Sacraments onely manifestly delivered in the Gospell. I
wonder at you that you doe so wrest the words of Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> to such a sence, as that out of those words all the
Ceremonies of the Masse may be established: whereas
you cannot be ignorant, that the greatest part of them
hath ben added many ages after by the Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Wee reade also that the Apostles consecrated with the
words of the Gospell, and with the Lords prayer.
Moreover, whereas Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had even at that time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
already, that the people should not only eate the
bread with the Minister (as his owne words doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly

                  <p>You say that the Scriptures allow prayer for the dead,
and that you know this well enough. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7935:30"/>
saith, that the booke of <hi>Maccha<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

not to establish doctrine. You alledge that Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> doubted in many places whether there be a
Purgatorie. If that be a doubtfull poynt then it is not to
be obtruded as an Article of faith; but to be left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
For, faith is a substance: <hi>Heb</hi> 11. 1 and faith ought
not to wauer, saith Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
writeth concerning <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that amongst the
Auncients, there was either little or no mention of it.
And so long as there was no care taken for <hi>Prgatorie,</hi>
no man sought after <hi>Indulgences.</hi> And so those innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gaynes by Pardons were never knowne before Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
was found out. What shall we now say to bee
meant by those words of Saint <hi>Paul, esteeming gayne
godline,</hi> if this be not it. This <hi>Mart</hi> hath fed and still
doth feed many idle bellyes, who stoutly driue away the
word of God to the best of their abillity that they may
not loose their Swine. Howbeit at the last the truth shall
prevaile, how ever these men haue conspired together.</p>
                  <p>As touching that which you adde concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
of <hi>Saints,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> exhorteth vs rather
to stand to the Scriptures, then either to his writings,
or the writings of others: and not to build vpon his
writings without the authoritie of Scriptures. And
surely in this poynt my conscience is resolued, that there
is not one poynt of all these which are controverted,
that is proved by more evident testimonyes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then this, that God alone is to be prayed vnto, and
by one mediator, namely <hi>Iesus Christ. Rom. 10. 13. How
shall they call on him in whome they haue not beleeued?</hi> We
must beleeue in God onely, therefore he onely is to bee
prayed vnto: That distinction touching <hi>Invocation</hi> and
<hi>Advocation,</hi> that albeit you allow not the <hi>Invocation</hi> of
<hi>Saints,</hi> at the least you allow their <hi>advocation,</hi> is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
because, as those men robb Christ of his honour,
who seeke another mediator, so these are no lesse injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Christ, who seeke another <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>,</hi> because we

                        </gap>.</hi>
and <hi>Esai.</hi> 63: he affirmeth that <hi>Abraham knoweth vs not.</hi>
Truely I assure my selfe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the
faithfull is no lesse a Saint, then any other of the Saints
in heaven. You say, you beleeue the Communion of
Saints, which we also doe all of vs beleeue: but you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
thereupon, that you vnderstand not how there can
be a Communion of Saints: if the Saints departed doe
not pray for vs, and we call vpon them for assistance.
But the Church of Christ vnderstandeth the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints farre otherwise. For in the vsuall phrase of
Scripture, Saints are not vnderstood to be those that are
departed, and whose soules are in heauen, but those who
are living here on the earth. Nor shall you almost tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the whole Scripture of the Old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
find the name of Saint giuen to any man, but that
thereby is vnderstood a Saint living heere on the earth.
Yea, sometimes the Scripture speaketh more expressely
as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 3: <hi>to the</hi> Saints <hi>which are on the earth: all
my delight is in them.</hi> If any man ever had or could haue
a Communion with the Saints in heaven, surely <hi>Dauid</hi>
had it. But he expoundeth the communion wherewith
he was acquainted, that is the communion of Saints on
earth. So Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> expoundeth this poynt. 1 <hi>Ioh:</hi> 1, 3.
<hi>What we have seene and known: that declare we vnto you,
that yee also may have communion with vs, and that our
communion may be with God, and with his son Iesus Christ.</hi>
First, all the Church of Christ haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the
Apostolick Church, that you may haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with
vs: Secondly, this communion of Saints shall consist in
the preaching of the word, and in the participation of
diverse gifts for the edification of the Church in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
and private prayers. Thirdly, but in powering out
of our prayers we haue communion with the Father &amp;
the Sonne, or with the Father by the Sonne. Heere is
no mention at all, no respect had to the Saints departed.
This communion according to the words of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7935:31"/>
extendeth no further then to the Church on earth.
The Saints departed are not called in Scripture simply
Saints, but the <hi>Congregation of the first borne in heauen,
and the spirits of iust and perfect men. Heb:</hi> 12. 23. After
this life we shall haue communion with them, but as for
those who require this communion with them in this
life, let them either product from Scripture what they
say, or let them heare that sentence of our blessed Lord,
<hi>In vaine doe ye worship me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teaching for doctrines the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men. Math:</hi> 15 9.</p>
                  <p>I confesse that if you haue respect to the vse of this
our age, or some former ones, the deceased are called
Saints, but it is not the custome of this or that age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
the rule of the holy Scripture that is propounded for
our imitation. But what doe we contending about this
points? Those men who stand so hard for <hi>Invocation of
Saints</hi> shall grant it vs to be a thing indifferent: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is the safest way to goe to the fountaine of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it selfe, and let the streames alone. Nor suffer those
men to perswade you, who say that they detract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from God, by detracting their prayers to the
Saints: For no man can detract from God more then he
who transferreth the worship due to God alone vnto
the creature. For invocation is a part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
and this worship hee communicateth to no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who will not give his glory to another.</p>
                  <p>As for your Arguments touching <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi>
(which point of fasting God forbid that either I or any
one should deny, yea rather we exhort all persons to
the practise of it, onely we desire to haue the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

other Arguments touching Relicks, and Exorcismes in

it leadeth to Idolatry is the signe of a false Prophet: <hi>Deut</hi>

            </floatingText>
            <p>SO long as Bishop <hi>Pilkinton</hi> lived, Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> had a
most kind friend of him, after whose decease <hi>Richard
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7935:32"/>
Bar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> succeeded in the Bishopricke. This man was
somewhat offended with Mr. <hi>Gilpin:</hi> And hereby han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
a story which I must fetch somewhat farre. Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi>
was accustomed sometimes to ride to <hi>Oxford,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in his younger time when he was able to indure
travell. Now it happened vpon a time as he was vpon
his way towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he espyed by the way side
a youth one while walking and another while running.
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> demanded of him who he was, whence he
came, and whither he was going. He made answer that
he came out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and that he was bound for <hi>Oxford</hi>
with intent to be a scholler. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> examineth the
youth, and findeth him a prompt scholler in the Latine,
and that he had a little smattering of the Greeke. And
wilt thou (saith Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>) be contented to goe with
me? I will provide for thee. The youth was contented:
whereupon Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> tooke him along with him first
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Houghton,</hi> where he profited
exceedingly both in Greeke and Hebrew: whom Mr.
<hi>Gilpin</hi> at the last sent to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And this was that
famous <hi>Hugh Bro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ghton,</hi> so exceeding apt in learning the
Greeke and Hebrew, but a man of a most inconstant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For when Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> grew olde, whether it was
in expectation of Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> Parsonage, or for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, it is reported that he procured Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> to
be troubled and molested by the Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi>
Now so it fell out, that whiles the Bishops minde began
to be turned from Mr. <hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pin</hi> the Bishop sendeth vnto
him and giveth him notice that it is his pleasure to have
him to preach at a visitation in time and place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Which thing fell out at the very same instant when
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was preparing for his accustomed Northerne
journey, to wit, amongst them of <hi>Riddesdale</hi> and <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale:</hi>
wherefore he dispatched his servant vnto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to make his excuse vnto him, and to informe his
Lordship the reason of his purposed journey; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Bishop that he be pleased to appoint some other
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7935:32"/>
to preach at the visitation, seeing there were many who
would be willing enough to preach at the visitation, but
that there was not a man who would performe that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among those borders if he neglected it: and that at
any other time he would be ready to performe his duty.
The servant having beene with the Bishop returneth to
his Master, who demanded of him whether hee had
made his excuse to the Bishop: I haue, faith he: well,
and what (saith Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>) was the Bishops answer?
Whereunto the servant answered, the Bishop made no
reply, but held his peace. <hi>Qui tacet, consent<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>detur:</hi>
saith Mr. <hi>Gilpin:</hi> He that replyeth, not seemes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Therefore Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> went on with his purposed
progresse. Which thing so soone as the Bishop vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
he presently suspended Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> from all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
imployment. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> returning home fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himselfe suspended, a thing that he little dreamed
of, yet he tooke it patiently. The Bishop having notice
that Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> was returned home, sendeth vnto him
instantly warning him to meete him and the rest of the
Clergy at <hi>Chester.</hi> M. <hi>Gilpin</hi> being come to <hi>Chester</hi> findeth
there the Bishop with many of the Clergy, who were
all commanded to assemble themselues in the Church.
The Bishop had at that time a brother of his owne one
<hi>Iohn Barnes</hi> who was his Chancellour, a man, of whom
it is hard to say whether he was more lustfull or more
coveto<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: who whereas he should haue beene the man
that ought to haue reformed many enormities in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse,
was indeed the authour of them, permitting base
and dishonest persons to escape <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cotfree for a piece of
money, so that the Bishop had a very ill report every
where. When they were all met together the Bishop
calleth Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> vnto him, and saith, Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> I must
haue you preach to day. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> desired to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
for I came not (saith he) provided; and moreover
I am suspended. But I can free you (saith the Bishop)
from that suspension, and doe now free you. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:7935:33"/>
replyed, that he durst not goe vp into the pulpit vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
But we know (saith the Bishop) that you are
never vnprovided, for you haue now gotten such an
habit of preaching, that you are able to performe it,
if you please, even vpon the sodaine. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
vnmooveable in his resolution, answering that
God was not so to be tempted, saying that it was well
with him, if he were able to performe any thing in this
kinde vpon mature deliberation. Whereunto the Bishop
replyed, I command you vpon your Canonicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to goe vp into the pulpit forthwith. Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
the time a little while, answered: Well sir, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it can be none otherwise, your Lordships will be
done: and after a little pause began his sermon. As hee
was in his sermon hee observed some extraordinarily
prepared who wrote all he spoke. But yet hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in his sermon, vntill he came to a word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and reprehension of vices. At the last he proceeded
to the reproofe of those enormities which then raigned
in that Diocesse, and were every where spoken of. And
now, saith he, Reverend Father, my speech must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to your Fatherhood. God hath exalted you to be
Bishop of this Diocesse, and God requireth an account of
your government therof: a reformation of all those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which are amisse in this Church is expected at your
hands, and an account thereof is required. And now lest
perhaps, while it is apparant that so many enormities
are committed every where, your Lordship should make
answer that you had no notice of them given you, neither
did these things ever come to your knowledge, (which
words Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> used, because hee knew well enough
that this was the Bishops vsuall answer, that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
men made any complaints against the evill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Chancellour, the Bishop was accustomed to
say, alas, these things I never knew of; what is done can
not be vndone; I will take a better order in these matters
hereafter, if any such shall come to my knowledge.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7935:33"/>
said Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> I bring these things to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this day: Let not your Lordship say these crimes
haue beene committed by the fault of others without
your knowledge: for whatsoever either your selfe shall
doe in person, or suffer through your connivency to be
done by others, is wholly your owne. Therefore in the
presence of God, his Angels, and men, I pronounce your
Fatherhood to be the authour of all these evills, yea and
in that strict day of the generall account I shall be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to testifie against you that all these things haue come
to your knowledge by my meanes; and all these men
shall beare witnesse hereof who haue heard me speaking
vnto you this day. Now whiles that Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out these things, hee did thereby put all his friends
into a great feare, and distrust what would become of
him. Therefore when he had made an end of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
his friends came about him and tolde him with
teares, that now at last the Bishop had gotten that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against him which hee had long desired and
sought for: you haue, say they, put a sword into his
hand to slay you: if heretofore he hath beene offended
with you without a cause, what may you now expect
from him, who being provoked shall make vse of his
owne power to injure you by right or wrong? To whom
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> made answer, saying: be not afraid: The Lord
God overruleth vs all; so that the truth may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
and God glorified, Gods will be done concerning
me. After the Sermon they met all together at dinner,
&amp; all men were afraid that the Bishop would haue done
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> some shrewd turn for his Sermon, and silently
expected what would become of the matter. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> commeth to the Bishop to see him, and
to take leaue of him, and so to returne homewards. It
shall not be so, said the Bishop, for I will bring you to
your house; And so Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> returned home in the
company of the Bishop.</p>
            <p>And when they were now come to Mr. <hi>Gilpin<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> house,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7935:34"/>
and walked within into the parlour, the Bishop vpon a
sodaine caught Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> by the hand, and vsed these
words vnto him: Father <hi>Gilpin,</hi> I acknowledge you are
fitter to be Bishop of <hi>Durhams,</hi> then my selfe to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this Church of yours: I aske forgiuenesse for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
passed; forgiue me father: I know you haue hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vp some chickens that now seeke to pick out your
eyes; but so long as I shall liue Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
no man shall injure you. Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> friends, that is
all good men began to rejoyce, and to giue God thanks,
acknowledging the powerfull hand of God, in that the
Bishop being so offended with him, was so prevented by
the power of God, as that the thing which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for his disgrace, should turne to his greater credit.
In the meane while Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> reaped the fruit of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life in all plentifull manner.</p>
            <p>After that age began to grow vpon him, there was in
the towne of <hi>Newcastle</hi> one <hi>Genison</hi> who had received to
home a sonne of his owne brothers lately returned from
the parts beyond the seas. This <hi>Genison</hi> was much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved
for that his brothers sonne was (as hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood)
made a Iesuite: whereupon hee sent the young
man to Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> intreating him to haue a care of him,
and to disswade him if he could possibly from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and dangerous opinions. After that Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi> had
often conferd with him, he found the young fellow most
insolently proud, and armed with boldnesse and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
corrupting the holy Scriptures with certaine new
and vnheard of expositions. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Gilpin</hi>
wrote to his vncle Mr. <hi>Genison,</hi> that he was a most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
young fellow, and c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me not to him to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but to teach him rather.</p>
            <p>The young fell our, saith he, thinking I know not how,
a great deale too well of himselfe, had an hope to draw

I see that the Iesuites have found out, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:7935:34"/>
away all respect, and set vpon men with impudency.
They dare proue the Invocation of Saints from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaae,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> This fellow doth obstinately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not erred in any one
thing. Their most horrible errours touching Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
falsified Miracles, falsified Reliques, Pilgrimages,
worshipping of Images, and the rest of the same sort, all
these this wonderfull man findeth out in the Gospell.
And hee standeth vpon it stiffely that all these things are
good and holy. I desire not to haue any more to doe with
such a monstrous kinde of men, with such fierce natures,
who open their mouths against heaven, for what is it to
open their mouthes against heaven, if this be not, so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olenty
and disgracefully to handle the holy Scriptures?
They haue devised and daily doe devise horrible strange
expositions such as were never heard of before in the
Church of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> I therefore desire to rid mine hands of
this fellow as of a scabbed sheepe, for feare he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
my whole flocke.</p>
            <p>After that his leane body was quite worne out with
diversity of paines-taking, at the last even feeling before
hand the approach of death, he commanded the poore to
be called together, vnto whom hee made a speech, and
tooke his leaue of them. Afterwards he did the like to
others. He fell sick about the end of <hi>Febr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary,</hi> and after
many exhortations vsed to the schollers, to his servants,
and to divers others, at the last he fell asleep in the Lord
in great peace, the fourth day of <hi>March,</hi> in the yeare of
our Lord 1583. and in the 66. yeare of his age.</p>
            <p>He was tall of stature, and slender, being hawke-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
His clothes were ever such as cost not very deare.
He could never away with gay apparell. In things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to his owne body he was very frugall, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

tend to the good of others he was exceeding bountifull,
