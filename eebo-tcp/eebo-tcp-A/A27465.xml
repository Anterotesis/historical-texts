            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Remark concerning</hi> High-flying Philosophical Religionists; <hi>namely,</hi> That <hi>Simon Magus</hi> lost his Feet by affecting Wings: <hi>And that,</hi> Ex ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium hominum Ingeniis, omnes haereses animantur, <hi>as was observ'd by</hi> Tertullian, lib. 1. advers. Marcion.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Colloquies</hi> are plain and familiar, and drawn mostly from <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> which declares all God's Will to you in what you must <hi>believe and do:</hi> And as far as they conspire herewith, they have Food in them to nourish all the Faculties and Operations of Man's Soul: They are solid for Information, and soft for Perswasion: They can enlighten his Mind, and incite his Will, and give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Affection its due limit; and when any of them <hi>(</hi> through <hi>unbridled Mettle) shall outrun it, they strive to hank it in with a silken Snaffle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon these, and such matters, fix your Knowledge chiefly; for though you seek any other after the best manner,
<pb facs="tcp:47219:4"/>
and to the best end, that is, <hi>critically and rationally to find out what Real Content it can give to your Understanding,</hi> and use the two greatest <hi>Engines and Instruments of Discovery, viz.</hi> Labour and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yet it cannot make you <hi>happy:</hi> For that which can do so, must bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to all the Wants, Desires, and Capacities of your Soul, and must also be of an equal Duration with it, and neither of these is to be found in any other Knowledge. This is so apparent, that as 'tis said, <hi>Nequaquam opus est Argumentorum Plaustra hùc ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Education hath been in a <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Society;</hi> and I rejoyce that your Skill thereby in some choice Matters, hath not render'd you unworthy of it: But if you shall proceed to add a better Skill in a more excellent way than that of <hi>Men and Business;</hi> You will not only prove an Ornament to your Family and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Occasion of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Conventions of those Friends, which carry on these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Colloquies was the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and strengthning that Friendship, which their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood had begot amongst them: This being a direct way to that end, because the most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in this Case springs from it; for hereby, it becomes profitable for all Conditions and Persons. It makes the Day and the Night, that is Prosperity and Adversity, Light and Pleasant. It instructs and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines Youth, it confirms, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the Elderly, and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and supports the Ancient:
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <pb facs="tcp:47219:8"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:47219:9"/>
And when this is Experimentally known, and noted, it will be no easie Task to break that knot which Friendship hath tied; but in process of time, 'twill be like that which <hi>Gordius</hi> the <hi>Phrygian King</hi> made with so much Cunning, that it shall not be undone, and which is the <hi>Wonder</hi> of <hi>this Wonder,</hi> it will be <hi>fastest in the loosest Conditions;</hi> for as Man's heart tho' it be plac'd in the midst of his Body; yet is more inclin'd to his left side, and there beats more sensibly, tho' it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly inspires Life into all parts of it; so, tho' in a good and bad Condition, one Friend should help another, yet much the rather in Adversity.</p>
            <p>Now the way of going on in such Conventions for such a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is here set down, and these Friends agreeing to Elect one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them to regulate their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Glycon's</hi> Discourse Of Friendly Conference.</head>
            <p>FRiendly Conference hath much profit and advantage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good qualities to enhance its value, and commend it to the Exercise of well disposed Persons: For Human Society standeth in the communicating mutual Notions to one another. And that it may answer this Character, we must be careful what Friendship we contract, and in to what Society we engage our selves, for such obligation is not a matter of Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or enter'd into only upon account of Form and Custome, but will either add to our Personal estate of Grace and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or diminish it, and run us deeply into Debt by offending. This may be Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from the qualities of <hi>Load-stones,</hi> for put a Thousand <hi>Flints</hi> in an heap, and they shall not receive damage, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from each other; but put <hi>Load-stones</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47219:11"/>
together, and they'l prove beneficial, or injurious amongst themselves, for if they meet in terms agreeable to each others Nature, so that the Southern point of one be plac'd against the Northern of the other, the weak Load-stone will be drawn, and pleas'd, and strengthen'd by the strong, But if those which be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and incongruous do meet, the weak stone will be driven back, and injur'd.</p>
            <p>Thus it happens in the Friendships and Societies of Men, where somewhat of Good or Evil will redound from the Good or Evil which is amongst them, for evil Company corrupts good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and good corrects and confirm them, wicked Persons rub off some Vice to the next, and the Good infuse some Vertues. And as Diseases bred at some distance, spread forth their Infection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next parts of the Body, so the Vices of dissolute Persons are derived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those who have familiar Conversation with them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, for more Illustration in <note place="margin">See <hi>Bishop.</hi> Cownham.</note> this case, we may Note, that he who runs down the Hill can sooner put him down who is getting up, then the other draw him up to him; so in evil Company
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47219:11"/>
the worst prevails against the best, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then these against them, and the <hi>Reason</hi> may be, because the infected are not so soon cur'd by the Sound, as they tainted by their Contagion. You know that rotten Apples lying with the sound, are not restored to soundness, but the sound corrupted with their rottenness; and dead Carcases united to living Bodies are not revived, but the living if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue any time united to the dead, partake with them of their Mortality and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>Now that virtuous Persons are malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly influenc'd by the vicious, may appear from their distinct qualifications, and contrary dispositions, for the vicious persons being <hi>wholly Flesh,</hi> are more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and diligent in the Devils Service, then the truly virtuous can be in God's Cause, seeing they are Regenerate but <hi>in part,</hi> and the Flesh opposeth the Spirit <hi>in all</hi> good actions which either respect themselves or their Neighbour.</p>
            <p>This excellent Caution concerning Friendly Communication, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious application of i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47219:12"/>
the necessary Duty of <hi>Meditation,</hi> which is the <hi>Prologue to all good, Moral and Divine Actions,</hi> and they another to a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Conversation, for (said he) when the Royal Prophet had <hi>fix'd his thoughts upon his ways,</hi> this went immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">

               <hi>Denial of his Lord and Master,</hi> then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he became <hi>a weeping Penitent.</hi> And hereupon he desir'd <hi>Meletus</hi> to Discourse first on the Duty of Meditation, and he, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had Saluted the Company in a well disposed gesture, and with an affectionate and Courteous Compellation, began to speak thereof after this manner.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. The Prologue to Piety: Or of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Discours'd of by <hi>Meletus.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is in such a peculiar manner the <note place="margin">Meletus, <hi>one who thinks, and deeply considers from</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47219:12"/>
faculty to examine any of their Actions, or Motions; but proceed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the Innate Impulse which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given them for their Rule and Guide.</p>
            <p>However meerly to <hi>Think</hi> is not such a distinguishing excellency in Man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he use some means whereby he may put his Thoughts into good Order, and Method, and thereby so well digest them in his Head, that they may not brood unripe and raw Notions in his Mind; and such which are so dull and stupid, as that they render him like, and therefore worse than the Beasts that perish, for 'tis better to be a Beast than like one. In them a want of power to Think is Natural; but to Think to no purpose is Folly.</p>
            <p>Now the proper means for this End is <hi>Meditation,</hi> and that I may not huddle over what Idesign to speak of this Duty, I shall proceed in this following plain trodden way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Namely to declare</hi> what Meditation is; and what we should exercise it about; and the Causes which may move us hereto; and then the manner how we should put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47219:13"/>As to the First, Note that</p>
            <p>Meditation in the General description of it, <hi>is to fix our thoughts upon any thing:</hi> Or it is <hi>an Orderly right, and serious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our Thoughts.</hi> 'Tis as the Captains setting his Company in Rank and File, or the Accomptants distinct placing his Numeral Counters, or the Physicians skillful putting together his Ingredients.</p>
            <p>Now in this large sense of the word <hi>Meditation,</hi> the vilest of Men may, and have performed it, for they can <hi>search</hi>

               <hi>out Iniquity and the inward Thought of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, and their heart is deep.</hi> And frequently they omit nothing, which may serve for a most exact and punctual Inquiry, and all the Wit, and Craft, and Policy which can be found in all Mankind, is many times gathered together, and made use of by them, to perfect the wicked and cruel designs which they have thought upon.</p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>They Meditate deceits all the</hi>

               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Thoughts.</hi> So that, 'tis not praise worthy only to <hi>Think or to Meditate.</hi> For as <hi>Alexander,</hi> seeing a certain Youth, who bore his Name, but would not Fight,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47219:13"/>
said to him, <hi>either change this Disposition, or thy Name.</hi>—So may we to that Man who will not <hi>Think and Meditate,</hi> for his Soul, which gives him his Name <hi>Man,</hi> is a <hi>Busie Body,</hi> and so indispensibly in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that 'twill be doing something tho' it may come to <hi>nothing;</hi> and therefore there needs no Argument, or Rhetorick to convince a Man that he must Think and Meditate.—But to perform this Office is <hi>to set about it Orderly and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</hi> that is, to be Intent upon the best things, and fix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces real profit, and such <hi>Meditation</hi> will upon future proof, much further a pious Conversation, from which <hi>Harvest</hi> we shall <hi>Reap</hi> the best advantage.</p>
            <p>Now that we may so sow, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, we must according to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Method shew in the next place, <note place="margin">The Object of Meditatton.</note> upon <hi>what we must fix and settle our Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that must be</hi> upon God, and our <note place="margin">God, and our selves.</note> selves, upon what God hath said and done, and upon what we are and shall be.</p>
            <p>And for our Guide herein, we must Meditate on God's Holy Word.—And therein upon his Will and Commands; these must be known before they can be done.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47219:14"/>
A good Expositor hath told us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Calv. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em. ad Psal.</note> one Holy Book, namely that of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now if Gods Word abound so in one part, what will it do in the whole? If a parcel be so Gainful, what Riches will the whole <hi>Cargo</hi> Import? This may be one Reason why the <hi>Psalmist</hi> was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Meditating on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>'Tis my Meditation all the Day,</hi> and he did not forget his Commandments, and he did it frequently, <hi>for his eyes did prevent the Night watches, that he might Meditate</hi>

               <hi>in God Word</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in our Reflections upon Gods Holy Word, we must especially inquire out the <hi>Promises and Threatnings</hi> which are there Treasur'd up—His promises
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47219:14"/>
to comfort us, His Threatnings to awe us; upon his Promises as <hi>Cordials</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive our drooping Souls, upon his Threatnings, <hi>as Purges and Vomits</hi> to cleanse us from our filthy Lusts, for then we shall be perswaded to part with our filthy Corruption, when we can say with <hi>David, my flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Iudgments.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 120.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as for Gods promises, his thoughts were firmly fix'd upon them, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 55.</note> for he saith, <hi>I have remembred thy Name, O Lord, in the Night, and have kept thy Law. Thy Name,</hi> that is, <hi>thy mercy and goodness, and love in thy Promises, and in thy experienc'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and assistance,</hi>—In <hi>the Night,</hi> that is, when cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have possess'd my mind, or when wicked Men short, and are secure, and on their Beds meditate Villany, then have I comforted my self in the promises of thy Word.</p>
            <p>Such Meditations should we have, and tho' all Gods Word deserves our serious Meditations, yet most especially those parts which afford us much comfort, and benefit, true Ioy and real Profit, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledged Gods promises did to him, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 130.</note> saying, <hi>How sweet are thy promises to my Mouth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47219:15"/>And here 'tis worth our Meditation, <note place="margin">W. D.</note> and a very fit object for it, how that Good things were purposed by God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Men before all Time, Promised in Time, and shall be performed in the End, and after, and beyond all Times: So God's Promise putteth us in mind of his Love of Old in Electing us, his Truth now in assuring us, his Power hereafter in doing that which he hath both purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and promised.—And tho' God's <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Law, by reason of the condition annexed of perfect fulfilling it, be contrary to the free promise of Life; yet it doth not abolish, and take away the Promise of Grace, but serveth as an helper thereto, for by discovering the fatal danger by sin, it driveth afflicted Sinners to Christ, who is their only Remedy, and in whom alone <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his spiritual Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty find Righteousness, and Life Eternal, which is the thing promised.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God's Promises are Insal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Cures for our <hi>Broken Bones</hi> or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Consciences, and we should apply them to those Ruptures by a discussive Meditation, and thereby we should awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our hearts, and incite our Wills to close with God and Christ in the Mercy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47219:15"/>
and Truth of his Promises, such Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as are founded upon Christ as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and in him upon God, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Grace and Love.</p>
            <p>Now as we must Meditate upon what God <hi>hath said,</hi> so must we also upon what <hi>he hath done.</hi>—We must by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation have all God's Works in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,—His Works of Creation, and Providence, for, when our thoughts are rightly fix'd upon these Works, we shall admire God in his Power, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodness, and Mercy,—<hi>His Power</hi> in making such excellent things which we see in the Heavens, Earth, and Sea, out of nothing. <hi>His Wisdom</hi> in the contrivance of them in so Glorious a manner. <hi>His Goodness and Mercy</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, and preserving all things in that Order and Decency which we find them.</p>
            <p>Thus in general: And if in a particular manner we would Meditate upon the Nature and Properties, which God hath wrought in <hi>Beasts,</hi> we might thence not only take good Instructions for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preservation and sustenance of our Bodies, but Lessons also to frame and perfect our Manners:—As for Instance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47219:16"/>Meditate on the <hi>Camel</hi> which then stoopeth, and kneeleth when he shall be charged; and thence learn the lesson of Humility.</p>
            <p>Meditate on the <hi>Cock,</hi> which giveth out of his own Mouth Meat to his Hens, and exposeth himself to any danger to keep them safe; and thence learn the Lessons of Liberality, and care over our Families.</p>
            <p>Meditate on the <hi>Bee,</hi> which gets Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of the Flowers without any damage, or injury done to them; and thence learn to Gain by the use of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Goods without his hurt or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
            <p>Meditate on the one eyed Fish called <note place="margin">

            <p>From <hi>Meditation</hi> on such, and the like Works of God, Good and Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have much improved themselves, and others by way of Application of them, for Orators have us'd them to

perswade, and others also who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten well and Elegantly; and God and Holy Men frequently instruct us by the Manners and Conditions of Beasts, and lead us thereby to perfection, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness of Life, for they advise us to be Prudent as <hi>Serpents,</hi> and Innocent as <hi>Doves,</hi> and Meek and Gentle as the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and Strong and Constant as the <hi>Lyon.</hi>—Now to many other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this kind I shall leave you to your own thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what a large Field of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation all Mankind hath, from what they see God hath done in the World.</p>
            <p>But we must not bound our Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">On what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should meditate.</note> here, but consider that we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and thereupon proceed in this Duty with care and circumspection, for because we are thus called, it behoves us to fix our thoughts chiefly on God's gracious Work, in sending his Son into the World to Redeem those who Believe in him from the Bondage of Sin, Death, and Misery.</p>
            <p>That God <hi>so loved the World that he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io.</hi> 3 16.</note> 
               <hi>gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Life,</hi> is such a glad Tyding which should never slip out of our memories.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47219:17"/>Certainly there is much Benefit got by reflecting upon such loving Works of God, for as the Flint is broken upon the Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so our Hearts which are hard and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by customary sinning, will hereby through God's Grace, be broken, and made tender and plyable to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of God's Laws.</p>
            <p>Meditate upon Divinity cloathed in Humanity, upon Life suffering Death; upon Glory induring Shame; upon the Beloved cast out to Misery; upon Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Descending into Hell, and then be silent if you can; and if it be possible forbear to cry out who can resist such Love? What frozen Heart cannot be thaw'd with such heat? Who would not Fear such a Lord? And who would not be Obedient to such a Father? These are the admirable effects which are wrought in us by the <hi>Meditation</hi> on such a wonderful Work of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to fix our thoughts frequently upon this Object, is not only the special Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the excellent priviledge of us who are called Christians.</p>
            <p>And here <hi>Meletus,</hi> that he might not surfeit his Hearers patience, and hereby put the Medicine he us'd for their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47219:17"/>
in the prescrib'd Office in need of a Medicine it self, he adjourn'd them to another time to hear the Report he was to make upon the next Object of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Meletus's</hi> Second Discourse of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</head>
            <p>IN the next Congress he proceeded to declare, that the Duty of Meditation was to be exercis'd upon <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, said he, we must <hi>Think upon our Condition, what we are, and what we are like to be:</hi> Whether we are what we profess, Christians in reality, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we declare our selves to be so, <hi>by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if by Meditation we discover what we are, we shall soon know what we shall be, if we so continue, for Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happiness everlasting, will be the consequent of our Wicked or Pious Conversation; as we Live, so shall we Die; and as we Die, so shall we be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; we must either <hi>be Goats, or</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47219:18"/>
               <hi>Sheep,</hi> receive our Blessing or our Curse, either be thrown down into <hi>outer Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or else <hi>enter into our Masters Ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the first Meditation in reference <hi>to our selves</hi> should be to know what the Condition of our Heart is, for that is the special <hi>Gift which God requests of us.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.</note> since we should not give him we know not what, something at adventure, and not what we may be assured he will kindly accept, and carefully Preserve, and plentifully Reward. We must fix our thoughts so, as to examine what our Hearts <hi>are in themselves,</hi> and then we shall know <hi>what our selves are,</hi> and what God expects from us. Now as no Member of the Body performs any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spiritual Life wherein a Pulse from the Heart doth not Beat. So it is in the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Mede. <hi>on Prov. the</hi> 4.</note> spiritual Man, and the Actions of Grace; that lives not, which some Gracious <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 23.</note> Motion from the Heart doth not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; and therefore know by Tryal and Examination what that is.</p>
            <p>Now according to Scripture Phrase the Heart of Man is of a large extent; for, 'tis not only the principal inward part of all Life, and the Fountain of Motion, and Native Heat, but it is the <hi>Principal and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47219:18"/>
               <hi>of all the faculties, and of all the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Because of this full description of the Heart, the greek Inter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters give it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Names, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Animal and Vital Operations; The seat of the Understanding, Fancy, Memory and Affections. It is the spring from whence the Thoughts, Discourses, Imaginations, Passions and Motions, which are in Man flow, and stream forth; Besides it is the Treasury of Virtues, and Sink of Vices, and the place of all Habits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, the Heart signifies a sincere assent of Mind, a serious purpose of Will, a great force of Affections, a large endeavour of Strength, and Integrity, and perfection of Mind.</p>
            <p>Now when upon <hi>Meditation,</hi> we thus know, what our Hearts are, and how they are differenc'd from <hi>double,</hi> or rather <hi>half Hearts;</hi> then we shall understand what that Duty and Obedience to God is, which is hearty, or perform'd with the whole Heart, and which will be well pleasing to him; for hence we learn, that <hi>it must be true and sincere, not feigned and hypocritical; serious and solid, and not in jest, light and superficial; diligent and efficacious, not weak, remiss, and sloathful; whole and full, not concise, lame, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this knowledge is not only worth the obtaining, but <hi>absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47219:19"/>
and therefore should engage us in the <hi>Meditation</hi> of it, because it is the most proper means for that end.</p>
            <p>And, when we have fix'd our thoughts to this purpose, then we should fix them upon the main thing requir'd in us as <hi>We are Christians.</hi> And that is set down by our Lord and Master, from whom we have our Names, in the Phrase of <hi>being Born again,</hi> and the necessity of it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io.</hi> 3. 3.</note> to stir up our diligence in assuring our selves, that we are in that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for, <hi>except</hi> it be thus, <hi>we shall not see</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi> So that we must be New, or Undone Creatures, live in Grace, or die in Sin.</p>
            <p>And next to the <hi>Necessity if it,</hi> we must Meditate upon <hi>the Excellency,</hi> the <hi>superlative Excellency of that New State.</hi> As, that it makes us partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, <hi>that is, Regenerate by the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Holy Ghost, or indewed with new qualities of Righteousness and Holiness,</hi> wherein we resemble God, as Children do their Father, bearing the Image of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Purity. And also that hereby we become <hi>Kings and Priests unto God,</hi> Kings, because of the Victories which in that Condition we obtain against the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47219:19"/>
               <hi>Priests,</hi> because then we offer up to God a pure Body, and Holy Prayers, and the Works of Piety, and Mercy.</p>
            <p>The next Object we should fix upon in reference to <hi>our selves,</hi> is, to know <hi>what we shall be, or what kind of future Life we shall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order hereto it will highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to Meditate on the four last things, namely, <hi>Death, Iudgment, Hell Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These last things well consider'd, will make us always last, and live in spight of Death it self.</p>
            <p>Now, as a previous motive to six our thoughts upon, the first of these Objects, <hi>DEATH,</hi> Let us Note that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <note place="margin">Death.</note> performance hereof, may cause our Sins to <hi>Dye</hi> before <hi>they be Old,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by secure us from the full strength and force of them in our Hearts, for 'tis the Nature of Sin to be stronger and more fierce when <hi>Old</hi> than <hi>Young,</hi> the wither'd and drooping Body, proves a Medicine for Sin's growth and flourishing, for when <hi>the Fort, or Outwork of the Soul</hi> is Dismantled by many Breaches made in it by Lust, and Intemperance, and from the frequent <hi>Detachments,</hi> and fresh Supplies, sent by Satan from those vicious Habits
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47219:20"/>
as from a well furnish'd <hi>Magazine,</hi> which he hath laid up against it; then Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into the <hi>Castle of Mans Soul,</hi> and there un tes his Forces, and makes them stronger, and what Ruines the <hi>Out-work,</hi> that is, the <hi>Body</hi> hath suffer'd, doth but <hi>Alarm</hi> Satan's Industry, to make the <hi>Castle</hi> the more Invincible for himself.</p>
            <p>Now the frequent thoughts of Death may out-wit Satan, and prevent this his <hi>Stratagem,</hi> and this should stir us up to be exercis'd in that counterplot and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and that this will herein prove successful we may be assur'd from hence, <hi>namely,</hi> that the Heavenly Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick of <hi>Numbering our Days, that we may apply our Hearts to Wisdom,</hi> must be learned by Meditation.</p>
            <p>Hereby we should often visit our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, and take a turn in our Tombs, and Dress our selves up in our winding Sheets.—By this Art, we may make Death, our Natures grim Enemy, our choice Friend, and hereby learn an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it, and procure its fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and even touch and stroke it, and so abate much of its fierceness, when of necessity, and according to Heavens <hi>Statute Law,</hi> it must, and doth come.</p>
            <p>Believe it, <hi>Meditation</hi> of it before, is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47219:20"/>
the best Receit to heal the anguish, and sharpness of Death when it <hi>doth</hi> come; and after our Thoughts have taken some Turns in the <hi>Charnel House,</hi> let them come forth, and by Meditation mount up to the place of <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there fix we our Minds upon the <hi>Righteous Iudge,</hi> and the <hi>Glorious Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and the <hi>Various Qualities, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the Prisoners,</hi> some smiling with their Pardons in their Hands, and called by their Loving Master and Saviour from the Bar, and plac'd at his <hi>Right Hand.</hi> Others pale and ghastly, and trembling under the terrours of a guilty Conscience, and Seated on the <hi>Left Hand</hi> to be thrown down into a Prison of Eternal Darkness.</p>
            <p>Meditate on the never <hi>Dying Worm,</hi> that is bred in that Prison, and there will fix his Venemous Teeth, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Conscience for ever.—How to go through Hell to Heaven, is a Road well known to those who have examined all the Passages which lead thither, and are resolved upon that Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, mauger all the dangers, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects, and cruel usage, which lye in the way to hinder them, supposing it much better hereby to be scared to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47219:21"/>
Happiness, then to slide down delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to Misery,—we all know that the most dreadful State of those which are in Hell is express'd <hi>by Fire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the most terrible Element; and the Meditation hereof may cause us, <hi>through God's Grace,</hi> to use all the proper means whereby we may escape it, and that it may not be the <hi>Portion of our Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after such black and frightful thoughts which are as the Rod, rather to keep us in awe and order, than to assright and hurt us.</p>
            <p>Let us <hi>Meditate on Heaven,</hi> and this <note place="margin">Heaven.</note> Object when duely entered upon, will be so delightsome, and delicious to our Souls, that with the Spouse in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cap</hi> 5.</note> they will crave <hi>whole Flaggons of it, and drink so deep, till they be inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with its sweetness.</hi>—For there, all the precious and gracious Promises in God's Holy Word shall be fully accomplish'd, and perform'd to them; and what Draught can be more sweet, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable?—So that 'tis our Recreation, and Pleasure, as well as our Obligation and Duty to Meditate on <hi>Heaven.</hi> And that we may not be discourag'd from fixing our thoughts upon this Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47219:21"/>
of the vast extent of it, or surfeit them with the variety of those Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which it affords. <hi>For Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor can Man's Heart conceive what they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us set this Breviate, or Epitomy of it before us, and Meditate thereon.—Namely, on the Incomparable, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Excellency of the Place; of the unexpressible <hi>Ioys</hi> laid up in that place, of the <hi>Fatness</hi> of that House; of the innumerable <hi>Rivers of pleasure</hi> which glide along those Banks; of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Glory that fills every part; of the Noble and Seraphical Quiristers which there attend; of the Ravishing Anthems which are there heard; and of the <hi>Vision</hi> of God himself which is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness.</p>
            <p>And here, <hi>Meletus</hi> looking about him, and perceiving by the chearful aspects, and diligent attention of his Hearers, that their Ears were not <hi>yet satiated</hi> with his Lecture, he went on to shew them some unquestionable Reasons, why they should perform this Pious Office of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and to what end, and for what profit they should be so employ'd.</p>
            <p>And the first Reason was, <hi>because there is nothing more truly Beneficial to us than the</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47219:22"/>
right and constant management of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>for hereby</hi> God's Holy Word will be fruitful to us: <hi>A Meditating Heart is an</hi> honest and good Heart, <hi>and such is very fruitful, under the means of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we won't step aside, and take time to fix our Thoughts upon what we hear, or read in God's Word, and from his Messengers, we should be very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly conceited to imagine that we should be ever the better for it. <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By Meditation <hi>we may prepare our Souls for all Holy Performances.</hi>—As for Prayer, and Reading Holy Writ, and Receiving the Lord's Supper, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and forgetting Injuries, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties of Mercy and Charity.—This Exercise will compose our minds, and fetch them <hi>in,</hi> when they have been <hi>abroad upon the World,</hi> and 'tis fit we make our selves comely and orderly by this Act of <hi>Meditation,</hi> before we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to wait upon God.</p>
            <p>We are not to Rush all of a sudden upon any Holy Duty, but to consider <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 4.</note> of it, and prepare for it.</p>
            <p>Now Meditation puts us into this way, it causeth us to <hi>Wash and Trim</hi> up our Souls with sincerity, and an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that so we may enter into God's
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47219:22"/>
presence with that Decency, and Order which becomes his Faithful Servants and Dutiful Children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Meditation <hi>will prove an excellent</hi>

               <hi>means against all our tempting Lusts and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and also a strong Bulwark, for our Vertues and Graces.</hi> For, he who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fixeth his mind upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin, may (through God's Grace) be soon perswaded to hate and abhor it: For the Nature of Sin is to be evil in it self, and dangerous to the Soul which harbours it.</p>
            <p>Now as a <hi>Landlord</hi> will by no prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of advantage entertain a Guest which he knows to be an egregious Robber, and will Plunder him of his Substance, and Fire his House: No more will the Soul admit of Sin, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders that it will deprive him of God's Favour, and inflame him with his Wrath and Displeasure.</p>
            <p>If Men would in their serious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations set the pleasures and profits of Sin on one side, and the loathsomness, and danger of it on the other; did they view her Portion and Dowry with one eye, and her Deformity and Vicious Qualities with the other, it would be an admirable way to make them defist
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47219:23"/>
from <hi>Courting her,</hi> and to avoid her with the greatest abhorrency.</p>
            <p>If they would in their Meditations <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.</note> compare Sin, as they aptly may, to the <hi>Locusts</hi> mention'd in Sacred Writ, which tho' they <hi>had Crowns like Gold on their Heads, and the Faces of Men, and their Hair like Womens, yet withal had Teeth like Lyons, and Tayls like to Scorpions,</hi> that is, did they but think what Shame and Death would follow their sinful delights, and honours; what bitterness lay at the bottom of Sins Cup; Questionless such a thought would make them <hi>Crucify</hi> it to Death in its most rich and pleasing At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
            <p>Now as Pious Meditation would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner ruine sin, so 'twould be a <hi>means to save and secure Grace:</hi> For, the thoughts of the loveliness hereof would put Courage into us to engage for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all its Spiritual Enemies, and 'twould invite us to quicken it with our warmest affections, and hereupon we should place it in the <hi>Garrisons</hi> of our Hearts, and keep those Garrisons with our greatest watchfulness.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Meditation is a means to <hi>encrease and multiply our Graces,</hi> for this Duty will bring supply of Grace, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47219:23"/>
by it we should know what Armory to go to, <hi>that is,</hi> where to be Releiv'd.</p>
            <p>And besides all this, it will <hi>employ them,</hi> and not suffer them to perish by ease and idleness: It will rouse up our Faith, and kindle our Charity, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our Hope, and enliven our Desires, and multiply our spiritual Ioys; 'twill also loosen our Affections from earthly things, and give us a foretaste of Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>By Meditation <hi>we enjoy God here, and</hi>

            <p>Believe it, there can be no <hi>Intercourse</hi> between Heaven and Earth, betwixt God and Man without <hi>Meditation,</hi> but in the exercise of it there may, and this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47219:24"/>
will bring a large Harvest of Spiritual Ioy, and Comfort into our Souls; for, true Meditating Christians are usually most acquainted with God, and this <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> will procure the best <hi>Peace,</hi> and the most real comfort.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Meletus's</hi> Third Discourse of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
            <p>THE next meeting being come, and <hi>Glycon</hi> having put <hi>the Assembly</hi> in mind of the occasion of it, and then made some sign to <hi>Meletus</hi> to proceed in the same <hi>Path,</hi> and with the same <hi>Foot</hi> he had begun, he freely embrac'd the motion, and broke silence after this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
            <p>It is written, saith <hi>Meletus,</hi> of the Bird <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Causin. de Symbol. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. sapient. P. 8.</note> called <hi>Phatalia,</hi> that it is wont to fill it self with Shell-fish, and to vomit them up when he hath concocted them by the heat of his Stomack, and then choose out of them those which were most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be eaten.</p>
            <p>I would perswade my self, that in <hi>like manner</hi> you have, by Meditation, put in good order what you have already heard, and chose out some peculiar observations, whereby you have been made more strong in Christian Virtues, then you were before, and that you may have fresh supply to add to your increase
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47219:25"/>
herein for Christians must like <hi>the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile, be growing as long as they live.</hi>—I shall now shew you the manner how the Duty of Meditation must be exercis'd, and it is necessary that you be inform'd hereof; for the <hi>manner</hi> of doing any good action is the main thing which renders it acceptable in God's sight, and beneficial to us; and the difficulty of it will require directions for its performance in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now the <hi>first Direction</hi> in order hereto is,</p>
            <p>To <hi>choose out some fit time to Meditate:</hi> This will much further our design, and prove helpful to us.—We find that our <hi>Great Master</hi> chose the early Morning: For then <hi>rising up before Day, he went out</hi> 
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 25.</note> 
               <hi>and departed into a solitary place, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and the Patriarch <hi>Isaac</hi> used this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in <hi>the Field at the Evening</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen</hi> 24. 69.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is not absolutely necessary to pitch just upon such a certain time, and no other, and if that be past, or busied other ways, then to lay it aside; but we should as near as we can pitch on such a time, wherein we are most free from our Worldly occasions.</p>
            <p>Nor is it requisite that all Persons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the very same time, for all have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47219:25"/>
not the same business, or occasions, and therefore <hi>divers hours</hi> may be most proper in this present case; but some peculiar time of the Day, or as oft as we can, we should sequester our selves for pious <hi>Meditation.</hi> And verily that part of the Day which is so us'd, may procure a blessing for all the other parts, for God doth not forget those who do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> We should <hi>find out a proper place</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Direct.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>for this Office,</hi> such a circumstance may much further this necessary employ: <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> assures us, that through <hi>desire a Man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 1.</note> 
               <hi>having separated himself seeketh and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth with all Wisdom.</hi>—The mind of Man is soon disturb'd with sights, and noise, and those matters which hinder the free exercise of Meditation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>convenient places</hi> conduce much to the right performance of it.</p>
            <p>The Devil would fain burthen our Ears, and employ them too much, that so we, being intent upon the lesser, may neglect our greater concerns. He would entertain and <hi>

               </hi> our Ears with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Tales, and Fables, that so we might take no notice whether we be Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Heaven or Hell. It is his <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and therefore it should be <hi>our Ioy,</hi> to go

into our private Apartments, and there fix our minds upon our present, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condition.</p>
            <p>3dly. In order to due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </note> 
               <hi>we must get our Hearts into a right frame for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we have resolv'd upon the Time, and the Place, then we should be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to order our Hearts well; and in good earnest: this is not an easy business, for our Hearts will require some pains and study before we can bring them into a Meditatimg temper.—They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and so may perswade us that we are, when indeed we are not so well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for this Duty as we ought to be,—To Meditate, is to be very intent, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and such a disposition is neither quickly, or easily procur'd, and yet this Frame we must get, or we can't herein perform our Duty.</p>
            <p>Now the most proper means to be thus qualified is, to keep our Hearts with <note place="margin">Mede <hi>on Prov.</hi> 4. 23.</note> all diligence, <hi>that is,</hi> to watch them that they do not admit such vain, and foolish things into them, that may put aside this Office of Holy Meditation, and if we cannot at one time, we must strive at another, to fix, and compose our minds, we must take some pains in this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47219:26"/>
business; and the gain of it (as I have shewn) will more than sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the hardness of the Task:—If we can't Meditate to day, or to night, we must try to do it tomorrow, or some other time, and follow the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to purpose; till we have (<hi>through Gods grace</hi>) brought our Minds to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating frame; and when we are in tune for the Duty, we shall perform it with comfort.</p>
            <p>You must acknowledge that Mens Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance herein spoils all: They suppose that a short time, and little labour, will serve for the Duty; but when they go about it, and find many worldly Cares, and this, and that, and the other trifle put them by, and take them off, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige their Thoughts to fix on them soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than upon Heaven, and Heavenly matters, then they are or may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that to Meditate is not so easie a task as they imagin'd; and then as the supposed easiness of it kept them from the exercise of it for some time, so now the real difficulty of it will hinder them from any performance of it—Now this may be prevented, and the real knowledge of the Duty of Meditation may be obtain'd, if we study to keep our Hearts in a due
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47219:27"/>
Frame and Disposition. And to do thus, we should not surfeit our Minds with inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things, nor disorder our Bodies by Intemperance; for the contrary Vertue, <note place="margin">

            <p>4thly. When we would rightly Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <note place="margin">4. <hi>Direct.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>we must preface that Office with Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Prayer is an Ascension of the <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Heart to God; and when it is presented to him with an entire and warm Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Tongue does not forerun the Wit;</hi> that is, <hi>we do not speak what we do not fore-think;</hi> for God's Grace is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by an unaccomptable Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Cyphers,</hi> or Insignificant Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But the pious Heart shoots forth its Affections as so many keen Arrows which pierce into Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47219:27"/>Upon Examination we shall find, that there is not any Religious Duty which can be rightly perform'd, unless it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with Prayer; and <hi>the Reason is,</hi> Because to do as we ought in Religious Matters is the <hi>Gift of God; Now every</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iam.</hi> 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>good and perfect Gift cometh from above:</hi> And God will not let it drop down upon us, unless we first raise up our Hearts by Prayer to him.</p>
            <p>Now there is no Gift of greater Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as you have heard, than that of due Meditation; and therefore this should be beg'd, and earnestly beg'd of God in our daily Devotions: The Difficulty of that Duty should drive us to this; for, if we find that we can't do a business our selves, we pray help and assistance; and so we should of God in this case; and this may be an Argument to prevail with him to comply with our Petitions when we do pray.</p>
            <p>Our Experience tells us that our Souls are weak and infirm, and infected with <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the plagues of Sin: Now Prayer <hi>is the best, and only Medicine to make them sound,</hi> and so fit to exercise the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; and the reason may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if in Prayer we humbly, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively acknowledge our own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47219:28"/>
and declare that we cannot of our selves Meditate rightly, and that we are not able to overcome the <hi>Army</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating Enemies that are in us; that is, our vain and sinful Thoughts and Cares; and that our eyes are up unto God for relief in this Condition, questionless such an humble, and modest pleading with him in Prayer, may cause him to grant our Petition; for God will thus glorifie them in the face of their spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that first glorifie him by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their own Weakness and his Power; and therefore that you may pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Meditate, fervently pray.</p>
            <p>5thly. We <hi>must fix our Minds upon one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5. Direct.</note> 
               <hi>matter at a time:</hi>—We must not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we can Meditate once for all: No, it must be done by degrees, and at several times: One kind Providence may fix the Mind on the Goodness of God; and perhaps a while after a Severe part of Providence may afford it matter of another sort of Meditation; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereunto we are to frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our Thoughts; several Meditations must be exercis'd upon several Objects, otherwise we shall run into Confusion, and learn our Hearts not properly to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, but to wander.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47219:28"/>Now the due observing this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will very much help in the Duty we are about, especially if we do not stay too long between the matter which we should Meditate on, or the Occasion, and the time of our Meditation.</p>
            <p>If upon the Lord's day we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve only to Meditate on the Business of the day, this would be a proper means to gain by the exercise. When our Hearts would run out upon many things at once, we must put them back, and bring them into convenient order again: and do so as often as they wander, or are luxuriant in several matters, for, he <hi>that minds all things minds nothing;</hi> that is, nothing so orderly, and beneficially as he might, if he was fix'd upon one single matter.</p>
            <p>So that when our Thoughts and Hearts would crowd upon us <hi>many things</hi> to be Meditated upon, we should say to them, fair, and softly, and all in due place and order shall be dispatcht; be satisfied with one part at one time, till by degrees the whole be compleated: For,
<q>Pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47219:29"/>Now when we have us'd these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; that is, got a fit time, and place, and a right frame and temper, and have pray'd, and thought upon one busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so Meditated; then we must fix <hi>upon some Resolutions that may bring glory to God, and be helpful to us in a course of Grace and Vertue;</hi> and this is the right use of Meditation; for it must look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the composing our Spirits, and fixing our Thoughts upon some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar good thing. It <hi>must tend to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> for we must Meditate, that we may the better live, and act what we Meditate upon.</p>
            <p>As for Example;</p>
            <p>When we have Meditated on <hi>God's Mercies,</hi> then we must proceed to bless his Name for them, and to lead holy Lives in the use of them; for when we have considered the riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Patience, and Long-suffering towards us, then we must set about the Practice of Repentance by forsaking our Sins, and turning unto God.</p>
            <p>When we have Meditated on <hi>God's Iustice</hi> in punishing our selves, or others, when we have seen him walk in the Paths of his Iudgments; then we must tremble at his Power, and fear his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47219:29"/>
and turn from our evil ways which have caus'd him to turn away his face in displeasure from us.</p>
            <p>When we have Meditated upon all his <hi>Works of Providence,</hi> and learn'd thereby how admirably he preserves those things that he hath made, and in what Order he keeps the World, that so all things do not run into Confusion, nor destroy each other; then we must lay aside our Carking Care, and so act our Faith and Confidence in him, and so acknowledge him the Fountain from whence all our true Enjoyments flow.</p>
            <p>When we Meditate upon <hi>our own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Emptiness, and upon the World's Insufficiency and Inconstancy;</hi> then we must carry up our Affections higher than our selves, and all these inferiour things, and place them upon God, who is full of Power and Majesty.</p>
            <p>Now if according to these fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Examples, and the like, we put Meditation into practice, we shall bring it to a good issue, and we shall <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize</hi> with it to great advantage; for hereby we shall glorifie God, and render our selves <hi>holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47219:30"/>2dly. When we have fix'd our Thoughts firmly, <hi>then we must study to stir up such Affections in our Hearts as the Object which we have fixed on doth require;</hi> that is, we should be full of Desire, or Ioy, or Fear, or Anger, or Love, or Hatred, or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or Compassion as will comply with the matter we have fix'd our Minds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is not proper that we should be after this Exercise just of the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position we were before: But if we have considered on Heavenly things, then we must be more joyful in them, and more desirous of them. If we have thought seriously on our sins, then we must be more angry with them, and full of Hatred against them, and of sorrow for them.</p>
            <p>If we have Mediated on God's Love in Christ, and of the Riches of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Patience to us, then we must strive to love God again, and to declare it by preferring him before all Worldly Concerns; and by Obedience to all his Commands, and by Delight in his Word; and we must also fear to offend him, and be constantly doing those things which are pleasing to his Divine Majesty. Thus we must be diversly affected in divers matters; sad Thoughts, will require a sad Posture and sad Affections; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47219:30"/>
Thoughts will require contrary. We must not smile under God's Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nor are we to cry and lament in the midst of Blessings: True said <hi>Musophil</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And now, said <hi>Meletus,</hi> I suppose your Ears have made a <hi>sufficient meal on this one Dish,</hi> and will require some time for <hi>its Digestion.</hi>—What hath been spoken with great Submission to your Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Candour, hath been the fruit of the present Duty that lies before us, and which I have commended to your great Circumspection and Diligence; for where there is only a superficial regard to it, there can be no real and solid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort flow from it: But if we will be so wise as to set about it with our whole strength, then we shall perform it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and thereupon we shall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God for the Duty; and benefited by it both in this World and the next.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Meletus</hi> had thus finished his Discourse concerning <hi>Meditation,</hi> which is the proper Prologue to Vertue and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: And <hi>Glycon</hi> (according to his Office)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47219:31"/>
was to nominate him who should speak at their next meeting. <hi>Phanias</hi> stood up, and made a motion that he might <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that Province,</hi> because he could bear witness in himself of the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of due and well order'd <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> for hereupon for some time past, he had perceiv'd, that he was not so wise and knowing as he had appear'd to be in his own Conceit; but could manifest <hi>the Folly and Fallacy</hi> of that Wisdom, and Knowledge of Truth upon which he formerly had valued himself, and the inevitable Misery which did follow it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon his Motion was approved; and whereas it was noted, that formerly when he spake it was but Talk, and at adventure what came next: Now he did <note place="margin">He did then <hi>effutire,</hi> only, now he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, <hi>loqui.</hi>

            <p>IT is a Catholick Desire because planted in all Mankind, to be, or at least to

               <hi>be esteem'd Wise,</hi> and <hi>truly Knowing;</hi> and the very Name of Folly is as equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd and abhorr'd, as the Practice of it, through Misapprehension, is followed and applauded; and this is the reason why all People put themselves into <hi>a Way, i.e.</hi> upon such Determinations and Actions, or into such a course of Life and Conversation which they suppose will answer this their aim and design, and frequently they think they have hit this mark which they have aim'd at: Yet upon strict Examination, and punctual Measuring, they will be found to be much besides it.</p>

            <p>First, <hi>Men are prone to think falsly of things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The several extravagant Opinions which the Philosophers had of God, may in some sort satisfie us that it is so, for upon fixing our thoughts on them, we shall find that the true Nature of God was as far from their minds, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Heaven was from their Schools, and that they lived at the same distance from Truth, as Truth did from false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

            <p>These were strange Sentiments of God, and yet the <hi>Wise Men of the World</hi> embraced them; these ways in descrying the Essence of God did seem strait and true in their Eyes.</p>
            <p>Moreover I shall make it evident that their false Conceits, or their <hi>Wise Folly</hi> appeared not only in the foremention'd great Point concerning God, <hi>but in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> account Revenge amongst their Virtues, and the first of these, tho' <hi>the Philosopher,</hi> affirm'd, That War against <hi>Barbarians</hi> (which were all People but the <hi>Grecians</hi>) was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whose Laws were approv'd of, and prais'd by <hi>Appollo's</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and the <hi>Romans,</hi> have declar'd, That <hi>all Praise and Virtue are got in Wars tho' apparently unjust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the plainest Demonstration was, that their <hi>very God's</hi> were highly vicious, and the People were not asham'd to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, whom they were asham'd to imitate, and sometimes they ador'd him with <hi>their hands,</hi> whom they blush'd to <note place="margin">Priap.</note> see <hi>with their eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Matters did seem truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and were Effects of the best Wisdom of the Heathens, and they who were so bold as to dare to be more vicious than others, seem'd to them rightly qualified
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47219:33"/>
to be their Gods, and to whom they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Altars, and paid their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>If we pass from <hi>Heathens to Christians,</hi> and consider the first Heresies that were born in their Church; we shall be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of the truth of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for things false, and absur'd did seem true, and righteous to them.</p>
            <p>If we will gather from Church Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the several wild, and monstrous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Simon Magus, Valentinus, Cerdo, Artemas, Novatus, and Arius, those Six Heretical Patriarchs,</hi> from whom all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies sprang, or those <hi>Garrisons</hi> from <hi>whence Hereticks marcht</hi> forth as so many Troops from the <hi>Trojan Horse,</hi> and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the Christian World, we shall have cause enough to be assured, that the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of men is foolish and vain in things of the greatest, and most useful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>I need not Examine, tho' some affirm it, whether the cause thereof proceeded from the twisting together <hi>the Principles of Philosophy, and Christianity:</hi> 'Tis most certain, that they did hereby notorioufly prejudice the Christian Faith; for, they made the Professors hereof contemptible, and furnished its Adversaries <hi>with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi>

               <hi>and Provision,</hi> that is, gave them Arguments to plead against it.</p>
            <p>I could give more Instances hereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selves, in the empty and foolish Wisdom which swarms in our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies; for some of them are crowded with Persons of <hi>slight of hand,</hi> that is, such which would make others believe that they have not what they have, or have that which they have not, and were their Wisdom in Religion as <hi>sound</hi> as it seems <hi>Plausible,</hi> it would be a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant passage to Heaven, or were this their Garment as strong, and warm as 'tis slight and gay; it would apparel the Soul well, but as it is, it only cloaths it with Ribbons, and Spangles, and Laces, and thereupon it catcheth cold and dies.</p>
            <p>Others amongst us, who wear <hi>Geneva Spectacles,</hi> see they think a straitness in many crooked Inventions, and whilst they are infected with the Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Icterism,</hi> our Primitive and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Church Government will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>pure and white</hi> in their Eyes.</p>
            <p>These have made it appear, that Men have false and witless Apprehensions both in Doctrine, and Discipline.</p>
            <p>Others have trod in the same steps in Relation to good <hi>Manners;</hi> and <hi>Immoralities</hi>

as well <hi>as Errors</hi> have been approved of by them: and one main Reason hereof is, <hi>Because Vices have put on the Garments of Vertues.</hi> Sins have past without Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination <hi>for Graces,</hi> and Lusts of the <hi>Flesh</hi> for fruits of the Spirit.—The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical <note place="margin">Esay,</note> Prophet speaks of such <hi>who call Evil Good, and Good Evil,</hi> and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth <hi>a Curse</hi> against them.</p>
            <p>It is well known to us, that <hi>Barabbas</hi> seemed worthy of Pardon in the <hi>Iews</hi> Opinion, and our Saviour had the Visage of a notorious Malefactor,—The <hi>Scribes, and Pharisees</hi> conceived of Christ's Doctrine as we do of <hi>Stoical</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lectures, that is, as an Institution too rigid, and unpracticable, as a mere <hi>Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and an heap of Absurdities;—but they could spy out much Beauty, and order in <hi>old Wives Fables,</hi> and in the pale and <hi>wrinkled Traditions of men.</hi>

               <hi>natural Darkness of Mans understanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his natural Condition Man knows little of himself, and far less of God, he is a Dunce in his own Form, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Fool when he meddles higher.</p>
            <p>The Stars and Elements challenge him to give a Reason of their Influences, Motions, Order, and Productions, and baffle him: Nay, the least <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in Nature when encounter'd, will give him a Fall, as being more than Man's match to give a punctual, and satisfactory Reason of its Esience and Operations. But then when Man ventures to speak of God, he lisps and stammers, and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is disjoynted, and broken, and he prates of Religion as a Child would of Philosophy.</p>
            <p>This might easily be proved in the Scheme which might be given of the Religion, and Manners of the Heathens, who followed that Light of Nature which they found set up within them; for, by their uncertain Knowledge and Belief of the true God, they declar'd that their Light did want <hi>snuffing,</hi> and that there was more requir'd than that single <hi>Candle to</hi> lead them on to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Divine Knowledge which Man
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47219:36"/>
was made capable of.—They were wanting in that very knowledge they pretended to excel in, and wherein they proclaimed themselves <hi>Doctors,</hi> they were but <hi>Sophisters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they gave it out to the World <note place="margin">Pemb.</note> that their Understandings were grown big, and lusty by a true Digestion of their common natural Notions, and told the World that they fed well, by their thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; upon Examination it appear'd, that they had only the <hi>Rickets in their heads,</hi> and that what they took for sound thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, was but a <hi>Malignant Swelling</hi> and what they supposed an wholsom Dose of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was but a gilded <hi>Bunch of Diseases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this being the Case of Man in his <hi>Natural Dress,</hi> it is one Reason also, why his Knowledge is mistaken, and his Wisdom so thin, and thread bare that it will not hold together.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another Reason hereof is, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Because Man's understanding is mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by his Will which is in an high Degree irregular and stubborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Faculty will either hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or promote it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the Truth; for it can set the Understanding a work to consider of an Object propounded to it, or it can render it idle, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47219:36"/>
in that matter: It can put it upon exercise, and give it tools to work with, or it can be close fisted in the Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of necessary Instruments, and so ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it uncapable of acting as it should.</p>
            <p>Now that Mans Will doth naturally obstruct his Understanding that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consider as it should, and thereby apprehend Truth from Falshood, and Wisdom from Folly, may appear to all who can see it in its native Colours, and can perceive its dogged and ill-natur'd Qualities; and how easie it is first to be deceived it self, and then to put tricks upon others?—<hi>It is the Nature of it to love it self:</hi> It affects to be comply'd with, and can naturally as little brook opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it can the truth:—What at first it undertakes to maintain, it will prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute; and when it hath <hi>espous'd</hi> a Tenet, it <hi>plights its Troth to it during life;</hi> that is, during Mans natural Condition, and till Grace have form'd another better life in him.</p>
            <p>2dly. As Mans Will loves it self, so ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quality in its Nature is, <hi>that it is very stubborn and peevish:</hi> For, it will do all it self without consulting right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and it will not have patience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the superiour Faculty, the Iudgment,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47219:37"/>
to deliberate upon any Subject propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it.</p>
            <p>If it were so charitable to the <hi>lame and blind Iudgment</hi> as to seek it out <hi>an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital</hi> where it might be recovered: If so officious, as to afford it all the helps it could to render it as sound as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was distemper'd, which it might do by propounding to it Holy Writ, as the Rule of Wisdom and Truth, and the most proper Object to be thought upon, and consider'd by it; then it might be useful, first to discover, and then to vanquish Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; first to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thus we have seen, that because of the Blind Understanding, and stubborn fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Will of Man, it comes to pass, that he thinks he hath fill'd his Soul with true Knowledge and Wisdom, when it is really far otherwise.</p>
            <p>Now though these be the chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his Mistake; yet I shall mention, and but mention a few other <hi>ex Abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> that no want of weight may appear, and these are those ill qualities of <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found in Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Precipitation is a rash Iudgment of a thing unknown;</hi> or when the mind being carried away with some force, or Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, doth not consider a matter so as is fit, and thereupon follows Confusion in Ideas, and then Error of Iudgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prejudice is a certain anticipated Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, caus'd from the Impression of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and this is the more strong for that it grows with our Age: For, we make
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47219:39"/>
almost infinite unwarrantable Iudgments before we have the full use of Reason; and these are more increas'd and fix'd than corrected, and amended with our Age; so that now they are accounted as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>common Notions drawn from Nature it self,</hi> and allow'd by long use and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom; and we esteem it an unseemly thing to gainsay them; and yet for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof in the case before us, note, that the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and Troubles of Mans Soul, lead him on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>'Tis true, the Wanton acts that he may have Pleasure, and not Shame and Disease; and the Thief robs to get Gain; but the <hi>last end</hi> follows these which are interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,

and that is Death, nay Deaths; for it is Spiritual and Eternal.</p>
            <p>And this will be found true in every vicious Course that wicked Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, and take to be vertuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause pleasing to their carnal Appetites; for since the keeping of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are recompenced with a <hi>double Reward</hi> of this Life, and a better, 'twill follow that the breaking of them may be recompenced with a <hi>double Death,</hi> and indeed in one and the same Vice, not only a double Death, but a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold way of Destruction may be found, as shall appear as we proceed.</p>

            <p>Thus Heresie, the Calenture, Plague and Poyson of our Souls, winds up fatal Bottoms for us, and procures not only one, but many ways of Death. 2. As for those <hi>Carnal ways of</hi> Pleasure and Delight, and of worldly Gain, and Profit which deceive most Persons; many of them, as Murder, Rebellion, Sodomy, Thieft
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47219:42"/>
and others, are the High Roads to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Punishents, and many instead of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Riches, and Content from them, have been put off with <hi>an Ax, or an Halter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet if the eye of the Law cannot spy them, or they escape the Execution of it, yet Death will not be so baffled or deluded; for if they run from one, yet another Death will overtake and Arrest them; tho' they run <hi>from the Corporal,</hi> yet the <hi>spiritual Death</hi> will draw its <hi>Bow,</hi> and fix its <hi>Dart</hi> in them: Tho' they live to the World, yet they are dead to Grace; walking Carcasses living in Tombs, and Sepulchres, having putrid, and rotten Souls.</p>
            <p>And in good earnest, such a <hi>living Death</hi> was accounted no Contradiction even amongst the <hi>Heathens,</hi> for Persons who <hi>ran-counter</hi> to Philosophical Rules, and whose Actions seemed wise only thro' the <hi>Medium</hi> of their sensitive Appetites, were by them esteemed Dead, and no better than rotten and stinking Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses.</p>
            <p>Now to avoid this Soul Death, the better sort of <hi>Heathens</hi> have physick'd themselves by mortifying their Bodies; for they supposing that corporeal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47219:42"/>
were as great Murderers as <hi>Syrens,</hi> who sang Persons into their fatal Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, did prescribe a moral Purge, and a strong one too, called by the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>—which was a <hi>whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Lecture for beating down those Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which rose up against Reason,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the Body a downey softness, and did flide them down into the Gulph of iniquity; and they <hi>unstitched</hi> their Souls from too much sticking to bodily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and then proposed to them the love of Vertue and heavenly Matters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Stoicks</hi> used the same Medicine against this kind of Soul Death, or <hi>Hectic</hi> of Vertue, for their <hi>Doctors,</hi> or great Philosophers prescrib'd their Schollars things severe and laborious, for some were willing to be bound, and others that their Bodies should smart with Rods and Whips.</p>
            <p>How sad, and lamentable his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, who through counterfeit Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and false Wisdom hath brought his Soul into the Snares of Death, may appear, because in this Case it is stripp'd stark naked of all Grace and Vertue; and it being <hi>thus swept and garnished,</hi> the Devil enters in and takes Possession of it as of a Tenement of his own; thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47219:43"/>
to him, and there Commands as a most cruel and bloody Tyrant, and is not this Condition sad?</p>
            <p>Should we see a Person all naked, bowed down and sadled, and whipt into a full <hi>Career</hi> by the Devil thro' <hi>Church-Yards, and over Vaults, and Monuments of dry Bodies</hi> and Rottenness; we would be much affected with the hideous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Person, and account it su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Misery, and in Anticipation of Hell it self: Yet such is every one, who through his own <hi>Glass</hi> looks well, and at the same time is Domineer'd over by his carnal Appetite; for, he's possessed, and at the Command of Satan, and is taken out, and Rid up and down by him where he pleaseth. And could this be made appear to his Senses it would horribly affright, and make him break <hi>his Glass</hi> through which such a prodigious Monster did look fair and lovely.</p>
            <p>But because this sort of Death is one of <hi>a subtle Nature,</hi> and Persons wedded to their Senses, and corpulent in Vice, do not apprehend it, and think there's no such Matter because they cannot see it, 'tis too too thin to catch hold of their Senses; and they too too thick for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47219:43"/>
and Soul Notions: It will be necessary to acquaint them with another Death, which is after these we have mentioned, and that <hi>is Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now such Persons as we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, may escape the first violent Death, being not capitally punished in this Life, but they shall not escape this last Death; if they cheat the <hi>Gibbet,</hi> and seare their Consciences, yet they shall meet an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death, with Satan their Lord and Master.</p>
            <p>Were it possible for a Man to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways stabbing and slaying his Soul with Wantonness, Pride, Covetousness, and other Vices; and yet not smart as would his Body if consum'd with Ulcers and Dropsies, yet the dart <hi>of Eternal Death</hi> is too too sharp not to be felt, and this will plainly appear if we consider what eternal Death is.</p>
            <p>And it is the <hi>state of the Demned: It is a cursed departing from Christ into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire:</hi> It is <hi>Blackness of Darkness for ever; the Worm which never dies, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation, and Everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And were it possible for me to tell you all the pains of loss, and sense wrapt up in this shroud of Death; what it is to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47219:44"/>
be punish'd with everlasting Destruction from the <hi>presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his power;</hi> what it is to dwell, and to dwell for ever in a Lake of Fire, fed with Brimstone; what it is to have a Worm, and that Worm as <hi>long as Eternity,</hi> to be knawing and grinding our Souls.</p>
            <p>Could I read, and explain all the Deeds and Conveyances of Hell, to shew you the Lease, the for ever Lease that the Damned have got for their Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the bottomless Pit.</p>
            <p>Could I but describe to you the <hi>nature of Eternal Death,</hi> you must conclude that 'tis too too keen not to be perceiv'd, and too certain and evident not to be avoided; and they who get this Prize for their running, and these Wages for their labour, must needs be in a very sad, and doleful condition, their end is such an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death.</hi>

            <p>Such, such Employs and Meditations are suitable for Christians high-born, and precious Souls; and when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in them, they will be able to act according to the Prescriptions of true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge.</p>

            <p>Ask a poor Wretch who hath sadly experienc'd their Cheats, what he can say in this case; and he can tell you, that they only shew'd him Pleasures which did bloodily scratch and bite him, pleasant Groves tenanted with Tygers, spacious Walks ending in bottomless Gulphs; loaded Dishes, and Golden Cups, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied over with Swords and Halberds, and underneath the Table lay in one place the <hi>Man made with Bones, and his Dart in his Hand;</hi> and hard by a ghastly Ghost with this Label from him: <hi>Dying but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dead</hi>

            <p>But if this Relation gain no Credit, then if we dare be so bold, call we up the Ghosts of <hi>Doeg, Haman and Iudas,</hi> and ask them how it now fares with them, for their Treachery, Pride, and Cruelty. Go, go, incredulous Fools, and raise up <hi>Corah, Dathan, and Abiram,</hi> and

ask them how Schism thrives, and what the end of it was, and is to them: Is it not for ever miserable?</p>
            <p>If we are not hoarse, and have still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Courage left us, call we once more upon <hi>the rich Man, and covetous Fool,</hi> and ask them to what end their Pomp and worldly Mindedness brought them? ask them who requir'd their Souls of them when their Barns were full of Grain, and their Cellars of the best Wine? and they must tell you that it was the Devil, and his Angels with whom they dwell for ever.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Examples</hi> may, and should set before us the great Delusions which these our fore-mention'd Enemies use towards our Souls, and the unhappy Condition they bring us into, and how at last they <hi>decoy</hi> us into that Death whose Torments are as impossible to be express'd, as to be endured; Endless, Eternal Torments.</p>
            <p>And now my hearty and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desire is, that for God's and our Souls sake, we would fix our Thoughts upon this <hi>unparallel'd Tragedy;</hi> and that thereupon we would this day, this hour begin, or if we have done so, continue to loath the softest Embraces of the World, and arm our selves against all the Darts of

            <p>The case is plain; we have had base usage from them, for their Delights lead to Misery, their Riches to Poverty, their Sweets to Bitterness and their Heaven to Hell; wherefore there is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son imaginable that we should practice the utmost degree of revenge and hatred against them.</p>
            <p>And whilst we make these our Foes, and hate them, let us make God our Friend, and love him; and since we can't do it our selves, it highly concerns us to procure such a Friend who can, and will assist us, and will (if we be not wanting to our selves) put us into the right way of true Wisdom and Vertue, even that <hi>way</hi> whose end <hi>is Pleasantness and Peace.</hi> And that he would do so, let us beg of him in our daily Devotions that he <hi>would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Goings in his paths that our foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps may not slide,</hi> and that he would give us a Love to his Law, and a right Understanding of it, and a rectified Will to obey all the Precepts therein prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and a sober, serious, and settled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and Perseverance herein to our lives end.</p>

            <p>Now that he really doth so, and how, and why he and all mortified Christians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish this difficult Task, shall at present be made known to you, and for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Demonstration</hi> hereof, I shall shew that tho' the word <hi>Sorrow</hi> bears several mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet in some Degree, each of them produce Ioy and Profit, as may be seen especially in two Instances, which may give us an Occasion of thinking upon more in our private Meditations.</p>
            <p>Now the first Instance is, That the <note place="margin">First Instance.</note> word <hi>Sorrow signifies Anger,</hi> and this is <hi>the Root of Ioy and Gain.</hi> I do not mean such an Anger as is excessive and reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But, <hi>That whereby one Person chides and corrects another for his Faults;</hi> and this Angry Sorrow is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Transgressor, than if he were smiled upon, and applauded for his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:—For looking upon him with a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Brow, and giving him a biting, smart <hi>Iuniper Lecture,</hi> he may amend his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47219:49"/>
Manners, and hereby his Soul may be rub'd and furbish'd up, and look much brighter, <hi>i. e.</hi> more Vertuous than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But, by Flattery, he may be stroak'd with one hand, when wounded with the other; nay, he may suffer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hereby, for it is compar'd to <hi>Milk;</hi> and as no Poison kills sooner than that which is drank herein, for its Nature is so thin and subtil, that all of it soon turns into Poison, so the Poison of evil Manners being mixed with the Milk of Insinuation and enticeing words, and with some Lip Sugar, it will prove mortally dangerous and hurtful, and this Condition is much worse than Sorrow; and this is the first Instance. <note place="margin">Second.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This word <hi>Sorrow,</hi> as it signifies An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>may be referred to God himself,</hi> as to the Ioyful, and good effect it may cause. For it was the Opinion of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that it was much better when God look'd upon the Old World, and the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and other egregious Sinners severely, by whipping them with a Deluge, and a Fire, and Plagues, and Diseases, then when he forbore Execution on them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by seemed to be their Friend, and take no notice of their Sins, but to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like themselves; for in Allusion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47219:50"/>
the World is like <hi>a Free School</hi> the Inhabitants of it never look so careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their Books, as when the <hi>Rod is in their Masters hand.</hi> Aptly hereto faith Almighty God, when <hi>Ismote them they sought me:</hi> and faith the Prophet, <note place="margin">Psal.</note> when <hi>God's Iudgments are in the Land, the Inhabitants thereof will learn righteousness:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 26. 9.</note> And another Prophet saith, <hi>in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they will seek me early.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hos,</hi> 5. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, God's Lenity <hi>engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Sinners obstinacy, and Indulgence doth not melt, but harden them, like the <hi>Beasts</hi> to which they are compar'd, they are rather driven out of their evil ways by fear, than lead to Vertue by any kindness and Good-will: For, let <hi>favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will they not learn righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 26. 10.</note> So that God is rather Angry when he shews none; such Pity, and Compassion is cruel; and it carries a sorer stroak with it, than that heat of God's Anger which ripens the Patient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good Manners, for when God gives the Sinner his Request, and withal sends <hi>leanness into his Soul,</hi> when he stops the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 15.</note> Scourge, and says hold, <hi>smite them no more,</hi> then is God very angry.—You know, Persons in an Hectick Fever, the more full, the more lean they are, the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47219:50"/>
more they eat, the more they consume, because of the <hi>Atrophy,</hi> or Consumption joyn'd usually with that Disease, so it is with unsorrowful wicked Men, their good outward Condition destroys them, for then they are froward and regardless of God; for, he says to <hi>Israel,</hi> I spake <hi>unto them in their Prosperity,</hi> but they said, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 21. 5.</note> 
               <hi>We will not hear,</hi> and since they were, and they who imitate them are so froward as we have heard, let them note, that with such <hi>God will shew himself froward,</hi> and 'tis very terrible to lye under the Rod of a froward God. So that 'tis much better that God punish than indulge; for as they are the more <hi>Orient Pearls,</hi> which are got in the more tempestuous weather, so are they the better Men, who are exercis'd with the more severe Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; for as it shall appear, where the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is sad by Sorrow, and Affliction, there <note place="margin">N. B.</note> the Soul is chearful by Instruction, and Discipline.</p>
            <p>It is true, God hath brought the <hi>evil</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>of Misery</hi> into the World, for he hath framed it, and there is none of that sort, but he hath appointed it; but it is true also, that he hath put Man into a way to discover it, and to desend himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, or make a profitable use of it;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47219:51"/>
for as God hath given Beasts natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and Weapons against that which is destructive to them; the hard Skin, the Hoof, the Horn, the Tusk, the Bristle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are clear Demonstrations hereof; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of these, he hath endow'd Man with Reason, and Wisdom, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are not outward but inward, not in the Body, but the Soul.</p>
            <p>Now unless there were Evils which Man should be aware of, and which he might distinguish from matters in their own Nature good and beneficial, he should have no need of Reason, and Wisdom, or at least there would <hi>be one end</hi> lost for which they were given. So that things good and bad are propounded to him because he is Rational and Wise, and the force hereof is seen in his discerning the one from the other.</p>
            <p>But now to make a good use and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the evil of Misery, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater degree of Wisdom, than only how to know it, and therefore God cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>' it be griping with Sorrow and Grief, than that we should be let alone, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, and die with Ease.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Philosophers called <hi>Stoicks</hi> are of another Opinion, for they say, that all Sorrow and Grief of mind should <note place="margin">Lib. de cult, div.</note> be rooted out of Mans Soul.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lactantius</hi> argues against them from the impossibility of the Effect, if it should be attempted;—for who (<hi>saith he,</hi>) can abstain here from, if either a Plague consumes his Countrey, or an Enemy invade, or a Tyrant oppress it; can a Man not grieve when his Liberty is snatched away, or when his Friends, or good Men are banished, or cruelly slaughter'd, unless he be so stupified as to have no use of his Senses? So that whilst we are sensitive, we must (as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion offers,) be sorrowful Creatures: To say we won't lament, or be sad tho' Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the blackest Complexion meet us, or we won't vent a sigh at the most dismal Tydings, are words which cannot be made good, <hi>mere vapours,</hi> which will vanish away when we are put to the Tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:47219:52"/>Our great Lord and Master, who groaned in compassion to the two Sisters, and wept near their Brother <hi>Lazarus's</hi> Grave; and upon the thought of the terrible doom of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> gave another, and better Doctrine in his Example.</p>
            <p>So that Sorrow and Distress upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is necessary; and to make a Vertue of this Necessity is a business which we should learn, and go about, and will be an excellent proof of <hi>Ioyful Sorrow,</hi> and that Grief is much better than Mirth.</p>
            <p>Now to drive this <hi>nail</hi> (in allusion to <note place="margin">Eccles.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon's</hi> saying) the deeper in before we fully <hi>clinch,</hi> and fasten it. We must note, that there are several sorts of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Adversities, and Evils, and all of them, except those which are procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Lusts and vicious Habits, and the Prevalency (<hi>through our own neglect</hi>) of seducing Temptations, are better than the Worlds Smiles, or Grinnings upon us through outward ease and content.</p>
            <p>As for instance; There are those which are temporal and corporal, as the Adversities of this Life and Death; and <note place="margin">

               </note> there are those which are spiritual, such as corrupt Suggestions, and inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and Soul-trials; and all these are better than constant Encrease, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,

            <p>It is said of one <hi>Damianus,</hi> a Man rich in Grace, though poor in Purse, that when Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 10th. took him <note place="margin">

               </hi> found true at the City <hi>Larin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go;</hi> for therein was a Tower built of that Wood, which being surrounded with Flames received no damage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47219:53"/>Thus the true Christian is not made worse by any outward Calamity, but more capable to resist and profit by it. When <hi>Luperus</hi> had thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd his Obligation to <hi>Meletus.</hi>—For this Discovery, he thus proceeded, I need not fling away an Argument to prove that Sorrow and Calamity will require some Art and Diligence to make them joyful, in making them beneficial and servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Water must be forc'd from Stills, and so must that of Grace sometimes by Severity.</hi> However, a good Christian can (through Divine assistance) as compleatly work it, as a Tradesman can a crooked Tree, or a rugged Horn to become a useful Table, or Cup. And in his Profession he hath been taught to do so after this manner, and by these degrees.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>He owns all his sorrowful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come from God:</hi> He spies God's Arrow in his Wound, and his Nails in those Scratches by which he bleeds; and this is the fountain of his Ioy, and the root of all the wholesome fruit which is gather'd from his Griefs and Perplexities: For God is his <hi>Father,</hi> and he intends him good in this hard usage. And then upon this occasion, he <hi>searcheth, and trys his ways, and confesseth, and bewailes his</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:47219:54"/>
               <hi>sins;</hi> and hereupon he patiently submits to God's power, that so he may not seem to slight his Correction, and declare his own Presumption; and finally, he is <hi>careful in these his sad Circumstances to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in new Obedience;</hi> and in the exercise hereof he doth patiently hope for the end which God hath appointed, and till then waits his leisure.</p>
            <p>Thus the true Christian hath made his <hi>Poison medicinal, and his Iron soft:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath candied and made palliata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Gentian, Rew and Wormwood,</hi> and the rest of his bitter Herbs; that is, he hath made his Sorrows and Distresses as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to his Soul, as upon occasion his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician and Surgeon</hi> hath made Pains and Smarts advantageous to his Body.</p>
            <p>I have said that a true Christian by the foresaid manner hath done thus, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily none else can; for as it is reported, that if those who live by the <hi>Deadsea</hi> put <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47219:55"/>And since 'tis thus, Sorrows are not <hi>Plagues</hi> to infect and destroy; but <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> to reform and cure: As to God's Purpose, their Nature is balmy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, not cruel and destructive: This is the Nature of a sorrowful Condition, and the <hi>Inward Argument</hi> to prove it joyful, and better than outward Prosperity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Outward Argument</hi> is drawn <hi>from the fruit,</hi> as this <hi>was from the Root of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive Sorrow;</hi> and that this is its fruit, shall be shewn, partly in reference to this kind of Sorrow in general, and partly as to some of it in a more especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Now in general, Sorrow or Adversity hath an admirable good Influence upon; and is very beneficial to the Inward part, or Soul of Man, for <hi>it puts it upon Exercise and Action;</hi> and this is better for it than to be idle and sloathful; this finds it E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to contend with, and so to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove its Art of spiritual Wrestling; this convinces the World that this sorrowful Soul is holy and vertuous; for as there can be no Victory without an Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so there can be no Vertue without the evil of Misery or Sorrow.</p>
            <p>Now that Exercise herein hath made Mans Soul better than otherwise it could
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47219:55"/>
be, hath been confirm'd by <hi>Heathens,</hi> and may be by our own <hi>Experiences: Seneca,</hi> in his first Chapter of Providence, says;
<q>That God does not dandle a good Man, or make him his Fondling; but hardens and tries him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him for himself under the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Calamity.</q> And in his second Chapter, he says;
<q>That Vertue withers without an Adversary, and that then it only appears how great and excellent it is, when it declares how the Soul can so  order it as to make it useful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover, He quotes this saying of</hi> Demetrius <hi>as excellent, namely;</hi> Nothing seems to me more unhappy than that Person who was never in a sad and doleful estate; for he hath no occasion to try himself; he seems too unworthy, and too weak to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fortune, for she slightes each lasie Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on and tells us, That</hi> Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity dwells among the Vulgar, and conver seth with inferiour and shallow Wits; but it is the Office of a good and great Man to subdue Calamities, or make them serviceable to him, and either to break such stones, or therewith to build up a place in his Soul for Vertue to dwell in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47219:56"/>
               <hi>Once more he bespeaks his Friend thus;</hi> I account thee miserable, because thou never wast in Misery: Thou hast spent thy self without an Antagonist, and no body knows what thou couldst do, no not thy self; and yet there is need of a Trial to know that; Souldiers glory in Wounds, Ship masters in Storms; and in Battel thou canst best know a valiant Man: <hi>After this manner he goes on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must leave this Philosopher, and shew, that besides this Outward Evidence of the bettering quality of Sorrow or Adversity, real Christians have another <hi>Within,</hi> which is, their own <hi>Experience;</hi> for they perceive themselves to have grown taller and bigger in all Christian Vertues hereby, in these <hi>Waters</hi> they find themselves more clean, and in these <hi>Fires</hi> less drossy than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>And here permit me to <hi>appeal</hi> to your selves, and tell me; have not your Souls relish'd good and holy matters more, much more under some of <hi>God's smart Stroaks,</hi> than when he let you alone, and seemed not to regard what you did: When he hath snatcht from you a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an helpful Friend, or a plentiful Estate; when by Distempers he hath
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47219:56"/>
sow'd Paleness in your Cheeks, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in your Consciences, by giving you a sense of the Danger, and Vileness of your sins; have you not then been better min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than formerly, more ready to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and reformed, or at least to <hi>wish</hi> your selves much better than you <hi>are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may all see, that Sorrows have whetted our Souls by Exercise, and so made them more keen and bright; that is, <hi>more active and gracious,</hi> than they were without them.</p>
            <p>And they continue to do so, because they put them upon the necessary <hi>Duty of Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:</hi> For hereby we shall consider not only the Author of our Sorrows, who is God, and so submit; but also what good may be gained by it, and this may prove advantageous to our Souls, by advancing Purity, and Reformation of Manners in them: For they must be well <hi>ploughed and harrowed;</hi> that is, have much Instruction bestowed on them to make them capable to bear <hi>ripe fruit in cold Seasons,</hi> and they must, like some Birds noted by Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists, put on their Wings the <hi>wild Rew</hi> of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Causin. Symb. &amp;c.</note> sorrowful Mortification before they can fly from the rapacious Cruelty of those <hi>Cats</hi> which would devour them; and if
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47219:57"/>
they do so, then they will answer this Charge and Trouble about them, and be fruitful in obedience to God's Will in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Charity, Humility, Patience, <hi>&amp;c</hi> for as <hi>Iron</hi> if it be not used becomes <hi>Rusty,</hi> and cannot be serviceable till it be knockt, and burnt, and hammer'd; so when carnal Security hath once prevail'd, and become strong in us, we cannot be well fitted for the Exercise of any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties, till we be made sorrowful by Distresses: But hereupon we shall shine forth with all those <hi>Lights,</hi> that is, <hi>Graces</hi> which descend <hi>from the Father of Lights;</hi> all our former Barrenness in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 15. 17.</note> Christian vertues shall be purged away, and we shall abound so far herein, <hi>As to be fruitful in every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this general Account how Sorrows are made Ioyful, and profitable, I shall add in performance of my former Promise to you, some particular ones, by which our Souls become more rich in Grace, and Vertue, then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—</p>
            <p>And the first of these is <hi>Sickness.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>First.</hi> Salvian, de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. Dei <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</note>—For hereby our Souls gain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over our Bodies, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might Rebel, and give them much Vexation; and those headstrong Vices
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47219:57"/>
which have run away with them, such as Malice, Pride, Anger, Distrust, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soriousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are hereby hank'd and kept in from doing us any Mischief: And when they are so, that saying of <hi>Salvian</hi> a primitive Bishop, may be said of them, that they <hi>were ill when well, and well whenill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a particular manner also, <hi>Losses</hi> may make us better, and so become joyful to us; for before these were sent, there was an <hi>Intus existens prohibens,</hi> or some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hindrance to our Souls growing in Grace. But now this is removed, and better Goods may fill its place; eternal instead of temporal, and lasting instead of those which are slight and perishing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we must note, That the <hi>Poverty</hi> which is hereby inflicted, is more gainful than all the Goods we lose, for as primitive Discipline hath taught us, <hi>Poverty is a safe Castle, a quiet Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Next to this be pleased to observe that,—The very Sorrow of a <hi>Prison</hi> is joyful and advantageous; for, <hi>Fetters and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles</hi> may draw us to Goodness, when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47219:58"/>
the <hi>Cords</hi> of Love and Freedom cannot; those may bind and weaken our Lusts, as strong as <hi>Sampson,</hi> and fling stones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Foreheads of these sturdy <hi>Goliahs,</hi> and make them fall when more kind usage may be snapt asunder like threads, <hi>That is,</hi> prove wholly ineffectual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iosephs Imprisonment</hi> did not procure him more outward Honour than inward Improvement, for he became thereby devout to God and serviceable, and Loyal to his Master, and temperate, Chast, and sober to himself in <note place="margin">

            <p>Now <hi>Luperus</hi> having by these special Cases confirm'd his <hi>Problem of Ioyful</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, was passing on to the more inward and invisible Instances which might gain our Credit hereto, and give us more excellent Demonstrations of it, and those are the <hi>spiritual Conflicts of our</hi> Souls: Wherein he would inform us; how our Souls are advantaged, and so made joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful-by them: But considering that what is <hi>put off, is not put out,</hi> and that present

               <hi>Comfort,</hi> and this he doth by infusing Doubts and Scruples, with which it shall contend with much Perplexity and Trouble.</p>
            <p>However, the Contentions which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise hereupon shall be useful to it, and much more than a <hi>mistaken</hi> Peace and Quietness: For hereupon the Soul prays to God with mournful Tears, that it may have power to quench the fiery Darts of this his troublesome and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Enemy.

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47219:60"/>
               <hi>that is,</hi> my <hi>sorrowful thoughts within me, thy Comforts, O Lord, delight my Soul:</hi>—In the Crowd of them, and when they were strong and bulkey, God with his helping hand did enlarge them, now the word <note place="margin">Moller. <hi>in Psal.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>enlarge,</hi> signifies <hi>that he opened a passage</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>for him out of the Calamity in which he was shut up, and besieged.</hi> and to the same Purpose, he says, <hi>I called on the Lord in my Distress, and he set me in a large place,</hi> that is, <hi>He was in straits, and God opened them that he might pass out from them:</hi> He unlock'd the Prison, repair'd his Losses. <note place="margin">N. B.</note> took away his Contempt, made his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his fierce Enemies, to be at Peace with him.</p>
            <p>Now from this Example we see, that by how much the more our Sorrows are heavy, by so much the more God's Grace will be powerful in the easing of them.—He will distil some secret Ioy into the hearts of the Distressed, which like Bladders may keep them up from sinking into the Gulph, the Deep, and irrecoverable Gulpn of Despair.—Now this infused Divine Comfort brings more Delight, and so is much better than all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Accidents, which we can meet with, can bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47219:60"/>
and Oppressor, cannot in their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent usages be so Ioyful, as they are, in their Sufferings by them. So that, here is an inward Delight which righteous Sufferers shall receive from God, which is far better than outward Ease, for it is inward quietness and peace of Conscience, which infinitely exceeds all other Ioys without them.</p>
            <p>Now after this manner said <hi>Luperus,</hi> I have resolv'd the <hi>World's Riddle,</hi> and <hi>seeming Contradiction</hi> of <hi>Ioyful Sorrow,</hi>—and discover'd it to be not only <hi>Ioyful,</hi> but <hi>much Better</hi> than those Ioyful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights which have a far fairer outward Complexion. And I shall proceed to shew you, what an admirable Treasure is laid open by this Discovery to make our Souls rich, and how we may secure them from all that outward Misfortune which may be injurious to them, and Pillage them of this their wealthy and comfortable Condition.</p>
            <p>And in order hereto; Note, that from what hath been said, we may be put in mind <hi>of Almighty Gods goodness, and love in intending good, and in taking care for his Servants in their worst Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If sometimes he think fit to make them smart and bleed, yet even then he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47219:61"/>
takes care to make them better by this Severity. If he will rub them with Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yet even then he intends to make them shine in the Exercise of many Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Parent sees his Child's Ear bored, but his end is not to bleed it, but to hang the Ring and Iewel in it: In like manner does our Heavenly Father when he sorrowfully afflicts his Children; in so doing, he makes them rich in Graces.</p>
            <p>So that God chastiserh his Servants not from Anger, but Love: Nay, he is so kind and beneficial in dispensing his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that sometimes the Sorrows which he deals to some, not only <hi>better them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but many others</hi> also: Not unlike some Physician, who (as my Author says) burns the Thumb that he may cure the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> or <hi>Pain in the Hip;</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Remedy in one place, when the Malady is in another. As when God is severe with the Parent, Natural or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, that he may heal their Children or Subjects from their Vices; and when he bleeds the Subjects that he may save their King from his Lusts: So that God hath several ways to save good and vertuous Persons, and all proceeds from Care and Goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:47219:61"/>Persons who neglect to mind seriously the Dispensations of Divine Providence, and are ignorant of the admirable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Manner of God's dealing with his own Servants in this World, are apt to take every Sorrow which God sends to them, as a sign of his Anger, and to think that there can be no Love in the <hi>Heart</hi> whilst the Frown is in the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to others who understand him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is a sign that God is not angry; but hereby healing them of their Sins, the worst of Maladies; and so have a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration from him of a Love not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Benevolence, but of Complacency and Delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let this suffice to be said of the first Lesson which we should learn from God's dealing severely with us in this World: The next is this; namely,</p>
            <p>That we should fix our Thoughts upon the End, and Reasons why God brings us into the Sorrows which we have describ'd, and comply therewith.</p>
            <p>If he sends them as <hi>Plaisters</hi> to cure us of our sins by Repentance, it would much unbeseem us to be so <hi>Childish as to rend them off</hi> before they have wrought the Cure: The puling, whinning, restless
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47219:62"/>
Patients are very troublesom to their Physitians; we should by no means be so to God: But when we drink the bitter Potions, or see the black Cloud over us, or in the Royal Prophet's Phrase, <hi>When the Iniquity of our Heels compass us about;</hi> that is, <hi>when we are persecuted by unjust Men closely, or crasty Men lay Snares for us:</hi> Then go we to our <hi>Apartments,</hi> and by Meditation and Prayer, consider and enquire why it is so with us. If because Vice abounds amongst us, let us beseech God <hi>that he would give us true Repentance, and forgive us all our Sins, Negligences and and Ignorances, and endue us with the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to amend our Lives according to his Holy Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If because through Carking Care and Covetousness, and by permissive Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Custom, we have lent of our Substance upon Covenant for Advantage and Gain, against the Divine Precept, <note place="margin">St. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 35.</note> which enjoins us to <hi>do good, and to lend, hoping for nothing again.</hi> Let it be our Prayer to God that be would deliver <hi>us from all hardness of Heart, and contempt of his Word and Commandment:</hi> And that he would be our <hi>Ruler and Guide, that we may so pass through things temporal, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll.</hi> 4. p. Tr. S.</note> that finally we lose not the things eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47219:62"/>If to try our gracious <hi>evil overcoming Temper</hi> to our Enemies, we should pray as our great Master did; <hi>Father forgive them they know not what they do.</hi> If, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to others, we should lay out our <hi>Talents</hi> of Patience and Long-suffering, and not hide them in a <hi>Napkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we thus exercise our selves, as we are here advis'd, then we shall regard God's End in our Sorrows and Distresses, and he will reward us with the end of our Hopes, the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
            <p>And now as a <hi>Preface to my Conclusion,</hi> which may release your confined Patience, which as to our present occasion hath <hi>wrought its perfect work,</hi> my hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is, That our chief Study would be to live well, and to add to our stature in Piety and Vertue, and to <hi>shine more and more to a perfect day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not only our Duty at all times, but our advantage when we are in <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> and not only an evidence that we have a good Title to God's Promises, but an additional security for the payment of them to us; for hereby we declare that we love God, and then may be sure that <hi>all things,</hi> that is, <hi>all sorrowful Persecutions</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>and Afflictions shall work together for our good;</hi> and hereby we shall shew that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47219:63"/>
God's <hi>Physick</hi> hath workt with us, and that which first made us sick, hath now made us well.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Since as far as our Lives are from God's Commands to obey them, so far are God's Ears from our Prayers to hear them; therefore let us live well that in time of <hi>Sorrow</hi> we may pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with Success, otherwise we may have many Sorrows in the best cause, and yet have no reward for such Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; and the Sacrifice of our Lives, even for Religion and Loyalty, shall be esteem'd by God but as <hi>the Cutting off a Dog's Neck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We bewail the common Evils we lie under, and we may well withdraw, and weep for them: But if we sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see better days, we should strive to live better Lives; and to this end we should humbly, and with our whole Hearts, beseech Almighty God to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the various Dispensations of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to us; that is, <hi>cause us to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, meekly, and patiently in our Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> To hate all manner of Vice, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Schism, and to have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with those Works of Darkness; and if God hath given us holy Courage to be Confessors and Witnesses of his Truth, to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47219:63"/>
bless him for that excellent Gift. To wait his leisure for the Redemption of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from all their Troubles; and in the mean time to lie secure by <hi>Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> under his warm and comforting Wing; and now and then, in a submissive and resigning posture, say, <hi>Make no long tarrying, O our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus let us pray, and thus believe, and thus live, and in due time God will <hi>awake and arise,</hi> and answer our Requests, and we shall reap in Ioy, and be exceeding glad in his Salvation.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47219:64"/>
that hereupon it is such a coarse and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Garment put upon us, which no Art can make fine and fit for use: Was now made a Convert, and became <hi>Luperus's</hi> Captive by the power and dint of his. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: And observing that the chief means to continue him in this free and happy Captivity, (as he now thought it) was God's Grace, and through that, his own Compliance with it; and this to be obtain'd by <hi>Asking, Seeking, and Knocking;</hi> and these Qualifications to be demonstrated in <hi>Prayer:</hi> Did thirst to hear some apposite Lecture upon that Office; and to free the Road from all Obstacles which might defeat the Efficacy of it, he propounded that the <hi>Object of true Prayer</hi> might be plainly made known, and the Objections arising here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon entirely vanquished; for, unless this be done by a true Recognition of the true God when we pray, we shall have as little success hereby, as if we pray'd to <hi>Neptune</hi> or <hi>AEolus</hi> for help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an <hi>Ocean</hi> of Storms and Perils: Or as those <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> had, who pray'd to him to vindicate his Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty against the only Omnipotent and <note place="margin">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47219:64"/>
suspected to be an erroneous, if not a worse, Religionist, that he might receive a like Conviction from such a Lecture, which himself had from the former.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Theosebius,</hi> a Person worthy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theosebius,</hi> one who pray'd to God only.</note> of Praise for his worthy Devotions which no <hi>Battology,</hi> or Impertinencies could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, was by <hi>Glycon</hi> requested to speak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject: <hi>Theosebius,</hi> an humble, meek, and zealous Man, and therefore rightly qualified for the Exercise of that Duty whose Object he was solicited to discourse upon, was not ready to answer this Desire: But told <hi>Glycon</hi> more by his Countenance than Tongue, that he was willing to decline it: But <hi>Glycon</hi> by some sweet and passionate Expressions, which were familiar with him, beseech'd him to declare the reason of his denial, and was herein complied with; for <hi>Theosebius</hi> told him that he soresaw that he should meet with many rubs in his progress by many obsolete and thread-bare Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore could not be so cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that Undertaking as their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations might require. <hi>Sebagius</hi> did perceive a warm Reflection to be cast upon him, and that this <hi>Remora</hi> to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius's</hi> Enterprize did look a squint upon his private Sentiments; and therefore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47219:65"/>
said with a Lip smoother than is usual with many of his Perswasion, that if any thing was delivered contrary to his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would make it known in as short <hi>Parenthesis</hi> to his design, as the nature of it could bear: And that he would promise that sincere Conversion should tread in the heels of <hi>Theosebius's</hi> solid Conviction, and that he would ask no Questions for Contradiction, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution sake: Upon these Conditions <hi>Theosebius</hi> denied himself some ease to give his Friends theirs, by yielding to their Wishes, and spake after this manner chiefly upon Prayer.</p>

            <p>Moreover, to Pray to God in the depth of our Sorrows, as <hi>Ionas</hi> did in that of the Sea, is an Act of Faith, and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God to help us, for he never fails those who trust in him; and because <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did so, therefore did his heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: And faith the Prophet, <hi>Thou wilt</hi>

            <p>And indeed we can find apt redress against all our afflictive Sorrows no where else, and by no other means; for we cannot of our selves deserve and purchase it.—If the most just God should give us our Deserts, we should never be freed from Calamities, but pass on from one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and when we have suffered much here, we might suffer more hereafter; and therefore our only way is to beg <hi>God's mercy</hi> in Prayer.—</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47219:67"/>
and profitable, I shall go on with less stumbling, and a more light Foot in surveying the main <hi>Province</hi> which I have undertaken, which was, to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the right and only true Object of Prayer.—And this was mentioned in this Second Conclusion.</p>
            <p>That in a sorrowful <hi>Estate, and upon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>all other Considerations, Prayer must be made to God only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Call, that is, <hi>Pray</hi> unto me, that is, <hi>Me only,</hi> or chiefly, is the Institution, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.</note> Command of the Almighty, all other Callings will find deaf Ears.</p>
            <p>It is God's <hi>Prerogatvie,</hi> and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed to his <hi>Regalities,</hi> to be call'd upon in Prayer; and he will not lose any part hereof, nor give any of this his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto another.</p>
            <p>However, God our King hath been voted out of this his ancient, and highly valued <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and this his Honour hath been forced from him, not only by <hi>Pagans</hi> who have not rightly known him, and the <hi>Constitution of his Empire,</hi> and the Iealousie of his Nature. But by those Christians who have pretended best to know him, and to be most <hi>Loyal to his Majesty,</hi> and most punctual in their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and Subjection to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:47219:68"/>And they have been thus injurious to the King of Kings, and put forth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing <hi>Remonstrances</hi> against him; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the <hi>Devils Subtilty,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through their <hi>own Ignorance, Folly</hi> and <hi>Pride:</hi> for that the Devil might the more easily abuse their first good plain Intentions in their Devotions, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them that Prayers made at the <hi>Sepulchres of Martyrs</hi> would be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, then if made any where else; and then, when any thing great, or beyond Expectation was obtained at such places, by those who prayed there, this Enemy of Mankind caused them to impure that not wholly to God, but some part <hi>to the Martyr,</hi> or at least for the Favour and Merits of that <hi>Martyr</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>And that he might the more deeply fix this perswasion in Mens minds, either by false Miracles made there by him, or by true ones by God, but to another end, and by him turn'd to some other purpose than intended; he hath so nourished, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Inclination of humane Nature to Superstition, that they, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were wont to pray to <hi>God only at the Tombs of Martyrs,</hi> did at length direct their Prayers to <hi>those Martyrs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47219:68"/>
without their Help and good Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, they believed nothing should be obtained of God.—Now because all Confessors are in Vow Martyrs, and all <note place="margin">N. B.</note> true Saints are either in Act, or Vow Confessors, and so there is the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all who are Dead, whom the Church supposeth to be Saints, and the reason for the Angels far better: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the praying to Saints and Angels was used, and became Customary; and so the ancient Devil worship of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> under other Names, to wit, those of Angels and Saints, but under the same pretext of Humility, is restored, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of Christians, or rather thrust upon them by <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I think it will plainly appear, that Christians are herein more inexecusable than <hi>Pagans,</hi> for they daring not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Supreme Deity <hi>without Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours;</hi> and having none appointed by God, between him and them, they used such which they could in their own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies make to themselves:—But seeing Christans have such a Mediator given to them of God, who can do all things with him as being his Son, and whatever he can he will entreat of God for Men, as being the Son of Man, and he fits at
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47219:69"/>
the right hand of God as Man's Advocate with his Father, and hath Commanded all his Disciples to come to himself. Surely when they have such a <hi>Mediator</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God between him and them; if it were not absolutely unlawful, yet 'twould be great folly to substitute another, because none can be more powerful with God, nor any more kind towards Men: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, since Christ is not only the best, but the <hi>only Mediator between God and Men,</hi> to think of any other but him, is not only foolish, but impious: For, to will any besides him is to refuse him: Nay! 'Tis as much as in us lies to thrust Christ out of his Throne, and to place another, who is not God, on God's <hi>right hand, that is, on the utmost top of Divine Majesty;</hi> which is not only Rash and Silly, but apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, and Idolatrous—And since 'tis thus, nothing can be more plain, tho' written with <hi>Text Letters,</hi> than that the Angel, and Saint worship of those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Professors is less excusable, than the <hi>Demon Worship</hi> of Heathens.</p>
            <p>Now upon this laying the Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship between God and Men upon Christ as the only Foundation, and rejecting all other as Rotten, or as none, <hi>Sebagius</hi> thought himself concern'd to put in with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47219:69"/>
a <hi>Distinction</hi> which he had imbibed in his religious Education, and it was this; namely, That the <hi>Mediatorship</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Theosebius,</hi> had a respect partly to <hi>Intercession,</hi> and partly to <hi>Redemption;</hi> and in reference to the first, <hi>Sebagius</hi> said, there were many Mediators, but as to the other but one. But <hi>Theosebius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That this <hi>Distinction</hi> was partly <hi>uncanonical,</hi> and partly <hi>false;</hi> for it is not found in Holy Writ, nor is it agreeable to the Office of an <hi>Intercessor:</hi> For, to intercede <hi>is a Court Term,</hi> and signifies, <hi>not barely to request; but to Act with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Legally, and by Authority, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose himself and his Authority where need requires it;</hi> and thus Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for us with his Father, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing his Merits betwixt God's Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and the sins of his Brethren, and by forbidding, and by hindring his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that he may not proceed with them severely, and after a strict and rigorous manner.</p>
            <p>So that whosoever is the Author of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> the same, and besides him none else is, or can be the <hi>Mediator of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> and hence 'tis, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> says plainly, that because Christ humbled himself to the Death of the Cross, whilst
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47219:70"/>
he became a <hi>Mediator of Redemption:</hi> Therefore <hi>he was exalted to sit at the right hand of God,</hi> that there he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Mediator and Intercessor.</hi> So that, the latter is as it were the Fruit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the former; and thereupon so due to Christ <hi>God Man,</hi> that it ought not, nor can be communicated to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without the greatest Sacriledge and most apparent Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But to this Answer, <hi>Sebagius</hi> replied, That his Distinction was mistaken, for those of his Iudgment did not mean thereby that they used many Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, such as Angels, and Saints with God instead of Christ; but with Christ instead of themselves,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theosebius</hi> hereto rejoin'd first with this Question; namely, What need is there of another Intercessor with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor?</hi> And one less powerful and kind, with one more powerful, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?</p>
            <p>Besides <hi>Theosebius</hi> added, that what is thus said is false; for they use those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessors with God, either instead of Christ, or together with him: Nay! They pray to the Saints, <hi>That in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">N. B.</note> 
               <hi>same manner with which</hi> Christ <hi>intercedes, they would also intercede with God,</hi> that is,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47219:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by their Merits, or the Representation, or Interposition of them, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which God would also grant them Pardon of their sins, and this is manifest from the <hi>publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Prayer</hi> which are in use among them; and thus they shew their impious Folly, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeous impiety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sebagius</hi> upon having this Cogent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity did now exercise the <hi>Virtue of Taciturnity,</hi> and hereby confessed that he had no more to say against <hi>Theose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius's</hi> clear Confutation of his foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Distinction, and his Explanation of it, but he proceeds to other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions concerning the main Subject which they had in hand; but 'twas <hi>in another Figure.</hi> The <hi>Bullion</hi> and the <hi>Mint</hi> were the same, but the <hi>Coyn</hi> of <hi>another Stamp,</hi> for quitting that first about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessors, he frames new Distinctions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Prayer it self;</hi> whereby he would maintain Man's interest, and Priviledge in that Office.</p>
            <p>For says <hi>Sebagius,</hi> Prayer is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into <hi>that,</hi> which is <hi>Chief, Direct, and Absolute,</hi> and into that which is <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative, or Subaltern,</hi> and <hi>Indirect,</hi> and <hi>Relative,</hi> and <hi>Transitive,</hi> or <hi>which is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from one to another:</hi> Now, says he, of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47219:71"/>
Prayer of the former kind, we (of our way,) confess, That 'tis a Worship due to <hi>God only;</hi> and that such a Prayer to Saints is Idolatrous, but that of the last sort, or that which is directed, and referred to God by the <hi>Mediation and Merits of Saints</hi> is not Idolatrous, or Superstitious, nor unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but profitable, commendable, and pleasing to God and his Saints.—Now whatever we alledge for Praying to God only, that we affirm to be meant only of the first kind of Prayer, and that alone is due to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Now hereto <hi>Theosebius</hi> said, That this Distinction of Prayer is frivolous, and a <hi>new Invention,</hi> nay; none, for their's no Precept or Example sound in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the Old and New Testament, nor in the Practice of the more pure and <note place="margin">N. B.</note> Primitive Church, nor in the very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are alledged by your Sect in this Cause.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Sebagius</hi> went off, and urged another Argument in behalf of his Saints after this manner, They are, saith he, <hi>God's Favourites:</hi> And therefore we must pray to them, to pray to God for us; and so not to <hi>God only.</hi> But in Answer thereto, <hi>Theosebius</hi> denied the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his <hi>Medium,</hi> for, said he, tho'
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47219:71"/>
the Saints in Heaven have much Favour and Grace from God, and much Love <note place="margin">N. B.</note> and Kindness, and more than they had here for us their Fellow-members; yet we justly question their knowledge of our particular Wants and Concerns, and therefore suppose it a vain thing to Pray to them to intercede with God for us. They have no ordinary knowledge of us themselves, nor can they be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med how it is with us, and so cannot put themselves in a proper way to help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>for,</hi> knowledge is the first mover in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, the last Act of the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Intellect, being the first of the Will, so that the Will of Man willeth only that which is suggested by the Understanding; and if the Saints, as we affirm, cannot know, then they cannot wish us well, nor do us good by their Intercessions. But <hi>Sebagius</hi> told him, That the Saints in Heaven know our Petitions to them, as the <hi>Angels</hi> know the Conversion of a Sinner, for which they rejoyce: But says <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besius,</hi> This is no satisfaction of the Doubt, but the occasion of another question; namely, how <hi>Angels</hi> know the state of a Sinner? For, they can't know the state of others on Earth by an <hi>Original knowledge,</hi> for that is full and Intuitive,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47219:72"/>
and belongs to God alone: But they know by Communication from God; for God makes his Creatures know things partly in himself, and partly out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The first is a supernatural way, whereby Saints and Angels beholding God's Face in glory, do withal in him as in a Glass, as some have thought, behold infinite forms of things and Beings.</p>
            <p>The other way is <hi>natural,</hi> and proceeds from the power of that Endowment wherewith Saints and Angels as such, are endowed in that their blessed Estate. Now hereupon we must conclude, that this their Knowledge is not sufficient to warrant us to pray to them; and the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> hereof is, Because all Persons Requests are either <hi>such as remain in their Minds, and are not express'd in Voice, or such as are expresly made known:</hi> Now they have no knowledge of the first sort; for God only, and the Man who thinks, knows those Requests; and they can't know the second sort of Requests, because they are at a vast distance from them, who pray and petition them. But is not (said <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagius</hi>) the Soul separated from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exceeding quick and active, and so capable of this Knowledge to put it into exercise? It is so qualified, replies <hi>Theose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius;</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47219:72"/>
but however it hath its limits; for, if it work here, it doth not work there, and when in one place, then not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Besides, the desire of a Saint's Soul is bounded, and at all times submits to God's Will, and it doth not desire what God will not discover to it: It is no part of its Perfection to know all that is in God; 'tis not Divine but Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it longs for, and is restless till ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. Now it is no part of that Soul's Perfection and Happiness to know our Requests, or what we say to it by seeing them in God; and hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it hath no ability to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any sort of our Prayers, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to no purpose to pray to them. And here <hi>Sebagius</hi> puts in another Question, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cannot the Souls of Heavenly Saints know our Conditions by <hi>Revelutions from Angels?</hi> Are not they all Ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and God's Guard in his Church to secure his Friends, and fight against his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? and since it is their Profession, must they not declare it? and must they not busie themselves in their peculiar Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments? They are such Guardians and Officers, said <hi>Theosebius;</hi> however, they can't give a <hi>full and exact Account</hi> in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of all Persons Desires, Thoughts,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47219:73"/>
Wants and Necessities; no, not of any one Person, much less of all things, of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in all places: They may know some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in particular, as appears from some Instances in Holy Writ: But that does not conclude a general: But still more, says <hi>Sebagius,</hi> may they not know all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns by <hi>Revelation</hi> from God? Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers <hi>Theosebius,</hi> if he please to reveal them; but he hath not so pleased, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his power by his Will, and can do what he will not; for it cannot be proved that God ever hath, or will make known all things in Heaven and Earth, to Men <note place="margin">N. B.</note> departed, and to Angels, ordinarily at all times, in all places, without Priviledge or Exemption. Moreover, 'Tis absurd to suppose that God will communicate <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience</hi> to Saints or Angels; for he gives according to the Capacities of Receivers, and they are not able to receive this Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. It is part of God's Essence, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, and therefore he doth not give it to them. But once more, says <hi>Sebagius,</hi> may not that which cannot be known in a natural and ordinary way, nor by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Angels, nor from God, be made known in God himself, when the Souls of Saints departed, have a full sight of his Face in Glory? Do they not in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47219:73"/>
him, see all things? Have they not in that <hi>Glass</hi> the Idea of every thing set forth to their view? if so, then they may know, and consequently we may pray to them.</p>
            <p>My Answer to this Question, said <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> must be of larger compass than my former; and therefore I beg of you a like Patience, and if it may be, a double At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>As to your Allusion <hi>of a Glass,</hi> you must understand, that to see therein is <hi>our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here,</hi> and not theirs, who are in God's more immediate Presence. Moreover, even in this <hi>Glass</hi> all things have not been seen, for the deep <hi>Mysteries of the Gospel</hi> was in that <hi>Glass,</hi> and yet the Angels who have always seen God have not seen them, nor could they but by Revelation from Christ's Church: And though God knows the day of Iudgment, yet the Saints and Angels cannot spy it with their most stedfast look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him. Again, they who appoint the Saints <hi>this Glass</hi> as a means whereby they may know all our Requests and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, do wickedly bind God to a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Causes as a natural Agent, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate <note place="margin">N. B.</note> him to discover those matters to them who are in his presence; whereas he is a most voluntary Agent, and may or may not impart the Knowledge hereof;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47219:74"/>
and till they can shew what God doth hide, and what, and how much he doth make known, they cannot reasonably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us that Saints in Heaven have such a Knowledge as may assure us of Success in the Prayers we make to them.</p>
            <p>But further; If there could be such <hi>a Glass,</hi> yet it would be to no purpose unless the Saints who look in it were <hi>as large as that is:</hi> But thus they are not; for they can't know all God's Secrets, and they can't know the Thoughts and Prayers of Men, and so 'tis in vain to pray to them.</p>
            <p>Besides, We cannot guess what, or how much each Saint knows, and so know not to whom to commend our Conditions: We may mistake, and pray to that Saint <note place="margin">N. B.</note> who hath no Commission to help us by his Intercession: He may not be the <hi>Advocate</hi> appointed to plead our cause, and do our business, and appear in God's <hi>Court in our names:</hi> We know not what share of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Saint has, and so may give him more Credit than is his due.</p>
            <p>Now all this Uncertainty may close up our Lips, and discourage us from Praying to Saints.</p>
            <p>This Device of a <hi>Glass is too too brittle</hi> to lay any stress upon it; and therefore we can frame no Argument from it that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47219:74"/>
the Saints in Heaven may know our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and thereupon be perswaded by our Prayers to intercede with God for us.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sebagius</hi> having spent all his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and being too weak to confute what had been urg'd in this present case; <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osebius,</hi> proceeds to his concluding To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, <hi>from primitive Authority,</hi> and thence argues for his Negative Maxim about An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in Divine Worship: For, saith he, St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his 4th Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Care for the Dead,</hi> discourseth <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> largely on the 63d Chapter of <hi>Isaiah, v.</hi> 16. where 'tis said, <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of us, and</hi> Israel <hi>doth not know us;</hi> and and in the Conclusion of that Discourse he says, That if famous Patriarclis, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> did not understand how the <note place="margin">N. B.</note> World went with their Posterity which came from their Loins; How can it be that Men deceased should at all take any notice of the state, or meddle with the assisting Men alive on Earth?</p>
            <p>And on the Promise made to King <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> that he should <hi>be gathered to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Peace, and not see the Destruction of Ierusalem,</hi> nor the Plagues which were to come on that People.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, that the Promise had been to no effect, if after Death, Men may seel those Calamities which happen in their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47219:75"/>
Life; and he thus resolves the case, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>ordinarily</hi> the Saints departed med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with us, and have no Knowledge of our Affairs.</p>
            <p>What though they may <hi>extraordinarily</hi> at some times, and by special <hi>Dispensation,</hi> take notice of some things: And what though they may be <hi>Assistants</hi> in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to some particular Persons, yet all this will not prove it reasonable to pray to them.</p>
            <p>To this purpose <hi>Iamblicus</hi> an Heathen says, <hi>That those Men make themselves ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, who seek any good but from God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Enough, says <hi>Sebagius;</hi> and thereupon with a chearful Countenance, and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bow to the <hi>Lecturer,</hi> he intimated his Satisfaction; and according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in the starting of this dispute, that was followed with his sincere Conversion from his former Errors in this, and some other points of Religion.</p>

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:47219:75"/>And now this crooked and knotty part of the Lecture being thus smoothed, and made strait; <hi>Theosebius</hi> would not let it lie so; but like a skilful Artificer, made use of it to the <hi>Edification</hi> of his Hearers. Wherefore he first put them in mind of the Shame and Folly which they procure, who apply themselves to any other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>of Requests in the King of Heavens Court,</hi> than only his only begotten Son the <hi>Prince of Peace:</hi> For proof of which, he saith, That the Angels and Saints are out of the reach of our lowdest Crys, and can no more hear our Complaints than their <hi>Statues or Pictures can;</hi> and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of supply for our Wants by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Answer from them to our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and neglecting Divine Assistance, is as great a Folly, as <hi>Ammonius's Ass's</hi> was; who though he eagerly crav'd Food, yet neglected it to hear Poetical Fables. So that our Prayers to them, are but the <hi>Spider-web Castles</hi> of our <hi>superstitious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,</hi> and as equally foolish and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as they are vain and ridiculous. For when trusted to, they can as little help as hear us, and will be as insignificant in what we supplicate them for, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Gods were to <hi>the Saguntines;</hi> who (in spight of their Divinity) perished by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>

            <p>Now since some Mens Dangers should (if wisely improv'd) be the caution of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then it should be ours; and if in conformity hereto, we would distill sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Water from Hemlock, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine from Poison; that is, Wisdom from Folly, true Devotion from Superstition, Ghostly Advice from Dead Saints; we should study and learn the true, from the Danger and Vanity of the fore-mentioned Persons false Worship; and whilst they prove Fools in doing otherwise, we should be so wise as to make Almighty God the <hi>only Object of</hi> our Prayers, and send up our Hearts and our Desires to him through Christ the only Mediator and Intercessor: By doing thus, we shall speed, and be as sure to have, as that <hi>we ask;</hi> and to find, <hi>as that we seek.</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47219:78"/>
and this must turn to the prejudice of every single Person.</p>
            <p>However, this hath been the peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and absurdity of some People, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Iews,</hi> and amongst them the <hi>Scribes,</hi> who were their <hi>Men of the Long Robe;</hi> that they have esteemed Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood from each Persons condition and quality, and so have thought none <note place="margin">N.

This is the genuine Sense which our <hi>Master the Holy Iesus</hi> did in his Sermon upon the Mount; restore and vindicate from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Calumny, and thereupon made it plain, that he gave at that time no new Laws, but corrected the ill Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrases, and Comments of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Scribes and their Followers, with which the Purity of God's Law was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>Now the whole Doctrine of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is agreeable to this large Scope, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47219:78"/>
extension of Love, where Enemies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and the <hi>Reason</hi> may be, because whoever can perswade himself to love those who hate him, will easily, or at least more than otherwise, avoid all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, <hi>and bear all Evils,</hi> that is, all Affronts, Disgraces and Injuries, and will be much more propense to help, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the necessitous and oppressed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>Now the Object of this huge, and thick Christian Grace, to wit, <hi>Enemies,</hi> must be exactly weigh'd in our Minds, that we may know its due measure, and when it is so, we shall find, That <hi>it signifies such</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And to <hi>love this Object,</hi> is to <hi>forgive all the forementioned Faults to such persons who are guilty of them and behave our selves as Persons civil, affable and courteous to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now upon this Description of <hi>Love-Enemy, Eumenes</hi> said, That tho' it were large and plain enough, and half an Eye might spy it, yet he thought it useful,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47219:79"/>
and convenient to make some Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, that so he might fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the end for which it was proposed; and because he understood that some of their Assembly had long <hi>Thirsted</hi> after some Lecture upon this Suject, he took this opportunity to satisfie their <hi>Longing,</hi> by giving them to <hi>Drink largely</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he went on in his Speech, to add a Paraphrase upon the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> which he had made of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Love, and it was this, namely, That to Love our Enemies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to them, and to study, and desire as much to do them good, as we would to Eat and Drink, when we are hungry and thirsty: It is to speak well of them, and to them, and to turn the <hi>Swords</hi> which we have had in <hi>our Lips</hi> against them, into <hi>Words as soft as Wax,</hi> and as sweet as Honey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is, upon all occasions, to be helpful to their Necessities, and useful in their Extremiries, and it is also the Condition of this Love as was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, not only to do our ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies no harm, <hi>but</hi> we must do them good, and more good than one, or two, or a few comes to, for we must do good to their Persons and Families and Fortunes, and to that end; we must visit them when Sick, and Counsel and help,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47219:79"/>
them when in Danger, and congratulate their Good, and pity and relieve their bad Conditions, and send some <hi>powerful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment</hi> to succour their <hi>forlorn Hopes:</hi> and when we see one Enemy's ancient Family feeble, and faint, and staggering, we should lend them our hand of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to keep them from falling; and if we should see another Enemy's Family lately risen, ready to rot through the Showers and Floods of Mis rule and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality before it be thorough ripe with Wealth and Honour, we should be so loving as to give it a Remedy if it be not past Cure, and where that Remedy is refused, we should lay it much to heart, to see those <hi>Slips</hi> wither, which might by Providence have proved fair and dellicate Flowers.</p>
            <p>This is to love our Enemies, and to love them not only <hi>Negatively,</hi> or so, as not to do them mischief; <hi>But Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> and so, as to do them good, this is to love them not only <hi>as Wasps</hi> and Flies, which will accompany the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary</hi> in his Shop where his Syrrups and Sweat-meats are. But as the <hi>Dolphin</hi> who <note place="margin">Franz. de Annimalib.</note> 
               <hi>will Cruise to</hi> and fro in <hi>Storm, to help and secure the disconsolate and faint hearted Passenger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this larger Description of <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-love,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:47219:80"/>
I must put a Note of special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon that first part which enjoyns us to <hi>Forgive and forget Injuries,</hi> and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts; for in complyance with this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we must no more remember them, than if they had never been Committed, and as sincerely and truly forgive them, as they have been mischievously and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully intended; and God hath in this Command <hi>joyn'd them together,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should <hi>by no means put them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we should the rather remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, because this Band, this <hi>beautiful Band,</hi> is too too soon snapt asunder; for (if the <hi>Account</hi> can be taken) I beseech you tell me how often, and more then often is it said, I can forgive, but never <hi>forget mine</hi> Enemy, my Rank, malicious Enemy, No! Here I must say, <hi>Pardon thy servant, O Lord, in this Matter:</hi> It is enough to Promise that I will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of him. But I shall be so far from <hi>Forgetting,</hi> that I will engraven his Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Steel and Marble,</hi> that no time may deface them; and I will learn an Art to make them so tough, that his Teeth shall not be able to devour them.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Blot</hi> at the Period of this Duty spoils all, the leaving this part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, makes the other to be as if it were
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47219:80"/>
so also; and such Workers have no other recompence for their Labour than their Pains, and therefore that part must not be neglected.</p>
            <p>True it is, and most True, that thus to love is a Task of the greatest Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to most Persons, <hi>for</hi> it is contrary to the Wisdom, and policy of the Flesh: However, we must in no wise seek excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from our Infirmities and Vices; but rather industrioufly study to do what God's Law of Love requires, and if we trust to the Heavenly power of the Holy Ghost; we may by so doing prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all those Affections which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto in us, his Grace with our Endeavour may be sufficient herein.</p>
            <p>Now in this Case of Difficulty, I would advise you to observe, That the <hi>Herb Moly,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> informs us, is with much <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nat. Hist.</hi> B. 2.</note> Difficulty dug out of the Earth; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, is more useful and efficacious for Remedies than others are; <hi>feembably,</hi> the most Excellent, are the most difficult Matters to be obtain'd, and the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Precepts the most hardest to Practice; and further observe, That Men perform Actions very easie, not <hi>from Love, but from Nature,</hi> and herein they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed irrational Creatures, for <hi>Toads and Frogs, Batts and Owles, Camels and Asses,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:47219:81"/>
and other Beasts can Act after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as shall appear in another place.</p>
            <p>Now from this Quality of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to wit, that it is most Difficult, the <hi>Monks and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of</hi> Rome have feigned it to be a <hi>Counsel, and not a Command</hi> from Christ, and they have also made Mens Ability and Power, the <hi>Standard</hi> of what they owe to God and his Law.</p>
            <p>But this cannot be, and that partly because it is absurd to make those Offices of Love free, which are enjoyn'd by God's Law; and partly, because it would injure Christ to say, he only counsel'd and advis'd, but did not peremptorily Command and enjoyn his Disciples that which was right and equal; and partly, because the word <hi>Say,</hi> us'd before, and signifying to <hi>Denounce</hi> or <hi>Command,</hi> is very ill translated to Counsel or perswade: And in the next place, because expresly to Counsel and Advise what was <hi>Necessary</hi> to be performed, can in no wise be proved from Christ's words. So that it was assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly a Command, and a reasonable one, to <hi>Love our Enemies.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>It is most certain, that each of us may find two things to be noted in every Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; <note place="margin">N. B.</note> one is, the natural Likeness which he hath to God, and the possibility of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Happiness, and this is the cause of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47219:81"/>
Love: The other is, his Injury to us, and his Aversion to us, and this is the cause of Hatred.</p>
            <p>Now, if we disregard the Reason why we should love him, and wholly hate him, then our Enmity outweighs our Love to God: As for scandalous Persons, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity will not be wanting to them; for, that <hi>hopes all things,</hi> and therefore that they may be converted to God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Partakers of the Saints Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eternal Happiness. Indeed a pious, hates a wicked Person; but then it is with <hi>a perfect hatred;</hi> that is, <hi>such which wants neither Righteousness or Knowledge:</hi> Or, if you please, thus, <hi>He hates no Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his Vices, and he loves no Vices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, though the practice of this Love be little, yet the Reasons why it should be otherwise are great, and must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by every body who will give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves leisure to weigh them; and the <hi>Topicks</hi> from whence they are drawn, are <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and our <hi>Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason in respect of <hi>God</hi> appears thus: The Enemy which injures and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends us, doth principally offend God, and not us; for, the fault is directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God forbidding it, and but indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against us, who are injur'd: This is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47219:82"/>
plain in the case of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Uriah:</hi> We all know <hi>David</hi> murder'd that good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a stout brave Captain, and also that he committed Adultery with <hi>Bersheba</hi> his Wife: However, because God was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concern'd in these abominable Crimes, because his Laws were broken, therefore <hi>David</hi> in his Confession, takes no notice of the <hi>Loyal Captain</hi> whom he had abus'd, but only that he had sin'd against <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</note> God.</p>
            <p>However, the Case we are upon may appear clear by this Instance: Suppose any Apothecary should be so cruel and <note place="margin">N. B.</note> wicked, as to poison any of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with some deadly Snuff; and some Person being accidentally by, the smell of it should affect his Head to his great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: Now if the poison'd Person do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death freely forgive the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, who intended only to kill him; Is there any reason that the other Person should be inexorable against the Offender, when he received his Mischief indirectly, and much besides his Will, and in a less degree? Now the Inference is, that since God who is the first and most offended, forgives our Enemies, we should go and do likewise. Again, we should consider, that the Affronts which we receive, and the Injuries done to us by our Enemies,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47219:82"/>
proceed from <hi>God's permissive Providence,</hi> and that they were only the Instruments whose Malice God can guide to our good. Now we should be so much <hi>Philosophers</hi> as to reduce <hi>Effects</hi> to their <hi>principal Causes,</hi> and since God's permissive Providence is the principal Cause of the Injuries done to us, we should expostulate, and contend with God concerning them; and we can devise no other proper way how this should be done, but by paying our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Majesty, and by shutting our <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.</note> Mouths from speaking against him, and by opening our Ears widely to him.</p>
            <p>We know who it was who said, <hi>I was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.</note> 
               <hi>dumb, and opened not my Mouth because thou Lord didst it.</hi> Thus did he only contend with God under the Hardship of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and so should we.</p>
            <p>Tell me! If a Noble Person should be <hi>Cudgel'd</hi> by the Servant of any Man, will he be doggedly reveng'd on the Cudgel by cutting it in pieces? Or will he take his Remedy only against the sawcy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who us'd it? No, no! But he will implead the principal Agent, and expect from him the Satisfaction which in that Case the Law allows him, or else he will not rightly vindicate his Honour to the World.</p>
            <p>Now since it is upon the account of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47219:83"/>
Divine Providence, that our Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us; when at any time they do so, God useth them as his Scourge to whip us; we must hereupon either absurdly, and in vain, as reaping no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, plead against them, or against God himself; and if we can resist him and prosper, or impeach him, and vindicate our selves, we may take this Course. It is more than worth our while to weigh such Proceedings, and to make them the Matter of our private Meditations as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serves.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it should not pass our Notice. That God himself does perform this Office which he enjoyns us: He lays his hand to the same Work, and gives us <hi>Tools out of his own Shop,</hi> and makes the <hi>Sampler</hi> which should direct us: For,</p>
            <p>We are all his Enemies, and yet he is our Friend; we have the Sword in our hand towards him, and he holds the Scepter, the Badge of Peace, towards us. While we meet him as <hi>Goliah</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> he runs towards us, as the <hi>Prodigal's Father</hi> did towards his Son: We all sin against him, and yet he causeth his <hi>Sun to rise upon the good and evil, and Rains upon the just and unjust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me entreat you to ponder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the contrary; should God
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47219:83"/>
contend and fall out presently with us his Servants, upon our Faults against him; all the <hi>Elements</hi> might soon deny us their Observance and Assistance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> might not sustain us, nor the <hi>Sun</hi> shine upon, or the <hi>Fire</hi> heat us, nor the <hi>Air</hi> breath upon us, nor the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> refresh us: But our God is Gracious <note place="margin">N. B.</note> and full of Forgiveness, and abundant in Pardon, and his Mercies are numberless, and he deals not with us as we deal with our selves; but permits us tho' his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to have the use, and benefit of these his Creatures. And hereto we may add, That he lovingly gives us Life, Motion, Sense, Apparel, Food, Friends, and all things necessary, and he so overcomes our great Enemy <hi>Satan,</hi> that he cannot hurt us as he would, and daily strives to do. And thus it is manifest, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>God</hi> we may frame a Reason, an undeniable Reason, why we <hi>should Love our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we will further Consider, that the whole <hi>World doth thus,</hi> and that in all its parts; we may hence frame another Argument for this Duty; for, we daily tread upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> and frequently rend it in pieces and dig it up, and cast upon it all our Filth and Excrements: However that, being taught of God, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47219:84"/>
to us good for evil; for it produceth for our use, Herbs, Fruits, Plants: Ay! Gold, Silver, precious Stones and all Metals.—We cut and scrape the Vines and Trees yearly: However, they afford great store of Grapes and Apples.</p>
            <p>Pass we on to the <hi>sensitive part,</hi> and tell me, don't we severely, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cruelly whip, and kick, and beat our Dogs: However they soon forget all that ill usage, and kindly shake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves round us, and Salute, and flatter us with their Tailes.</p>
            <p>Proceed we on to the best part of the World the <hi>rational Creatures,</hi> and they flow over with Examples of this Love: Every School boy can tell us that that Royal Heathen <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> was wont to forget nothing but Injuries; and the Athenian <hi>Pericles,</hi> when he was reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Rail'd upon all day, by a rude and scurrilous Stage-player, heard him with much Patience, and at Night lighted him home with his Torch, and Courteously took his leave of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> must not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got as an Instance herein, for he was cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sold by his Brethren, and almost slain, &amp; yet reveng'd their Injuries no other way than by transferring Benefits upon them.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to reckon how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47219:84"/>
               <hi>King David</hi> spared his raging Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and would if he could have obliged them: For all Persons but those would have acknowledged themselves to have been so.</p>
            <p>Let our next Stage be towards <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> and thence let us take a View of the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> and therein we shall find that the Holy <hi>Iesus,</hi> St <hi>Stephen, the Apostles, and Martyrs,</hi> and all Saints have been Exemplary herein; this Motto was given by one of the first Rank of them, <hi>Maledicimur, &amp; Benedicimas.—</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, These were Saints, and such to whom a large <hi>Manifestation</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi> was given: But yet <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Pericles</hi> were not such, nor were many others which we may call to mind from our own reading and observation; and therefore what they did to procure a vain and transitory, why should not we do, to obtain a real and eternal Glory?</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Ioseph, David, Stephen, Paul,</hi> and others were Saints, yet at that time they were also <hi>Men;</hi> they were kneaded up together of Flesh and Bones, and we all know, they had Sense, and Blood, and Choler, tho' they were Pure, and Holy, and so ought we all to be, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we shall not <hi>enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have heard that the whole
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47219:85"/>
World, and each part of it enjoyn us by their Example to <hi>Love our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>Eumenes</hi> was passing on to his last Reason for this Duty. But there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Congress a Nephew of his, by his Sister <hi>Aurora</hi> named <hi>Musophil,</hi> who <note place="margin">Beloved of the Muses.</note> had been very attentive to what had been spoken, and having peculiarly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>Uncle's Argument</hi> for Enemy-Love which was drawn from Authority, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the two first parts of it; made some sign to <hi>Glycon,</hi> that they might admit of his chearful <hi>Interpone,</hi> before any other Argument was urged in the present Matter. This offer was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted; and hereupon <hi>Musophil</hi> added to the Narrative of the first part of the Worlds Testimony for the Love of our Enemies, this, That

            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>Eumenes</hi> had in reserve his last Reason to Discourse upon; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that 'twould take up more time than could at present be well spar'd, to make it clear and demonstrative to his Friends, he kept it as a fit Subject for their hearing the <hi>next Meeting.</hi>

         <div n="12" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Eumenes</hi> Second Discourse, of the Love of Enemies.</head>
            <p>WHEN they appear'd together again, after the usual Formalities were over, <hi>Eumenes</hi> assisted their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories with a short Narration of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>had been formerly deliver'd, and then past on to another main Reason, why all Christians should <hi>Love their Enemies,</hi> and this he drew <hi>from the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all Persons</hi> in <hi>this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, says he, We can go no where, but we shall meet with opprobrious Terms,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47219:86"/>
and injurious Actions, these are daily past <note place="margin">N. B.</note> upon us, and we can get no Buckler large enough to defend us from them: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unless we learn to <hi>Love these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> who are thus desperately bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, and to Pardon their Affronts, and sometimes wink at their Dis-obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there will be no Love, or Peace in this Life; we must love them, or we can scarcely <hi>Love any Body;</hi> and therefore we should do exceeding well, and that which would be much more than the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of our Pains, to make this Virtue of Necessity.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot choose but add, That in this Life, we are so frail of Temper, and so full of Sin, that the very thought hereof should hinder us from breaking the Band of Love, when Injuries and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces are cast upon us. For to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this Case a little, I pray tell me, Are we despised? Let us consider that we <note place="margin">N. B.</note> have nothing Praise worthy: Are we cheated, or plunder'd of our Goods? Let us consider, that they were perishable and uncertain, and that it becomes each of us to be as those who have nothing: Are we hurt and maim'd in our Bodies? We should consider, that this is a sort of necessary Discipline taught us by God himself: Are Traps and Snares laid
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47219:86"/>
for our Lives? We should then consider, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this very Case did, and follow him: Are we maliciously and peevishly slander'd, and frequently ill spoken of? We should then Note, that our <hi>Great Master,</hi> and dear Saviour was so used, and when he <hi>was revil'd, revil'd not again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when we are gone hence, and have proper time to Meditate; let us do so, by weighing these foremention'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, and then we must think it reasonable <hi>to Love our Enemies</hi> so as to forgive, and forget their Injuries.</p>
            <p>And besides all this, (for Arguments in this Case <hi>swarm</hi> about us.) It is an Office most excellent in its Essence and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and highly Beneficial to those who can execute it; and in good Earnest none can be more, for it is a Matter <hi>Generous, Noble,</hi> and most Christian like.</p>
            <p>To Love our Friends is a mere <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Employ,</hi> and can Challenge only the Name of Traffick, or <hi>Merchandise;</hi> for that is such, and not Friendship, which aims at Gain, and only regards that it may be hoarded up. To love our Friends is an <hi>Occupation</hi> which Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can set themselves about: Ay, and by your leave, said <hi>Musophil,</hi> this Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation as you well word it, may and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47219:87"/>
hath been manag'd by Creatures most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational and vile: For,

                     <l>Wolves, Vipers, Lions, Tygers, can</l>

                     <l>The Youth who pickt the Thorne from th' Lion's Foot,</l>
                     <l>Got Friendship from him, and his Life to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </lg>
               </q>
It is well and truly observ'd, said <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes;</hi> but the Love of our Enemies is a Business of another kind, and a Lesson of an higher form, and a Star of a greater magnitude.</p>
            <p>Believe it, there is nothing of the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Merchandize</hi> in it: But we must acknowledge that there is in it another, which is much more gainful; for hereby we <hi>wind and turn the penny</hi> for things which are eternal.</p>
            <p>It is not impossible but a Friend may be loved for the sake of God; however it is not so apparent as that there can be no question made of it: But when an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is loved, it seems as clear as Light it self, that he is so in <hi>respect of God himself;</hi> for where shall we find any other Motive to it? 'Tis certain, that the Love of God doth not shine forth very hot in a <hi>Friend,</hi> but in an <hi>Enemy</hi> it spreads forth its Beams largely, and its Rays are very keen and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47219:87"/>
servent. And though thus to love be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature, yet it is only that which is corrupt; for it agrees, and is very suitable to <hi>that Nature which is improved, and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God's Grace.</hi>

And he resolves it for the <hi>Love of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</hi> I shall not loaden your Ears by making Inserences hereupon, nor <hi>scratch them by School-Briars:</hi> You have heard my Argument in the case, and let it sink or swim, flourish or wither in your due Management of it, while I proceed to add, that the Office which we discourse of, is <hi>profitable and advantageous.</hi> It will appear in our progress that it is a single Ship far richer fraighted than an whole <hi>Fleet from the Indies;</hi> and a single <hi>Medal,</hi> of more value than all the <hi>Golden Mines in Peru.</hi>

            <p>It is the Observation of an eminent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <note place="margin">Plut. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47219:88"/>
render us less humoursome, and more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ingenuous to our Friends, who are in a better and more happy Condition than our selves. But there is a <hi>more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Author,</hi> who in our matter in hand, wraps up a better Observation than this in an elegant <hi>Trope,</hi> and it is the Royal Prophet <hi>David,</hi> for when he speaks of his Enemies, his rancorous Enemies, he says, <hi>They compassed me about like Bees, and burnt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.</note> 
               <hi>me like a fire in the Thorns,</hi> as I have read it translated; signifying, that as the Bee though she prick with her Sting, yet <note place="margin">N. B.</note> gives excellent good Honey; so our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> though they make us smart with their Injuries, yet hereby they crown our Heads with an eternal weight of Glory; and as <hi>fire amongst the Thornes</hi> affrights with making strange Noises and Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, yet afterwards it scoures the Field from Weeds and Fern, and Trash; so the troublesome Injuries of our Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patiently suffer'd, do purge our Souls from our Sins, and conduct us to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is everlasting.</p>
            <p>Thus these quaint Expressions of this <hi>Royal Prophet</hi> afford us special Evidence for the Gain which we may procure from the exercise of <hi>Love to our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, there must be some Art made use of, and some Prudence set a work to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47219:88"/>
procure this Profit; and we deny it not where we have less advantage than we may here look for: But hereupon it will not fail us, or we shall not be disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our hopes, or <hi>not ashamed;</hi> and the Reason is plain; for, as Profit may be got not only from tame, but wild Beasts, not only from Trees in the <hi>Orchard,</hi> but from those in the <hi>Wood,</hi> and not only from <hi>sweet,</hi> but from <hi>salt and bitter Waters;</hi> In like manner, Profit may be acquir'd not only from domestical, kind, and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Friends; but from cruel, malicious, and despiteful Enemies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I can make it good, that if we love them, we may receive greater Profit from them than from our Friends; and the Reason is, because these, as good Fields, gives us <hi>Grain, Flowers,</hi> and <hi>Apples.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">N. B.</note> But when we have got the Skill to profit by our Enemies, though they be as it were <hi>scraggy and barren Mountains,</hi> yet they will give <hi>us Gold, and precious Iewels,</hi> and questionless, Rich, very rich Treasure lies hid under those <hi>Shrubs, Thistles, and Thorns</hi> of <hi>an Enemy:</hi> For, I pray Note, our Bodies frequently obtain Benefit and Gain from our Friends, but if we love our Enemies, our <hi>Souls</hi> shall procure from them the chiefest and greatest Gain, and this is so sure, that 'twas the Opinion of a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47219:89"/>
               <hi>Wise Father</hi> of the Christian Church, That <note place="margin">St. Bernard.</note> for advantage sake our Enemies should be loved more than our Friends; for tho' (says he) they mischief our Bodies, yet they profit our Souls; because they prepare everlasting Rewards for them, and tho' they pillage us of our Carnal and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, yet they gather up for us those things which are spiritual and heavenly; and hence the inference is plain, They are best to be loved who give us the best things, and as much to be preferr'd in the exercise of our Love, as eternal Riches are to temporal.</p>
            <p>It is true, Our <hi>Friends</hi> give us sweet and luscious things, but they stifle and choak our Souls; and bring them into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perdition! And it is as true, that our <hi>Enemies</hi> hate, and persecute us; but they are hereby the Instruments whereby we obtain Happiness; for, our <hi>Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> tells us, that we are happy when we are so used; and since it is thus, what Friend can be so beneficial to us?</p>
            <p>Moreover, those who are truly <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Christians</hi> (and we should strive to be so) have so much servent Charity, as that they can concoct Reproaches and Injuries, and be nourish'd, and grow by them.</p>
            <p>It is noted by <hi>Plutarch</hi> that those Beasts
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47219:89"/>
which have great Stomachs and healthful Bodies, though they eat <hi>Scorpions</hi> and <hi>Serpents,</hi> yet they can digest them; and he says that there be other Beasts which are nourish'd with <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Shells:</hi> In like manner those Couragious Christians who are <hi>hot with the flame of Divine Love,</hi> can digest all evil Surmises, and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are us'd against them; and they can grow plump and fat with such sort of <hi>Serpents and Scorpions;</hi> that is, <hi>have their Graces exercis'd and encreas'd by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon, I would to God we would all look back, and think of the hot Stomachs of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and then let us consider, have not they there with <hi>digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flames and hot Irons?</hi> And shall we, <hi>we Christians</hi> of this Age, be so squeamish, and of such weak Stomachs as not to digest a few angry Words and Slanders? <hi>O cold Stomachs!</hi> What! have many valiant Saints upon Record, nay delicate Virgins indur'd patiently Racks, and Beasts, and many other Torments, and do we say that we can't suffer the Reproaches of vile Men? Have they swallowed the most distasteful, and can't we sip a scarce Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Potion? For shame! How can we have the Foreheads to pray to be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Eternal Bliss with these Saints,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47219:90"/>
whose Examples we will not follow in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matters? Believe it, it is a shrewd sign that we are mostly our own Enemies, and that no Person injures us so much as we do our selves, unless we add the Devil to boot. For upon Examination we may find that his <hi>Cloven foot bruiseth us,</hi> and not the hard kickes of our inveterate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. He sucks the Blood not of our Bodies, but Souls; and does not plunder us of our perishing, and corruptible Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but of those which are eternal: Man who injures and persecutes us, is not our Enemy, but the Minister and Instructor <note place="margin">N.

            <p>When <hi>Rebecca</hi> had two Sons in her womb, <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> they strove between themselves: Hereupon God said, <hi>The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall serve the Younger,</hi> i. e. <hi>Esau, Iacob.</hi> Hence S. <hi>Augustin</hi> asks, How did <hi>Esau</hi> serve <hi>Iacob,</hi> since he persecuted him to Death, and through the fear of him he fied his Countrey? To which he answered, That the Elder was to serve the Younger not by <hi>Obedience,</hi> but <hi>Vexation,</hi> as the Fire serves the Gold: Wherefore tho' the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner persecutes the Righteous by Scoffs and Injuries, and threats of Death; yet he doth not hurt, but profit him, he doth him good and not evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not his Enemy: He is only his <hi>true Enemy,</hi> who seeks the Life of his Soul, and always studies to deprive him of his eternal Inheritance; and this the Devil doth, and therefore is his true and only <hi>true Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This wrought such Conviction <hi>upon one</hi> of the <hi>Assembly;</hi> who sate near the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47219:91"/>
present Speaker named <hi>Eureketas;</hi> that he openly said, Certainly he must have <hi>no Eye in</hi> his Soul, that is, no understanding, who cannot perceive much Splendour, and he must be a bad <hi>Accomptant,</hi> who cannot reckon up many Benefits which are plac'd in this Office of <hi>Love Enemy,</hi> as you have describ'd it to us: But if you can yet hold out, I would beg the Favour of you to teach me how to make those <hi>Engines</hi> by which I may frame it in my self, for till now I never esteemed it possible to be wrought in any Body.</p>
            <p>I shall, replied <hi>Eumenes,</hi> only teach you to make <hi>one Engine,</hi> and that will do it as well as a <hi>Thousand,</hi> and that is this; I would have you not only to know what the Grace of Charity is, as it hath been lately described to you; <hi>but to live in the right use, and exercise of it;</hi> for, as the heat of the Sun consumes the Clouds, so the heat of <hi>Charity</hi> melts away Injuries to nothing, and so translates an Enemy into a Friend: But on the contrary, as the <hi>cold of the Night nourisheth the Clouds,</hi> so the Heart grown cold with Malice and Revenge, retains and encreaseth Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and hatcheth Enmity out of a very little Injury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:47219:91"/>It is worth more than our ordinary Notice, what we read in Holy Writ of a <hi>little Cloud which ascended from the Sea,</hi> and then the Heavens were much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.</note> and many Clouds and much Wind did arise, and there followed a great Storm. For it may be thus applied, It is frequent in our present Case: That first a <hi>little Cloud</hi> ariseth from the Sea, that is, some <hi>small Injury from a salt, bitter heart,</hi> some Scurvy word is utter'd, and then other <hi>Clouds</hi> of Injuries do follow: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Mind is much darkned, and much <hi>Thunder and Rain,</hi> that is, many railing and angry Expressions fall; but if the heat of the <hi>Sun of Charity,</hi> exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the little Cloud of Reproaches, and disperseth it, then a <hi>Tempest</hi> of revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Evil will not arise.</p>
            <p>Upon Tryal, you will find that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Love is an hot Sun, and he that takes it away, deprives the World of that <hi>Planet;</hi> but if it remain, then as the Sun gives light to the Stars, so that will give Loveliness to <hi>Angels and Men:</hi> And as Gold gilds <hi>Wood and Iron,</hi> and adorns them, so will that Affection gild the Soul, and cloath it with the Ornament of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:47219:92"/>I am hugely satisfied said the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Eureketas,</hi> that an Engine made as you have directed, is proper to frame this sort of Affection, and when it is fram'd, I must own it to be an excellent Peice, and such as will make the Soul very gay and lovely. But there is one part of it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally disliked, and I have seen some scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Smile at it, and say that it spoils the whole, and indeed most Persons, whom I have convers'd with, <hi>Shoot</hi> some <hi>Bolt</hi> against it.</p>
            <p>I had thought, said <hi>Eumenes,</hi> to have given you a Taste, (a full Draught would prove nauseous) of the Sentiments which some entertain against this Duty of <hi>Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Enemies.</hi> But you speak but of one part which finds an ill Character with some Persons; and therefore I pray men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, that you may have your desired Resolution therein.</p>
            <p>It is then, with Submission, said he, That part of the Duty which concerns <hi>the forgiving of Injuries.</hi> That is replied <hi>Eumenes,</hi> a <hi>curious Slip</hi> of that <hi>delicate Flower,</hi> the <hi>Love of an Enemy;</hi> and it is Pity it should be blown upon, and ruffled with the Wind of a detracting Tongue: However proceed, and tell us, What is the ill Character which you have heard of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:47219:92"/>It is this, said <hi>Eureketas,</hi> Namely; that to <hi>forgive Injuries is</hi> called <hi>by some a low, pittiful sneaking, Temper,</hi> and us'd <hi>only by Persons of narrow, scanty Souls and Fortunes, and void</hi> of all <hi>Bravery and Courage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard the same said <hi>Eumenes:</hi> but this is an Errour, and such, which rather deserves Pity, if not Scorn, than a serious Thought, and an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it would <hi>be too too great an Honour for it:</hi> For I pray weigh the Matter, and <note place="margin">N. B.</note> tell me, Doth God himself account it high and noble to Forgive, and shall any Person account it vile and base? Is it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in the Lords eye, and shall it be despicable in the Servants? Surely if there can be any such Conceit, it must be the mishapen Child of Ignorance and Pride. There are other Persons who instead of <hi>forgiving Injuries,</hi> study to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Duty, by saying that if they do so, <hi>All People will slight them, and they shall bear no Figure, or a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one amongst their Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now herein I shall suppose as they do, and also that they may be scorched with the <hi>Iuniper Coals,</hi> or the scotts and Ieers of rude Tongues; but then I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest them to tell me, whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of God and Angels, will not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47219:93"/>
prove a Remedy sufficient to cure the smart which they suffer hereupon.</p>
            <p>It is well known that unworthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons condemn them, and those of the best Qualifications think them Praise-worthy; <hi>Fools deride,</hi> and <hi>Wise men admire them,</hi> and surely this Carriage may be made use of, as an <hi>Handkerchief</hi> to wipe off <hi>that slaver which they rudely cast upon them.</hi> It may so, said <hi>Eureketas,</hi> and, I think, if I apprehend the Case right, it is thus: If I should go to Law with any Person before a Iudge, and all People who hear my Case tell me, That it is their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I shall be cast in my Suit; and by some good means or other, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand from the <hi>Iudge</hi> the quite contrary: Now hereupon I should be strangely dull and simple, if I should be scared by them into a Distrust of my Suit, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dis-regard their Opinions, and put my Confidence of Success in the Iudges.</p>
            <p>Rightly, very <hi>rightly infer'd said</hi> Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and very apposite to our Purpose; for, if God says we do well, when we <hi>Love our Enemies;</hi> and that in so doing we shall get the greatest Gain and Honour, we need not matter what others prate, nor fear their evil Reports; if he <hi>be for us, we need not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> who are against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:47219:93"/>I may add hereto, That if we any whit value <hi>Generosity and Honour,</hi> and think that good, natural, and gentle Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour are Qualities not to be ridicul'd; we shall rather forgive than revenge the Affronts, and hard usages of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for, there are no Persons more Contemptible than they, <hi>Who seek for Glory in revenge;</hi> they are more like the <hi>Hangman</hi> who spares <hi>No body,</hi> than to our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, <hi>Who spares when we deserve Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and in wrath thinketh upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> Nay, They are more cruel than any <hi>Hangman;</hi> for, he makes some delay at the place of Execution, to permit the Condemned person to expiate for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by Confession and Repentance, and after that executes him without any Symptoms of Anger and Hatred; but they who resolve to revenge Offences, rage like mad Dogs, and enraged Wolves, and were it possible, would destroy the Bodies and Souls of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>And now, if to what hath been said to the Cavils of these Enemy-haters, we add a Meditation on the <hi>Deportment of</hi> David <hi>to</hi> Saul; we may for ever baffle their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious Humour, and if hereupon they bend not to a more mild and soft Temper, and become yielding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47219:94"/>
they will declare themselves very willful and perverse, and receive the same measure from their offended God, which they meet to their offending Neighbours; for tell me, <hi>I pray tell me,</hi> do they say, That they have an Enemy which is Matchless, an Enemy Cruel, Subtil, Envious, implacable and incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet he is not worse <hi>than Saul,</hi> and yet he was beloved of <hi>David,</hi> and once and again, and frequently endeared to him: And (which is <hi>highly worth our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi>) at those very times, when he laid a thousand Snares and Traps for his Life; and persever'd in his Tyranny, in spight of a World of kindness, and an whole <hi>Mine of Coals of Love laid on his head,</hi> which should have melted him into a more mild Temper.</p>
            <p>Now, what can our <hi>Enemy-haters</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of which hath any Colour of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to this usage, <hi>Which</hi> David <hi>met with from</hi> Saul? Is it (besides what hath been mentioned) because their Enemies have forced away part of their Inheritance? Is it because they damnified their Grain and Cattle in the Fields? Is it because they pillaged their Houses, and against all Equity possest themselves of their Goods, and made them as poor as <hi>Iob?</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:47219:94"/>
Is it because they have maliciously poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd the <hi>precious Ointment</hi> of their good Names? Is it because they live better, and are more eminent in the World, and have a greater Credit and Repute with their sober Neighbours than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have? Well, be it for all, or some of these Causes; yet surely it never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into their Thoughts to <hi>murder them, and their Lives found better Usage than their Fortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was it not even so in this <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> before us? And yet to these, these very Miscreants, the love of a <hi>Royal</hi> Heart was exercis'd, <hi>O Incomparable Love!</hi> And though it may not <hi>find,</hi> shall it also not <hi>make</hi> some Alteration in these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-haters; certainly it may, provided they will be at the small pains to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a Lesson but of one word, and that is, <hi>Consider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by your leave, said the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer <hi>Eureketas,</hi> what think you of that Expression of the Primitive Father <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen;</hi> wherein he says, <hi>there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Peace, and an useful sort of Discord?</hi> Does it not <hi>contract</hi> that Duty which you <hi>spun</hi> out almost <hi>into an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable Line;</hi> and is it not against the Love you plead for, as being unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47219:95"/>
with any Peace which is unprofitable, or any Discord which is useful? No, no, answered <hi>Eumenes;</hi> but it intimates that our Love and Peaceable Temper to our Enemies, should be declar'd not upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Terms,</hi> but only such as are <hi>Lawful;</hi> or which have Peace with them without Confederacy with their Lusts; and jar and fight with these, whilst they kiss and embrace those.</p>
            <p>I beg, said <hi>Eureketas,</hi> the Resolution of one more Problem from you, and then praying your pardon for what is past, shall give no more Interruption: And it is, whether what you have said would not prove as injurious to the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> as Enemies are to them which hate them; and whether they have not as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be exhorted to love hereupon, as any others who have been wronged in their Trades and Estates, and good Names? For should your Doctrine prove Orthodox, there would be little to do in <hi>Westminster Hall;</hi> and the Iudges have <note place="margin">Dan. <hi>Cronlc.</hi> H. 7.</note> as much leisure to talk or fleep, as they had in that part of one King's Reign, when in one Term of the Year there was but one Sergeant at Law employ'd in that Place; and whether this might be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and injurious to them or not, will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47219:95"/>
scarce require a <hi>Poll</hi> to determine.</p>
            <p>In answer hereto <hi>Eumenes</hi> said, that his Doctrine of <hi>Love-Enemy</hi> stood firm, and was not built upon the prejudice of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> or the Ruines of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Authority;</hi> for, though we may not take it our selves, yet the Iudge and Magistrate may give us Satisfaction for Injuries and Affronts: 'Tis true, we must not require it of them with <hi>ulcerated Minds;</hi> that is, <hi>with Anger, and Pride, and Malice, and Revenge, or Hatred,</hi> or <hi>any such infectious Passions settled in them; and breaking out from them against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and harmful Person:</hi> But with meek, humble, sober, peaceable, and <note place="margin">N. B.</note> mild Tempers; and it must be from a Zeal for Iustice, and for Quietness sake, and from a desire to make them better who have wronged us; and withal 'tis much, very much better to lose many, nay all our Worldly Concerns, than to let go our Patience, and Christian Charity.</p>
            <p>But since these Sayings, says <hi>Eumenes,</hi> may be thought to be only my own Thoughts and Iudgment, I shall by dint of Argument defend and maintain this my Answer, as I have the <hi>Office of Love-Enemy,</hi> upon which this Question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; and my Reasons are partly, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:47219:96"/>
               <hi>God hath appointed Magistrates, and Trials of Cases, and Iurisdiction, and he doth nothing contrary to Charity;</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>because Laws are establish'd in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick matters well ordered for the repairing of Injuries, and comforting of those who are hereby grieved.</hi> Now these would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Cyphers</hi> if there must be no Accompt made of them, against those who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and oppressive; and partly, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is profitable for the very Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors themselves</hi> that they be sued, and punished for their Wrongs and unjust Dealings; and that their Prey so got, should be taken from them; and assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a part of Love to cause them to suffer Punishment according to due course of Law: For he is lovingly and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally setter'd and chastis'd, who is restrain'd thereby from his Oppression.</p>
            <p>Upon this Head, I remember the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Advice which <hi>Seneca</hi> gives to <hi>Lucili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">47 <hi>Epist.</hi>
               </note> in one of his Epistles.</p>
            <p>—It is, says he, behoveful to neglect <note place="margin">N. B.</note> Injuries, and Taunts, and Checks, which I will call <hi>the Shadows of Injuries,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I deserve them or not: For if I do, it is not a proper Check or Scoff, but a just Opinion given of me: <hi>If not,</hi> then he who was injurious should blush here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and not my self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:47219:96"/>Now if there be not one Reason (and it is impossible there should) why each Christian should not <hi>Con this Lesson,</hi> as exactly as any Philosopher, I am sure there are a great many, you have been told of, why he should do it better.</p>
            <p>I shall add one Example to the former I have cited, and soon after put a period to this Discourse; and what you may (in your Retirements) super-add by your Meditating upon what you have heard and read, and known hereof, will so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Duty of <hi>Love Enemy,</hi> that it shall never be doubted of hereafter, but put in exercise with great Zeal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. The Example is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrrhas</hi> King of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> had heard that certain of his Subjects had injur'd his Name over their Cups amongst the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines:</hi> He sent for some of them, and ask'd whether what he had heard, and then repeated to them, was true? One of them answered, <hi>That if they had not wanted Wine, that which was told him was but Mirth and Iest to what they should have said of him.</hi> This blunt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of this Debauch, and such a plain Confession of Truth, turn'd their King's Frowns into Smiles; and by this his Mildness and Love, he afterward procur'd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47219:97"/>
the <hi>Tarentines</hi> Thanks whenever they were sober, and their Hussa's and good Wishes, when in their Revels and Iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Your Example in this case, said <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> is very apposite and worthy to be added to those we have mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and may not only confirm to our Understandings, but cause our Wills to embrace and choose this Love of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as you have very pertinently noted: And if in our united Devotions we would beseech Almighty God to teach us it by the Hand of his Holy Spirit, (without which all our Labour will be Idleness, and our Care Negligence) we shall prove good Proficients in this Art; for as red-hot Iron burns by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which penetrates its Substance, and not of it self; so we become zealous, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd herein not through our own dull Natures, but by the Fire of Divine Love, which God by his Holy Spirit kindles in us.</p>
            <p>With this wholesom Advice <hi>Eumenes</hi> shut up his Discourse; and <hi>Glycon</hi> not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing the Assembly thereupon, as he had formerly done, they chearfully wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know the Reason hereof, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47219:97"/>
(as it fell out) that himself would dictate something worthy of himself, and useful to them? And after some Preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, he stood up, and made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them what an incomparable Art of Memory he had learned; for a short account of the reason of his Intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, instead of presenting them with his Note-Book, as a dumb Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of what the former Lecturers had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, he made himself a Speaking-Book to them by a punctual Rehearsal thereof; and when he had thus gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, he dismiss'd the Assembly.</p>
