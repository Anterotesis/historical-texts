            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you: How meanly ſoever, and unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it preſents it ſelfe to your view, yet it comes to you on a great errand, as the faithfull Meſſenger of all the peaceable and right-affected ſonnes of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and in their names, humbly craves a gracious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance: Had it regarded the pomp and oſtentation of names, it might have gloried in a train paſt number; It is but a poore ſtock that may be counted; Millions of hands (if that tumultuary, and under-hand way of procured ſubſcriptions could have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope for favour in your eyes) ſhall at your leaſt Command, give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to that, which this ſcroll doth in their names humbly tender unto you.</p>
            <p>Ye are now happily (through Gods bleſsing) met in a much-longed-for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48:3"/>
Parliament; It were but a narrow word to ſay that the eyes of all us the good Subjects of the whole Realme are fixed upon your ſucceſſe; Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are not more eyes in theſe three intereſſed Kingdomes, then are now bent upon you; yea all the neighbour Churches and Kingdomes, if I may not ſay the whole Chriſtian world, and, no ſmall part beyond it, look wiſhly upon your faces, and with ſtretched-out necks gaze at the iſſue of your great Meeting; Neither doubt wee but ſince Soveraigne Authority hath for this purpoſe both ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and actuated you, you will not faile to produce ſomething worthy of ſo high an expectation.</p>
            <p>Yee are the Sanctuary, whereto now every man flees, whether really, or pretendedly diſtreſſed; Even a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48:4"/>
               <hi>Ioab</hi> or <hi>Adonijah</hi> will bee alſo taking hold of the hornes of the Altar: Your noble wiſedomes know how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of men and actions, and your inviolable juſtice knowes to award each his owne.</p>
            <p>Many things there are doubtleſſe, which you finde worthy of a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reformation, both in Church and State. Neither can it be otherwiſe, but that in a pamperd full body, diſeaſes will grow through reſt. Ponds that are ſeldome ſcoured will eaſily gather mud; metals, ruſt; and thoſe patients that have inured themſelves to a ſet courſe of medicinall evacuations, if they intermit their ſprings and falls, fall into feverous diſtempers; Not, that ſupreme, and immediately-ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Authority hath in the meane time been wanting to its charge;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48:4"/>
Surely, unleſſe wee would ſuppoſe Princes to be Gods, wee cannot think they can know all things: Of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they muſt look with others eyes, and heare with others eares, and be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by others tongues, and act by others hands; and when all is done, even the moſt regular, and carefully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inquiſitive State is not like the Sunne, from whoſe light and heat nothing is hid.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expected that thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations which attend the Southerne Pole, ſhould take view of our Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, or intermixe their influences with thoſe above our heads; Every agent is required, and allowed to work within the compaſſe of its own activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Yee therefore, who by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of your diſperſed habitations, enjoy the advantage of having the whole
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48:5"/>
Kingdome, and all the corners of it within your eies, may both clearly ſee all thoſe enormities, wherewith any part is infeſted, (unknown to remoter intelligence) and can beſt judge to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply meet remedies thereunto. Neither can it be, but that thoſe eies of yours, which have been privately vigilant, within the places of your ſeverall abodes, muſt needs (not without much regret) in this your publique Meeting, take notice of the miſerable diſorders of ſo many vicious and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſons, as have thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon your cognizance.</p>
            <p>Whiles the Orthodoxe part in this whole Realme, hath (to the praiſe of their patience) been quietly ſilent, as ſecurely conſcious of their own right, and innocence, how many furious and malignant ſpirits every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48:5"/>
where have burſt forth into ſclande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Libels, bitter Paſquines, railing Pamphlets? (under which more Preſſes then one have groaned) wherein they have indeavoured, through the ſides of ſome miſliked perſons, to wound that ſacred Government, which (by the joynt-confeſsion of all reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vines) derives it ſelfe from the times of the bleſſed Apoſtles, without any interruption, (without the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any one Congregation in the Chriſtian world) unto this preſent age; Wherein, as no doubt their lewd boldneſſe hath been extremely offenſive to your wiſedomes, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo may it pleaſe you to check this daring, and miſ-grounded inſolence of theſe Libellers, and by ſome ſpeedy Declaration to let the world know, how much you deteſt this their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or ignorant preſumption; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48:6"/>
by ſome needfull Act to put a preſent reſtraint upon the wilde and lawleſſe courſes of all their factious combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abroad, and enterpriſes of this kinde.</p>
            <p>And if you finde it paſſe for one of the maine accuſations againſt ſome great perſons, now queſtioned before you, that they endeavoured to alter the forme of the eſtabliſhed government of the Common-wealth; how can theſe Pamphleters ſeem worthy of but an eaſie cenſure, which combine their counſels and practiſes, for the changing of the ſetled form of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church? Since, if Antiquity may be the rule, the civill Politie hath ſometimes varied, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, never; And if originall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may carry it; that came from arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary impoſers, this, from men inſpired,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48:6"/>
and from them in an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable clearneſſe derived to us: And if thoſe be branded for Incendiaries, which are taxed of attempting to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce new formes of adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rules of Divine worſhip into our neighbour Church, how ſhall thoſe <hi>boute-feux</hi> of ours eſcape, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to doe theſe offices to our owne? the ſeverall, and daily variable projects whereof, are not worthy of your knowledge, or our confutation; Let me have leave to inſtance in two, the prime ſubjects of their quarrell, and contradiction; Leitourgie, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy.</p>
            <p>The Liturgie of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> hath been hitherto eſteemed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, reverently uſed by holy Martyrs, daily frequented by devout Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as that, which more then once
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48:7"/>
hath been allowed and confirmed by the Edicts of religious Princes, and by your own Parliamentary Acts; and but lately, being tranſlated into other Languages, hath been entertained abroad, with the great applauſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Divines and Churches; Yet, now, begins to complain of ſcorn at home: The Matter is quarrelled by ſome, the Form by others, the Uſe of it by both: That which was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of in the Church of God, whether Jewiſh, or Chriſtian, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſcription of the moſt holy devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offendeth. Surely, our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his gracious Fore-runner, were ſo farre from this new Divinitie, as that they plainly taught that, which theſe men gain-ſay; a direct forme of prayer; and ſuch, as that part of the frame preſcribed by our Saviour, was compoſed of the formes of devotion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48:7"/>
then formerly uſuall; And Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> his daies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly practiſed it; and put it over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the times of the Goſpel; under which, whiles it is ſaid that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went up to the Temple at the ninth houre of prayer, we know the prayer wherewith they joyned was not of an extemporary, and ſudden conception, but of a regular preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the formes whereof are yet extant, and ready to be produced; And the Euangelicall Church, ever ſince, thought it could never better improve her peace, and happineſſe, then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe religious models of invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and thankſgiving; which they have traduced unto us: And can ye then with patience think, that any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Chriſtian ſhould be ſo farre miſ-tranſported, as to condemne a good prayer, becauſe, as it is in his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48:8"/>
heart, ſo it is in his book too? Far be it from me to diſhearten any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian from the uſe of conceived prayer, in his private devotions; and upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion alſo, in the publique; I would hate to be guilty of pouring ſo much water upon the ſpirit, to which I ſhall gladly adde oyle rather; No, let the full ſoule freely poure out it ſelf in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious expreſsions of its holy thoughts, into the boſome of the Almighty: Let both the ſudden flaſhes of our quick ejaculations, and the conſtant flames of our more fixed conceptions mount up from the altar of a zealous heart, unto the throne of Grace; and if there be ſome ſtops or ſoleciſmes in the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent utterance of our private wants, theſe are ſo far fro being offenſive, that they are the moſt pleaſing muſique to the eares of that God, unto whom our prayers come: Let them be broken off
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48:8"/>
with ſobs, and ſighes, and incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our delivery, our good God is no otherwiſe affected to this imperfect elocution, then an indulgent Parent is to the clipped, and broken language of his deare childe, which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to him then any others ſmooth Oratory; This is not to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in another, by any man that hath found the true operation of this grace in himſelfe: But in the meane time, let the publique formes of the ſacred Church-Liturgie have its due honour; Let this, by the power of your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be re-inforced, as that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelected, out of ancient models, (not Romane, but Chriſtian) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the holy Martyrs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the bleſſed Reformation of Religion, hath received abundant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of ſtrength, both from the zealous recommendation of foure moſt religious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48:9"/>
Princes, and your own moſt firme and peremptory eſtabliſhment; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which powerfull induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is worthy of no ſleight conſideration, which I humbly tender unto you, from the judgement of the learnedſt King that ever ſate upon this Throne, or (as I verily think) ſince <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> time, upon any other; King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory, who (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever miſ-alledged by ſome, as letting fall diſgracefull ſpeeches concerning this ſubject) after a ſolemne hearing of thoſe exceptions, which were taken by ſome againſt this open forme of Common-prayer, (as it is called in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Act for uniformity) ſhuts up in his Proclamation given at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the fifth of <hi>March,</hi> in the firſt yeare of his raigne, with theſe words; <q>And laſt of all, We admoniſh all men, that hereafter they ſhall not expect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48:9"/>
or attempt any farther alteration into the Common and publike forme of Gods ſervice, from this, which is now eſtabliſhed; For that, neither will We give way to any, to preſume, that Our own judgement having determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a matter of this weight, ſhall be ſwayed to alteration, by the frivolous ſuggeſtion of any light ſpirit; Neither are We ignorant of the inconveniences that doe ariſe in Government, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting innovation in things once ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by mature deliberation: And how neceſſary it is to uſe conſtancy in the upholding of the publique determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of States; for that ſuch is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, and unſtedfaſtneſſe of ſome diſpoſitions, affecting every yeare new formes of things, as, if they ſhould be followed in their unconſtancie, would make all actions of State, ridiculous and contemptible; whereas the ſtedfaſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48:10"/>
maintaining of things, by good adviſe eſtabliſhed, is the weale of all Common-wealths.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, that great Oracle of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Learning, whom I beſeech you ſuppoſe, that you ſtill heare dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this prudent and religious adviſe to your preſent eares; and conſider how requiſite it is for you, out of the reaſon both of State, and pietie, to reſt in that his ſound, and exquiſite judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for thoſe particularities of exceptions which have been taken by ſome at certain paſſages of that Book, they have more then once received full ſatisfaction, by other pens: Let me onely ſay thus much, That were the Readers but as charitable, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers were religiouſly devout; thoſe quarrels had either never been raiſed, or had ſoone died, alone: Oh ſuffer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48:10"/>
not then, I beſeech you, this holy form of Gods Service, to be expoſed to the proud contempt of ignorant, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſons; maintain, and beare up the pious acts of your godly prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, yea, make good your owne: And if our holy Martyrs heretofore went to heaven with a Litany in their mouth; Let not an ill adviſed new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangleneſſe be ſuffered to put ſcorn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, wherein they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy.</p>
            <p>As for that forme of Epiſcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which hath hitherto obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church of God, I confeſſe, I am confounded in my ſelfe, to heare with what unjuſt clamours, it is cried down abroad, by either weak, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious perſons; of either, or both which, I may well take up that word of our Saviour, <hi>Father forgive them, for</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48:11"/>
               <hi>they know not what they doe:</hi> Surely, could thoſe look with my eies, they would ſee cauſe to be thoroughly aſhamed of this their injurious miſ-conceit; and ſhould be forced to confeſſe, that never any good cauſe had more reaſon to complain of a wrongfull proſecution; Were this Ordinance meerly humane, and eccleſiaſticall, if there could no more be ſaid for it, but that it is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ancient, of more then 1500 yeares ſtanding, and that it hath continued in this Iland, ſince the firſt plantation of the Goſpel, to this preſent day, without contradiction: A man would think this were enough plea to challenge a reverent reſpect, and an Immunity from all thoughts of alteration; For, even nature if ſelfe teaches us to riſe up before the hoare-head; and hath wrought in us a ſecret honour, even to the very outward gravity of age; and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48:11"/>
juſt policie teaches us, not eaſily to give way to the change of thoſe things, which long uſe, and many Lawes have firmly eſtabliſhed, as neceſſary, or beneficiall.</p>
            <p>Yea, the wiſedome of the ancient Grecians went ſo farre, as to forbid the removall of a well ſetled evill; But, if religion teach us better things, and tell us, that nothing morally evill, can be ſetled well: and being, however, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, had the more need to be (after too long delay) removed; Yet right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſound experience informe us, that things indifferent, or good, having been by continuance, and generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation well rooted in Church, or State; may not upon light grounds be pulled up: But, this holy calling fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches its pedegree higher, even from no leſſe, then Apoſtolicall; (and therefore,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48:12"/>
in that right, Divine) inſtitution; For, although thoſe things which the Founders and prime Governours of the Euangelicall Church did, as men, went no further then their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet, what they did as Apoſtles, is of an higher and more ſacred conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and, if as Apoſtolike men, they did, upon occaſion, enact ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary things, which were to die with, or before them, yet, thoſe things which they ordained for the ſucceeding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Church which they ſhould leave behinde them, in all eſſentiall matters, can be no otherwiſe conſtrued, then as exemplary, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.</p>
            <p>Now if to this Text, we ſhall adde the undoubted Commentary of the Apoſtles own practiſes, and to this Commentary, we ſhall ſuper-adde
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48:12"/>
the unqueſtionable gloſſe of the cleare practiſe of their immediate ſucceſlors, in this adminiſtration, continued in Chriſts Church to this very day; what ſcruple can remain in any ingenuous heart? but, if any one reſolve to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unſatisfied, in ſpight of reaſon, and all evidence of hiſtory, and will wilfully ſhut his eies, with a purpoſe not to ſee the light, that man is paſt my cure, and almoſt my pity: The good God of heaven be mercifull to ſuch a miſ-zealous obſtinacy: Certainly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all hiſtories, all Authors faile us, nothing can be more plain then this truth; Out of them, we can, and doc ſhew, on whom the Apoſtles of Chriſt laid their hands, with an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement and conveyance of Impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juriſdiction; we ſhew what Biſhops ſo ordained lived in the times of the Apoſtles; and ſucceeded each
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48:13"/>
other, in their ſeverall charges, under the eies and hands of the then living Apoſtles; We ſhew who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded thoſe immediate ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in their ſeverall Sees, throughout all the regions of the Chriſtian Church; and deduce their uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Line, through all the following ages, to this preſent day; And if there can be better evidence under heaven, for any matter of fact, (and in this cauſe, matter of fact ſo derived, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth matter of right) let Epiſcopacy be for ever abandoned out of Gods Church; But if theſe be (as they are) certain and irrefragable; Alas, what ſtrange fury poſſeſſeth the minds of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, unſtable men, that they ſhould thus headily deſire, and ſue to ſhake off ſo ſacred, and well grounded an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48:13"/>
But I hear what they ſay; It is not the office of Epiſcopacy that diſpleaſes, but the quality: The Apoſtles Biſhops, and ours, were two; Theirs was no other then a parochiall Paſtor, a preaching Presbyter without inequalitie, without any rule over his brethren; Ours claims an eminent ſuperiority, whether in a diſtinct order, or degree; and a power of Ordination, Juriſdiction, unknown to the Primitive times. Alas, alas, how good people may be abuſed by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information! Heare, I beſeech you, the words of truth and confidence; If our Biſhops challenge any other ſpirituall power, then was by Apoſtolique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority delegated unto, and required of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Angels of the ſeven Aſian Churches, (ſome whereof are known to us by name) let them be diſclaimed as uſurpers; and if we doe not ſhew, out of the genuine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48:14"/>
and undeniable writings of thoſe holy men, which lived both in the times of the Apoſtles and ſome yeares after them, and converſed with them, as their bleſſed fellow-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, a cleare and received diſtinction, both of the names and offices of the Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons, as three diſtinct ſubordinate Callings, in Gods Church, with an evident ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the duty and charge belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to each of them; Let this claimed Hierarchy, be for ever hooted out of the Church: And if the bounty of religious Princes have thought meet to grace this ſacred function, with ſome acceſsion of titles, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; far be it from us to think, that the ſubſtance and eſſentiall parts of that Calling is ought impaired, or altered, by ſuch gracious munificence; And, although (as the world goes) theſe honors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48:14"/>
cannot ballance the contempt of thoſe eminent places; and that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is now made hereditary to the Church) cannot, in the moſt of theſe dignities, (after all deductions) boaſt of any ſuperfluity, yet (ſuch as they are) if any man have ſo little grace, and power of ſelfe-government, as to be puffed up with pride, or tranſported to an immoderation in the uſe of theſe adventitious favours; the ſin is perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, the calling free; which may be, and is managed by others, with all humble ſociableneſſe, hoſpitall fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, conſcionable improvement of all meanes and opportunities to the good of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>I may not yet diſſemble, that, whiles we plead the divine right of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, a double ſcandall is taken, by men, otherwiſe not unjudicious, and caſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48:15"/>
upon us from the uſuall ſuggeſtions of ſome late Pamphleters; The one, that we have deſerted our former Tenet, not without the great prejudice of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; for, whereas we were wont to acknowledge the deriving of our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, as in fee, from the beneficent hand of Kings, and Princes; now as either proudly, or ungratefully caſting off that juſt dependence, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingneſſe, we ſtand upon the claime of our Epiſcopacy, from a divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; The other, that, whiles we labour to defend the Divine right of our Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, we ſeeme to caſt a dangerous imputation upon thoſe Reformed Churches, which want that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Both which, muſt be ſhortly cleared.</p>
            <p>The former had never been found worth objecting, if men had wiſely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48:15"/>
learned to conſider, how little incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibleneſſe there is in this caſe, of Gods Act, and the Kings; both of them have their proper object, and extent: The office is from God; the place, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and power, wherein that office is exerciſed, is from the King; it is the King that gives the Biſhoprick, it is God that makes the Biſhop; Where was it ever heard of, that a Soveraigne Prince claimed the power of ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Paſtor in the Church? this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from none, but ſpirituall hands: On the other ſide, who but Princes can take upon them, to have power to erect, and diſpoſe of Epiſcopall Sees, within their own Dominions? It is with a King, and a Biſhop, as with the Patron, and the Incumbent: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron gives the Benefice to his Clerk, but pretends not to give him Orders, That this man is a Miniſter, he hath
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48:16"/>
from his Dioceſan; that he is Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he hath from his Patron; Whiles he acknowledgeth his Orders from the Reverend hands of his Biſhop, doth he derogate ought from the bounty of a Patrons free preſentation? No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is it with Epiſcopacy; which thankfully profeſſes to hold at once from God and the King; Its calling, of God, its place and exerciſe of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, of the King: And, if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that both ſome former, and Modern Divines, both abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at home, borrowing S. <hi>Ieromes</hi> phraſe, have held the ſuperiority of Biſhops over Presbyters, to be grounded rather upon the cuſtome of the Church, then any appointment of Chriſt, I muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Firſt, that we cannot preſcribe to other mens thoughts; when all is ſaid, men will take liberty, (and who can hinder it?) to abound in their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48:16"/>
own ſenſe: But ſecondly, if they ſhall grant (as they ſhall be forced) that this cuſtome was of the Church Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>call, and had its riſe, with the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, approbation, practiſe of thoſe inſpired Legates of Chriſt, and was from their very hands recommended to the then preſent, and ſubſequent Church, for continuance; there is no ſuch great diſſonance in the opinions, as may be worthy of a quarrell.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, is intended to raiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy againſt us, as the uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and condemners of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our Government: Wherein, we do juſtly complain of a ſclanderous aſperſion caſt upon us; We love and honour thoſe Siſter-Churches, as the dear Spouſe of Chriſt; we bleſſe God for them; and we doe heartily wiſh
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48:17"/>
unto them that happineſſe in the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip of our adminiſtration, which, I doubt not, but they doe no leſſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh unto themſelves.</p>
            <p>Good words, you will perhaps ſay, but what is all this faire complement, if our act condemne them, if our very Tenet exclude them? for, if Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſtand by Divine right, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of thoſe Churches that want it? Malice and ignorance are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this unjuſt aggravation: Firſt, our poſition is onely affirmative; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the juſtifiableneſſe, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an Epiſcopall calling, without any further implication: Next, when we ſpeak of Divine right, we meane not an expreſſe Law of God, requiring it upon the abſolute neceſsity of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church (what hinderances ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may interpoſe) but a Divine inſtitution,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48:17"/>
warranting it where it is, and requiring it where it may be had; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church therefore, which is capable of this forme of Government, both may, and ought to affect it, as that, which is, with ſo much Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Apoſtles, to the whole body of the Church upon earth; but, thoſe particular Churches, to whom this power and faculty is denied, loſe nothing of the true eſſence of a Church, though they miſſe ſomething of their glory and perfection, whereof they are barred, by the neceſsity of their condition; Neither are liable to any more imputation, in their credit, and eſteeme, then an honeſt, frugall, offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tenant, who, notwithſtanding the profer of all obſequious ſervices, is tied to the limitations and termes of an hard Landlord. But ſo much we have reaſon to know, of the judgement of

the neighbour Churches, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Divines, that, if they might hope to live ſo long, as to ſee a full freedome of option tendred unto them, by Soveraigne Authority, with all ſutable conditions, they would moſt gladly embrace this our forme of Government; which differs little from their owne, ſave, in the perpetuity of their (<gap reason="foreign">

And, if whiles theſe challenge a due reſpect from all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Chriſtians, ſome others heare ill, (how deſervedly, God knows, and will in due time manifeſt) yet, why ſhould an holy calling ſuffer? why ſhould the faults (if ſuch be) of ſome, diffuſe their blame to all?

of this Engliſh Church; tell me, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I beſeech you, what are the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this Church? what the diſtinction of the Profeſſors and Religion? and, if the clients of the Prelacy, and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, (whoſe ſeverall thouſands are pun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctually calculated) be they who make up this Prelaticall Church, what grounds of faith, what new Creed doe they hold, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their neighbours? what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what Baptiſme, what Euchariſt, what Chriſt, what heaven, what meanes of ſalvation other then the reſt? Alas, my brethren, whiles we doe fully agree in all theſe, and all other Doctrinall and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call points of religion; why will ye be ſo uncharitable, as by theſe frivolous and cauſleſſe diviſions, to rend the ſeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe coat of Chriſt? Is it a Title, or a Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or a Ceremony, a garment, or a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or an Organ-pipe, that can make us a different Church, whiles we preach and profeſſe the ſame ſaving Truth, whiles
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48:23"/>
we deſire (as you profeſſe to doe) to walk conſcionably with our God, according to that one rule of the Royall Law of our Maker; whiles we oppoſe one and the ſame common enemy, whiles we unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly indeavour to hold the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace? Oh conſider, I beſeech you in the feare of God, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether theſe be the thoughts of the ſons of peace, and ſuch as are ſutable to the charge, and legacy of our deare Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and think ſeriouſly from what ſpirit they proceed; For us, we make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all (in the right and intereſt of the Church) betwixt Clergy and Laity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Clergy and Laity of one part, and another; we are all your true bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; we are one with you, both in heart and brain; and hope to meet you in the ſame heaven; but if yee will needs bee otherwiſe minded, we can but bewaile the Churches miſery, and your ſin; and ſhall beſeech God to be mercifull to your

willing and uncharitable ſeparation. Howſoever, I have freed my ſoule before my God, in the conſcience of this juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation, and faithfull adviſe.</p>
            <p>What remains, but that I poure out my heart in my fervent, and dayly prayers to the Father of all mercies, that it would pleaſe him to inſpire this Great Counſell, with all wiſedome from above; and crown this great meeting with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all happy ſucceſſe, ſo as it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much glory to his own name, much complacency and contentment to his deare Anointed, comfort to all good hearts, terror to his enemies, ſeaſonable reſtraint to all inſolence and faction, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all Innovations; and laſtly, a firm peace and ſettlement to this Church and Common-wealth, and to all other his Majeſties Dominions? Which God grant for the ſake of the Son of his love, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>
