            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of piracies: yet some numbers of vessels armed with certayne disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
persons mixt of sundry nations, do still haunt the narowe seas, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
secretly into small Creekes and obscure places of this Realme for reliefe
of vitayles, and suche lyke: And for their better defence to escape apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
do colourably pretende that they be licenced to serue on the seas, and are
not to be accompted culpable as pirates. For remedie whereof, and to the
intent no maner of pretext shall serue eyther suche persons to commit piracies, or any other that shall relieue
them for priuate gayne or fauour by fayned colours or pretence of ignoraunce: Her Maiestie straightly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

to the vsage of marchauntes, vppon payne that whosoeuer shall do the contrarie, or be consentyng thereto,
shalbe vppon due information committed to prison, there to remayne without bayle, vntyll inquisition be
made (accordyng to the lawes of this Realme) of them and their factes, as in cases of piracies, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged
and executed as pirates, as by lawe shalbe ordered. And whosoeuer shall geue information hereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
any officer of the customes, or any their deputies, and shalbe able to proue the same, if any wise the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmer
be meete to exercise the same office, they shall inioy the same, or otherwyse shalbe duely and liberally
recompensed accordyng to their demerites.</p>
            <p>Furthermore her Maiestie wylleth and commaundeth all maner her officers, and specially Wardens of
Portes, Uiceadmiralles, Constables, or Capitaynes of Castles vpon the seas, and al other hauyng any office
in Port townes or places of landyng, that they shall foorth with, as they wyll aunswere at their vttermost
