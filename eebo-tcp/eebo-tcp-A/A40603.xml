            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT a Grand Match of the Royal
Sport of Cock-Fighting in <hi>Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Fields, in <hi>Aviarium,</hi> or the
Kingdom of Birds, there lately
happened a private Quarrel between a Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
Ambitious, Superſtitious <hi>Albanian
Mag-Pye,</hi> and a Phanatical, Covenanting,
Seditious <hi>Scotian Black-Bird:</hi> The Conteſt
was for Preheminence, but the Controverſie
being hot and encreaſing, and like to prove
dangerous Effects (the <hi>Eagle,</hi> King of Birds,
not being in the way) it was appointed that
the Two Criminals ſhould be Tryed by a
<hi>Non-ſuch</hi> Commiſſion, for the ſafety of the
Kingdom, in the hallow Oak formerly called

            <p>The Court being thus orderly ſet, Silence
Commanded, the Priſoners were Arraign'd,
and their Indictments Read by <hi>Tom Tit,</hi> Clerk
of the Crown: After which, the <hi>Parrot,</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
General, and chief Speaker for the
King, opened their Indictment thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and this
Honourable Court: The Two Priſoners at
Bar, Sir <hi>Roger Magpye,</hi> Knight and no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and <hi>Robert Sterling,</hi> alias <hi>Black-Bird,</hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſtand Indicted as falſe Traytors
and grievous Malefactors, contrary to the
Peace of our Soveraign Lord the King, have
with their Idle Chattering, ſet our Bills on
edge, and made it their Buſineſs (in this
dangerous Time; wherein the Peace and
<pb facs="tcp:31156:2"/>
Tranquility of the Kingdom hangeth on ſo
ſlender a Bough) to Sow the Seeds of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhake the Root of the Royal Oak, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Eagle</hi> hath built his Neſt, and (by
kindling a Spark of Animoſity) to ſet on fire
the whole Kingdom of Birds: Therefore,
in Name and Authority of our Soveraign
Lord the Royal <hi>Eagle,</hi> I require Juſtice to
be executed on the Priſoners according to
utmoſt extremity of the Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On this the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hawk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to look grim, and after ſome ſharp and
noiſome Words and Threats, asked the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
whether they were Guilty or not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Magpye,</hi> being the Bird in Faſhion,
began to clear himſelf firſt, in indirect terms;
telling, That the <hi>Black Bird</hi> gave him the
firſt Affront and Provocation, by throwing
Dirt at his white Feathers, in the Streets of
<hi>Troynovant,</hi> whilſt he was taking care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Feathering of his Neſt, as all
<hi>Coffee-Polian</hi> Birds, could teſtifie.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> reply'd thus: <q>I do
acknowledge and teſtifie, That at the time
I threw this late Kennel Dirt (which I had
wrapt up in a ſheet of Paper) at the Lazie
<hi>Magpye,</hi> he and I were good Friends from
the Bill out: But the intollerable provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſome Ambitious <hi>Magpyes</hi> our Tribe
have met with formerly, are ſtill freſh in
our Remembrance; and the Feud now is
ſo great, and become ſo natural, that it is
as eaſie to reconcile Light with Darkneſs,
as to make us good Friends, till they throw
by their white Feathers, and give over a
great many more of their affected Geſtures.
But ſince I gave them the laſt Affront, they
have accuſed us of Treaſon againſt the Line
of our Royal King, as being acceſſary to
the twiſting off the Head of the beſt of
<hi>Eagles,</hi> whilſt it is known to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Judges, <hi>Hawk, Cuckow,</hi> and <hi>Batt,</hi>
that the Actors of that dreadful Tragedy
were <hi>Storks, D</hi>—, and <hi>Moles.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Magpye.</speaker>
               <p>Your Sect is never at quiet,
you are ſtill affronting our Lordſhips, you
are an inferior Crew of Seditious Sciſmaticks;
you are all <hi>Publicans,</hi> and cannot live in Peace
under any King; you convene privately in
Flocks under Hedges, and at a dark and
ſhady Grove, called <hi>Coffee-Polian Boriale,</hi>
where in ſeveral Cluſters of <hi>Tub-Chanters,</hi> you
Plot nothing but Miſchief, and Sow Sedition.</p>

               <speaker>Black-Bird.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are all Forgeries, the
Bench knoweth the contrary, at leaſt thoſe
who know the Hiſtory of the Times, and
preſent State of the Kingdom. But one of
your over-grown <hi>Magpyes</hi> pick'd up a ſtately
<hi>Lapwing</hi> with a Pyebald Top-Knot near the
Sea Coaſt, and carrying to the <hi>Belzebub</hi>-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
near the <hi>Rooks-Cloyſter,</hi> by the <hi>Weſtern-Gate,</hi>
got her with Egg of a young <hi>Jacobite,</hi>
but as ſoon as ſhe began to look big-bellied
of a new Plot, he run away and left the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
to look after the Chick: But had not the
Egg been Birth-cruſh'd on the <hi>Triple Tree,</hi> it
might have been hatcht to a <hi>Cockatrice,</hi> and
brought the whole Kingdom to Confuſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Magpye</hi> began here to Prattle, and
clear his <hi>Cabal</hi> of the Accuſation, but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
being a clear demonſtration, Judge
<hi>Cuckow</hi> Commanded Silence; telling, That
he might be aſham'd to ſpeak in the behalf
of ſo pernicious a Patron; and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
<hi>Cock</hi> had turn'd his back upon the
Bantling, and fled to a Deſart, and that the
Kingdom would look after the young <hi>Mag.</hi>
