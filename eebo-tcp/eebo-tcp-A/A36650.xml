         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>What share have we in Nature or in Art?</l>
                  <l>Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,</l>

                  <l>Where made he love in Prince <hi>Nicander</hi>'s vein,</l>
                  <l>Or swept the dust in <hi>Psyche</hi>'s humble strain?</l>
                  <l>Where sold he Bargains, Whip-stitch, kiss my Arse,</l>
                  <l>Promis'd a Play and dwindled to a Farce?</l>
                  <l>When did his Muse from <hi>Fletcher</hi> scenes purloin,</l>
                  <l>As thou whole <hi>Eth'ridg</hi> dost tranfuse to thine?</l>
                  <l>But so transfus'd as Oylon Waters flow,</l>

                  <l>Nor let thy mountain belly make pretence</l>

                  <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>'TIS not my intention to make an Apology for my
<hi>Poem:</hi> Some will think it needs no Excuse;
and others will receive none. The Design, I am sure,
is honest: but he who draws his Pen for one Party,
must expect to make Enemies of the other. For, <hi>Wit</hi>
and <hi>Fool,</hi> are Consequents of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory:</hi> And
every man is a Knave or an Ass to the contrary side.
There's a Treasury of Merits in the <hi>Phanatick Church,</hi>
as well as in the <hi>Papist;</hi> and a Pennyworth to be had
of Saintship, Honesty and Poetry, for the Leud,
the Factious, and the Blockheads: But the longest
Chapter in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> has not Curses enough for
an Anti-<hi>Bromingham.</hi> My Comfort is, their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Prejudice to my Cause, will render their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of less Authority against me. Yet if a <hi>Poem</hi>
have a <hi>Genius,</hi> it will force its own reception in the
World. For there's a sweetness in good Verse, which
Tickles even while it Hurts: And no man can be
heartily angry with him, who pleases him against his
will. The Commendation of Adversaries, is the
greatest Triumph of a Writer; because it never comes
unless Extorted. But I can be satisfied on more easie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54612:13"/>
terms: If I happen to please the more Moderate
sort I shall be sure of an honest Party; and, in all
probability, of the best Iudges: for, the least Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
are commonly the least Corrupt. And, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I have laid in for those, by rebating the <hi>Satyr</hi>
(where Iustice woud allow it) from carrying too sharp
an Edge. They, who can Criticize so weakly, as to
imagine I have done my Worst, may be convinc'd, at
their own Cost, that I can write Severely, with more
ease, than I can Gently. I have but laugh'd at some
mens Follies, when I coud have declaim'd against
their Vices: and, other mens Vertues I have commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as freely as I have tax'd their Crimes. And
now, if you are a Malicious <hi>Reader,</hi> I expect you
should return upon me, that I affect to be thought
more Impartial than I am. But, if men are not to
be judg'd by their Professions, God forgive you <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
men,</hi> for Professing so plausibly for the
Government. You cannot be so Vnconscionable, as to
charge me for not Subscribing of my Name; for that
woud reflect too grosly vpon your own Party, who never
dare; though they have the advantage of a Iury to
secure them. If you like not my <hi>Poem,</hi> the fault may,
possibly, be in my Writing: (though 'tis hard for an
Author to judge against himself;) But more probably
'tis in your Morals, which cannot bear the truth of it.
The Violent, on both sides, will condemn the Character
of <hi>Absalom,</hi> as either too favourably, or too hardly
drawn. But they are not the Violent, whom I desire
to please. The fault, on the right hand, is to Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
Palliate and Indulge; and, to confess freely, I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54612:13"/>
have endeavoured to commit it. Besides the respect
which I owe his Birth, I have a greater for his Heroick
Virtues: and, <hi>David</hi> himself, could not be more tender of
the Young-man's Life, than I would be of his Reputation.
But, since the most excellent natures are always the most
easie; and, as being such, are the soonest perverted by
ill Counsels, especially when baited with Fame and
Glory; 'tis no more a wonder that he withstood not the
temptations of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> than it was for <hi>Adam,</hi> not
to have resisted the two Devils, the Serpent and the
Woman. The conclusion of the Story, I purposely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
to prosecute: because, I could not obtain from my
self, to shew <hi>Absalom</hi> Vnfortunate. The Frame of it,
was cut out, but for a Picture to the Waste; and, if the
Draught be so far true, 'tis as much as I design'd.</p>
                  <p>Were I the Inventor, who am onely the Historian,
I should certainly conclude the Piece, with the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement
of <hi>Absalom</hi> to <hi>David.</hi> And, who knows but
this may come to pass? Things were not brought to an
Extremity where I left the Story; There seems, yet,
to be room left for a Composure; hereafter, there may
onely be for Pity. I have not so much as an uncharitable
wish against <hi>Achitophel;</hi> but, am content to be Accus'd
of a good natur'd Errour; and to hope with <hi>Origen,</hi> that
the Devil himself may, at last, be sav'd. For which
reason, in this <hi>Poem,</hi> he is neither brought to set his
House in order, nor to dispose of his Person afterwards,
as he in Wisedom shall think fit. God is infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull;
and his Vicegerent is onely not so, because he is
not Infinite.</p>
                  <p>The true end of <hi>Satyr,</hi> is the amendment of Vices
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54612:14"/>
by correction. And he who writes Honestly, is no more
an Enemy to the Offender, than the Physician to the
Patient, when he prescribes harsh Remedies to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
Disease: for those, are onely in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Chyrurgeon's work of an <hi>Ense rescindendum,</hi>
which I wish not to my very Enemies. To conclude all;
If the Body Politique have any Analogy to the Natural
in my weak judgment, an Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> were as
necessary in a Hot, Distemper'd State, as an <hi>Opiate</hi>
would be in a Raging Fever.</p>

Hail then thou matchless Bard, thou great Unknown,</l>

                     <l>Yet by one Stabb of your keen Satyr dies:</l>
                     <l>Before your Sacred Lines their Shatter'd <hi>Dagon</hi> lies.</l>

                     <l>IN pious Times, e'er Priest-Craft did begin,</l>
                     <l>Before <hi>Polygamy</hi> was made a Sin;</l>

                     <l>E'er one to one was, cursedly, confin'd:</l>
                     <l>When Nature prompted, and no Law deni'd</l>
                     <l>Promiscuous use of Concubine and Bride;</l>
                     <l>Then, <hi>Israel</hi>'s Monarch, after Heavens own heart,</l>
                     <l>His vigorous warmth did variously, impart.</l>

To Wives and Slaves: and, wide as his Command,</l>
                     <l>Scatter'd his Maker's Image through the Land.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Michal,</hi> of Royal Blood, the Crown did wear;</l>
                     <l>A Soil ungratefull to the Tiller's care:</l>
                     <l>Not so the rest; for several Mothers bore</l>
                     <l>To God-like <hi>David,</hi> several Sons before.</l>
                     <l>But, since like Slaves his Bed they did ascend,</l>

                     <l>Of all the Numerous Progeny was none</l>

                     <l>His Father got him with a greater Gust;</l>
                     <l>Or that his Conscious Destiny made way,</l>
                     <l>By manly Beauty to Imperial Sway.</l>
                     <l>Early in Foreign Fields he won Renown,</l>
                     <l>With Kings and States alli'd to <hi>Israel</hi>'s Crown:</l>
                     <l>In Peace the thoughts of War he cou'd remove,</l>
                     <l>And seem'd as he were onely born for Love.</l>
                     <l>What e'er he did, was done with so much ease,</l>
                     <l>In him alone, 'twas Natural to please:</l>
                     <l>His motions all accompani'd with grace;</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Paradise</hi> was open'd in his face.</l>

With secret Joy, indulgent <hi>David</hi> view'd</l>
                     <l>His Youthfull Image in his Son renew'd:</l>
                     <l>To all his wishes nothing he deni'd;</l>
                     <l>And made the Charming <hi>Annabel</hi> his Bride.</l>
                     <l>What faults he had (for who from faults is free?)</l>
                     <l>His Father cou'd not, or he wou'd not see.</l>

And when no rule, no president was found,</l>

                     <l>They led their wild desires to Woods and Caves;</l>
                     <l>And thought that all but Savages were Slaves.</l>

                     <l>Made foolish <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> the Crown forego;</l>
                     <l>Who banisht <hi>David</hi> did from <hi>Hebron</hi> bring,</l>

                     <l>Their Humour more than Loyalty exprest,</l>

                     <l>Or melt him to that Golden Calf, a State.</l>
                     <l>But these were random Bolts: No form'd Design,</l>
                     <l>Nor Interest made the Factious Croud to joyn:</l>
                     <l>The sober part of <hi>Israel,</hi> free from stain,</l>
                     <l>Well knew the value of a peacefull Reign;</l>
                     <l>And, looking backward with a wise afright,</l>
                     <l>Saw Seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight:</l>
                     <l>In contemplation of whose ugly Scars,</l>

The moderate sort of Men, thus qualifi'd,</l>

                     <l>The Good Old Cause reviv'd, a Plot requires.</l>
                     <l>Plots, true or false, are necessary things,</l>

                     <l>Were <hi>Iebusites:</hi> the Town so call'd from them;</l>

                     <l>The rightfull cause at length became the wrong:</l>
                     <l>And every loss the men of <hi>Iebus</hi> bore,</l>
                     <l>They still were thought God'<hi>s</hi> enemies the more.</l>

And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,</l>
                     <l>Their Gods disgrac'd, and burnt like Common Wood.</l>
                     <l>This set the Heathen Priesthood in a flame;</l>

                     <l>In his Defence his Servants are as bold,</l>
                     <l>As if he had been born of beaten Gold.</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Iewish Rabbins,</hi> though their Enemies,</l>

To the
WHIGS.</head>
                  <p>FOR to whom can I dedicate this <hi>Poem,</hi> with
so much justice, as to you? 'Tis the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your own Heroe: 'tis the Picture drawn
at length, which you admire and prize so much in
little. None of your Ornaments are wanting; neither
the Landscap of the Tower, nor the Rising Sun; nor
the <hi>Anno Domini</hi> of your New Sovereign's Coronation.
This must needs be a gratefull undertaking to your
whole Party: especially to those who have not been so
happy as to purchase the Original. I hear the <hi>Graver</hi>
has made a good Market of it: all his Kings are
bought up already; or the value of the remainder so
inhanc'd, that many a poor <hi>Polander,</hi> who would be
glad to worship the Image, is not able to go to the
cost of him: But must be content to see him here. I
must confess I am no great Artist; but Sign-post pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
will serve the turn to remember a Friend by;
especially when better is not to be had. Yet for your
comfort the lineaments are true: and though he sate
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54612:44"/>
not five times to me, as he did to <hi>B.</hi> yet I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
History; as the <hi>Italian</hi> Painters do, when they
wou'd draw a <hi>Nero</hi> or a <hi>Caligula;</hi> though they have
not seen the Man, they can help their Imagination
by a Statue of him, and find out the Colouring from
<hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Truth is, you might have
spar'd one side of your Medall: the Head wou'd be
seen to more advantage, if it were plac'd on a Spike
of the Tower; a little nearer to the Sun. Which
wou'd then break out to better purpose. You tell us
in your Preface to the <hi>No-protestant Plot,</hi> that you
shall be forc'd hereafter to leave off your Modesty: I
suppose you mean that little which is left you: for it
was worn to wrags when you put out this Medall.
Never was there practis'd such a piece of notorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
in the face of an Establish'd Government.
I believe, when he is dead, you will wear him in Thumb-Rings,
as the <hi>Turks</hi> did <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> as if there
were virtue in his Bones to preserve you against Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy.
Yet all this while you pretend not onely zeal
for the Publick good, but a due veneration for the
person of the King. But all men, who can see an inch
before them, may easily detect those gross fallacies.
That it is necessary for men in your circumstances to
pretend both, is granted you; for without them there
could be no ground to raise a Faction. But I would
ask you one civil question, what right has any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, or any Association of men, (to come nearer
to you,) who out of Parliament, cannot be consider'd
in a publick Capacity, to meet, as you daily do, in
Factious Clubs, to vilify the Government, in your
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54612:44"/>
Discourses, and to libel it in all your Writings? who
made you Iudges in <hi>Israel?</hi> or how is it consistent with
your Zeal of the publick Welfare, to promote Sedition?
Does your definition of loyal, which is to serve the
King according to the Laws, allow you the licence
of traducing the Executive Power, with which you own
he is invested? You complain that his Majesty has lost
the love and confidence of his People; and by your very
urging it, you endeavour what in you lies, to make
him lose them. All good Subjects abhor the thought
of Arbitrary Power, whether it be in one or many:
if you were the Patriots you would seem, you would
not at this rate incense the Multitudè to assume it;
for no sober man can fear it, either from the King's
Disposition, or his Practice; or even, where you would
odiously lay it, from his Ministers. Give us leave
to enjoy the Government and the benefit of Laws
under which we were born, and which we desire to
transmit to our Posterity. You are not the Trustees
of the publick Liberty: and if you have not right
to petition in a Crdoud, much less have you to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the management of Affairs; or to arraign what
you do not like: which in effect is every thing that is
done by the King and Council. Can you imagine that
any reasonable man will believe you respect the person
of his Majesty, when 'tis apparent that you Seditious
Pamphlets are stuff'd with particular Reflexions on
him? If you have the confidence to deny this, 'tis easy
to be evinc'd from a thousand Passages, which I onely
forbear to quote, because I desire they should die and
be forgotten. I have perus'd many of your Papers;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54612:45"/>
and to shew you that I have, the third part of
your <hi>No-protestant Plot</hi> is much of it stoln from
your dead Authour's Pamphlet call'd, the <hi>Growth of
Popery;</hi> as manifestly as <hi>Milton's</hi> defence of the
<hi>English</hi> People, is from <hi>Buchanan, de jure regni apud
Scotos:</hi> or your first Covenant, and new Association,
from the holy League of the <hi>French Guisards.</hi> Any one
who reads <hi>Davila,</hi> may trace your Practices all along.
There were the same pretences for Reformation, and
Loyalty, the same Aspersions of the King, and the
same grounds of a Rebellion. I know not whether you
will take the Historian's word, who says it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that <hi>Poltrot</hi> a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> murther'd <hi>Francis</hi>
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> by the instigations of <hi>Theodore Beza:</hi>
or that it was a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Minister, otherwise call'd
a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> (for our Church abhors so devilish a
Tenet) who first writ a Treatise of the lawfullness of
deposing and murthering Kings, of a different Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in Religion: But I am able to prove from the
Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and Principles of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> that
they set the People above the Magistrate; which if I
mistake not, is your own Fundamental; and which
carries your Loyalty no farther than your likeing.
When a Vote of the House of Commons goes on your
side, you are as ready to observe it, as if it were
pass'd into a Law: But when you are pinch'd with
any former, and yet unrepealed <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi>
you declare that in same cases, you will not be oblig'd
by it. The Passage is in the same third part of the
<hi>No-protestant Plot;</hi> and is too plain to be denied.
The late Copy of your intended Association<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you neither
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54612:45"/>
wholly justify nor condemn; But, as the Papists, when
they are unoppos'd, fly out into all the Pageantries of
Worship; but in times of War, when they are hard
press'd by Arguments, lie close intrench'd behind the
<hi>Council of Trent:</hi> So, now, when your Affairs are
in a low condition, you dare not pretend that to be a
legal Combination, but whensoever you are afloat, I
doubt not but it will be maintain'd and justify'd to
purpose. For indeed there is nothing to defend it but
the Sword: 'tis the proper time to say any thing,
when men have all things in their power.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time you wou'd fain be nibbling at a
parallel betwixt this Association, and that in the time
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But there is this small difference
betwixt them, that the ends of one are directly opposite
to the other: one with the Queen'<hi>s</hi> approbation, and
conjunction, as head of it; the other without either
the consent, or knowledge of the King, against whose
Authority it is manifestly design'd. Therefore you doe
well to have recourse to your last Evasion, that it was
contriv'd by your Enemies, and shuffled into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that were seiz'd: which yet you see the Nation
is not so easy to believe as your own Iury; But the
matter is not difficult, to find twelve men in <hi>New-gate,</hi>
who wou'd acquit a Malefactour.</p>
                  <p>I have one onely favour to desire of you at parting,
that when you think of answering this <hi>Poem,</hi> you
wou'd employ the same Pens against it, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
with so much success against <hi>Absalom</hi> and
<hi>Achitophel:</hi> for then you may assure your selves of a
clear Victory, without the least reply. Raile at me
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54612:46"/>
abundantly; and, not to break a Custome, doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wit: By this method you will gain a considerable
point, which is wholly to wave the answer of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
Never own the botome of your Principles,
for fear they shou'd be Treason. Fall severely on
the miscarriages of Government; for if scandal be not
allow'd, you are no freeborn subjects. If God has not
bless'd you with the Talent of Rhiming, make use of
my poor Stock and wellcome: let your Verses run upon
my feet: and for the utmost refuge of notorious Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
reduc'd to the last extremity of sense, turn my
own lines upon me, and in utter despair of your own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,
make me Satyrize my self. Some of you have
been driven to this Bay already; But above all the
rest commend me to the Non-conformist Parson, who
writ the <hi>Whip and Key.</hi> I am affraid it is not read
so much as the Piece deserves, because the Bookseller is
every week crying help at the end of his <hi>Gazette,</hi> to
get it off. You see I am charitable enough to doe him
a kindness, that it may be publish'd as well as printed;
and that so much skill in Hebrew Derivations, may
not lie for Wast-paper in the Shop. Yet I half suspect
he went no farther for his learning, than the Index of
Hebrew Names and Etymologies, which are printed
at the end of some <hi>English</hi> Bibles. If <hi>Achitophel</hi>
signify the Brother of a Fool, the Authour of that
Poem will pass with his Readers for the next of kin.
And perhaps 'tis the Relation that makes the kindness.
Whatever the Verses are; buy 'em up I beseech you
out of pity; for I hear the Conventicle is shut up, and
the Brother of <hi>Achitophel</hi> out of service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:54612:46"/>
Now Footmen, you know, have the generosity to
make a Purse, for a Member of their Society, who has
had his Livery pull'd over his Ears: and even Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Socks are bought up among you, out of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the name. A Dissenter in Poetry from Sense
and <hi>English,</hi> will make as good a Protestant Rhymer, as
a Dissenter from the Church of <hi>England</hi> a Protestant
Parson. Besides, if you encourage a young Beginner,
who knows but he may elevate his style a little, above
the vulgar Epithets of prophane, and sawcy Iack, and
Atheistick Scribler, with which he treats me, when
the fit of Enthusiasm is strong upon him: by which well-manner'd
and charitable Expressions, I was certain of
his Sect, before I knew his name. What wou'd you
have more of a man? he has damn'd me in your Cause
from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations:</hi> And has half the
Texts of both the <hi>Testaments</hi> against me, if you will
be so civil to your selves as to take him for your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;
and not to take them for <hi>Irish</hi> Witnesses.
After all, perhaps you will tell me, that you retain'd
him onely for the opening of your Cause, and that your
main Lawyer is yet behind. Now if it so happen he
meet with no more reply than his Predecessours, you
may either conclude, that I trust to the goodness of my
Cause, or fear my Adversary, or disdain him, or what
you please, for the short on't is, 'tis indifferent to your
humble servant, whatever your Party says or thinks
of him.</p>

No doubtfull Letters thy lost faith accuse,</l>

                     <l>Such proofs, one word of thine might overcome;</l>
                     <l>Why is my cause so good, and thou so dumb?</l>

                     <l>These Eyes beheld thee, when thou thoughst me gone</l>
                     <l>In books and signs (nor yet in those alone)</l>
                     <l>Conveying the glad message of thy Love</l>

                     <l>Not such as Wives to their cold Husbands give,</l>

These soft endearments should not farther go,</l>

                     <l>Like a Cloud guilded by the rising Sun,</l>
                     <l>Or Virgin newly by her Love undone.</l>

                     <l>Her lovely Eyes, with a disdainfull frown.</l>
                     <l>Disdain became her, looking on the Earth,</l>
                     <l>Sad were her looks, but Charming above mirth.</l>

                     <l>Scarce did my rage her tender Cheeks forbear:</l>
                     <l>When I beheld her Face my anger cool'd,</l>
                     <l>I felt my self to a mere Lover fool'd.</l>
                     <l>I, who but now so fierce, grow tame and sue,</l>

                     <l>And from his hand the brandisht Thunder charm.</l>
                     <l>'Twas worse than death, to think my Rival knew</l>

She gave much better kisses than I taught,</l>

                     <l>Nor should I for a kiss be so in pain:</l>

                     <l>By some strange Witchcraft, or some Magick aid;</l>
                     <l>Then would I wish her swelling breasts she'd feel,</l>
                     <l>While from her lovely hand I'de slyely steal,</l>
                     <l>Off would I drop, thô sticking fast before,</l>
                     <l>And kiss the Snowey Bosome I adore:</l>
                     <l>Then would I wish I might her Signet be,</l>
                     <l>And that the Wax from sticking might be free;</l>
                     <l>From her fair mouth I'de humid kisses steal,</l>
                     <l>And every Letter bite my Rival's seal:</l>
                     <l>But most I'de wish she would me with her bear,</l>
                     <l>When to the Bath she'd secretly repair;</l>
                     <l>Yet Then! O Then! I should my self betray</l>
                     <l>While I her Naked Armes her Breasts survey,</l>
                     <l>While my devouring Eye would wander lower,</l>
                     <l>I should rise Man and be a Ring no more.</l>
                     <l>In Vain I wish, go, little Present, go,</l>
                     <l>By thee my Love, my Faith by thee she'll know.</l>

                  <l>'TIs not for nothing when just Heav'n does frown,</l>
                  <l>The wretched <hi>Orpheus</hi> brings these judgments down;</l>
                  <l>Whose wife avoiding to become thy prey,</l>
                  <l>And all his joys at once were snatch'd away;</l>
                  <l>The poor Nymph doom'd that dangerous way to pass,</l>
                  <l>Spy'd not the Snake lye lurking in the grass:</l>
                  <l>A mournfull noise the spacious Vally fills,</l>
                  <l>With echoing cryes from all the Neighbouring hills;</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Dryades</hi> roar'd out in deep despair,</l>
                  <l>And with united voice bewail'd the Fair.</l>
                  <l>For such a loss he sought no vain relief,</l>
                  <l>But with his Lute indulg'd his tender grief;</l>

All o'er the lonely sands did wildly stray,</l>
                  <l>And with sad Songs begin and end the day.</l>
                  <l>At last to Hell a frightfull journey made,</l>
                  <l>Pass'd the wide gaping Gulph and dismall shade;</l>
                  <l>Visits the Ghosts, and to that King repairs,</l>
                  <l>Whose heart's inflexible to humane prayers.</l>
                  <l>Hell seems astonish'd with so sweet a Song,</l>
                  <l>Light Souls, and airie Spirits slide along</l>
                  <l>In troops, like millions of the feather'd kind,</l>
                  <l>Driv'n home by night or some tempestuous wind;</l>
                  <l>Matrons and Men, raw Youths and unripe Maids,</l>
                  <l>And mighty Heroes more majestick Shades;</l>
                  <l>Sons burnt before their mournfull Parents face,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Styx</hi> does all these in narrow bounds embrace</l>
                  <l>Nine times with loathsome mud, and noysome weeds,</l>
                  <l>And all the filth which standing water breeds:</l>
                  <l>Amazement reacht e'en the deep Caves of death,</l>
                  <l>The Sisters with blue snaky curles took breath;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ixion</hi>'s Wheel a while unmov'd remain'd,</l>
                  <l>And the great Dog his three-mouth'd voice restrain'd.</l>
                  <l>Now safe return'd, and all these dangers past,</l>
                  <l>His Spouse restor'd to breathe fresh air at last,</l>

Following, for so <hi>Proserpina</hi> was pleas'd,</l>
                  <l>A sudden rage th' unwary Lover seiz'd;</l>
                  <l>He when the first bright glimps of daylight shin'd,</l>
                  <l>Unmindfull, and impatient, look't behind,</l>
                  <l>A fault of Love, could Hell compassion find.</l>
                  <l>A dreadfull noise thrice shook the <hi>Stygian</hi> coast,</l>
                  <l>His hopes now fled, and all his labour lost.</l>
                  <l>Why hast thou thus undone thy self and me?</l>
                  <l>What madness this? Again I'm snatch't from thee,</l>
                  <l>She faintly cry'd; Night, and the powers of Hell</l>
                  <l>Surround my eyes, O <hi>Orpheus,</hi> O farewell:</l>
                  <l>My hands stretch forth to reach thee as before,</l>
                  <l>But all in vain, alas, I'm thine no more;</l>
                  <l>No more allow'd to behold him or day;</l>
                  <l>Then from his sight like smoak she slipp'd away.</l>
                  <l>Much he would fain have spoke, but Fate, alas,</l>
                  <l>Would ne'er again consent to let him pass.</l>
                  <l>Thus twice undone, what course now could he take</l>
                  <l>To redeem her already pass'd the Lake?</l>
                  <l>How bear his loss? what tears procure him ease?</l>
                  <l>Or with what vows the angry Powers appease?</l>

'Tis said, he seven long months bewail'd his loss</l>
                  <l>On bleak and barren Rocks, on whose cold moss,</l>
                  <l>While languishing he Sung his Fatal flame,</l>
                  <l>He mov'd e'en Trees, and made fierce Tigers tame.</l>
                  <l>So the sad <hi>Nightingale,</hi> when Childless made</l>
                  <l>By some rough Swain who steals her young away,</l>
                  <l>Bewails her loss under a Poplar shade,</l>
                  <l>Weeps all the night, in murmurs wasts the day;</l>
                  <l>Her sorrow does a mournfull pleasure yield,</l>
                  <l>And melancholly musick fills the Field.</l>
                  <l>Marriage, nor Love could ever move his mind,</l>
                  <l>But all alone, beat by the Northern wind,</l>

                  <l>Kill'd the poor Youth, and strew'd about his limbs;</l>
                  <l>His Head torn off from the fair body swims,</l>
                  <l>Down that swift current, where the <hi>Hebre</hi> flows,</l>
                  <l>And still his Tongue in dolefull accents goes;</l>

                     <p>Sireno and Diana having lov'd each other
with a most violent passion, Sireno is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd,
upon the Account of his Master's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to go for some time into a Foreign
Country. The Melancholly parting of the
two Lovers is the Subject of the following
Eclogue.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <l>CLose by a stream, whose flowry bank might give</l>
                  <l>Delight to Eyes that had no Cause to grieve,</l>
                  <l>The sad <hi>Sireno</hi> sate, and fed his Sheep,</l>
                  <l>Which now, alas! he had no Joy to keep;</l>

Since his hard Fate compell'd him to depart</l>
                  <l>From her dear Sight, who long had Charm'd his heart.</l>
                  <l>Fix'd were his thoughts upon the Fatal day</l>
                  <l>That gave him first what this must take away;</l>
                  <l>Through all the Story of his Love he ran,</l>
                  <l>And nought forgot that might increase his pain.</l>
                  <l>Then with a sigh raising his heavy Eyes,</l>
                  <l>Th' approach of his afflicted Nymph he spies;</l>
                  <l>Sad as she was, she lost no usual Grace,</l>
                  <l>But as she pass'd seem'd to adorn the place:</l>
                  <l>Thither she came to take her last Farewell,</l>
                  <l>Her silent Look did her sad Business tell.</l>
                  <l>Under a Neighbouring Tree they sate 'em down,</l>
                  <l>Whose shade had oft preserv'd 'em from the Sun;</l>
                  <l>Each took the other by the willing hand,</l>
                  <l>Striving to speak, but could no word Command:</l>
                  <l>With mutual Grief both were so overcome,</l>
                  <l>The much they had to say had made 'em dumb.</l>
                  <l>There many a time they two had met before,</l>
                  <l>But met, alas! upon a happier score:</l>
                  <l>Cruel reverse of Fate, which all the Joys</l>
                  <l>Their mutual presence us'd to bring destroys.</l>

                     <hi>Sireno</hi> saw his Fatal hour draw near,</l>
                  <l>And wanted strength the parting pang to bear;</l>
                  <l>All drown'd in tears he gaz'd upon the Maid,</l>

                     <l>'Tis hard unjust suspicions to abide,</l>

STORY of LVCRETIA
OUT OF

                  <byline>Englished By Mr. <hi>Creech.</hi>
                  </byline>
                  <l>NOw <hi>Tarquin</hi> the last King did Govern <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Valiant abroad 'tis true, thô fierce at home;</l>
                  <l>Some Towns he won, some he did fairly beat,</l>
                  <l>And took the <hi>Gabbi</hi> by a mean deceit;</l>
                  <l>For of his Three brave Youths his youngest Son,</l>
                  <l>His Nature fierce, his Manners like his own,</l>
                  <l>His Father's Child Outright pretends a flight,</l>
                  <l>And came amidst the Enemies by Night;</l>
                  <l>They drew their Swords, Come kill me now he said,</l>
                  <l>My Father will rejoyce to see me dead:</l>
                  <l>See how his Rods my tender Entrails tore,</l>
                  <l>(To prove this true he had been whipt before)</l>

The men grow mild, they sheath their threatning swords</l>
                  <l>And view his wounds, and those confirm his words:</l>
                  <l>Then each man weeps, and each his wrongs resents</l>
                  <l>And begs to side with them, and he consents.</l>
                  <l>Thus gull'd, the crafty Youth, and once in Trust,</l>
                  <l>The first occasion sought to be unjust,</l>
                  <l>And the unthinking <hi>Gabii</hi>'s Town betray,</l>
                  <l>Consults his Father for the surest way.</l>
                  <l>There was a Garden crown'd with fragrant Flowers,</l>
                  <l>A little Spring ran through the pleasant Bowers,</l>
                  <l>The soft retreat of <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s thinking hours.</l>
                  <l>There when the message came he chanc't to stand,</l>
                  <l>And lopt the tallest Lilies with his wand:</l>
                  <l>With that the Messenger return'd, and said,</l>
                  <l>I saw your Father crop the lofty head</l>
                  <l>Of each tall Flower, but not one word to you;</l>
                  <l>Well, says the Son, I know what I must doe,</l>
                  <l>And streight the Nobles kill'd; When those were gone</l>
                  <l>He soon betray'd the poor defenceless Town.</l>
                  <l>When lo (a wond'rous sight) a Serpent came,</l>
                  <l>And snatcht the Entrails from the dying Flame;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:54612:97"/>
                     <hi>Phoebus</hi> advis'd, and thus the Answer ran</l>
                  <l>He that shall kiss (for so the Fates ordain)</l>
                  <l>His Mother first shall be the greatest man.</l>
                  <l>Then streight with eager haste th' unthinking Crowd</l>
                  <l>Their Mothers kiss't, nor understood the God.</l>
                  <l>But wiser <hi>Brutus,</hi> who did act the Fool,</l>
                  <l>Lest <hi>Tarquin</hi> should suspect his rising Soul,</l>
                  <l>Fell down, as if't had been a Casual fall,</l>
                  <l>And kiss't his Mother Earth before them all.</l>
                  <l>Now <hi>Ardea</hi> was besieg'd, the Town was strong,</l>
                  <l>The men resolv'd, and so the Leaguer long:</l>
                  <l>And whilst the Enemy did the War delay,</l>
                  <l>Dissolv'd in Ease the careless Souldiers lay,</l>
                  <l>And spent the vacant time in sport and play.</l>
                  <l>Young <hi>Tarquin</hi> doth adorn his Noble Feasts,</l>
                  <l>The Captains treats, and thus bespeaks his Guests;</l>
                  <l>Whilst we lye lingring in a tedious War,</l>
                  <l>And far from Conquest tired out with Care,</l>
                  <l>How do our Women lead their Lives at <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And are we thought on by our Wives at home?</l>
                  <l>Each speaks for his, each says I'll swear for mine,</l>
                  <l>And thus a while they talkt, grown flusht with Wine;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:54612:97"/>
At last Young <hi>Collatine</hi> starts up and cryes,</l>
                  <l>What need of words, come let's believe our Eyes;</l>
                  <l>Away to <hi>Rome,</hi> for that's the safest Course,</l>
                  <l>They all agree, so each man mounts his Horse.</l>
                  <l>First to the Court, and there they found no Guard,</l>
                  <l>No Watchmen there, and all the Gates unbar'd;</l>
                  <l>Young <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Wife, her hair disorder'd lay</l>
                  <l>And loose, was sitting there at Wine and play.</l>
                  <l>Thence to <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s, She a lovely Soul</l>
                  <l>Her Basket lay before her, and her Wooll,</l>
                  <l>Sate midst her Maids, and as they wrought she said,</l>
                  <l>Make haste, 'tis for my Lord as soon as made;</l>
                  <l>Yet what d'ye hear? (for you perchance may hear)</l>
                  <l>How long is't e'er they hope to end the War?</l>
                  <l>Yet let them but return; But ah, my Lord</l>
                  <l>Is rash, and meets all dangers with his Sword:</l>
                  <l>Ah when I fansie that I see him fight,</l>
                  <l>I swoon and almost perish with the fright.</l>
                  <l>Then wept, and leaving her unfinisht thread</l>
                  <l>Upon her bosome lean'd her lovely head.</l>
                  <l>All this became, gracefull her grief appears,</l>
                  <l>And she, chast Soul, lookt beauteous in her tears.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:54612:98"/>
Her Face lookt well, by Natures art design'd,</l>
                  <l>All charming fair, and fit for such a mind.</l>
                  <l>I come, says <hi>Collatine,</hi> discard thy Fear,</l>
                  <l>At that she streight reviv'd, and oh my Dear,</l>
                  <l>She claspt his neck, and hung a welcome burthen there.</l>
                  <l>Mean while Young <hi>Tarquin</hi> gathers lustfull Fire,</l>
                  <l>He burns and rages with a wild Desire;</l>
                  <l>Her Shape, her Lilie-white, and Yellow hair,</l>
                  <l>Her natural Beauty, and her gracefull Air,</l>
                  <l>Her words, her voice, and every thing does please,</l>
                  <l>And all agree to heighten the disease;</l>
                  <l>That she was Chast doth raise his wishes higher,</l>
                  <l>The less his hopes, the greater his Desire.</l>
                  <l>But now 'twas Morning, and the warlike Train</l>
                  <l>Return from <hi>Rome,</hi> and take the Field again:</l>
                  <l>His working Powers her absent Form restore,</l>
                  <l>The more he minds her, still he loves the more;</l>
                  <l>'Twas thus she sate, thus spun, and thus was drest,</l>
                  <l>And thus her Locks hung dangling o'er her Breast;</l>
                  <l>Such was her Mein, and such each Air and Grace,</l>
                  <l>And such the charming figure of her Face.</l>

As when a furious storm is now blown o'er</l>
                  <l>The Sea's still troubl'd, and the Waters roar</l>
                  <l>And curle upon the Winds that blew before.</l>
                  <l>So he thô gone the pleasing form retains</l>
                  <l>The Fire her present Beauty rais'd remains;</l>
                  <l>He burns, and hurry'd by resistless Charms,</l>
                  <l>Resolves to force, or fright her to his Arms.</l>
                  <l>I'll venture, let whatever fates attend,</l>
                  <l>The daring bold have fortune for their friend;</l>
                  <l>By daring I the <hi>Gabii</hi> did o'ercome;</l>
                  <l>This said, he takes his Horse, and speeds for <hi>Rome:</hi>

                  <l>The Sun was setting when he reach't the place,</l>
                  <l>With more than Evening Blushes in his Face;</l>
                  <l>A Guest in shew, an Enemy in design</l>
                  <l>He reach't the stately Court of <hi>Collatine,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And's welcom'd there, for he was nearly Kin.</l>
                  <l>How much are we deceiv'd? She makes a Feast,</l>
                  <l>And treats her Enemy as a Welcome Guest;</l>
                  <l>Now Supper's done, and sleep invites to Bed,</l>
                  <l>And all was husht, as Natures self lay dead.</l>
                  <l>The Lamps put out, and all for rest design'd,</l>
                  <l>No Fire in all the House, but in his mind:</l>

                  <l>Thy ruine pay for this thy forc't delight,</l>
                  <l>How great a price! a Kingdom for a Night!</l>
                  <l>The guilty Night was gone, the day appears,</l>
                  <l>She blusht, and rose, and double Mourning wears,</l>
                  <l>As for her onely Son, she sits in Tears.</l>
                  <l>And for her Father, and her Husband sends,</l>
                  <l>Each quickly hears the message, and attends.</l>
                  <l>But when they came, and saw her drown'd in Tears,</l>
                  <l>Amaz'd they askt the Cause, what violent Fears,</l>
                  <l>What real ill did wound her tender mind;</l>
                  <l>What Friend was dead, for whom this Grief design'd?</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:54612:100"/>
But she sate silent still, still sadly cry'd,</l>
                  <l>And hid her blushing Face, and wept, and sigh'd.</l>
                  <l>Both strive to Comfort, both lament her Fate,</l>
                  <l>And fear some deadly Ill, they know not what.</l>
                  <l>Thrice she would speak, thrice stopt, again she tryes</l>
                  <l>To speak her wrong, yet durst not raise her Eyes:</l>
                  <l>This too on <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s score, she cry'd, I place;</l>
                  <l>I'll speak, I'll speak, ah me! my own disgrace,</l>
                  <l>And what they could her modest words exprest,</l>
                  <l>The last remain'd, her Blushes spoke the rest.</l>
                  <l>Both weep, and both the forc't Offence forgive,</l>
                  <l>In vain you pardon me, I can't receive</l>
                  <l>The pity you bestow, nor can I live.</l>
                  <l>This said, her fatal Dagger pierc't her side,</l>
                  <l>And at her Father's feet she fell and dy'd.</l>
                  <l>Her Soul slew through the wound, and mounts above</l>
                  <l>As white, and Innocent as a Virgin Dove,</l>
                  <l>Not spotted with one thought of Lawless Love.</l>
                  <l>Yet as she fell, her dying thoughts contriv'd</l>
                  <l>The fall as modestly as she had liv'd.</l>
                  <l>The Father o'er the Corpse, and Husband fall,</l>
                  <l>And mourn, and both the common loss bewail.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54612:100"/>
While thus they mour'd, the generous <hi>Brutus</hi> came</l>
                  <l>And shew'd his Soul ill suited with his Name.</l>
                  <l>He graspt the Dagger reeking in her Gore,</l>
                  <l>And as he held it thus devoutly swore;</l>
                  <l>By thee, by this thy Chast and Innocent Bloud,</l>
                  <l>And by thy Ghost, which I'll esteem a God;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and all his Race shall be expell'd,</l>
                  <l>My Virtue long enough hath lain conceal'd.</l>
                  <l>At that she rais'd her Eyes, she seem'd to bow</l>
                  <l>Her head, and with her Nod approv'd the Vow.</l>
                  <l>The Pomp appears, and as it passes by</l>
                  <l>The gaping Wound expos'd to publick view,</l>
                  <l>Fill'd all the Crowd with rage, and Justly drew</l>
                  <l>Curses from every Heart, and Tears from every Eye.</l>
                  <l>Young <hi>Brutus</hi> heads the Crowd, proclaims the wrong,</l>
                  <l>And tells them they endure the King too long:</l>
                  <l>The King's expell'd, and Consuls they create,</l>
                  <l>And thus the Kingdom chang'd into a State.</l>

Last night me thought (Heaven make the next as kind)</l>
                  <l>Free as first innocence, and unconfin'd</l>
                  <l>As our first Parents in their <hi>Eden</hi> were,</l>
                  <l>E'er yet condemn'd to eat their bread with Care;</l>
                  <l>We two together wander'd through a grove,</l>
                  <l>'Twas green beneath us, and all shade above,</l>
                  <l>Mild as our friendship, springing as our Love;</l>
                  <l>Hundreds of chearfull Birds fill'd every Tree,</l>
                  <l>And sung their joyfull Songs of Liberty;</l>

                  <l>Thus humbly blest, who'd labour to be great?</l>
                  <l>Who for preferments at a Court would wait,</l>

This Image when it came too fiercely shook</l>

                  <l>The Friend I trust in, and the She I love,</l>

ELEGY
BY
The Wife of St. ALEXIAS (a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Rome) complaining on his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
he having left her on his Wedding
Night unenjoy'd, out of a Pious Zeal to
go Visit the Christian Churches.</head>

                     <l>I Prais'd and Lov'd by the best Youth of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>My fatal Charms sent many to their Tomb,</l>
                     <l>Now wretched Maid, and miserable Wife,</l>
                     <l>In tears, and in complaints, must waste my Life;</l>
                     <l>Abandon'd by my Husband e'er enjoy'd,</l>
                     <l>With thoughts of pleasures yet untasted cloy'd.</l>

He leaves me to my anxious cares a Prey;</l>
                     <l>Ah! my <hi>Alexias,</hi> whither do you stray,</l>
                     <l>Whilst in my Maiden Widdow'd bed I lye,</l>
                     <l>More wretched than the Dead, and wish to dye?</l>
                     <l>In you were all my hopes, dear Wanderer,</l>
                     <l>Your doubted safety now creates my Fear;</l>
                     <l>He broak his Vows, he broak our Marriage bond,</l>
                     <l>What dangers may a Perjur'd wretch surround,</l>
                     <l>At least his flight his tender Feet may wound.</l>
                     <l>Oh! that I knew which way his course he stears,</l>
                     <l>T'wou'd soften much my pains, and lessen much my fears:</l>
                     <l>A Letter shou'd inform him of my cares,</l>
                     <l>And he with pity sure wou'd reade my Pray'rs;</l>
                     <l>I'd write him lines might move a senseless Stone,</l>
                     <l>Nay his hard Heart to feel compassion.</l>
                     <l>But, when we write, too slow are the returns,</l>
                     <l>Too slow, for one that with my passion burns;</l>
                     <l>Letters I wou'd not trust, my self wou'd goe,</l>
                     <l>And from my mouth my sorrows he shou'd know.</l>
                     <l>By stealth I'll leave my Father's House, t'was you</l>
                     <l>Did first, alas! the sad example shew.</l>

My pressing Love wou'd wing my willing Feet,</l>
                     <l>To fly, till my <hi>Alexias</hi> I shou'd meet.</l>
                     <l>Through Desarts I durst go (a tender Maid)</l>
                     <l>In search of you I cou'd not be afraid.</l>
                     <l>No dangers shou'd my eager steps retard,</l>
                     <l>My Innocence, and Love wou'd be my Guard.</l>
                     <l>If <hi>Dragons</hi> against me their crests shou'd rear,</l>
                     <l>Or shou'd I meet a <hi>Lyon</hi> or a <hi>Bear,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>I never can be capable of Fear.</l>

                        <hi>David</hi> (too young for Toils) a tender Boy,</l>
                     <l>Cou'd the fierce <hi>Lyon,</hi> and rough <hi>Bear</hi> destroy;</l>
                     <l>From his small Hand a Pebble cou'd confound,</l>

                     <l>And she was by her Guardian Angel led.</l>
                     <l>Why may not my attempts successfull prove,</l>
                     <l>Assisted by Divinity, and Love?</l>
                     <l>With fearless courage I dare undertake</l>

                  <l>My dying words, when I would speak 'em hung;</l>
                  <l>As when imperfect sounds from Children fall,</l>

Had you admitted me, it had been well,</l>
                  <l>For I in swiftness, and in form excell,</l>
                  <l>But that my vanquish'd Equals best may tell;</l>

                  <l>Now thanks to you great Queen of Love I owe,</l>

                  <l>She saw the burning Pain which I endure,</l>
                  <l>And recommends to you the mighty Cure;</l>
                  <l>For cool and gentle are all other fires</l>

                  <l>Love, tender Maids can from their Beds excite,</l>
                  <l>Nor darkness them, nor danger can afright,</l>
                  <l>Love's mighty power can the young Wife compell</l>
                  <l>From her warm sleeping Husband's armes to steal.</l>
                  <l>He said: And I a fond, believing Maid</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Aurora</hi> scarce had chas'd away the Night,</l>
                  <l>And o'er the World diffus'd her rosie Light,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Philista</hi>'s mother came, (and as she still</l>
                  <l>The Love, and News o'th' Town delights to tell;)</l>
                  <l>She told me first that <hi>Delphis</hi> Lov'd, but who</l>
                  <l>She could not tell, but that he Lov'd she knew;</l>
                  <l>All signs of some new love she said she found,</l>
                  <l>His House adorn'd, and Doors with Garlands crown'd.</l>
                  <l>She tells me true; oh my ill boding fears!</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Delphis</hi> treachery too plain appears:</l>
                  <l>His Visits were more frequent, now at last,</l>
                  <l>Since he was here twelve tedious days are past.</l>

'Tis so: And can he then so cruel prove,</l>
                  <l>Am I so soon forgotten, and my Love?</l>
                  <l>Now I'm content to see what Charms can do,</l>
                  <l>But if he dares go on to use me so,</l>

                  <l>The Secret was by an <hi>Assyrian</hi> taught.</l>
                  <l>You, <hi>Cynthia,</hi> now may to the Sea decline,</l>
                  <l>And to the rising Sun your light resign;</l>
                  <l>My Charm's now done, and has no longer force</l>
                  <l>To fix your Chariot, or retar'd your course;</l>
                  <l>I, what I can't redress, must learn to bear,</l>

                  <l>Follies and Faults elsewhere by them are shown,</l>
                  <l>But by your Manners they Correct their Own.</l>
                  <l>Th' illiterate Writer, Emperique like, applies</l>

Here free your selves, from Envie, Care and Strife,</l>
                  <l>You view the various turns of humane Life:</l>
                  <l>Safe in our Scene, through dangerous Courts you go,</l>
                  <l>And Undebauch'd, the Vice of Cities know.</l>
                  <l>Your Theories are here to Practice brought,</l>
                  <l>As in Mechanick operations wrought;</l>
                  <l>And Man the Little world before you set,</l>
                  <l>As once the Sphere of Chrystal, shew'd the Great:</l>

                  <l>With joy we bring what our dead Authours writ,</l>
                  <l>And beg from you the value of their Wit.</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s, <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s, and great <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s claim</l>
                  <l>May be Renew'd from those, who gave them fame.</l>
                  <l>None of our living Poets dare appear,</l>
                  <l>For Muses so severe are worshipt here;</l>
                  <l>That conscious of their Faults they shun the Eye,</l>
                  <l>And as Prophane, from Sacred places fly,</l>

                  <l>Hating themselves, what their Applause must make:</l>

                  <l>Though they like Eagles Mount, your <hi>Iove</hi> is Higher.</l>

                  <byline>
                     <hi>By</hi> Mr. Dryden.</byline>
                  <l>THo' Actors cannot much of Learning boast,</l>
                  <l>Of all who want it, we admire it most.</l>
                  <l>We love the Praises of a Learned Pit,</l>
                  <l>As we remotely are ally'd to Wit.</l>
                  <l>We speak our Poets Wit, and Trade in Ore,</l>
                  <l>Like those who touch upon the Golden Shore:</l>
                  <l>Betwixt our Judges can distinction make,</l>
                  <l>Discern how much, and why, our Poems take.</l>
                  <l>Mark if the Fools, or Men of Sence, rejoyce,</l>
                  <l>Whether th' Applause be only Sound or Voice.</l>
                  <l>When our Fop Gallants, or our City Folly</l>
                  <l>Clap over-loud, it makes us melancholy:</l>
                  <l>We doubt that Scene which does their wonder raise,</l>
                  <l>And, for their ignorance contemn their Praise.</l>

                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:54612:143"/>
Judge then, if We who Act, and They who Write,</l>
                  <l>Shou'd not be proud of giving You delight.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>London</hi> likes grossly, but this nicer Pit</l>
                  <l>Examines, Fathoms all the depths of Wit:</l>
                  <l>The ready Finger lays on every Blot,</l>
                  <l>Knows what shou'd justly please, and what shou'd not.</l>
                  <l>Nature her self lies open to your view,</l>
                  <l>You judge by Her what draught of Her is true,</l>
                  <l>Where out lines false, and Colours seem too faint,</l>
                  <l>Where Bunglers dawb, and where True Poets Paint.</l>
                  <l>But by the Sacred Genius of this Place,</l>
                  <l>By every Muse, by each Domestick Grace,</l>
                  <l>Be kind to Wit, which but endeavours well,</l>
                  <l>And, where you judge, presumes not to excel.</l>
                  <l>Our Poets hither for Adoption come,</l>

                  <l>Not in the suffragating Tribes to stand,</l>
                  <l>But in your utmost, last, Provincial Band.</l>

                  <l>Told her own Faults, but I shou'd much abhor,</l>

                  <l>Our Play a merry Comedy had prov'd,</l>

                     <l>I'le seek for Chesnuts too in every Grove,</l>
                     <l>Such as my <hi>Amaryllis</hi> us'd to love.</l>
                     <l>The glossie Plums, and juicy Pears I'le bring,</l>
                     <l>Delightful All, and many a pretty thing:</l>
                     <l>The Lawrel and the neighbouring Myrtle Tree,</l>
                     <l>Confus'dly planted 'cause they both agree</l>
                     <l>And prove more sweet, shall send their boughs to thee.</l>

                     <l>Each hath his Game, and each pursues his own:</l>
                     <l>Look how the weary'd Ox brings home the Plow,</l>
                     <l>The Sun declines, and Shades are doubled now:</l>
                     <l>And yet my Passion nor my Cares remove,</l>
                     <l>Love burns me still, what flame so fierce as Love!</l>
                     <l>Ah <hi>Corydon!</hi> what fury's this of thine!</l>
                     <l>On yonder Elm, there hangs thy half prun'd Vine:</l>
                     <l>Come, rather mind thy useful work, prepare</l>
                     <l>Thy harvest Baskets, and make those thy care,</l>

a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Poet.</item>

                        <item>3. <hi>Varus</hi>—A great Favourite of <hi>Augustus,</hi> the same that
was kill'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> and lost the Roman Legions.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>Chromis</hi> and <hi>Mnasylus</hi>—Some Interpreters think
these were young Satyrs, others will have them Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds:
I rather take them for Satyrs, because of their
names, which are never used for Shepherds, or any
where (that I remember) but here.</item>
                        <item>5. <hi>They bound—Proteus, Pan,</hi> and <hi>Silenus</hi> would
never tell what was desired, till they were bound.</item>

Art and Industry of <hi>Prometheus</hi> (who had made an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

Life,) carried him up to Heaven, where he lighted a

in a Well, which made the Poets say that a Nymph had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54612:197"/>
stole him away: I use the word <hi>resounds</hi> (in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Tense) because <hi>Strabo</hi> (who lived at the same time
as <hi>Virgil)</hi> seems to intimate, that the <hi>Prusians</hi> continued
then their annual Rites to his Memory, repeating his
name with loud cries.</item>
                        <item>10. <hi>The Maids of</hi> Argos—Daughters of <hi>Praetis,</hi>
King of <hi>Argos,</hi> who presumed so much upon their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they preferr'd it to <hi>Iuno</hi>'s, who in revenge,
struck them with such a Madness, that they thought
themselves Cows. They were at last cured by <hi>Melampo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
with Hellebore, and for that reason, Black Hellebore is
called Melampodion.</item>
                        <item>11. <hi>Gallus</hi>—an excellent Poet and great Friend of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
he was afterwards Praetor of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of some Conspiracy, or rather called upon for some
Moneys, of which he could give no good account, he
killed himself. It is the same <hi>Gallus</hi> you read of in the
last Eclogue: And <hi>Suidas</hi> says, that <hi>Virgil</hi> means him
by <hi>Aristaeus,</hi> in the divine Conclusion of his Georgicks.</item>
