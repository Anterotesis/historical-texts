            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

more loath to
come to the red
Sea, then to part
from it. How soon
can God turne the horror of any
euill into pleasure? One shore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3791:8"/>
resounded with shrieks of feare;
the other with timbrels, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and songs of deliuerance. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
maine affliction is our red
Sea, which whiles it threats to
swallow, preserues vs: At last our
songs shall be lowder then our
cries. The Israelitish Dames, when
they saw their danger, thought
they might haue left their tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels
behinde them; how vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
a burden seemed those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of Musicke? yet now
they liue to renue that forgotten
minstralsie, and dancing, which
their bondage had so long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued:
and well might those
feet dance vpon the shore, which
had walked through the Sea. The
Land of Goshen was not so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to them, as these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3791:8"/>
That affoorded them a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
life: This gaue them at once
freedome, victory, riches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
vpon them the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that wealth, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
had but lent. It was a
pleasure to see the floating car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses
of their aduersaries; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day offers them new booties;
It is no maruell then if their hearts
were tied to these banks. If wee
finde but a little pleasure in our
life, we are ready to dote vpon it.
Euery small contentment glewes
our affections to that we like: And
if heere our imperfect delights
hold vs so fast, that we would not
be loosed; how forceable shall
those infinite ioyes bee aboue,
when our soules are once posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3791:9"/>
Yet if the place had pleas'd
them more, it is no maruell they
were willing to follow <hi>Moses;</hi> that
they durst followe him in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
whom they followed
through the Sea: It is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
to any people, when
they haue seene the hand of God
with their guide<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> O Sauior which
hast vndertaken to carry me from
the spirituall Egypt, to the Land
of promise; how faithfull, how
powerfull, haue I found thee?
How fearlesly should I trust thee?
how cheerefully should I follow
thee through contempt, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
death it selfe? Maister, if
it be thou, bidde vs come vnto
thee.</p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3791:9"/>
Immediately before, they had
complained of too much water:
now they goe three dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Thus God meant to punish
their infidelitie, with the defect
of that whose abundance made
them to distrust. Before, they saw
all water, no land; now all dry, and
dusty land, and no water. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamities
are the best tryals of
men: As in bodies, those that can
beare sudden changes of heats
and cold without complaint, are
the strongest. So much as an euil
touches vpon the mean, so much
help it yeelds towards patience;
Euery degree of sorrow is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to the next: but when
wee passe to extreames without
the meane, we want the benefit of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3791:10"/>
recollection; and must trust to
our present strength. To come
from all things to nothing, is not
a descent but a downfall; and it is
a rare strength and constancy,
not to be maimed at least. These
headlong euils, as they are the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
so they must be most proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for; as on the contrary a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
aduancement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the height of honour, is
most hard to menage. No man
can maruell how that tyrant blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his captiues, when he heares
that hee brought them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie,
out of a darke dungeon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
rooms that were made bright,
and glorious. We are not worthy
to knowe, fot what wee are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
no euill can amate vs, if we
can ouercom sudden extremities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3791:10"/>
The long differring of a good
(though tedious) yet makes it
the better, when it comes. Well
did the Israelites hope that the
waters which were so long in
finding, would be precious when
they were found: Yet behold they
are crossed, not only in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
but in their hopes; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three dayes trauell, the first
fountaines they finde are bitter
waters. If these wells had not run
pure gall, they could not haue so
much complained. Long thirst wil
make bitter waters sweete; yet
such were these springs, that the
Israelites did not so mnch like
their moisture, as abhor their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
I see the first handsell that
God giues them in their voyage
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3791:11"/>
to the Land of promise; Thirst,

hee had not loued them, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
fornace or sword had
preuented their thirst, or that Sea
wherof their enimies drunk dead;
and yet see how hee diets them.
Neuer any haue had so bitter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3791:11"/>
draughts vpon earth as those hee
loues best: The palate is an ill
iudge of the fauours of God. O
my Sauiour, thou didst drinke a
more bitter cup from the hands
of thy Father, then that which
thou refusedst of the Iewes, or
then that which I can drinke from
thee.</p>
                  <p>Before, they could not drinke
if they would; now they might
and would not. God can giue vs
blessings with such a tang, that
the fruition shall not much differ
from the want: So, many a one
hath riches, not grace to vse
them; many haue children, but
such, as they preferre barrennes.
They had said before, Oh that we
had any water; now, Oh that wee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3791:12"/>
had good water. It is good so to
desire blessings from God, that
wee may be the better for inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; so to craue water, that it
may not be sauced w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> bitternes.</p>
                  <p>Now these fond Israelites
in steed of praying, murmur; in
steed of praying to God, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
against <hi>Moses.</hi> What hath the
righteous done? He made not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Wildernesse dry, or the
waters bitter; Yea (if his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
were the matter) what one
foot went hee before them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God? The piller led them,
and not hee; yet <hi>Moses</hi> is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd
at. It is the hard condition
of authoritie, that when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
fare well, they applaud
themselues; when ill, they repine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3791:12"/>
against their gouernours. Who
can hope to be free, if <hi>Moses</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
not? Neuer any Prince so
merited of a people. He thrust
himselfe vpon the pikes of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>
tyranny. He brought them
from a bondage worse then death.
His rod diuided the Sea, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
life to them, death to their
pursuers. VVho vvould not haue
thought these men, so obliged to
<hi>Moses,</hi> that no death could haue
opened their mouthes, or raised
their hands against him? Yet now,
the first occasion of want makes
them rebell: No benefit can stop
the mouth of Impatience. If
our turne be not serued for the
present, former fauours are either
forgotten, or contemned. No
maruell if we deale so with men,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3791:13"/>
when God receiues this measure
from vs. One yeare of famine,
One summer of pestilence, One
moone of vnseasonable weather,
makes vs ouer-look all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God; &amp; more to mutine
at the sense of our euill, then to
praise him for our varieties of
good: whereas, fauours well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
leaue vs both mindfull
and confident; and will not suffer
vs either to forget or distrust. O
God, I haue made an ill vse of thy
mercies, if I haue not learned to
be content with thy corrections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> was in the same want of

                     </gap>aste
of bitternes, and yet they
say to <hi>Moses,</hi> What shal we drink?
If they had seene him furnished

with full vessels of sweete water,
and themselues put ouer to this
vnsauory liquor; enuy might
haue giuen some colour to this
mutinie: but now their leaders
common misery, might haue
freed him from their murmurs.
They helde it one peece of the
late Egyptian tyranny, that a task
was required of them, which the
imposers knew they could not
performe; to make brick when
they had no straw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>; Yet they say
to <hi>Moses,</hi> what shall wee drink?
Themselues are grown exactors,
and are ready to menace more
then stripes, if they haue not their
ends, without means: <hi>Moses</hi> took
not vpon him their prouision, but
their deliuerance: and yet, as if
he had been the common victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aler
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3791:14"/>
of the Camp, they aske, what
shall we drink? When want meets
with impatient mindes, it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
them to fury; Euery thing
disquiets, and nothing satisfies
them.</p>
                  <p>What course doth <hi>Moses</hi> now
take? That which they should
haue done, and did not; They
cryed not more feruently to him,
then he to God: If he were their
leader, God was his. That which
they vniustly required of him, he
iustly requires of God, that could
doe it; He knew whence to look
for redresse of all complaints;
this was not his charge, but his
Makers, which was able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his owne act. I see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the harbour, that we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3791:14"/>
must put into, in all our ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It is to thee, O God, that we
must poure out our hearts, which
onely canst make our bitter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
sweet.</p>
                  <p>Might not that rod which
took away the liquid nature from
the waters, and made them solid;
haue also taken away the bitter
quality from these waters, and
made them sweet? since to flowe
is naturall vnto the water; to be
bitter is but accidentall. <hi>Moses</hi>
durst not imploy his rod without
a precept; hee knew the power
came from the commandement.
Wee may not presume on likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
but depend vpon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
therefore <hi>Moses</hi> doth not
lift vp his rodde to the waters,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3791:15"/>
but his hand and voyce to
GOD.</p>
                  <p>The hand of faith neuer
knocked at heauen in vaine: No
sooner hath <hi>Moses</hi> shewd his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance,
then God shews him the
remedie: yet an vnlikely one,
that it might be miraculous. He
that made the waters, could haue
giuen them any sauor: How easie
is it for him that made the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to alter the quality? It is not
more hard to take away, then to
giue. Who doubts but the same
hand that created them, might
haue immediatly changed them?
Yet that almighty power will
doe it by meanes. A peece of
wood must sweeten the waters:
What relation hath wood to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3791:15"/>
or that which hath no sauour;
to the redresse of bitternes? Yet
here is no more possibility of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
then proportion to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse:
All things are subiect to
the commaund of their Maker;
He that made all of nothing, can
make euery thing of any thing:
There is so much power in euery
creature, as he wil please to giue.
It is the praise of omnipotencie
to work by improbabilities; <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi>
with salt, <hi>Moses</hi> with wood,
shall sweeten the bitter waters;
Let no man despise the meanes,
when he knowes the author.</p>
                  <p>God taught his people by
actions, as well as words. This
entrance shewd them their whole
iourney; wherein they should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3791:16"/>
taste of much bitternesse: but at
last through the mercy of GOD,
sweetned with comfort. Or did
it not represent themselues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the iourney? in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of whose hearts, were the
bitter waters of manifold corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet their vnsauory soules
are sweetned by the graces of
his Spirite. O blessed Sauiour:
the wood of thy Crosse, that is,
the application of thy sufferings,
is enough to sweeten a whole sea
of bitternesse. I care not how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
a potion I finde in this
wildernesse, if the power and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of thy precious death may
season it to my soule.</p>

He that made the rod a serpent,
can as well make these stones,

him whom wee haue found so
powerful? Now they set the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

it onely by their present sense.
Nature is iocond and cheereful,

The other mutiny, was of
some few male-contents, perhaps
those strangers, which sought
their owne protection vnder the

God measures the state of any
Church, or country by the most;
The greater part carries both the
name and censure. Sinnes are so
much greater, as they are more
vniuersall: so farre is euill from
being extenuated by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the guilty, that nothing
can more aggrauate it. With
men, commonness may plead for
fauour; with God it pleads for
iudgement. Many hands drawe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3791:19"/>
the cable with more violence,
then fewe: The leprosie of the
whole body is more loathsome
then that of a part.</p>
                  <p>But what doe these mutiners
say? Oh that we had died by the
hand of the Lord. And whose
hand was this, O yee fond Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
if ye must perish by famine?
God carried you forth; God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
his creatures from you:
and while you are ready to die
thus; ye say, Oh that we had dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>It is the folly of men, that in

see Gods hand: not in those,
whose second causes are sensible;
whereas God holds himselfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3791:19"/>
interessed in all: challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that there is no euill in the

hand, and many instruments, that
God strikes vs with: The water
may not lose the name, though
it come by chanels and pipes
from the spring. It is our faithles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that in visible meanes, wee
see not him that is invisible.</p>
                  <p>And vvhen would they haue
wisht to die? When we sate by the
flesh-pots of Egypt: Alas, what
good would their flesh-pots haue
done them, in their death? If they
might sustaine their life, yet what
could they auaile them in dying?
For if they were vnpleasant, what
comfort was it, to see them? If
pleasant, what comfort to part
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3791:20"/>
from them? Our greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are but paines in their losse.
Euery minde affects that which is
like it selfe. Carnall minds are for
the flesh-pots of Egypt, though
bought with seruitude; spirituall
are for the presence of GOD,
though redeemed with famine:
and vvould rather die in Gods
presence, then liue without him,
in the sight of delicate or full
dishes.</p>
                  <p>They loued their liues well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
I heard how they shrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
when they were in danger
of the Egyptians; yet now they
say, Oh that we had died: Not,
oh that wee might liue by the
flesh-pots; but oh that wee had
dyed. Although life be naturally

sweete, yet a little discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
makes vs weary. It is a base
cowardlinesse, so soone as euer
wee are called from the garrison
to the field, to thinke of running
away. Then is our fortitude wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of praise, when we can indure
to be miserable.</p>
                  <p>But vvhat? can no flesh-pots
serue but those of Egypt? I am
deceiued, if that Land affoorded
them any flesh-pots saue their
owne: Their Landlords of Egypt
held it abhomination to eate of
of their dishes, or to kill that
vvhich they did eate. In those
times then they did eate of their
owne; and why not now? They
had droues of cattell in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes;
why did they not take of

them? Surely if they would haue
been as good husbands of their

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3791:24"/>
morning of our resurrection,
must wee looke for our perfect
satiety of the true Manna, the
bread of life.</p>
                  <p>Now the Israelites sped well
with their Quayles; They did eat,
and digest, and prosper: not long
after they haue Quayles vvith a
vengeance; the meat was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
but the sauce was fearefull.
They let downe the Quayles at
their mouth, but they came out at
their nostrils. How much better
had it been to haue dyed of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
through the chastisement of
God, then of the plague of God,
with the flesh betwixt their teeth?
Behold they perish of the same
disease then, whereof they now
recouer. The same sinne repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3791:24"/>
is death, whose first act found
remission: Relapses are desperat,
where the sicknesse it selfe is not.
With vs men, once, goes away
with a warning, the second act is
but whipping, the third is death.
It is a mortall thing to abuse the
lenity of God; we should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
mad, to hope that
God will stand vs for a sinning-stock
to prouoke him how wee
wil. It is more mercy then he owes
vs, if he forbear vs once; it is his
iustice to plague vs the second
time: We may thanke our selues,
if we will not be warned.</p>
                  <p>Their meat was strange, but
nothing so much as their bread.
To find Quayles in a Wilderness
was vnusual; but for bread to com
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3791:25"/>
downe from heauen vvas yet
more. They had seene Quayles
before (though not in such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber):
Manna was neuer seene till
now. From this day till their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Canaan, God wrought a
perpetuall miracle in this food.
A miracle in the place: Other
bread rises vp from belowe, this
fell downe from aboue; neither
did it euer raine bread till now;
Yet so did this heauenly shower
fall, that it is confined to the
Camp of Israell. A miracle in the
quantitie; that euery morning
should fall enough to fill so many
hundred thousand mouthes and
mawes. A miracle in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
that it was sweet like hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes,
round like corianders,
transparent as deaw. A miracle in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3791:25"/>
the qualitie; that it melted by one
heat, by another hardened. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in the difference of the fall;
that (as if it knew times, &amp; would
teach them, as well as feed them)
it fell double in the eeuen of the
Sabaoth, and on the Sabaoth fell
not. A miracle in the putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and preseruation; that it was
full of wormes when it was kept
beyond the due hour for distrust:
full of sweetnes when it was kept
a day longer for religion; Yea
many Ages, in the Ark, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of the power and mercy
of the giuer. A miracle in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and ceasing; That this
showre of bread follow'd their
camp in all their remoualls, till
they came to taste of the bread
of Canaan; and then withdrew it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3791:26"/>
selfe, as if it should haue said: Yee
need no miracles, now ye haue
meanes. They had the Types;
wee haue the substance. In this
Wildernes of the world, the true
Manna is rained vpon the tents
of our hearts. Hee that sent the
Manna, was the Manna, which
he sent: Hee hath said, I am the
Manna that came downe from
heauen. Beholde their whole
meales were sacramentall: Euery
morsell they did eat, was spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
We eat still of their Manna:
still he coms down from heauen.
Hee hath substance enough for
worlds of soules; yet onely is to
be found in the lists of the true
Church: He hath more sweetnes
then the hony, and the hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.
Happie are vvee if
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3791:26"/>
wee can finde him, so sweete as
hee is.</p>
                  <p>The same hand that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Manna vppon their tents,
could haue rayned it into their
mouthes, or laps. God loues we
should take paines for our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
food. Little would it haue
auayled them, that the Manna lay
about their tents, if they had not
gone forth and gathered it, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it, bak't it: Let saluation be
neuer so plentifull, if we bring it
not home, and make it ours by
faith, wee are no whit the better.
If the worke done, and meanes
vsed, had beene enough to giue
life, no Israelite had dyed: Their
bellies vvere full of that bread,
whereof one crum giues life: yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3791:27"/>
they dyed many of them in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.
As in naturall, so in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, we may not trust to
meanes: The carcasse of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
cannot giue life, but the
soule of it; which is the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.
I see each man gather,
&amp; take his iust measure out of the
common heap; Wee must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious,
and helpfull each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but when wee haue done,
Christ is not partial. If our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
differ, yet our iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is equall in all.</p>
                  <p>Hee that gaue a Gomer to
each, could haue giuen an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah:
As easily could hee haue
rayned downe enough for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
or a yeare at once, as for a
day. God delights to haue vs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3791:27"/>
liue in a continuall dependance
vpon his prouidence, and each
day renew the acts of our faith
and thankfulnesse. But what a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
Israelite was that, which in
a foolish distrust would be sparing
the charges of God; and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that for morning which hee
should haue spent vpon his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
Hee shall knowe, that euen
the bread that came downe from
heauen, can corrupt: The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
was from aboue, the wormes
and stink from his diffidence. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so soueraine, which being
peruerted, may not annoy in stead
of benefiting vs.</p>
                  <p>Yet I see some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the true and typicall Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;
God neuer meant that the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3791:28"/>
shadow and the body should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in all things. The outward
Manna reserued was poyson: the
spirituall Manna is to vs, as it was
to the Arke; not good, vnlesse it
be kept perpetually. If wee keep
it, it shall keep vs from putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The outward Manna fell not
at all, on the Sabaoth: The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Manna (though it balks no
day) yet it falls double on Gods
day: and if we gather it not then,
we famish. In that true Sabaoth of
our glorious rest, we shal for euer
feed of that Manna, which wee
haue gathered in this eeuen of
our life.</p>

and was satisfied; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, they hungred
and were filled; novv
they thirst againe. They haue
bread and meat, but want drink:
It is a maruell if God doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
hold vs short of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because he would keep vs
still in exercise. Wee should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
at whose cost wee liue, if wee
wanted nothing. Still God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
a vicissitude of euill, and
good; and the same euils that we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3791:29"/>
haue passed, returne vpon vs in
their courses. Crosses are not
of the nature of those diseases,
which they say a man can haue
but once. Their first seisure doth
but make way for their reentry.
None but our last enemy comes
once for all; and I knowe not, if
that: for euen in liuing, wee die
daily. So must we take our leaues
of all afflictions, that wee reserue
a lodging for them, and expect
their returne.</p>
                  <p>All Israel murmured vvhen
they wanted bread, meat, water;
and yet all Israel departed from
the Wildernesse of Sin to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidin
at Gods command. The
very worst men will obey God in
something; none but the good in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3791:29"/>
all: Hee is rarely desperate that
makes an vniuersal opposition to
God. It is an vnsound praise that
is giuen a man, for one good
action: It may be safely said of
the very diuels themselues, that
they doe something well: They
know, &amp; beleeue, and tremble. If
we follow God and murmur, it is
all one, as if wee had staid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>
                  <p>Those distrust his prouidence
in their necessitie, that are ready
to follow his guidance in their
welfare. It is an harder matter to
indure an extreame want, then to
obey an hard commaundement.
Suffrings are greater tryals, then
actions: How many haue we seen
ieopard their liues, with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3791:30"/>
resolution, which cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
in cold blood to lose a lim
with patience. Because God wil
haue his throughly tryed, he puts
them to both: and if wee cannot
indure both to follow him from
Sin, and to thirst in Rephidim,
we are not sound Israelites.</p>
                  <p>God led them, on purpose, to
this dry Rephidim: Hee could as
well haue conducted them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Elim, to conuenient wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings:
Or he that giues the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of all their chanels, could as
well haue deriued them to meet
Israel: But God doth purposely
carry them to thirst. It is not for
necessitie, that we fare ill, but out
of choyse: It were all one vvith
God to giue vs health, as sicknes;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3791:30"/>
abundance as pouerty. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
of his riches hath more store
then his creature can be capable
of; we could not complaine, if it
vvere not good for vs to want.</p>
                  <p>This should haue been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
able to quench anie
thirst: <hi>GOD hath led vs hither;</hi>
If <hi>Moses</hi> out of ignorance had
misguided vs, or we chanceably
falne vppon these drie deserts,
though this were no remedy of
our griefe, yet it might be some
ground of our complaint. But
now the counsell of so wise and
merciful a God, hath drawne vs
into this want; and shal not he as
easily finde the way out? It is the
Lord, let him doe what hee will.
There can be no more forceable
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3791:31"/>
motiue to patience then the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of a diuine hand
that strikes vs. It is fearefull to be
in the hand of an aduersary; but
who would not be confident of a
father? Yet in our fraile humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
choler may transport a man
from remembrance of nature; but
when wee feele our selues vnder
the discipline of a wise God, that
can temper our afflictions to our
strength, to our benefit; vvho
vvoulde not rather murmur at
himselfe, that hee should swerue
towards impatience? Yet these
sturdy Israelites wilfully murmur:
&amp; will not haue their thirst quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with faith, but with water.
<hi>Giue vs water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I looked to heare when they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3791:31"/>
would haue intreated <hi>Moses</hi> to
pray for them; but in stead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
they contend, and in
stead of prayers I find commands.
Giue vs water. If they had gone
to God without <hi>Moses,</hi> I should
haue praysed their faith: but now
they goe to <hi>Moses.</hi> vvithout God,
I hate their stubborne faithlesnes.
To seeke to the second meanes
vvith neglect of the first, is the
fruit of a false faith.</p>
                  <p>The answere of <hi>Moses</hi> is like
himselfe, milde, and sweet; Why
contend ye with me? Why tempt
ye the Lord? In the first expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
condemning them of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice;
since not he, but the Lord
had afflicted them. In the second,
of presumption; that since it was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3791:32"/>
GOD<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that tempted them, by
want, they should tempt him by
murmuring. In the one, he would
haue them see their wrong; in the
other, their danger. As the act
came not from him, but from
God; so hee puts it off to God,
from himselfe. <hi>VVhy tempt yee
the Lord?</hi> The opposition which
is made to the instruments of
God, redounds euer to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Hee holds himselfe smitten
through the sides of his ministers:
So hath God incorporated these
respects, that our subtlety can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diuide them.</p>
                  <p>But what temptation is this?
<hi>Is the Lord among vs, or no?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
is crafty, and yet foolish;
Crafty in her insinuations, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3791:32"/>
in her conceits. They imply,
If wee were sure the Lord were
with vs wee would not distrust;
They conceiue doubts of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
after such confirmations.
What could God doe more, to
make them knowe him present,
vnless euery moment should haue
renued miracles? The plagues of
Egypt, and the diuision of the
Sea were so famous, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Innes of Iericho rang of them.
Their waters were lately sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
the Quayles were yet in
their teeth; the Manna was yet in
their eye; yea they saw God, in
the piller of the cloud, and yet
they say, Is the Lord amongst vs?
No argument is enough to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous
heart; not reason, not
sense, not experience. How much
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3791:33"/>
better was that faith of <hi>Thomas,</hi>
that would belieue his eyes and
hands, though his eares he would
not? Oh the deep infidelitie of
these Israelites, that saw, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued
not!</p>
                  <p>And how will they knowe if
God be amongst them? As if he
could not be with them, and they
be athirst: Either God must hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
carnall minds, or be distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted:
If they prosper (though it
be with wickednes) God is with
them; If they be thwarted in their
owne designes, straight, <hi>Is God
with vs?</hi> It was the way to put
God from them, to distrust, and
murmure. If he had not been with
them, they had not liued; If hee
had been in them, they had not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3791:33"/>
mutined. They can thinke him
absent in their want, and cannot
see him absent in their sin: and
yet wickednesse, not affliction, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
him gone; Yet then is hee
most present, vvhen hee most
chastises.</p>
                  <p>Who would not haue looked,
that this answere of <hi>Moses</hi> should
haue appeased their fury: As
vvhat can still him that will not
be quiet to thinke he hath God
for his aduersary? But, as if they
would wilfully warre against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
they proceed; yet with no
lesse craft, then violence; ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their exception to one part
of the answere: and smoothly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
what they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
against. They will not heare
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3791:34"/>
of tempting God; they maintain
their strife with <hi>Moses,</hi> both with
words, and stones: How maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
how heady is impatience?
The act was Gods, they cast it
vpon <hi>Moses: Wherefore hast thou
brought vs?</hi> The act of God was
mercifull, they make it cruell; <hi>To
kill vs and our children:</hi> As if
GOD and <hi>Moses</hi> meant nothing
but their ruine; vvho intended
nothing, but their life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Foolish men! What needed
this iourney to death? Were they
not as obnoxious to God, in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt?
Could not God by <hi>Moses</hi>
as easily haue killed them in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
or in the Sea, as their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
Impatience is full of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction;
If it be possible to
find out any glosse to corrupt the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3791:34"/>
text of Gods actions, they shall
be sure not to scape vntainted.</p>
                  <p>It was no expostulating with
an vnreasonable multitude; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
runnes straight to him, that
was able at once to quench their
thirst, and their fury: <hi>What shall
I doe to this people?</hi> It is the best
way, to trust God with his owne
causes: when men will be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
with his affaires, they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
themselues in vaine. We shal
find difficulties in all great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises;
If we be sure, we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
them from God, we may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
cast all euents vppon his
prouidence, which knowes how
to dispose, and how to end them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> perceiued rage, not in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3791:35"/>
the tongues onely, but in the
hands of the Israelites. Yet a while
longer and they will stone mee.
Euen the leader of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
feared death; and sinned not
in fearing. Life is worthy to be
deare to all: especially to him,
vvhome publique charge hath
made necessary: Meere feare is
not sinfull; It is impotence and
distrust that accompany it, which
make it euill. How well is that
feare bestowed, that sends vs the
more importunately to GOD!
Some man would haue thought
of flight; <hi>Moses</hi> flyes to his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and that not for reuenge, but
for help. Who but <hi>Moses</hi> would
not haue saide; This twise they
haue mutined, and beene pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and now againe, thou seest,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3791:35"/>
O Lord, how madly they rebell;
and how bloodily they intend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me; preserue me, I beseech
thee, and plague them. I heare
none of this: but imitating the
long suffering of his God, hee
seeks to God, for them, which
sought to kill him, for the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
of God.</p>
                  <p>Neither is God sooner sought,
then found: All Israel might see
<hi>Moses</hi> goe towardes the rocke:
None but the Elders might see
him strike it: Their vnbeleefe
made them vnworthy of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge.
It is no small fauour of
God, to make vs witnesses of his
great works; That he crucifies his
Son before vs; that hee serches
the water of life, out of the true
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3791:36"/>
rock, in our sight, is an hie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue;
If his rigour vvould
haue taken it, our infidelitie had
equally excluded vs, whom now
his mercy hath receiued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> must take his rod; God
could haue done it by his vvill,
without a word; or by his word<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
without the rod; but hee will doe
by meanes, that which hee can as
easily doe without. There vvas
no vertue in the rod; none in the
stroke, but all in the command of
God. Meanes must be vsed, and
yet their efficacie must bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
out of themselues.</p>
                  <p>It doth not suffice GOD to
name the rod, without a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
(<hi>Whereby thou smotest the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3791:36"/>
riuer:</hi>) Wherfore? but to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the faith of <hi>Moses,</hi> that hee
might well expect this wonder
from that, which he had tryed to
be miraculous. How could hee
but firmly beleeue, that the same
meanes which turned the waters
into blood, and turned the Sea
into a wall, could as vvell turne
the stone into vvater? Nothing
more rayses vp the heart in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
affiance, then the recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fauours, or vvoonders
passed. Behold the same rodde
that brought plagues to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,
brings deliuerances to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>. By the same meanes can
God saue and condemne: Like
as the same sword defends and

That power, which turned the
wings of the Quayles to the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes,
turned the course of the
water through the rocke: Hee
might (if he had pleased) haue
caused a spring to well out of the
plaine earth; but hee will now
fetch it out of the stone, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
and shame their infidelitie.
What is more hard and dry then
the rock? What more moist, and
supple then vvater? That they
might be ashamed to thinke, they
distrusted least God could bring
them water out of the cloudes, or
springs, the very rock shall yeeld
it. And now, vnlesse their hearts
had beene more rockie, then this
stone, they could not but haue
resolued into teares, for this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>

I wonder to see these Israelites
fed with Sacraments: Their bread
was Sacramentall, whereof they
communicated euery day: least
any man should complaine of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
the Israelites receiued
daily; and now their drinke was
Sacramentall, that the ancient
Church may giue no warrant of
a dry Communion. Twise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath the rock yeelded them
water of refreshing; to signifie,
that the true spirituall rock yeelds
it alwayes. The rocke that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them was Christ: Out of

Yet now, must the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites
doe that, which before

But the infinite wisedom, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                     <hi>Amalek</hi> was <hi>Esaues</hi> grandchild;

doubtlesse, out of enuie watcht
their opportunitie of reuenge for

subtilly takes all aduantages of
our weaknesses. Wee cannot be
wise, or safe, if we stay behinde
our colours; and strengthen not
those parts, where is most perill
of opposition.</p>
                  <p>I doe not heare <hi>Moses</hi> say to
his <hi>Ioshua: Amalek</hi> is come vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs; it matters not whether
thou goe against him, or not; or
if thou go, whether alone or with
companie; or if accompanied,
vvhether vvith manie or few,
strong or weake; Or if strong
men, vvhether they fight or no:
I vvill pray on the hill; but, <hi>Choose
vs out men, and goe fight:</hi> Then
onely can vvee pray with hope,
vvhen wee haue done our best.
And though the meanes cannot
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3791:41"/>
effect that, which wee desire; yet
God will haue and vse the likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
meanes on our part, to effect
it. Where it comes immediately
from the charge of GOD, any
meanes are effectuall; One stick
of wood shall fetch vvater out of
the rock, another shall fetch bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
out of the water: But
in those proiects, which vve make
for our owne purposes, vve must
choose those helps, vvhich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
most efficacy. In vaine shall
<hi>Moses</hi> be vpon the hill, if <hi>Ioshua</hi>
be not in the vally. Prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meanes, is a mockerie of
GOD.</p>
                  <p>Here are two shadowes of one
substance; The same Christ in
<hi>Ioshua</hi> fights against our spirituall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3791:42"/>
                     <hi>Amalek,</hi> and in <hi>Moses</hi> spreads out
his armes vpon the hill; and in
both, conquers. And why doth
he climbe vp the hill rather, then
pray in the valley? Perhaps that
he might haue the more freedom
to his thoughts; which, following
the sense, are so much more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly,
as the eye sees more of
heauen? Though vertue lies not
in the place, yet choise must be
made of those places, which may
be most helpe to our deuotion:
Perhaps, that hee might be in the
eye of Israel. The presence and
sight of the leader giues heart to
the people: neither dooth any
thing more moue the multitude,
then example. A publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot hide himselfe in the
valley: but yet it becomes him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3791:42"/>
best to shew himselfe vppon the
hill.</p>
                  <p>The hand of <hi>Moses</hi> must be
raised, but not emptie; neither is
it his owne rod that he holds, but
Gods. In the first meeting of God
with <hi>Moses,</hi> the rod was <hi>Moseses;</hi>
it is like, for the vse of his trade:
now the propriety is altered; God
hath so wrought by it, that now
he challenges it; and <hi>Moses</hi> dare
not call it his owne. Those things
which it pleases God to vse for his
owne seruice, are now changed
in their condition. The bread of
the Sacrament was once the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
now it is Gods: the water
was once euery mans, now it is
the Laver of Regeneration. It is
both vniust, and vnsafe to hold
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3791:43"/>
those things common vvherein
God hath a peculiarity.</p>
                  <p>At other times, vpon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the plagues, and of the
Quayles, and of the rock, he was
commanded to take the rodde in
his hand; now hee doth it vnbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
He doth it not now for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
operation, but for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
For when the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
should cast vp their eyes
to the hill, and see <hi>Moses,</hi> and his
rod (the man, and the meanes
that had wrought so powerfully
for them) they could not but take
heart to themselues, and thinke,
There is the man that deliuered
vs from the Egyptian, Why not
now from the Amalekite? There
is the rod, which turned waters to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3791:43"/>
blood, and brought varieties of
plagues on Egypt, Why not now
on <hi>Amaleck?</hi> Nothing can more
hearten our faith, then the view
of the monuments of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
If euer wee haue found any
word, or act of God cordial to vs,
it is good to fetch it forth oft to
the eye. The renuing of our
sense, and remembrance, makes
euery gift of God perpetually
beneficiall.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Moses</hi> had receiued a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that rod which fetcht wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the rock, could as well
haue fetcht the blood of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites
out of their bodies:
God will not worke miracles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes;
neither must wee expect
them vnbidden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:3791:44"/>
Not as a standerd-bearer so
much, as a suppliant dooth <hi>Moses</hi>
lift vp his hand: The gesture of
the body should both expresse, &amp;
further the piety of the soul. This
flesh of ours, is not a good seruant,
vnlesse it help vs in the best of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
The God of spirits dooth
most respect the soule of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion;
yet, it is both vnman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly,
and irreligious, to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestured
in our prayers. The
carelesse and vncomely carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the body helps both to
signifie, and make a profane
soule.</p>
                  <p>The hand, &amp; the rod of <hi>Moses</hi>
neuer moued in vaine; Though
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3791:44"/>
the rod did not strike <hi>Amalek,</hi> as
it had done the rock: yet it smote
heauen, and fetcht downe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
And that the Israelites
might see, the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> had
a greater stroke in the fight, then
all theirs, The successe must rise
and fall with it: <hi>Amalek</hi> rose, and
Israel fell, with his hand falling:
<hi>Amalek</hi> fell, &amp; Israel rises, with his
hand raysed; Oh the wondrous
power of the prayers of faith! All
heauenly fauours are deriued to
vs from this chanell of grace: To
these are wee beholden for our
peace, preseruations, and all
the rich mercies of GOD,
vvhich vve enioie. VVe could
not vvant, if wee could aske.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:3791:45"/>
Euery mans hand would not
haue done this; but the hand of
a <hi>Moses.</hi> A faithlesse man may as
well holde his hand, and tongue
still; hee may babble, but prayes
not; he prayes ineffectually, and
receiues not: Onely the prayer
of the righteous auaileth much;
and onely the beleeuer, is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
There can be no merit,
no recompence answerable to a
good mans prayer; for heauen,
and the eare of God is open to
him: but the formall deuotions
of an ignorant, and faithlesse man,
are not worth that crust of bread
which hee askes: Yea, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in himselfe; how should
it be beneficiall to others? it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes
the name of God, in stead
of adorning it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:3791:45"/>
But how iustly is the feruency
of the prayer added to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of the person? When
<hi>Moses</hi> hand slackned, <hi>Amalek</hi>
preuayled. No <hi>Moses</hi> can haue
his hand euer vp; It is a title pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God, that his hands are
stretched out still: whether to
mercy, or vengeance. Our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
will not suffer any long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
either of body, or mind.
Long prayers can hardly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their vigour; as in tall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
the spirits are diffused. The
strongest hand will languish, with
long extending: And when our
deuotion tyres, it is seene in the
successe; then straight our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malek</hi>
pruayles. Spirituall vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses
are maistered by vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3791:46"/>

in prayer, ouercome vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> had two helps, A stone
to sit on, and an hand to raise
his: And his sitting, and holpen
hand is no whit lesse effectuall.
Euen in our prayers will God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vs to respect our owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
In cases of our necessity,
he regards not the posture of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but the affections of the soule.
Doubtlesse <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> did
not onely raise their hands, but
their minds, with his: The more
cords, the easier draught. <hi>Aaron</hi>
was brother to <hi>Moses:</hi> there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a more brotherly office,
then to help one another in our
praiers; and to excite our mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
deuotions. No Christian may
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3791:46"/>
thinke it enough to pray alone;
Hee is no true Israelite, that will
not be ready to lift vp the weary
hands of Gods Saints.</p>
                  <p>All Israel saw this: or if they
were so intent vpon the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and spoyle, that they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it not, they might heare it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Hur:</hi> yet this
contents not God; <hi>It must bee
written.</hi> Many other miracles had
God done before; not one, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
commanded to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
The other were onely for
the wonder; this for the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods people. In things
that must liue by report, euery
tongue addes or detracts some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
The word once written
is both inalterable, &amp; permanent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:3791:47"/>
As God is carefull to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the glory of his miraculous
victory: so is <hi>Moses</hi> desirous to
second him; God by a book, and
<hi>Moses</hi> by an altar, and a name.
God commaunds to enroll it in
parchment; <hi>Moses</hi> registers it in
the stones of his altar; which hee
raises not onely for future me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
but for present vse. That
hand which was weary of lifting
vp, straight offers a sacrifice of
praise to God: How well it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the iust to be thankfull! E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
very nature teacheth vs men
to abhor ingratitude in small fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.
How much lesse can that
fountaine of goodnes abide to be
laded at with vnthankfull hands?
O God we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not but confess our

weekes, since Israell
came out of Egypt:
In which space God
had cherished their faith by fiue
seuerall woonders; yet now hee
thinkes it time to giue them sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
from heauen, as well as
bread. The Manna and water
from the rock (which was Christ
in the Gospell) were giuen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Law. The Sacraments of
grace before the legall couenant.
The grace of GOD preuenteth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3791:48"/>
our obedience; Therfore should
we keep the law of God, because
wee haue a Sauiour. Oh the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of our God! which before wee
see, what wee are bound to doe,
showes vs our remedy, if we doe
it not: How can our faith disannul
the Law, when it was before it?
It may helpe to fulfill that, which
shall be: it cannot frustrate that
which was not. The letters, which
GOD had written in our fleshy
tables, were now (as those which
are carued in some barks) almost
growne out; hee saw it time to
write them in dead Tables, whose
hardnes should not be capable of
alteration: Hee knew, that the
stone would bee more faithfull
then our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:3791:49"/>
Oh maruellous accordance
betwixt the two Testaments; In
the very time of their deliuery,
there is the same agreement,
which is in the substance. The
ancient Iewes kept our feasts;
and we still keep theirs. The feast
of the Passe-ouer is the time of
Christs resurrection; then did hee
passe from vnder the bondage of
Death. Christ is our Passe-ouer;
the spotlesse Lambe, whereof not
a bone must be broken. The very
day, wherein God came down in
fire and thunder to deliuer the
Law, Euen the same day came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Holy-ghost downe vpon
the disciples in fiery tongues, for
the propagation of the Gospell.
That other was in fire &amp; smoke,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3791:49"/>
obscuritie was mingled with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
This was in fire without
smoke, befitting the light and
clearnesse of the Gospell: Fire,
not in flashes, but in tongues; not
to terrifie, but to instruct. The
promulgation of the Law makes
way for the Law of the Gospell;
No man receiues the Holy-ghost,
but he which hath felt the
terrours of Sinai.</p>
                  <p>God might haue imposed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them a law perforce; They
were his creatures, and he could
require nothing but iustice. It had
been but equall that they should
be compelled to obey their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
yet that God which loues to
doe all things sweetly, giues the
law of iustice in mercy; and will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3791:50"/>
not imperiously command, but
craues our assent for that, which it
were rebellion not to doe.</p>
                  <p>How gentle should bee the
proceeding of fellow-creatures
who haue an equality of being,
with an inequality of condition;
when their infinite Maker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
where he might constrain.
GOD will make no couenant
with the vnwilling; How much
less the couenant of grace, which
stands all vpon loue? If wee stay
til God offer violence to our wil,
or to vs, against our will, wee shall
dy strangers from him. The
Church is the spouse of Christ;
hee will inioy her loue by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
contract, not by a rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The obstinate haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3791:50"/>
to doe with God; The title
of all conuerts, is, a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>That Israel inclined to God,
it was from God; hee inquires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his owne gifts in vs, for our
capacity of more. They had not
receiued the Law, vnlesse they
had first receiued a disposition
fit to be commanded. As there
was an inclination to heare, so
there must be a preparation for
hearing. Gods iustice had before
prepared his Israelites, by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
thirst, feare of enemies; his
mercy had prepared them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances,
by prouisions of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
meat, bread: and yet besides
all the sight of God in his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
they must be three dayes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3791:51"/>
prepared to hear him. When our
soules are at the best, our approch
to God requires particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses:
And if three dayes were
little enough to prepare them to
receiue the Law; how is all our
life short enough, to prepare for
the reckoning of our obseruing
it? And if the vvord of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
expected such readines,
what shall the word of promise,
the promise of Christ and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>The moraine of Egypt was
not so infectious as their vices;
the contagion of these stuck still
by Israell: All the water of the
red Sea, and of Marah, and that
which gushed out of the rocke,
had not washed it off. From these,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3791:51"/>
they must now be sanctified. As
sinne is alwayes dangerous; so
most, when we bring it into Gods
sight: It enuenometh both our
persons and seruices, and turnes
our good into euill. As therfore
we must be alwaies holy: so most,
when wee present our selues to
the holy eyes of our Creator.
Wee wash our hands euery day:
but when wee are to sit with some
great person, wee scoure them
with balles. And if wee must be
so sanctified, onely to receiue the
Law, how holy must we be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the grace promised in the
Gospell?</p>
                  <p>Neither must themselues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee cleansed, but their very
clothes: Their garments smelt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3791:52"/>
of Egypt, euen they must be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
Neither can clothes be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of sinne, nor can water
cleanse from sinne: The danger
was neither in their garments,
nor their skin; yet they must be
washed, that they might learne by
their clothes, with what soules to
appear before their God. Those
garments must be washed, which
should neuer waxe old, that now
they might begin their age in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
as those which were in more
danger of being foule, then bare.
It is fit that our reuerence to
Gods presence should appeare in
our very garments; that both
without and within wee may be
cleanly: but little would neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of vestures auaile vs with a
filthy soule. The God of spirits
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3791:52"/>
looks to the inner man, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
the purity of that part
which resembles himselfe: <hi>Cleanse
your hands yee sinners, and purge
your hearts ye double minded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they were washed,
and sanctified, they may not touch
the mount; not onely with their
feet, but, not with their eies: The
smoke keeps it from their eyes;
the marks from their feet. Not
only men that had some impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at their best, are restrained, but
euen beasts which are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of any vnholines. Those beasts
which must touch his altars, yet
might not touch his hill: And if
a beast touch it, he must die: yet
so, as no hands may touch that,
which hath touched the hill. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonablenes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3791:53"/>
might seem to be
an excuse in these creatures: that
therfore which is death to a beast,
must needs be capitall to them,
whose reason should guide them
to auoid presumption. Those Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
which saw God euery day
in the piller of fire, and the cloud,
must not come neere him in the
mount. God loues at once fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
and feare: Familiarity in
our conuersation, and feare in his
commands. Hee loues to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with men, in the walks
of their obedience: yet hee takes
state vpon him in his ordinances;
and will be trembled at, in his
word and iudgements.</p>
                  <p>I see the difference of Gods
carriage to men in the Law, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3791:53"/>
in the Gospell: There, the very
hill where he appeared, may not
be touched of the purest Israelite;
Here, the hemme of his garment
is touched by the woman, that
had the fluxe of blood; yea, his
very face was touched with the
lippes of <hi>Iudas.</hi> There the very
earth was prohibited them, on
which hee descended: Here, his
very body and blood is profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to our touch and taste. Oh
the maruellous kindnes of our
God! How vnthankfull are wee,
if wee doe not acknowledge this
mercy aboue his ancient people!
They were his owne; yet stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in comparison of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
It is our shame and sinne, if
in these meanes of intirenesse we
bee no better acquainted vvith
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3791:54"/>
God, then they, vvhich in their
greatest familiarity, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
aloof.</p>
                  <p>God was euer wonderfull in
his workes, and fearefull in his
iudgements: but he was neuer so
terrible in the execution of his
will, as now in the promulgation
of it. Here was nothing, but a
maiesticall terrour in the eyes, in
the ears of the Israelites; as if God
meant to shew them by this, how
fearful he could be. Here was the
lightning darted in their eyes,
the thunders roaring in their
eares, the trumpet of GOD
drowning the thunder-claps, the
voyce of God out-speaking the
trumpet of the Angel: The cloud
enwrapping, the smoke ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3791:54"/>
the fire flaming, the mount
trembling, <hi>Moses</hi> climbing and
quaking, palenesse and death in
the face of Israel, vprore in the
Elements, and all the glory of
heauen turned into terrour. In
the destruction of the first World,
there were clouds, without fire: In
the destruction of Sodome, there
was fire raining without clouds;
but here was fire, smoke, clouds,
thunder, earthquakes, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
might worke more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
then euer was in any
vengeance inflicted.</p>
                  <p>And if the Law were thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
how shall it be required? If
such vvere the proclamation of
Gods statutes, what shall the ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
be? I see and tremble at the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3791:55"/>
resemblance. The Trumpet of
the Angell call'd vnto the one:
The voyce of an Archangell, the
Trumpet of God shall summon
vs to the other. To the one, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
(that climbd vp that hill, and
alone saw it) saies, God came with
tenne thousands of his Saints; In
the other, thousand thousands
shall minister to him, and tenne
thousand thousands shall stand
before him. In the one, mount
Sinai only was on a flame; all the
world shall be so, in the other. In
the one there was fire, smoke,
thunder and lightning: In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a fiery stream shall issue from
him, wherewith the heauens shall
be dissolued, and the Elements
shall melt away with a noise. Oh
God, how powerfull art thou to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3791:55"/>
inflict vengeance vpon sinners,
who didst thus forbid sinne? and
if thou wert so terrible a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer,
what a Iudge shalt thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare?
What shall become of the
breakers of so fiery a Law? Oh
where shall those appeare, that
are guiltie of the transgressing
that Law, whose very deliuery
was little lesse then death? If our
God should exact his Law, but in
the same rigour wherein hee gaue
it, sinne could not quite the cost:
But now the fire wherein it was
deliuered was but terrifying; the
fire wherein it shall be required,
is consuming. Happy are those
that are from vnder the terrours
of that Law, which was giuen in
fire, and in fire shall be required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:3791:56"/>
God would haue Israel see,
that they had not to doe vvith
some impotent commander, that
is faine to publish his Lawes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
noise, in dead paper; which
can more easily inioyne, then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish;
or descry, then execute; and
therefore, before he giues them
a Law, he showes them that hee
can command heauen, earth, fire,
aire, in reuenge of the breach of
the Law; That they could not but
think it deadly to displease such a
Lawgiuer, or violate such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
statutes; That they might see
all the Elements, examples of
that obedience, which they shold
yeeld vnto their Maker.</p>
                  <p>This fire, wherein the Law was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3791:56"/>
giuen, is still in it; and will neuer
out: Hence are those terrours
vvhich it flashes in euery consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that hath felt remorse of
sinne. Euery mans heart is a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,
and resembles to him both
heauen and hell. The sting of
death is sinne: and the strength of
sinne, is the Law.</p>
                  <p>That they might see, hee could
finde out their closest sinnes, hee
deliuers his Law in the light of
fire, from out of the smoke: That
they might see, vvhat is due to
their sinnes, they see fire aboue,
to represent the fire that should
be belowe them: That they might
knowe he could waken their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
the thunder, and louder
voyce of GOD speaks to their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3791:57"/>
hearts. That they might see what
their hearts should doe, the earth
quakes vnder them. That they
might see they could not shift
their appearance, the Angels call
them together. Oh royall Law,
&amp; mighty Lawgiuer! How could
they thinke of hauing any other
God, that had such proofes of this?
How could they think of making
any resenblance of him, vvhom
they saw could not be seene, and
vvhom they saw, in not being
seene, infinite? How could they
thinke of daring to profane his
name, vvhom they heard to name
himself, with that voyce, <hi>Iehouah?</hi>
How could they thinke of stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vvith him for a day, vvhom
they saw to command that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
vvhich makes and measures
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3791:57"/>
day? How could they thinke of
disobeying his deputies, vvhom
they saw so able to reuenge? How
could they think of killing, when
they vvere halfe dead vvith the
feare of him, that could kill both
body and soule? How could they
thinke of the flames of lust, that
saw such fires of vengeance? How
could they think of stealing from
others, that saw vvhose the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth vvas to dispose of
at his pleasure? How could they
thinke of speaking falsly, that
heard God speak in so fearefull a
tone? How could they thinke of
coueting others goods, that saw
how weake and vncertaine right
they had to their owne? Yea to
vs, was this Law so deliuered; to
vs in them: neither had there bin
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3791:58"/>
such state in the promulgation of
it, if God had not intended it for
Eternity. We men, that so feare
the breach of humane Lawes for
some small mulcts of forfaiture;
how should we fear thee (O

Who would not haue said:
<hi>Moses</hi> is not with vs; but he is with

Yea God is forgotten with him;
and: as if God and <hi>Moses</hi> had been

and not only in their sinking, but

                  <p>Superstition besots the minds
of men, and blinds the eye of
reason; and first makes them not
men, ere it makes them Idolaters.
How else could he, that is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God, fall downe to the
images of creatures? How could
our forefathers haue so doted
vpon stocks and stones, if they
had been themselues? As the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
were first blinded, and then
led into the midst of <hi>Samaria:</hi> so
are Idolaters first bereaued of

afterwards are carryed brutishly
into all palpable impietie.</p>
                  <p>Who would not haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3791:62"/>
to heare this answer from
the brother of <hi>Moses; Pluck off
your Earings?</hi> Hee should haue
said, <hi>Pluck this Idolatrous thought
out of your hearts:</hi> and now in
stead of chiding, he soothes them.
And, as if hee had been no kin to
<hi>Moses,</hi> he helps to lead them back
againe from God, to Egypt. The
people importun'd him, perhaps
with threats. He that had waded
through all the menaces of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
doth hee now shrinke at the
threats of his owne? <hi>Moses</hi> is not
afraide of the terrors of GOD:
His faith that carryed him throgh
the water, led him vp to the fire
of Gods presence; whiles his
brother <hi>Aaron</hi> feares the faces of
those men, which hee lately saw
pale with the feare of their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3791:62"/>
Law-giuer. As if hee that
forbad other Gods, could not
haue maintained his owne act,
and agent, against men. Sudden
feares when they haue possessed
weak minds, lead them to shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
errors. Importunitie or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
may lessen, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuse a fault. Wherfore was
hee a gouernour, but to represse
their disordered motions? Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of yeelding to a sinne, or woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with our voluntary suit, is
an hyer stayre of euill: but, euen
at last to be wonne to sin, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
It is good to resist any on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
of sinne; but one condescent
loses all the thanks of our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
What will it auaile a man,
that others are plagued for solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him, whiles hee smarteth for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3791:63"/>
yeelding; if both be in hell, what
ease is it to him, that another is
deeper in the pit?</p>
                  <p>What now did <hi>Aaron?</hi> Behold,
he that alone was allow'd to climb
vp the trembling and fiery hill of
Sinai, with <hi>Moses,</hi> and heard God
say, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe
any grauen Image, for I am a iealous
God</hi> (as if hee meant particularly
to preuent this act) within one
moneth, calls for their earings,
makes the grauen image of a
Calfe; erects an altar, consecrates
a day to it, calls it their God, and
weeps not, to see them daunce
before it. It is a miserable thing,
vvhen gouernours humour the
people in their sins, and in stead
of making vp the breach, enlarge
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3791:63"/>
it. Sinne will take heart by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the meanest looker
on; but if authority once second
it, it growes impudent: As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
where the publique go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
opposes euill, (though
it be vnder hand practised, not
without feare) there is life in that
state.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aaron</hi> might haue learned bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
counsel of his brothers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
When they came to him with
stones in their hands, and said,
<hi>Giue vs water,</hi> hee ran as roundly
to God, with praiers in his mouth;
So should <hi>Aaron</hi> haue done, when
they said, <hi>Giue vs Gods:</hi> but hee
weakly runnes to their earings,
that, which should be made their
God; not to the true God, which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3791:64"/>
they had and forsook. Who can
promise to himselfe freedome
from grosse infirmities, when hee
that went vppe into the mount,
comes downe, and doth that in
the valley, which he heard forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the hill?</p>
                  <p>I see yet, and wonder at the
mercy of that God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had iustly
called himselfe iealous. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<hi>Aaron,</hi> whose infirmity had
yeelded to so foule an idolatry;
is after chosen by God, to be a
Priest to himselfe: Hee that had
set vp an altar to the Calfe, must
serue at the altar of God: Hee
that had melted, and carued out
the Calfe for a god, must sacrifice
calues and rams, and bullocks
vnto the true God: He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3791:64"/>
a day to the Idoll, is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
consecrated to him which
vvas dishonoured by the Idoll.
The grossest of all sinnes cannot
preiudice the calling of GOD;
Yea, as the light is best seene in
darknesse, the mercy of God is
most magnified in our vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse.</p>
                  <p>What a difference God puts
between persons, and sins! While
so many thousand Israelites were
slaine, that had stomachfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Idoll; <hi>Aaron</hi> that in
weaknesse condescended, is both
pardoned the fact, and afterwards
laden with honour from GOD.
Let no man take heart to sin from
mercy: Hee that can purpose to
sin vpon the knowledge of Gods
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3791:65"/>
mercy in the remission of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
presumes, and makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a wilfull offender. It is no
comfort to the wilfull, that there
is remission to the weake and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</p>
                  <p>The earings are pluckt off:
Egyptian Iewells are fit for an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
vse. This very gold
was contagious. It had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Israelites had neuer bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
these ornaments, then that
they should pay them back to the
Idolatry of their first owners.
What cost the superstitious Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
are content to be at for this
lewd deuotion? The riches, and
pride of their outward habite are
they willing to part with, to their
molten god; as glad to haue their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3791:65"/>
eares bare, that they might fill
their eyes. No gold is too deare
for their Idoll; each man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to spoyle his wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of that whereof they spoiled
the Egyptians.</p>
                  <p>Where are those worldlings,
that cannot abide to be at any
cost for their religion; which
could be content to doe GOD
chargelesse seruice? These very
Israelites that were ready to giue
gold, not out of their purses, but
from their very eares, to mis-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
shall once condemne
them. O sacriledge succeeding
to superstition! Of old they were
ready to giue gold to the false
seruice of God; we to take away
gold from the true: How doe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3791:66"/>
we see men prodigal to their lusts
and ambitions, and we hate not
to be niggards to God?</p>
                  <p>This gold is now growne to a
Calfe; Let no man thinke that
forme came forth casually, out of
the melted earings. This shape
was intended by the Israelites,
and perfected by <hi>Aaron:</hi> They
brought this God in their hearts
with them out of Egypt, and now
they set it vp in their eyes. Still
doth Egypt hurt them: Seruitude
was the least euill, that Israel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
from Egypt; for that sent
them stil to the true God, but this
Idolatrous example led them to a
false. The very sight of euill is
dangerous: and it is hard for the
heart not to runne into those sins
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3791:66"/>
to which the eye and eare is inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Not out of loue, but custom,
we fall into some offences.</p>
                  <p>The Israelites wrought so long
in the furnaces of the Egyptians
brick, that they haue brought
foorth a molten Calfe. The
black Calfe with the white spots,
which they saw worshipped in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
hath stolne their hearts:
And they, which before vvould
haue beene at the Egyptian flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots,
would now be at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions.
How many haue falne
into a fashion of swearing, scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing,
drinking, out of the vsuall
practise of others; as those that
liue in an ill aire are infected
with diseases! A man may passe
through Aethiopia vnchaunged:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3791:67"/>
but hee cannot dwell there, and
not be discoloured.</p>
                  <p>Their sinne was bad enough,
let not our vncharitablenes make
it worse: No man may think they
haue so put off humanity, and
sense, with their religion, as to
thinke that Calfe, a God; or that
this Idoll which they saw yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
made, did bring them out of
Egypt, three moneths agoe. This
were to make them more beasts
then that Calfe, which this image
represented: Or if they should
haue been so insensate, can wee
thinke that <hi>Aaron</hi> could be thus
desperately mad? The image,
and the holy-day were both, to
one Deity: <hi>Tomorrow is the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
of the Lord your God.</hi> It was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3791:67"/>
the true God they meant to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the Calfe: and yet at best,
this Idolatry is shamefull. It is no
maruell if this foule sinne seeke
pretences; yet no excuse can hide
the shame of such a face. Gods
iealousie is not stirred onely by
the riuality of a false God, but of
a false worship: Nothing is more
dangerous then to mint Gods
seruices in our owne braine.</p>
                  <p>God sends downe <hi>Moses</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
this sinne. He could as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
haue preuented, as redressed
it. He knew, ere <hi>Moses</hi> came vp,
what Israel would doe, ere hee
came downe: like as he knew, the
two Tables would be broken, ere
he gaue them. God most wisely
permits, and ordinates sinne to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3791:68"/>
his owne ends, without our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse:
And though he could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his owne hands remedy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills;
yet he will doe it, by means,
both ordinary, and subordinate.
It is not for vs to looke for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
redresse from GOD,
when we haue a <hi>Moses,</hi> by whom
it may be wrought: Since God
himselfe expects this from man,
why should man expect it from
God?</p>
                  <p>Now might <hi>Moses</hi> haue found
a time to haue been eeuen with
Israell, for all their vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and mutinous insurrections.
<hi>Let me alone: I will consume them,
and make thee a mighty Nation.
Moses</hi> should not need to solicite
God for reuenge; God solicites
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3791:68"/>
him, in a sort, for leaue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge:
Who would look for such a
word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> god to man, <hi>Let me alone?</hi>
As yet <hi>Moses</hi> had said nothing;
Before he opens his mouth, God
preuents his importunity; as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
that holy violence, which
the requests of <hi>Moses</hi> would offer
to him. <hi>Moses</hi> stood trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the maiesty of his Maker; &amp;
yet heares him say, <hi>Let me alones</hi>
The mercy of our God, hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

were obliged his power, to the
faith of men: The feruent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the faithfull, hold the hands
of the Almightie. As I finde it
said afterwardes of Christ, that
<hi>hee could doe no miracles there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their vnbeliefe:</hi> So now
I heare GOD (as if hee could
not doe execution vppon Israel
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3791:69"/>
because of <hi>Moseses</hi> faith) say, <hi>Let
mee alone that I may consume them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee all naturally affect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie;
and like our owne so
much better, as it is freer from
partners. Euery one would be
glad to say, with that proud one,
<hi>I am, and there is none beside me:</hi>
So much the more sweetly would
this message haue sounded to
nature, <hi>I will consume them, and
make of thee a mighty Nation.</hi> How
many indeuour that (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger of curses and vprore)
which vvas voluntarily tendred
vnto <hi>Moses!</hi> Whence are our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populations,
and inclosures, but
for that men cannot abide either
fellowes, or neighbours? But how
gratiously doth <hi>Moses</hi> striue with
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3791:69"/>
GOD against his owne prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
If God had threatned, <hi>I
will consume thee, and make of them
a mighty Nation,</hi> I doubt whether
he could haue beene more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
The more a man can leaue
himselfe behinde him, and aspire
to a care of community, the more
spirituall he is. Nothing makes
a man so good a patriot, as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Oh the sweet disposition of
<hi>Moses;</hi> fit for him that should bee
familiar with God! hee saw they
could be content to be merry,
and happy without him; he would
not bee happy vvithout them.
They had professed to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
him: hee slacks not to sue
for them. He that will euer hope
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3791:70"/>
for good himselfe, must returne
good for euill vnto others.</p>
                  <p>Yet was it not Israel so much
that <hi>Moses</hi> respected, as God in
Israell. He was thrifty and iealous
for his Maker; and would not
haue him lose the glory of his
mighty deliuerances; nor would
abide a pretence for any Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
dogge, to barke against the
powerfull worke of God; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall the Egyptians say?</hi> If Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell
could haue perished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dishonour to God, perhaps
his hatred to their Idolatry would
haue ouercome his naturall loue,
and he had <hi>let God alone:</hi> Now
so tender is hee ouer the name of
God, that hee would rather haue
Israel scape with a sin, then Gods
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3791:70"/>
glory should be blemished in the
opinions of men, by a iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He saw that the eyes and
tongues of all the world were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
vppon Israel; a people so
miraculously fetcht from Egypt,
vvhome the Sea gaue vvay too;
whom heauen fedde; whom the
rock watred; whom the fire and
cloud garded, which heard the
audible voyce of God: He knew
vvithall, how ready the vvorld
would bee to misconstrue, and
how the heathens would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to cast imputations of leuity,
or impotence vpon GOD, and
therefore saies, <hi>What will the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
say?</hi> Happy is that man,
which can make Gods glory the
scope of all his actions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
neither cares for his owne
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3791:71"/>
welfare, nor fears the miseries of
others, but with respect to God,
in both. If God had not giuen
<hi>Moses</hi> this care of his glory, hee
could not haue had it: And now
his goodnes takes it so kindly, as
if himselfe had receiued a fauour
from his creature; and for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
of the grace hee hadde
wrought, promises not to doe
that, which he threatned.</p>
                  <p>But what needs God to care
for the speech of the Egyptians;
men, infidels? And if they had
beene good, yet their censure
should haue beene vniust. Shall
God care for the tongues of men;
the holy God, for the tongues of
infidels? The very Israelites now
they were from vnder the hands
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3791:71"/>
of Egypt, car'd not for their
words; and shall the GOD of
heauen regard that which is not
worth the regard of men? Their
tongues could not walke against
God, but from himselfe; and if it
could haue beene the worse for
him, would he haue permitted it?
But, O God, how dainty art thou
of thine honour! that thou canst
not indure the vvorst of men
should haue any colour to taint
it. What doe we men stand vpon
our iustice, and innocence, with
neglect of all vniust censures;
when that infinite God, whom no
censures can reach, wil not abide,
that the very Egyptians should
falsly taxe his power and mercy?
Wise men must care not onely to
deserue well, but to heare well:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3791:72"/>
and to wipe off, not onely crimes,
but censures.</p>
                  <p>There was neuer so pretious
a monument, as the Tables writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with Gods owne hand. If we
see but the stone vvhich <hi>Iacobs</hi>
head rested on; or, on which the
foot of Christ did once tread;
we looke vpon it with more then
ordinary respect: With what
eye should wee haue beheld this
stone, which was hewed, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the very finger of God?
Any manuscript scroll written by
the hand of a famous man is laid
vp amongst our iewels; What
place then should we haue giuen
to the hand-writing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:3791:72"/>
That which hee hath dictated
to his seruants the Prophets, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
iust honour from vs; how
dooth that deserue veneration,
which his owne hand wrote im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately?</p>
                  <p>Prophecies and Euangelicall
discourses hee hath written by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
neuer did hee write any
thing himselfe, but these Tables
of the Law: neither did hee euer
speak any thing audibly to whole
mankinde, but it; The hand, the
stone, the Law were all his. By
how much more precious this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
was, by so much vvas the
fault greater, of defacing it.
What King holds it lesse then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to teare his writing, and
blemish his seale?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:3791:73"/>
At the first, hee ingraued his
image in the Table of mans hart;
<hi>Adam</hi> blurr'd the image, but
(through Gods mercy) sav'd the
Tablet. Now he writes his will
in the Tables of stone, <hi>Moses</hi>
breakes the Tables, and defac't
the writing. If they had beene
giuen him for himselfe, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
the matter, had deserv'd,
that as they were written in stone,
for permanency; So they should
be kept for euer: and as they were
euerlasting in vse, so they should
bee in preseruation. Had they
been written in clay, they could
but haue been broken: But now
they were giuen for all Israell, for
all mankind. He was but the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
not the owner. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3791:73"/>
therefore Israell had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by breaking this Couenant
with GOD, to haue this monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods Couenant vvith
them, broken by the same hand
that wrote it: Yet how durst <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
thus carelesly cast away the
treasure of all the world; and by
his hands vndoe that, which was
with such cost and care, done by
his Creator? How durst he faile
the trust of that GOD, whose
pledge he receiued with awe, and
reuerence? Hee that expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with God, to haue Israel liue
and prosper, why would hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
the rule of their life, in the
keeping wherof they should pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
I see that forty dayes talk
with God cannot bereaue a man
of passionate infirmity: Hee that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3791:74"/>
was the meekest vpon earth, in
a sudden indignation abandons
that, which in colde blood hee
would haue held faster, then his
life: He forgets the Law written,
when he saw it broken; His zeale
for GOD hath transported him
from himselfe, and his duty to
the charge of God: Hee more
hates the golden Calfe, wherein
hee saw ingrauen the Idolatry of
Israell, then hee honor'd the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of stone, wherein God had
ingrauen his commandements:
and more longed to deface the
Idol, then hee cared to preserue
the Tables. Yet that God, which
so sharply reuenged the breach
of one Law, vpon the Israelites,
checks not <hi>Moses</hi> for breaking
both the Tables of the Law.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3791:74"/>
The Law of God is spirituall; the
internall breach of one Law is so
haynous, that in comparison of it
God scarce counts the breaking
of the outward Tables, a breach
of the Law. The goodnes of God
winks at the errours of honest
zeale; and so loues the strength of
good affections, that it passeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their infirmities: How high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God doth esteeme a well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
zeale; vvhen his mercy
crownes it with all the faults?</p>
                  <p>The Tables had not offended:
the Calfe had, and Israel in it. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
takes reuenge on both: Hee
burnes and stamps the Calfe to
powder, and giues it Israel to
drinke; that they might haue it
in their guts, in stead of their eies:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3791:75"/>
How he hasteth to destroy the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll
wherein they sinned? that,
as an Idoll is nothing, so it might
be brought to nothing; and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
and dust is nearest to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
that in stead of going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Israel, it might passe through
them; so as the next day they
might finde their God in their
excrements; To the iust shame
of Israel, when they should see
their new God cannot defend
himselfe, from being either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or worse.</p>
                  <p>Who can but wonder to see a
multitude of so many hundred
thousands (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> 
                     <hi>Moses</hi> came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ill) to turne their
eies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their god, to him; And on
a sudden, in stead of worshipping
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3791:75"/>
their Idol, to batter it in pieces,
in the very height of the nouelty?
In stead of building altars, &amp; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
fires to it, to kindle an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fire, then that, wherewith it
was melted, to consume it; In
stead of dancing before it, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
and deface it; in stead of
singing, to weep before it? There
was neuer a more stiffe-necked
people: Yet I doe not heare any
one man of them say; Hee is but
one man; We are many; how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
may we destroy him, rather
then he our god? If his brother
durst not resist our motion in
making it: Why will wee suffer
him to dare resist the keeping of
it? It is our act; and we will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it. Here was none of this;
but an humble obeysance to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3791:76"/>
basest and bloodiest reuenge that
<hi>Moses</hi> shall impose. God hath set
such an impression of Maiestie in
the face of lawfull authoritie,
that wickednesse is confounded
in it selfe to behold it. If from
hence visible powers were not
more feared then the inuisible
God, the world would be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne
vvith outrage. Sinne hath
such a guiltinesse in it selfe, that
vvhen it is seasonably checked,
it puls in his head, and seekes
rather an hiding place, then a
fort.</p>
                  <p>The Idoll is not capable of a
further reuenge: It is not enough,
vnlesse the Idolaters smart: The
gold was good, if the Israelites
had not beene euill: So great a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3791:76"/>
sinne cannot be expiated vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blood. Behold, that meeke
spirite, vvhich in his plea vvith
GOD vvould rather perish
himself, then Israel should perish,
armes the Leuites against their
brethren, and reioyces to see
thousands of the Israelites bleed,
and blesses their executioners.</p>
                  <p>It was the mercy of <hi>Moses</hi> that
made him cruell: Hee had beene
cruell to all, if some had not
found him cruell. They are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse
hands which are not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
embrued in blood: There
is no lesse charitie then iustice in
punishing sinners vvith death;
GOD delights no lesse in a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mercy, then in a pittifull iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:

vpon them? Or if their throates
must bee cut by their brethren,
shall it be done in the very heat of
their sinne? But they must learne
a difference betwixt pitty, and
fondnesse; mercy, and vniustice.
<hi>Moses,</hi> had an hart as soft as theirs,
but more hote; as pittiful, but wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.
Hee was a good Physician,
and saw that Israel could not liue,
vnlesse he bled: he therefore lets
out this corrupt bloud, to saue
the whole body. There cannot be
a better sacrifice to God, then the
bloud of malefactors: and this

                  <p>Neuer is GOD throughlie
displeased vvith any people,
where that continues. For, like
as those vvhich purposed loue,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3791:83"/>
vvhen they fall off, call for
their tokens backe againe: So
vvhen GOD beginnes once
perfectlie to mislike, the first
thing hee withdrawes, is his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
                  <p>Israel recouers this fauor, but
with an abatement; <hi>Heaw thee two
Tables.</hi> God made the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
The matter, the forme, was
his; now, <hi>Moses</hi> must heaw the
next: As God created the first
man after his owne image; but
that once defaced, <hi>Adam</hi> begat
<hi>Cain</hi> after his owne: Or as the
first Temple razed, a second was
built; yet so farre short, that the
Israelites wept at the sight of it,
The first workes of God, are still
the purest: those that hee secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3791:83"/>
vvorkes by vs, decline in
their perfection. It was reason,
that though God had forgiuen
Israel, they should still finde, they
had sinned. They might see the
foot-steps of displeasure, in the
differences of the agent. When
GOD had tolde <hi>Moses</hi> before,
<hi>I will not go before Israel, but my
Angel shall lead them; Moses</hi> so
noted the difference, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
not, till God himselfe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
their conduct: So might
the Israelites haue noted some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of offence, whiles in
stead of that which his owne hand
did formerly make, he saith now,
<hi>Heaw thee;</hi> And yet these second
Tables are kept reuerently in the
Arke, when the other lay moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in shiuers vpon Sinai; Like
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3791:84"/>
as the repayred image of God in
our regeneration is preserued,
perfited, and laid vp at last, safe in
heauen; whereas the first image
of our created innocence, is quite
defaced: So the second Temple
had the glory of Christs exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
tho meaner in frame. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
respects of God are not tyed
to glorious out-sides; or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
woorthinesse of things, or
persons: Hee hath chosen the
weake and simple to confound
the wise, and mighty.</p>
                  <p>Yet God did this vvorke by
<hi>Moses; Moses</hi> heawed, and God
wrote: Our true <hi>Moses</hi> repayres
that Law of GOD which wee
in our nature had broken; Hee
reuiues it for vs, and it is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3791:84"/>
of GOD no lesse then if
the first characters of his Lavv
had beene still entire. Wee can
giue nothing but the Table: it is
GOD that must write in it. Our
hearts are but a bare-board, till
GOD by his finger ingraue his
Law in them; Yea, Lord, we are
a rough quarrie; heaw thou vs
out, and square vs fit for thee, to
write vpon.</p>
                  <p>Well may wee maruell, to see
<hi>Moses,</hi> after this ouersight, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to this charge again: Who
of vs would not haue said, Your
care indeede deserues trust; you
did so carefully keepe the first
Tables, that it would doe well to
trust you with such another bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:3791:85"/>
It was good for <hi>Moses,</hi> that hee
had to doe with GOD, not with
men: The GOD of mercy will
not impute the slippes of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
to the preiudice of our
faithfulnes. Hee that after the
misse-answere of the one talent,
would not trust the euill seruant
with a second, because hee saw
a wilfull neglect; will trust <hi>Moses</hi>
with his second Law, because hee
saw fidelitie in the worst errour
of his zeale. Our charity must
learne, as to forgiue, so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
vvhere vvee haue beene
deceiued: Not that wee should
wilfully beguile our selues in an
vniust credulity, but that wee
should search diligentlie into
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3791:85"/>
the disposition of persons, and
grounds of their actions; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
none maie bee so sure, as
they that haue once disappointed
vs. Yea <hi>Moses</hi> brake the first;
therefore hee must heaw the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
If GOD had broken
them, hee would haue repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them; The amends must
bee where the fault was. Both
GOD, and his Church looke
for a satisfaction, in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee haue offended.</p>
                  <p>It was not long since <hi>Moses</hi>
his former fast of fortie dayes:
When he then came down from
the hill, his first question vvas
not for meate: and now going
vppe againe to Sinai, hee takes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3791:86"/>
not any repast with him: That
GOD which sent the Quayles
to the host of Israel, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
from heauen, coulde haue
fedde him with dainties: Hee
goes vppe confidently in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
trust of GODs prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
There is no life to that of
faith; Man liues not by bread
onely: The vision of GOD
did not onely sate, but feast
him. VVhat a blessed satiety
shall there bee, when wee shall
see him as hee is; and hee shall
bee all in all to vs; since this
verie frayle mortalitie of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi>
vvas sustained, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but with representations of
his presence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:3791:86"/>
I see <hi>Moses</hi> the receiuer of
the Lavv, <hi>Elias</hi> the restorer of
the Lavv, CHRIST the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filler
of the olde Law, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the nevv, all fasting
fortie dayes: and these three
great fasters I finde together
glorious in Mount Tabor. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
merits not; For Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
consists not in the bellie,
either full or emptie: what are
meates, or drinkes to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, vvhich is like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
spirituall? But it prepares
best for good dutyes. Full bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
are fitter for rest: not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so much as the soule, is more
actiue with emptines; Hence so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
prayer takes euer fasting to
attend it, and so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3791:87"/>
speeds in heauen, when it
is so accompanied. It is good so
to diet the body, that the soule
may be fatned.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> came downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
his eyes sparkled with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and his face was beth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
pale, and red with
indignation: now it is bright
with glorie. Before, there were
the flames of fury in it; now the
beames of Maiestie. <hi>Moses</hi> had
before spoken with GOD; why
did not his face shine before? I
cannot lay the cause vpon the
inward trouble of his passions,
for this brightnes was externall.
Whither shall we impute it but to
his more intirenesse with God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:3791:87"/>
The more familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
wee haue with GOD, the
more doe wee partake of him.
Hee that passes by the fire, may
haue some gleames of heat: but
hee that stands by it hath his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
chaunged. It is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a man should haue any long
conference with GOD, and
bee no whit affected. Wee are
strangers from GOD, it is no
woonder if our faces bee earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;
but hee that settes himselfe
apart to GOD, shall finde a
kinde of maiestie, and awfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
put vpon him, in the minds
of others.</p>
                  <p>How did the heart of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:3791:88"/>
shine with illumination when
his face was thus lightsome? And
if the flesh of <hi>Moses</hi> in this base
composition, so shined by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing
with GOD fortie dayes
in Sinai; What shall our glory
bee, when clothed with incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
bodies we shall conuerse
with him for euer, in the highest
heauen?</p>
                  <p>Now his face onely shone: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
the three disciples saw
all his bodie shining. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a glorified body, the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
vision, the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of that fountaine of glory,
challenge a farre greater resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to our faces, then his. O
GOD, wee are content that
our faces bee blemished awhile
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3791:88"/>
vvith contempt, and blubbred
vvith teares; how can wee but
shine vvith <hi>Moses,</hi> vvhen wee
shall see thee more then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The brightnesse of <hi>Moseses</hi>
face reflected not vpon his owne
eyes: Hee shone bright and
knew not of it: Hee saw Gods
face glorious, hee did not thinke
others had so seene his. How
manie haue excellent graces, and
perceiue them not? Our owne
sense is an ill iudge of GODs
fauours to vs; Those that stand
by, can conuince vs in that which
vvee denie to our selues. Heere
belowe, it is enough, if wee can
shine in the eyes of others; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
wee shall shine, and knowe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3791:89"/>
it. At this instant, <hi>Moses</hi> sees
himselfe shine: then, hee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not. GOD meant not
that hee should more esteeme
himselfe, but that hee should be
more honoured of the Israelites:
That other glorie shall be for our
owne happinesse, and therefore
requires our knowledge.</p>
                  <p>They that did but stand still,
to see anger in his face; ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to see glory in it: Before,
they had desired that God would
not speake to them any more but
by <hi>Moses;</hi> and now that GOD
doth but looke vpon them in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
they are afraide; and yet
there was not more difference
betwixt the voyces, then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of GOD and <hi>Moses.</hi> This
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3791:89"/>
should haue drawen Israel to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
so much the more, to haue
seene this impression of Diuinity
in his face.</p>
                  <p>That which should haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
affrights them: Yea <hi>Aaron</hi>
himselfe, that before went vppe
into the mount to see and speake
with God, now is afraide to see
him that had seene GOD: Such
a feare there is in guiltinesse,
such confidence in innocencie.
When the soule is once cleared
from sinne, it shall runne to
that glorie, with ioy, the least
glimpse whereof now appalles
it, and sends it awaie in terrour.
Howe could the Israelites now
choose but thinke; How shall
vvee abide to looke GOD
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3791:90"/>
in the face, since our eyes are
dazeled with the face of <hi>Moses?</hi>
And well may wee still argue, If
the image of GOD, which hee
hath sette in the fleshy forehead
of authoritie daunt vs; how shall
wee stand before the dreadful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
of heauen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> maruels to see Israell
runne away from their guide, as
from their enemy; and lookes
backe to see if hee could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
anie new cause of feare;
&amp; not conceiuing how his milde
face could affray them, calls them
to stay, and retire. Oh my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
vvhome doo you flee? It
is for your sakes, that I ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
stayd, came downe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
here are no armed Leuites
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3791:90"/>
to strike you, no Amalekites, no
Egyptians to pursue you, no fires
and thunders to dismay you. I
haue not that rodde of GOD
in my hand, which you haue seen
to command the Elements: or if
I had; so farre am I from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
any rigour against you,
that I now lately haue appeased
God towards you; and lo, heere
the pledges of his reconciliation.
God sends me to you for good; &amp;
doe you runne from your best
friend? Whither will ye goe from
me; or without mee? Stay, and
hear the charge of that God, from
whom ye cannot flee.</p>
                  <p>They perceiue his voyce the
same, though his face were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and are perswaded to stay,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3791:91"/>
and returne and heare him,
vvhome they dare not see; and
now after manie doubtfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
approching nearer, dare tell
him hee was growne too glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p>Good <hi>Moses,</hi> finding that they
durst not looke vpon the sunne
of his face, cloudes it vvith a
vayle: Choosing rather to hide
the worke of God in him, then
to want opportunitie of reuealing
GODs will, to his people: I
doe not heare him stand vppon
tearmes of reputation; If there
be glorie in my face, God put it
there; hee would not haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it so conspicuously, if hee
had meant it should be hid: Hide
yee your faces rather, which are
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3791:91"/>
blemished with your sin; and look
not that I should wrong God and
my selfe, to seeme lesse happy, in
fauour of your weakenesse. But
without all selfe-respects, he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
hides his glorified face;
and cares not their eyes should
pierce so farre, as to his skin, on
condition, that his wordes may
pierce into their eares. It is good
for a man sometimes to hide his
graces; Some talents are best im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
by being laid vp: <hi>Moses</hi>
had more glory by his vayle, then
by his face. Christian modesty
teaches a wise man, not to expose
himselfe to the fayrest show, and
to liue at the vtmost pitch of his
strength.</p>
                  <p>There is many a rich stone
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3791:92"/>
laide vp in the bowels of earth;
many a faire pearle laide vp in
the bosome of the Sea, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was seene, nor neuer shal be.
There is many a goodly starre,
which because of height comes
not within our account: How
did out true <hi>Moses</hi> with the vayle
of his flesh, hide the glorie of
his Deity, and put on vilenesse,
besides the laying aside of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty;
and shut vp his great and
Diuine Miracles, with, <hi>See you
tell no man.</hi> How farre are those
spirits from this, which care one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be seene; and wish onely
to dazle others eyes with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
not caring for vnknowne
riches? But those yet more,
vvhich desire to seeme aboue
themselues, whether in parts, or
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3791:92"/>
graces; vvhose vayle is fayrer
then their skinne. Modest faces
shall shine through their vayles,
when the vain-glorious shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
their shame, through their
couering.</p>
                  <p>That GOD, which gaue
his Law in smoke, deliuered it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
through the vayle of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
Israel coulde not looke to
the ende of that, which should
be abolished; for the same cause
had GOD a vayle vppon his
owne face, which hidde his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in the holy of holies. Now
as the vayle of GOD did rend,
when hee said, <hi>It is finished;</hi> so
the vayle of <hi>Moses</hi> was then pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
off: Wee clearely see Christ,
the ende of the Law; Our <hi>Ioshua</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:3791:93"/>
that succeeded <hi>Moses,</hi> speakes to
vs bare-faced: what a shame is it
there should be a vayle vpon our
hearts, when there is none on his
face?</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> went to speake
with GOD, hee pull'd off his
vayle; It was good reason hee
should present to GOD, that
face which hee had made: There
had beene more neede of his
vayle, to hide the glorious face
of GOD from him, then to hide
his from GOD: but his faith
and thankfulnesse, serue for both
these vses. Hypocrites are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Moses;</hi> hee show'd his
worst to men, his best to GOD;
they show their best to men, their
worst to GOD: but GOD sees
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3791:93"/>
both their vayle, and their face;
&amp; I knowe not, whether he more
hates their vayle of dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or their face of
wickednesse.</p>

it was, that fire came downe
from God, vnto the altar: That
as the charge of the sacrifice was
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3791:94"/>
deliuered in fire and smoke; so
God might signifie the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, in the like fashion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was commanded. The Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
might lay ready their bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
vpon the wood, and water
in their trench: but they might
sooner fetch the blood out of their
bodyes, and destroy themselues,
then one flash out of heauen to
consume the sacrifice. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
which can fetch downe fire
from heauen, either maliciously,
or to no purpose; (altho hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with fire; and did as fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently
desire this fire in emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

mitigation of his owne) yet now,
hee could no more kindle a fire
for the Idolatrous sacrifice, then
quench the flames of his owne

torment. Herein God approoues
himselfe onely woorthy to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
vnto, that he creates the
fire for his owne seruice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the impotent Idols of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
must fetch fire from their

are fit matter for their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
fire.</p>
                  <p>The Israelits (that were led too
much with sense) if they had seen
the bullock consumed with a fire
fetcht from a common hearth,
could neuer haue acknowledged
what relation the sacrifice had to
GOD; had neuer perceiued that
God took notice of the sacrifice:
but now they see the fire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming
out, from the presence of God,
they are conuinced both of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3791:95"/>
power and acceptation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
They are at once ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and satisfied to see the same
God answer by fire, which before
had spoken by fire: God doth no
lesse approue our Euangelical sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
then theirs vnder the law;
But as our sacrifices are spirituall,
so are the signes of his acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Faith is our guide, as sense
was theirs. Yea euen still, doth
God testify his approbation by
sensible euidences: when by a
liuely faith, and feruent zeale, our
harts are consecrated to GOD,
then doth his heauenly fire come
downe vpon our sacrifices; Then
are they holy, liuing, acceptable.
This flame, that GOD kindled,
was not as som momentany bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,
for a suddaine, and short

Triumph, nor as a domesticall

is giuen for a perpetuitie, &amp; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

God, as he is himself, eternal; so he
loues permanency, &amp; constancie
of grace in vs: If we be but a flash
and away, God regards vs not;
all promises are to perseuerance.
Sure, it is but an elementary fyre,
that goes out; that which is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall,
continues: it was but some
presumptuous heat in vs, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
vpon euery occasion.</p>
                  <p>But hee that miraculously sent

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3791:96"/>
God wil not worke miracles
euery day: if he haue kindled his
spirit in vs, we may not expect he
shall euery day begin again; wee
haue the fuell of the word and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
praiers, &amp; meditations,
which must keep it in for euer. It is
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> God that these helps can nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

                  <p>Whiles the people with fear and

haue bin excused with ignorance:
but now, when God had newlie

commaunded the continuance of
it; either to let it go out, or whiles
it still flamed, to fetch profane
coales to Gods altar, could sauor
of no lesse then presumption, and
sacriledge: when wee bring zeale
without knowledge, misconceits
of faith, carnall affections, the
deuises of our will-worship, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
deuotions into Gods
seruice; wee bring common fire
to his altar; these flames were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3791:97"/>
of <hi>his kindling;</hi> He hates both
altar, fire, priest &amp; sacrifice. And
now behold; the same fire vvhich
consumed the sacrifice before,
consumes the sacrificers. It vvas
the signe of his acceptation in
consuming the beast; but whiles it
destroyed men, the fearfull signe
of his displeasure. By the same
meanes can GOD bewray both
loue, &amp; hatred. We would haue
pleaded for <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abthu;</hi>
They are but yong men, the sons
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> not yet warme in their
function; let both age, &amp; bloud,
and inexperience excuse them, as
yet. No pretences, no priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
can beare off a sin with God:
Men think either to patronize, or
mitigate euils, by their fained rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
That no man may hope the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3791:98"/>
plea either of birth, or of youth,
or of the first commission of euil,
may challenge pardon. I see heer
young men, sonnes of the Ruler
of Israel, for the first offence
strooke dead.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this made God the more
to stomach, and the rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
this impietie, because the
sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> did it. God had both
pardoned &amp; graced their father,
he had honored the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>; of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Israel, culling them out
for his altar: and now, as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
set vp a false God, so they
bring false fire vnto the true God.
If the sonnes of Infidels liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,
they doe their kinde; their
punishment shall be (though iust)
yet lesse: but if the children of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3791:98"/>
religious parents, after all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
nourture, shall shame their
Education, GOD takes it more
haynously, and reuenges it more
sharply. The more bonds of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the more plagues of neglect.</p>
                  <p>If from the agents, we looke to
the act it selfe; set aside the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
descent, &amp; vvhat difference
vvas there betwixt these fyres?
Both lookt alike, heated alike, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
alike, consumed alike:
Both were fedde with the same
materiall wood, both vanished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
smoake; There was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but in the commandement
of God. If God had inioyned ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fyre, they had sinned to look
for celestiall; now he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely the fire which hee sent:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3791:99"/>
they sinned in sending vp incense,
in that fire, which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not. It is a dangerous thing
in the seruice of God to decline
from his owne institutions; vvee
haue to do with a power which is
wise to prescribe his own worship,
iust to require what he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
powerfull to reuenge
that which he hath not required.</p>
                  <p>If God had strooke them with
some leprosie in their forehead,
as he did their Aunt <hi>Miriam,</hi> soon
after, or with some palsy, or lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
consumption, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had been grieuous: but he,
whose iudgments are euer iust,
sometimes secret, saw fire the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
reuenge, for a sin of fire; his
owne fire, fittest to punish strange
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3791:99"/>
fire; A suddaine iudgement, fitte
for a present, and exemplary sin;
Hee saw, that if hee had winkt at
this, his seruice had been exposed
to profanation. It is wisedome in
Gouernours to take sinne at the
first bound; and so to reuenge it,
that their punishments may bee
preuentions. Speed of death, is
not alwaies a iudgement; sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as it is euer iustly suspicable,
so then certainely argues anger,
when it findes vs in an act of sin.
Leasure of repentance is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fauour: when God giues
a man lawe, it implyes that hee
would not haue iudgement sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
him.</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse <hi>Aaron</hi> lookt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
heauily on this sad spectacle;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3791:100"/>
It could not but appall him, to see
his two sonnes dead before him,
dead in displeasure, dead sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
dead by the immediat hand of
God. And now hee could repent
him of his new honor, to see it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
so ill, with the sonnes of his
loines; neither could he chuse, but
see himself striken in them. But his
brother <hi>Moses,</hi> that had learned
not to knowe either nephews, or
brother, when they stood in his
way to God, wisely turned his eies
from the dead carcasses of his
sonnes, to his respect of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
GOD; My Brother, this
euent is fearefull, but iust; These
vvere thy sonnes, but they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
it vvas not for GOD, it is
not for thee, to looke so much
who they were, as what they did.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3791:100"/>
It was their honor and thine, that
they were chosen to minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord: Hee that called
them, iustly required their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and obedience. If they
haue profaned God, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
can thy naturall affection
so miscary thee, that thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
wish their impunity, with the
blemish of thy Maker? Our sons
are not ours, if they disobey our
Father: to pitty their misery, is to
partake of their sinne; If thou
grudge at their iudgement, take
heed least the same fyre of GOD
come forth vpon this strange fyre
of nature. Showe now whether
thou more louest GOD, or thy
sonnes; Show whether thou be a
better father, or a sonne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:3791:101"/>
                     <hi>Aaron,</hi> weighing these things,
holds his peace, not out of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
or fullennesse, but out
of patient and humble submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and seeing Gods pleasure, &amp;
their desert, is content to forget,
that he had sons. He might haue
had a silent tongue, and a clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
hart; There is no voice low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the eares of GOD, then a
a speechless repining of the soule.
Heat is more intended with kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in; but <hi>Aarons</hi> silence was
no lesse inward: Hee knew how
little hee should get by brauling
with GOD. If hee breathed out
discontentment, hee saw GOD
could speake fire to him againe;
And therefore he quietly submits
to the will of God; and held his
peace, because the Lord had done
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3791:101"/>
it. There is no greater proofe of
grace, then to smart patiently; &amp;
humbly and contentedly to rest
the hart in the iustice, &amp; wisdome
of Gods proceeding; and to be so
far from chiding, that we dispute
not. Nature is froward; and tho
she well knowes wee meddle not
with our match, when wee striue
with our Maker, yet she pricks vs
forward to this idle quarrell; and
bids vs with <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, Curse and
die. If God either chide, or smite,
(as seruants are charged to their
Maisters) we may not answere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
when Gods hand is on our
backe, our hand must bee on our
mouth: else, as mothers do their
children, God shall whippe vs so
much the more for crying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:3791:102"/>
It is hard for a stander by, in this
case to distinguish betwixt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hartednes,
and pietie. There <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
sees his sons ly; hee may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
put his hand to them, to bury
them, nor shed a teare for theyr
death. Neuer parent can haue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
cause of mourning, then to
see his sons dead in their sinne; if
prepared, and penitent, yet vvho
can but sorrow for their end: but
to part with children, to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a second death, is woorthy
of more then teares. Yet <hi>Aaron</hi>
must learne so farre to denie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that hee must more magnify
the iustice of GOD, then lament
the iudgement. Those vvhom
GOD hath called to his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat
seruice, must knowe that hee
will not allow them the common
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3791:102"/>
passions, and cares of others. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more naturall then sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for the death of our owne: if
euer griefe bee seasonable, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms
a funerall. And if <hi>Nadab</hi> &amp;
<hi>Abihu</hi> had died in their beds, this
fauour had been allowed them,
the sorow of their father and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
for when GOD forbids
solemne mourning to his Priests,
ouer the dead, he excepts the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this neerenesse of bloud.
Now all Israel may mourne for
these two; onely the father and
brethren may not. God is iealous,
least their sorow should seeme to
countenance the sinne, which he
had punished: euen the fearfullest
acts of GOD must bee applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the heauiest hearts of the
faithfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:3791:103"/>
That which the father &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may not doe, the cozens are
commanded: Dead carcasses are
not for the presence of GOD;
His iustice was showne sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in killing them: They are now
fit for the graue, not the sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
Neither are they carried out
naked, but in their coats. It was
an vnusuall sight for Israell to see
a linnen Ephod vpon the beere;
The iudgement vvas so much
more remarkable, because they
had the badge of their calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their backs. Nothing is either
more pleasing vnto God, or more
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>modious to men, then that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
hee hath executed iudgement, it
should be seene and wondred at;
for therefore he strikes some, that
he may warne all.</p>

It was necessary we shold

Enuy was not wife enough to

Whether some secret &amp; emulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
brawles passed between <hi>Zip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porah</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3791:107"/>
choice of <hi>Moses,</hi> is now raised vp
to disparage Gods gifts in him; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in sight, the exceptions were
friuolous: Emulation is curious;
and out of the best person, or act,
will raise something to cauil at.</p>
                  <p>Seditions do not euer look the
same way they mooue; Wise men
can easily distinguish betwixt the
visor of actions, and the face. The
wife of <hi>Moses</hi> is mentioned, his
superiority is shot at. Pride is
lightly the ground of all sedition.
Which of their faces shined like
<hi>Moses?</hi> Yea, let him but haue
drawen his vaile, which of them
durst look on his face? Which of
them had fasted twise 40. dayes?
Which of them ascended vp to
the roppe of Sinai, and vvas hid
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3791:108"/>
with smoake, and fire? Which of
them receiued the Law twise in

own hand? And yet they dare say,
<hi>Hath God spoken onely by Moses?</hi>
They do not deny <hi>Moses</hi> his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but they challenge a part

in nature, so they would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
in dignity, equall in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
According to her name,
<hi>Miriam</hi> would bee exalted. And
yet how vnfit were they? One, a
woman, whom her sex debarred
from rule; the other a Priest,
whom his office sequestred from
earthly gouernment. Selfe-loue
makes men vnreasonable, and
teaches them to turne the glasse,
to see themselues bigger, others
lesse then they are. It is an hard

gladly to see his equalls lifted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

Nothing wil more try a mans

                  <p>As no wrong can escape God;
so least of all those which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
to Princes: He that made the
eare, needs no intelligence of our
tongues. Wee haue to doe with
a GOD, that is light of hearing;
wee cannot whisper any euill so
secretly, that hee should not cry
out of noyse; and what need wee
any further euidence, vvhen our

Without any delation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
GOD heares, and challenges
them. Because he was meek, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he complained not: Because
he was meek, &amp; complained not,
therefore the Lord struck in for
him, the more. The lesse a man
striues for himselfe, the more is
GOD his Champion. It is the
honour of great persons, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the patronage of their
clients: How much more vvill
GOD reuenge his Elect, which
cry to him, day and night? Hee
that said, <hi>I seeke not mine owne
glorie,</hi> addes, <hi>But there is one
that seekes it, and iudges.</hi> GOD
takes his part euer, that fights not
for himselfe.</p>

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:3791:109"/>
No man could haue giuen
more proofes of his courage,
then <hi>Moses.</hi> Hee slew the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;
Hee confronted <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
in his ovvne Court; Hee beat
the Midianite Shepheards; Hee
feared not the troopes of Egypt;
Hee durst looke GOD in the
face, amiddst all the terrours
of Sinai: and yet that Spirit,
vvhich made, and knevv his
heart<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> sayes, <hi>Hee vvas the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
man vpon earth.</hi> Mildnesse
and Fortitude may vvell lodge
together in one breast; to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the misconceits of those
men, that thinke none valiant,
but those that are fierce, and
cruell.</p>

No sooner is the word out of
<hi>Miriams</hi> mouth, then the word of
Gods reproofe meets it; How he
bestirres him, and will be at once
seene and heard, when the name
of <hi>Moses</hi> is in question! <hi>Moses</hi> was
zealously careful for Gods glory,
&amp; now God is zealous for his. The
remuneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of the almighty, are
infinitely gracious; Hee cannot
want honour, and patronage, that
seekes the honour of his Maker.
The ready way to true glorie, is
goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>GOD might haue spoken so
loud, that heauen &amp; earth should
haue heard it; so as they should
not haue needed to come foorth
for audience: but now, he calls
them out to the barre, that they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3791:110"/>
may be seene to heare. It did not
content him, to chide them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doores; the shame of their
fault had beene lesse in a priuate
rebuke: but the scandall of their
repining was publique. Where
the sinne is not afraid of the light,
God loues not the reproofe shold
be smothered.</p>
                  <p>They had depressed <hi>Moses,</hi>
GOD aduaunces him; They
had equalled themselues to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
God preferres him to them.
Their plea was, that God had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by them, as well as <hi>Moses:</hi>
Gods reply is, That hee hath in a
more entire fashion spoken to
<hi>Moses,</hi> then them. GOD spake
to the best of them, but either in
their dreame, sleeping; or in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3791:111"/>
vision, waking. But to <hi>Moses,</hi> hee
spake with more inward illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
with more liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation:

Wee cannot deuise to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Gods seruants, so much as by

                  <p>God was angry when he chode
them, but more angry when hee
departed. The withdrawing of
his presence, is the presence of
his wrath. Whiles he staies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue,
there is fauour in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
but when he leaues ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

hope, but of vengeance. The finall
absence of GOD, is hell it selfe.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3791:111"/>
When hee forsakes vs (tho for a

vtmost iudgement. It was time to
looke for a iudgement, when God
departed: so soone as hee is gone
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the eies of <hi>Miriam,</hi> the leprosy
appears in her face: her foul tong

she would acknowledge no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt her selfe, and her
brother <hi>Moses,</hi> euery Israelite now
sees his face glorious, hers le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous.
Deformity is a fit cure of
Pride. Because the venom of her
tongue, wold haue eaten into the
reputation of her brother, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a poysonous infection eates
into her flesh. Now both <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and <hi>Miriam,</hi> neede to vveare
a vayle: the one to hide his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
the other, her deformity. That

Midianite, <hi>Zipporah,</hi> vvhom shee

of her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Miriam</hi> was striken, <hi>Aaron</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
both sinned; his priesthood
could not rescue him; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his dignitie, did but adde
to the haynousnes of his sinne: his
repentance freed him; Alas, my
Lord, I beseech thee, lay not this
sin vpon vs, which we haue foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
committed. I wonder not
to see <hi>Aaron</hi> free, while I see him
penitent; This very confession sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him before, from bleeding
for Idolatry, which now preserues
him from leprosie, for his enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
repining. The vniuersall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
for all the iudgements of

that equalitie which was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
Beholde hee that so lately
made his brother his fellow, now

                     <hi>Miriam</hi> would haue wounded
<hi>Moses</hi> with her tongue; <hi>Moses</hi>
would heale her, with his <hi>O Lord
heale her now:</hi> The wrong is the
greater, because his sister did it.
He doth not say, I sought not her
shame, she sought mine; if God
haue reuenged it, I haue no reason
to looke on her, as a sister, who
lookt at mee, as an aduersarie:
But, as if her leprosie were his;
Hee cryes out for her cure. O
admirable meeknesse of <hi>Moses!</hi>
His people the Iewes rebelled
against him; GOD profers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge;
Hee would rather die,
then they should perish: His
Sister rebells against him; GOD
workes his reuenge: Hee will

                  <p>GODs Loue to <hi>Moses</hi> suffers
him not to obtaine presently his

If the Israelites hadde
gone on to Canaan,
without inquiry, their confidence
had possessed it: now they send
to espy the Land, sixe hundred
thousand of them neuer liued to
see it: And yet I see GOD in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
them to send; but inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, vppon their instance.
Some things GOD allowes, in
iudgement; Their importunitie,
and distrust extorted from God
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3791:115"/>
this occasion of their ouerthrow.
That which the Lord mooues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
prospers; but that which we
mooue him to, first, seldome suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.
VVhat needed they
doubt of the goodnesse of that
Land, which God tolde them did
flowe with milke and hony? What
needed they to doubt of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that, which God promised
to giue? When we will send forth
our senses to be our scouts in the
matters of faith, and rather dare
trust men, then God, we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be deceiued.</p>
                  <p>The basest sort of men are
commonlie held fit enough for
intelligencers; but <hi>Moses,</hi> to make
sure work, chooseth forth the best
of Israel, such as were like to be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3791:115"/>
most iudicious in their inquirie;
and most credible in their report.
Those that ruled Israel at home,
could best descry for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> abroad;
What should direct the body but
the head? Men can iudge but by
appearance; It is for him onely
that sees the euent, ere hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the meanes, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
It had beene better for
Israel to haue sent the offal of the
multitude: By how lesse the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of their persons is, by so much
lesse is the danger of seducement.
The errour of the mighty is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with authority, and in a sort
commaunds assent; whether in
good or euill, greatnes hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a traine to followe it at the

Forty dayes they spent in this
search; and this cowardly vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
in the search, shall cost them
forty yeeres delay of the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Who can abide to see the
rulers of Israel so basely timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous?
They commend the Land,
the fruit commends it selfe, and
yet they plead difficulty: <hi>Wee be
not able to goe vp.</hi> Their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are laden with the grapes;
and yet their hearts are ouerlaid
with vnbeliefe: It is an vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
thing to plead hardnes of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuing,
where the benefit will
more then requite the indeuour.
Our Land of Promise is aboue;
we knowe the fruit therof is sweet
and glorious; the passage difficult.
The giantly sonnes of <hi>Anak</hi> (the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3791:116"/>
powers of darknesse) stand in our
way: If wee sit downe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
we shall once knowe, that
without shall be the fearefull.</p>
                  <p>See the idle pleas of distrust;
<hi>We are not able: They are stronger.</hi>
Could not God inable them? was
he not stronger then their giants?
Had he not promised to displace
the Canaanites, to settle them in
their stead? How much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is it for vs to spy their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
then for them to espy the
strength of their aduersaries:
When wee measure our spirituall
successe by our owne power, we
are vanquished, before we fight:
Hee that would ouercome, must
neither look vpon his owne arme,
nor the arme of his enemy, but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3791:117"/>
the mouth, and hand of him, that
hath promised, and can performe.
Who are we flesh and blood, with
our breath in our nostrills, that
we should fight with Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
powers, spirituall wickednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in heauenly places? The match
is too vnequall; wee are not like
grashoppers, to these giants;
when we compare our selues with
them, how can we but despaire?
when wee compare them with
God, how can we be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
Hee that hath brought vs
into this fielde, hath promised
vs victory. GOD knew their
strength, ere hee offered to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
vs.</p>
                  <p>Well might they haue thought,
Were not the Amalekites stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

beat them downe? were not the

Did not Death come running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vs in their chariots? Did wee
not leaue these buryed in the sea,
the other vnburied in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Whence had the Anakims
their strength, but from him, that
bids vs goe vp against them? Why
haue the bodies of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
taken possession of their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,
but for vs? But now, their
feare hath not left them so much
reason as to compare their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
with others, but onely with
themselues: Doubtlesse these gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
were mighty, but their feare
hath stretched them out some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3791:118"/>
beyond their stature. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
makes our dangers greater,
and our helps lesse then they are,
and forecasts euer woorse, then
shall be; and if euills be possible,
it makes them certaine.</p>
                  <p>Amongst those twelue messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
whom our second <hi>Moses</hi> sent
through the Land of Promise,
there was but one <hi>Iudas;</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those twelue, which the
former <hi>Moses</hi> addressed through
the same Land, there is but one
<hi>Caleb:</hi> and yet those were chosen
out of the meanest; these, out of
the heads of Israel. As there is no
societie free from some corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
so it is hard, if in a community

We shall wrong GOD, if we

to serue himselfe of the best, if the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioshua</hi> was silent, and wisely
spared his tongue for a further

I doe not heare him say, Who am
I to striue with a multitude? What
can <hi>Ioshua</hi> and I doe against ten

True Christian fortitude tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vs not to regard the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or quality of the opponents,
but the equitie of the cause; and
cares not to stand alone, &amp; chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
all commers: and if it could
be opposed by as many worlds,
as men, it may be ouerborne, but
it cannot be daunted: Whereas
popularitie carryes weak minds,
and teaches them the safety of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with a multitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caleb</hi> saw the giantly Anakims,
and the walled citties, as well as
the rest; and yet he saies, <hi>Let vs go
vp and possesse it:</hi> As if it were no
more, but to go, and see, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.
Faith is couragious, and
makes nothing of those dangers,
wherewith others are quayled.</p>

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:3791:119"/>
It is very materiall with what
eyes we looke vpon all obiects.
Feare doth not more multiply e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills,
then faith diminisheth them;
which is therefore bold, because
either it sees not, or contemnes
that terrour, which feare repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to the weake. There is none
so valiant, as the beleeuer.</p>
                  <p>It had beene happy for Israel,
if <hi>Calebs</hi> counsell had beene as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,
as good: But how easily
haue these rulers discouraged a
faint-hearted people? In stead of
lifting vp their ensignes, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
towards Canaan; They sit
them down, &amp; lift vp their voice,
and cry; The roddes of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
task-maisters had neuer
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3791:120"/>
beene so fit for them, as now, for
crying. They had cause indeed
to weep for the sinne of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity:
but now they weep for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feare
of those enemies they saw
not. I feare if there had beene ten
<hi>Calebs</hi> to perswade, and but two
faint spies to discourage them;
those two cowards would haue
preuailed against those tenne so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors:
How much more, now
ten oppose, &amp; but two incourage?
An easie Rhetorick drawes vs to
the worse part; yea it is hard not
to runne downe the hill. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of euill is so much stronger
in our nature, then that of Good,
that euery least motion preuailes
for the one; scarce any suite for

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:3791:120"/>
Now is <hi>Moses</hi> in danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all the cost; and care, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he bestowed vpon Israel: His
people are already gone backe
to Egypt, in their hearts; and
their bodies are returning. Oh

To giue you a rich coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
without resistance? Are not

Can yee hope for lesse from the

to wish to die for feare of death:
Is there lesse hope from your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that shall be, when ye goe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3791:121"/>
vnder strong, and expert leaders,
then from the enemies that were,
when yee shall returne maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse?
Can those cruell Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
so soone haue forgotten the

brothers, husbands, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished

rather trust the mercy of knowne

yee returne? Who shall diuide
the Sea for you? Who shall fetch
you water out of the Rocke? Or
can ye hope that the Manna of

                  <p>It had beene time for the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites

but when wee consider the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3791:122"/>
wee cannot but contemne those

therefore, but goe before vs in

for vs in your prayers. But now
contrarily, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> fall

And yet, as if hee could

that they would stay. We haue

The sweetnesse of
GODs Law, and our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

glory is such, as should draw

I doubt vvhether they vvould

                  <p>Though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

Such hath been euer the thanks

I see the Leuites, not long
since, drawing their swords for
GOD and <hi>Moses,</hi> against the
rest of Israel; and that fact winnes
them, both praise and blessing:
Now, they are the forwardest in
the rebellion against <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron,</hi> men of their owne Tribe.
There is no assurance of a man,
for one act: whom one Sinne
cannot fasten vpon, another may.
Yea the same sinne may finde a
repulse one while, from the same
hand, which another time giues
it entertainment: and that yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
loses the thank of all the
former resistance. It is no praise
to haue done once well, vnlesse
we continue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:3791:125"/>
Outward priuiledges of blood
can auaile nothing, against a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calling of GOD: These
Reubenites had the right of the
naturall primogeniture; yet doe
they vainely challenge preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
where GOD hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
them. If all ciuill honour
flowe from the King, how much
more from the GOD of Kings?
His hand exalts the poore, and
casts down the mighty from their
throne. The man that will be
lifting vp himselfe, in the pride of
his heart, from vnder the foot of
God, is iustly troden in the dust.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> is the Prince of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell;
<hi>Aaron</hi> the Priest: <hi>Moses</hi> was
milde; <hi>Aaron</hi> popular, yet
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3791:126"/>
both are conspired against: Their
places are no lesse brothers, then
their persons. Both are opposed
at once; Hee that is a traytor to
the Church, is a traytor to the
King. Any superiority is a marke
of Enuy. Had <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
beene but fellowes with the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
none had been better belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
their dispositions were such,
as must needs haue forced fauor,
from the indifferent: now they
were aduanced, their malice is not
inferior to their honor. High tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
must looke for lightnings; we
offer not to vndermine but those
wals, which we cannot scale. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in euery man is both enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and disdainful; &amp; neuer loues
to honor another, but where it
may be an honor to it selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:3791:126"/>
There cannot be conceiued an
honor lesse worth emulation, then
this principality of Israel; A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that could giue nothing; a
people that had nothing, but in
hope; a people whom their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was faine to feed with bread,
and water; which paid him no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
but of ill wordes; whose
command was nothing but a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
and yet this dignity was an
eye-sore to these Leuites and
these Rubenites; <hi>Ye take too much
vpon you, yee Sons of Leui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this challenge (though
thus vnseasonable) hath drawen
in, two hundred and fifty Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of Israel. What wonder is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3791:127"/>
it, that the tenne rulers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
so much with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to disswade them from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;
when three traytors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
thus with 250. rulers,
famous in the Congregation<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and men of renowne? One man
may kindle such a fire, as all the
vvorld cannot quench: One
plague-sore may infect a whole
kingdome: The infection of euill
is much worse then the act.</p>
                  <p>It is not like, these leaders of
Israell could erre without follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
He is a mean man that drawes
not some Clients, after him. It
hath bin euer a dangerous policy
of Satan, To assault the best: hee
knowes that the multitude (as we
say of Bees) wil follow their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:3791:127"/>
Nothing can bee more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the vulgar sort, then to
heare their gouernours taxed,
and themselues flattered. <hi>All the
Congregation is holy; Euery one of
them; Wherefore lift yee vp your
selues?</hi> Euery word is a falshood.
For <hi>Moses</hi> deiected himself (<hi>Who
am I?</hi>) GOD lifted him vp, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Israel: And so was Israel holy,
as <hi>Moses</hi> was ambitious. What
holinesse was there in so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
feare, Idolatry, mutinie,
disobedience? What could make
them vncleane, if this were holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
They had scarce wip't their
mouthes, or washt their hands,
since their last obstinacy: and yet
these pick-thanks, say, <hi>All Israell
is holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:3791:128"/>
I would neuer desire a better
proofe of a false teacher, then flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
True meaning neede not
vphold it selfe by soothing. There
is nothing easier, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men well of themselues;
when a mans self-loue meets with
anothers flattery, it is an hy praise
that will not be belieued. It was
more out of opposition, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
that these men plead the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
of Israel. Violent aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to vphold a side, will maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
those things, they belieue
not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> argues not for himselfe,
but appeales to GOD; neither
speakes for his owne right, but
his brother <hi>Aarons:</hi> He knew, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3791:128"/>
Gods immediate seruice vvas
woorthy to bee more precious,
then his gouernment: That, his
Princedome serued but to the
glory of his Maister. Good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are more tender, ouer
Gods honour, then their owne;
and are more sensible of the
wrongs offred to religion, then
to themselues.</p>
                  <p>It is safest to trust God with his
owne causes. If <hi>Aaron</hi> had beene
chosen, by Israel, <hi>Moses</hi> would
haue sheltred him vnder their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
Now that GOD did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
appoint him, his patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
is sought, whose the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was. We may easily fault in the
menaging of diuine affaires; and
so our want of successe, cannot
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3791:129"/>
want sin; He knowes how to vse,
how to blesse his own meanes.</p>
                  <p>As there was a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the people, and Leuites, so
betwixt the Leuites, and Priests.
The GOD of order, loues to
haue our degrees kept. Whiles
the Leuites would be looking vp
to the Priests, <hi>Moses</hi> sends downe
their eyes, to the people. The
way not to repine at those aboue
vs, is to looke at those below vs.
There is no better remedy for
ambition, then to cast vp our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
receyts, and to compare
them with our deseruings, and to
conferre our owne estate with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours:
So shall wee finde cause
to be thankfull, that wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
any, rather then of enuie,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3791:129"/>
that any is aboue vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> hath chid the sonnes of
<hi>Leui,</hi> for mutining against <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
and so much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were of his own Tribe:
now, hee sends for the Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
vvhich rose against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
They come not, and their
message is worse, then their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
<hi>Moses</hi> is accused of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
crueltie, falshood, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie,
vsurpation; and Egypt
it selfe must bee commended, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then <hi>Moses</hi> shall vvant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche.
Innocencie is no shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from ill tongues; Malice
neuer regards hovv true any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
is, but hovv spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:3791:130"/>
Now it was time for <hi>Moses</hi> to be
angry. They durst not haue been
thus bold, if they had not seen his
mildnesse. Lenity is ill bestowed
vpon stubburne natures: It is an
iniurious senselesnesse, not to feel
the wounds of our reputation. It
well appeares he is angry, when he
prayes against them. He was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
before; but when he was
most bitter against them, hee still
pray'd for them: but now, hee
bends his very prayers against
them. <hi>Looke not to their offering.</hi>
There can be no greater reuenge,
then the imprecation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
There can bee no greater
iudgement, then Gods reiection
of our seruices. With vs men, what
more argues dislike of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
then the turning back of his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3791:130"/>
present? What will GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
from vs, if not prayers?</p>
                  <p>The innocence of <hi>Moses</hi> calls
for reuenge on his Aduersaries.
If hee had wronged them in his
gouernment, in vaine should hee
haue looked to Gods hand, for
right. Our sinnes exclude vs from
Gods protection; whereas vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
challenges, and findes
his patronage. An asse taken, had
made him vncapable of fauour.
Corrupt Gouernours, lose the
comfort of their owne brest, and
the tuition of God.</p>
                  <p>The same tongue that prayed
against the Conspirators, prayes
for the people. As lewd men
thinke to carry it with number;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3791:131"/>
                     <hi>Corah</hi> had so farre preuailed, that
hee had drawne the multitude to
his side. GOD, the auenger of
treasons, would haue consumed
them all, at once: <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
pray for their rebels. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were vvoorthy of
death, and nothing but death
could stoppe their mouthes; yet
their mercifull Leaders vvill not
buy their owne peace, with the
losse of such enemies. Oh rare
and imitable mercy! The people
rise vp against their Gouernors;
Their Gouernours fall on their
faces to God, for the people:
So far are they from plotting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
that they will not indure
God should reuenge for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> knew wel enough, that all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3791:131"/>
those Israelites must perish in the
Wildernesse; GOD had vow'd
it, for their former insurrection:
yet how earnestly doth hee sue
to GOD, not to consume them
at once! The very respite of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills,
is a fauour next to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corah</hi> kindled the fire; the two
hundred and fiftie Captaines
brought sticks to it; All Israel
warm'd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selues by it; onely the
incendiaries perish. Now doe the
Israelites owe their life to them,
whose death they intended. God,
&amp; <hi>Moses</hi> knowe to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the heads of a faction, &amp; the
train: though neither be faultless,
yet the one is plagued, the other
forgiuen. Gods vengeance when
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3791:132"/>
it is at the hotest, makes differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces
of men. <hi>Get you away from about
the Tabernacles of Corah.</hi> Euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
common iudgements, there
is a separation. In the vniuersall
iudgement of all the earth, the
Iudge himselfe will separate: in
these particular executions, wee
must separate our selues. The so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of wicked men, especially
in their sinnes, is mortally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
whiles wee will not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how can we complaine if we
be enwrapped in their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
Our very company sins
with them; why should wee not
smart with them also?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> had well hoped, that
when these rebels should see all
the Israelites runne from them, as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3791:132"/>
from monsters, and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightedly
vpon their Tents, and
should heare that fearfull procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of vengeance, against
them, (howsoeuer they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
set a face on their conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
yet now) their hearts would
haue misgiuen. But loe, these
bold Traytors stand impudently
staring in the doore of their tents,
as if they would out-face the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
of GOD; As if <hi>Moses</hi> had
neuer wrought miracle before
them; As if no one Israelite had
euer bledde for rebelling. Those
that shall perish, are blinded.
Pride and infidelity obdures the
hart, and makes euen cowards
fearelesse.</p>
                  <p>So soone as the innocent are
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3791:133"/>
seuered, the guilty perish: the
earth cleaues, and swallowes vp
the rebels. This element was not
vsed to such morsels: It deuoures
the carcasses of men; but bodies
informed with liuing soules, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
before. To haue seene them
struck dead vpon the earth, had
been fearfull: but to see the earth
at once their executioner, and
graue, was more horrible. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Sea, nor the Earth, are fit
to giue passage; The sea is moist
and flowing, and will not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
for the continuitie of it;
The earth is dry and massie, and
will neither yeeld naturally, nor
meet againe, when it hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
yet the waters did cleaue to
giue way vnto Israel, for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation;
the earth did cleaue,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3791:133"/>
to giue vvay to the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
in iudgement: Both Sea,
and Earth, did shut their iawes
againe vpon the aduersaries of
GOD.</p>
                  <p>There vvas more vvonder in
this latter. It was a maruell that
the vvaters opened: it vvas no
wonder that they shutte againe;
for, the retyring and flowing,
was naturall. It was no lesse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
that the earth opened; but
more maruell that it did shutte
againe, because it had no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
disposition to meet, when
it vvas diuided. Now might Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
see, they had to doe with
a GOD, that could reuenge
with ease.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:3791:134"/>
There were two sorts of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
the earth swallowed vp the
one the fire, the other. All the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
agree to serue the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their Maker. <hi>Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu,</hi> brought fit persons, but
vnfit fire to GOD; These Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites
bring the right fire, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted
persons, before him:
Fire from GOD consumes both.
It is a dangerous thing to vsurpe
sacred functions. The ministery
will not grace the man; The man
may disgrace the ministery.</p>
                  <p>The common people were
not so fast gathered to <hi>Corahs</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
perswasion before, as now
they ran from the sight, and feare
of his iudgment. I maruell not,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3791:134"/>
if they could not trust that earth,
whereon they stood, whiles they
knew their harts had bin false.
It is a madnesse to runne
away from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not
from sin.</p>

it not, which are wilfully sinfull:
wee men reueale not our secret
purposes either to enemies or
strangers; all their fauour is to
feele the plague ere they can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> though hee were great
with God, yet he takes not vpon
him this reconciliation; he may
aduise <hi>Aaron</hi> what to doe, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vndertakes not to act it: It
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3791:140"/>
is the worke of the Priesthood, to
make an atonement for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<hi>Aaron</hi> was first his brothers
tongue to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> now he is the
peoples tongue to God: He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
must offer vp the incense of the
publique prayers to God. Who
would not thinke it a small thing
to hold a Censer in his hand? yet
if any other had done it, hee had
fallen with the dead, and not
stood betwixt the liuing and dead;
in stead of the smoke ascending,
the fire had descended vppon
him: And shall there be lesse vse,
or lesse regard of the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ministery, then the Legall?
When the world hath powred out
all his contempt, we are they, that
must reconcile men to God; and
without vs, they perish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:3791:140"/>
I knowe not whether more to
maruell at the courage, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Aaron:</hi> His mercy, that hee
vvould yet saue so rebellious a
people; his courage, that hee
would saue them, with so great a
danger of himselfe. For, as one
that would part a fray, he thrusts
himselfe vnder the strokes of
God; and puts it to the choise of
the reuenger, whether hee will
smite him, or forbeare the rest;
He stands boldly betwixt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and the dead, as one that wil
eyther die vvith them, or haue
them liue vvith him; the sight
of fourteene hundred carcasses
dismayd him not; hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
feared the threats of the
people, novv feares not the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3791:141"/>
strokes of GOD: It is not for
Gods ministers, to stand vpon
their owne perils, in the common
causes of the Church: Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
must oppose the iudgements
of the Almighty; When the fire
of Gods anger is kindled, their
Censers must smoke with fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the altar. Euery Christian must
pray for the remouall of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
how much more they, whom
God hath appointed to mediate
for his people. Euerie mans
mouth is his owne: but they are
the mouthes of all.</p>
                  <p>Had <hi>Aaron</hi> thrust in himselfe
with empty hands, I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hadde preuailed; now
his Censer was his protection;
When wee come vvith suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3791:141"/>
in our handes, vvee
neede not feare the strokes of
GOD. We haue leaue to resist
the diuine iudgements by our
prayers, with fauour and successe:
So soone as the incense of <hi>Aaron</hi>
ascended vp vnto God, he smelt
a sauour of rest; hee will rather
spare the offenders, then strike
their intercessor. How hardly can
any people miscarry, that haue
faithfull ministers to sue for their
safetie? Nothing but the smoke
of heartie prayers can cleanse the
ayre from the plagues of God.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Aarons</hi> sacrifice were thus
accepted; how much more shall
the hy-priest of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by interposing himselfe
to the wrath of his father, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3791:142"/>
the offenders from death?
The plague was entred vpon all
the sonnes of men: O Sauiour,
thou stood'st betwixt the liuing,
and the dead, that all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in thee, should not perish.
<hi>Aaron</hi> offered and was not stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
but thou, O Redeemer,
wouldst offer and be strooke, that
by thy stripes wee might be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
So stood'st thou betwixt the
dead and liuing, that thou wert
both aliue and dead; and all this,
that wee, when wee were dead,
might liue for euer.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more troubled Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
then a feare least the two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
should cunningly ingrosse
the gouernment to themselues.
If they hadde done so, what wise
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3791:142"/>
men would haue enuied them an
office so little worth, so deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purchased? But because this
conceit was euer apt to stirre
them to rebellion, and to hinder
the benefit of this holy souerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
therefore God hath indeuor'd
nothing more, then to let them
see that these officers, whom they
so much enuied, were of his owne
proper institution: They hadde
scarce shut their eyes since they
saw the confusion of those two
hundred and fifty vsurping sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
and <hi>Aarons</hi> effectuall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for staying the plague of
Israell. In the one, the execution
of GODs vengeance vpon the
competitors of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for his
sake. In the other, the forbearance
of vengeance vpon the people
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3791:143"/>
for <hi>Aarons</hi> mediation, might
haue challenged their voluntary
acknowledgement of his iust cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from God; If there had been
in them either awe, or thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they could not haue doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his lawfull supremacy.
How could they choose but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
thus. Why would God so
fearefully haue destroyed the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualls
that durst contest with <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
if hee would haue allowed
him any equall? Wherefore serue
those plates of the Altar, which
wee see made of those vsurped
Censers, but to warne all poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of such presumption? Why
should God cease striking, whiles
<hi>Aaron</hi> interposed betwixt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and the dead, if he were but
as one of vs? Which of vs if wee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3791:143"/>
had stood in the plague, had not
added to the heap? Incredulous
mindes will not bee perswaded
with any euidence. These two
brothers had liued asunder for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeers; GOD makes them both
meet in one office of deliuering
Israel. One halfe of the miracles
were wrought by <hi>Aaron;</hi> he stroke
with the rodde, whiles it brought
those plagues on Egypt. The
Israelites heard GOD call him
vppe by name, to mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;
They saw him anointed
from GOD: and (least they
should thinke this a set match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the brethren) they saw the
earth opening, the fire issuing
from GOD vpon their emulous
opposites: they saw his smoke a
sufficient antidote for the plague
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3791:144"/>
of GOD; and yet still <hi>Aarons</hi>
calling is questioned. Nothing is
more naturall to euery man, then
vnbeleefe; but the earth neuer
yeelded a people so strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous,
as these; and after so
many thousand generations their
children doe inherit their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy;
still doe they oppose the
true high-priest, the anointed of
GOD: sixteene hundred yeers
desolation hath not drawen from
them to confesse him whom God
hath chosen.</p>
                  <p>How desirous was GOD to
giue satisfaction euen to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate!
There is nothing more
materiall, then that men should
be assured their spirituall guides
haue their commission and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3791:144"/>
from GOD: The vvant
whereof is a preiudice to our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
It should not be so: but
the corruption of men will not
not receiue good, but from due
messengers.</p>
                  <p>Before, GOD wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the rod of <hi>Moses;</hi> now, in
the rodde of <hi>Aaron.</hi> As <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
might see himselfe in <hi>Moseses</hi> rod;
who of a rodde of defence and
protection was turned into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
serpent: So Israel might
see themselues, in the rod of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
Euery Tribe and euery Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite
was, of himselfe, as a sere
stick, without life, without sap;
and if any one of them had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to liue, and flourish, he must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
power, and gift of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:3791:145"/>
Before Gods calling all men
are alike: Euery name is alike
written in their rod; there is no
difference in the letters, in the
wood; neither the characters of
<hi>Aaron</hi> are fayrer, nor the staffe
more precious; It is the choise of
God that makes the distinction:
So it is in our calling of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
All are equally deuoid of
the possibility of grace, all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
liuelesse; by nature we all are
sonnes of wrath: If we be now
better then others, who separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vs? We are all crab-stocks in
this orchard of God, hee may
graffe what fruit he pleases, vpon
vs; onely the grace and effectuall
calling of God makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:3791:145"/>
These twelue heads of Israel,
would neuer haue written their
names in their rods, but in hope
they might be chosen to this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
What an honour was this
Priesthood, whereof all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Israel are ambitious? If
they had not thought it an high
preferment, they had neuer so
much enuyed the office of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
What shall wee thinke of this
change? Is the Euangelicall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of lesse worth then the
Leuiticall? Whiles the Testament
is better, is the seruice worse?
How is it that the great thinke
themselues too good for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment?
How is it, that vnder
the Gospell, men are disparaged
with that, which honoured them
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3791:146"/>
vnder the Law; that their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and our scorne, meete in one
subiect.</p>
                  <p>These twelue rods are not laid
vp in the seuerall cabinets of their
owners, but are brought forth, &amp;
layd before the Lord. It is fitte
God should make choyce of his
owne attendants. Euen wee men
hold it iniurious, to haue seruants
obtruded vpon vs, by others: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall that man haue comfort
in his ministery, whom God hath
not chosen. The great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the world, hath set euerie
man in his station; To one hee
hath said, Stand thou in this tower
and watch; To another<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Make
thou good these Trenches; To a
third, Digge thou in this Mine.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3791:146"/>
Hee that giues, and knowes our
abilities, can best sette vs on
worke.</p>
                  <p>This rod was the pastorall staffe
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the great Shepheard of
Israel. God testifies his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his charge, by the fruit.
That a rod cut off from the tree,
should blossome, it was strange;
but that in one night, it should
beare buds, blossoms, fruit, &amp; that
both ripe and hard, it was highlie
miraculous. The same power that
reuiues the dead plants of winter,
in the Spring, doth it heere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
earth, without time, without
sunne; that Israel might see and
grant, it was no reason, his
choyce should be limited, whose
power is vnlimited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:3791:147"/>
Fruitfulnesse is the best argument
of the calling of GOD: Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the plants of his setting, but
the very boughes cut off from the
body of them, will flourish. And
that there may not want a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of increase, heere are fruite,
blossoms, buds; both proofe and
hope, inseparably mixed.</p>
                  <p>It could not but bee a great
comfort vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> to see his
rodde thus miraculously flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
to see this wonderfull Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Gods fauour, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection:
Sure hee could not but
thinke; Who am I, O GOD, that
thou shouldest thus choose mee
out of all the Tribes of Israel? My
weakenesse hath been more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of thy rodde of correction,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3791:147"/>
then my rod hath beene worthy
of these blossoms. How hast thou
magnified mee, in the sight of all
thy people? How able art thou
to vphold my imbecillitie with
the rodde of thy support? how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to defend me with the rodde
of thy power, who hast thus
brought fruite out of the saplesse
rod of my profession? That ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of GOD is worthy to faint,
that holds it not a sufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
to see the euident
proofes of his Maisters fauour.</p>
                  <p>Commonly, those fruites which
are soone ripe, soone wither; but
these almonds of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, are
not more early, then lasting: the
same hand which brought them
out before their time, preserued
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3791:148"/>
them, beyond their time; and for
perpetuall memory, both rod and
fruit must be kept in the Arke of
God. The tables of <hi>Moses,</hi> the rod
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Manna of God, are
monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts fit for so holy a shrine.
The doctrine, sacraments, &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
of Gods people, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to him, &amp; must be so to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.
All times shall see &amp; wonder, how
his ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t Church was fed, taught,
ruled. <hi>Moses</hi> his rod did great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
yet I find it not in the Ark.
The rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> hath this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
because it caried the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
stil in it selfe; whereas the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of that other rod were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Those monuments wold God
haue continued in his church, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
cary in them the most manifest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidences
of that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they import.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:3791:148"/>
The same God, which by many
transient demonstrations had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
the calling of <hi>Aaron</hi> to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
will now haue a permanent
memoriall of their conviction;
that whensoeuer they should see
this relique, they should be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their presumption, &amp; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
The name of <hi>Aaron</hi> vvas
not more plainly written in that
rod, then the sinne of Israel was in
the fruit of it; and how much Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
findes their rebellion beaten
with this rod, appears in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
relenting, &amp; complaint; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
we are dead, wee perish.</hi> God
knowes how to pull downe the
biggest stomach, and can extort
glory to his own Name, from the
most obstinate gainsayers.</p>

                  <p>It was first their way that makes

They had sent intreaties to

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3791:150"/>
It was churlishly deny'd them. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi>

They will not goe the nearest

What will become of thee, O Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to death. He that brought the
quailes thither to feed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, fetches
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3791:153"/>
these Serpents thither to punish
them. While we are at warres with
God, we can looke for no peace
with his creatures: Euery thing
reioyces to execute the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Maker. The stones of
the field wil not be in league with
vs, while we are not in league with
GOD.</p>
                  <p>These men, when the spies had
tolde them newes of the giants of
Canaan, a little before had wished,
<hi>Would GOD we were dead in this
Wildernesse:</hi> Now GOD hath
heard their praiers; what with the
plague, what with the serpents,
many thousands of them dyed.
The ill wishes of our impatience
are many times heard; As those
good things are not granted vs,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3791:153"/>
which we pray for, without care;
so those euils which we pray for,
and would not haue, are oft gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The eares of God are not
onely open to the prayers of faith,
but to the imprecations of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
It is daungerous wishing
euill to our selues, or ours; It is
iust with GOD to take vs at our
word, and to effect that, which
our lippes speake against our
heart.</p>
                  <p>Before, God hath euer consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Moses;</hi> and threatned, ere
he punisht: now hee strikes, and
sayes nothing. The anger is so
much more, by how much lesse
notifyed. When God is not heard
before he is felt, (as in hewing of
wood, the blowe is not heard, till
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3791:154"/>
the axe be seen to haue strooke)
it is a fearefull signe of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
It is with God, as with vs
men, that still reuenges are euer
most dangerous. Till now, all
was well enough with Israel, and
yet they grudged; Those that will
complaine without a cause, shall
haue cause to complain for som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Discontented humors sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
scape vnpunished; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that most iustly wherat they
repined vniustly.</p>
                  <p>Now the people are glad to
seeke to <hi>Moses</hi> vnbidden. Euer
heeretofore, they haue beene
wont to be sued too, and intreated
for without their owne intreaty;
Now, their misery makes them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate:
There neede no soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3791:154"/>
vvhere there is sense of
smart. It were pittie, men should
want affliction; since it sends them
to their prayers, and confessions.
All the perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of <hi>Moses</hi> could
not doe that which the serpents
haue done for him. O GOD;
thou seest how necessary it is wee
should be stung sometimes: else
we should runne vvilde, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come to a sound humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
vvee should neuer seeke
thee, if thy hand did not finde
vs out.</p>
                  <p>They had spoken against God,
and <hi>Moses;</hi> And now they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
speake to <hi>Moses,</hi> that hee
would pray to GOD for them.
He that so oft prayd for them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
cannot but much more
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3791:155"/>
doe it requested; and now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the meanes of their cure.
It was equally in the power of
God, to remoue the serpents; and
to heale their stinging; To haue
cured the Israelites by his word,
and by his signe: But he findes it
best for his people (to exercise
their faith) that the serpents may
bite, and their bitings may inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome,
and that this venome may
indanger the Israelites; and that
they, thus affected, may seeke to
him for remedy; and seeking may
find it, from such means, as should
haue no power, but in significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
That while their bodies were
cured by the signe, their soules
might be confirmed, by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
signified. A serpent of brasse
could no more heale, then sting
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3791:155"/>
them. What remedy could their
eyes giue to their legs? Or what
could a serpent of cold brasse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
against a liuing and fiery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?
In this troublesome desert,
we are all stung by that fiery and
old Serpent; O Sauiour, it is to
thee, we must looke, and be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
It is thou that wert their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
Lamb, their Manna, their
Rock, their Serpent. To all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
dost thou vary thy selfe to
thy Church, that wee may finde
thee euery-where: Thou art for
our nourishment, refreshing, cure;
as hereafter, so euen now, all in all.</p>
                  <p>This serpent which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for cure to Israell, at last stings
them to death, by idolatrous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse:
What poyson there is in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3791:156"/>
that makes euen Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes
deadly! As <hi>Moses</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
raised this serpent, so <hi>Ezekias</hi>
pulld it down: God commanded
the raysing of it, God approv'd
the demolishing of it. Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
vse can marre the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of God: how much
more the most wise and
wel-grounded deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

If they had not seene

                  <p>
                     <hi>Balac</hi> and his Moabites had wit
enough to feare, not witte e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to preuent iudgement:
They see an enemy in their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and yet take no right course
for their safety. Who would not
haue looked, that they should haue
come to Israel, vvith conditions of
peace? Or, Why did they not
thinke; Either Israels GOD is
stronger, then ours, or hee is not.
If he be not, why are wee afraide of
him? If hee be, Why doe we not
serue him? The same hand which
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3791:157"/>
giues them victory, can giue vs
protection. Carnal men, that are
secure of the vengeance of God,
ere it doe come, are mastered with
it, when it dooth come; and not
knowing which way to turn them,
run forth at the wrong doore.</p>
                  <p>The Midianites ioyne with the
Moabites, in consultation, in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against Israel. One would
haue thought, they should haue
looked for fauour from <hi>Moses,</hi> for
<hi>Iethroes</hi> sake; which was both
a Prince of their Country, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law to <hi>Moses;</hi> and either
now, or not long before, was with
Israel in the Wildernesse. Neither
is it like, but that <hi>Moses</hi> hauing
found fortie yeeres harbour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, would haue beene
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3791:158"/>
(what hee might) inclinable to
fauourable treaties, with them:
but now, they are so fast lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to <hi>Moab,</hi> that they will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinke, or swimme together;
Intirenesse vvith vvicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts
is one of the strongest
chaynes of Hell, and bindes vs
to a participation both of sin, and
punishment: An easie occasion
wil knit wicked hearts together, in
conspiracy against the Church of
God.</p>
                  <p>Their errand is diuelish (<hi>Come,
curse Israel:</hi>) That which Satan
could not doe by the swords of
<hi>Og,</hi> and <hi>Sehon,</hi> he will now try
to effect, by the tongue of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam.</hi>
If either strength, or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
would preuaile against Gods
Church, it could not stand. And
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3791:158"/>
why should not we be as industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to promote the glory of God,
and bend both our hands &amp; heads
to the causes of the Almighty?
When all helps faile <hi>Moab,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician
is sought too. It is a signe of
a desperate cause, to make Satan
either our counsellor, or our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
                  <p>Why did they not send to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
to blesse themselues rather,
then to curse Israel? It had beene
more easie to be defended from
the hurt of their enemies, then to
haue their enemies laid open to
be hurt by them. Pride and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
did not care so much for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as for conquest: It would not
content them to escape Israel, if
Israel may escape them; It was not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3791:159"/>
thank-worthy, to saue their owne
blood, if they did not spill the
blood of others; As if their owne
prosperitie had beene nothing,
if Israell also prospered. If there
bee one proiect worse then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
a wicked heart will finde it
out. Nothing but destruction wil
content the malicious.</p>
                  <p>I knowe not whether <hi>Balaam</hi>
were more famous, or <hi>Balac</hi> more
confident. If the King had not
beene perswaded of the strength
of his charme, hee had not sent
so farre, and payd so deare, for it;
now hee trusts more to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment,
then to the forces
of <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Midian:</hi> and (as if
heauen, and earth vvere in the
power of a charmers tongue) hee
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3791:159"/>
saith, <hi>Hee that thou blessest, is
blessed; and hee whom thou cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
is cursed:</hi> Magick, through
the permission of God, is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
for, whatsoeuer the Diuell
can doe, the Magician may doe:
but, it is madnes to thinke ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them omnipotent. If ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the curses of men, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours
of the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
should bee effectuall, all
would be Hell. No, <hi>Balac:</hi> So
short is the power of thy <hi>Balaam,</hi>
that neither thou, nor thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
himselfe, can auoide that
curse, which thou would'st haue
brought vpon Israel. Had <hi>Balaam</hi>
been a true Prophet of God, this
bold assurance had been but iust;
Both those ancient <hi>Seers,</hi> and the
Prophets of the Gospell haue the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3791:160"/>
ratification of God in heauen, to
their sentences on earth. Why
haue we less care of the blessings,
and lesse feare of the curses and
censures of Gods ministers? Who
would not rather haue <hi>Elishaes</hi>
guard, then both the Kings of
Israel, and Assyria? Hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
as hee hadde the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
chariots and horsemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, so was hee the chariots
and horsemen of Israel: Why
should our faith bee lesse strong,
then superstition? Or why should
GODs agents haue lesse vertue
then Satans?</p>
                  <p>I should wonder to heare God
speake with a false Prophet, if
I did not knowe it hath beene
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3791:160"/>
no rare thing with him (as with
men) to bestowe wordes, euen
where he will not bestowe fauour.
<hi>Pharaoh, Abimelech, Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
receiue visions from GOD:
neither can I think this strange,
when I heare GOD speaking to
Satan, in a question no lesse fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
then this of <hi>Balaam; Whence
comst thou Satan.</hi> Not the sound
of the voice of GOD, but the
matter which hee speakes, argues
loue: He may speake to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
hee speakes peace to none,
but his owne. It is a vaine brag,
GOD hath spoken to mee? So
may he do to reprobates, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
but what said he? Did he say
to my soule, I am thy saluation;
Hath he indented with me that he
will be my God, &amp; I shall be his?
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3791:161"/>
I cannot heare this voyce and
not liue.</p>
                  <p>God heard all the consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and message of these Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites;
These messengers could not
haue mooued their foote, or
their tongue, but in him: and
yet he which asked <hi>Adam,</hi> where
he was, asks <hi>Balaam, What men are
these?</hi> I haue euer seene, that God
loues to take occasion of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with vs, from our selues, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then from his owne imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
prescience. Hence it is, that
we lay open our wants, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
our sins, to him, that knowes
both, better then our owne harts,
Because he wil deale with vs from
our owne mouthes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:3791:161"/>
The preuention of GOD, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
both his iourney, and his
curse. And what if he had beene
suffred to goe and curse? What
corne had this winde shaken when
God meant to blesse them? How
many Bulls haue bellowed out
execrations against this Church
of God? What are we the worse?
Yea, I doubt if wee had beene so
much blessed, had not those <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laamitish</hi>
curses been spent vpon
vs. Hee that knowes what waste
winde the causeless curses of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men are, yet will not haue
<hi>Balaam</hi> curse Israel; because hee
will not allow <hi>Balac</hi> so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
in his opposition,
as the conceit of this helpe. Or
perhaps, if <hi>Balac</hi> thought this Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
a true Prophet, God would
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:3791:162"/>
not haue his name, so much, as in
the opinion of the heathen, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized,
in vsurping it to a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which he meant not should
succeed.</p>
                  <p>The hand of God is in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of many euills, vvhich we
neuer knew to be towards vs. The
Israelites sate still in their Tents,
they little thought what mischiefe
was brewing against them: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
euer making them of counsel,
God crosses the designes of their
enemies. He that keepeth Israel,
is both a sure, and a secret friend.
The reward of the diuination, had
easily commaunded the iourney,
and curse of the couetous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
if GOD had not stayed
him. How oft are wicked men
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3791:162"/>
curbed by a diuine hand, euen in
those sinnes, which their heart
stands to? It is no thanke to lewd
men that their wickednesse is not
prosperous. VVhence is it that
the vvorld is not ouer-runne
vvith euill, but from this; that
men cannot bee so ill as they
would?</p>
                  <p>The first entertainment of this
message, vvould make a stranger
thinke <hi>Balaam</hi> wise, and honest:
Hee will not giue a suddaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
but craues leasure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with GOD; and promises
to returne the answere hee shall
receiue. Who would not say, This
man is free from rashnesse, from
partialitie? Dissimulation is craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; able to deceiue thousands:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3791:163"/>
The words are good: when hee
comes to action, the fraude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes
it selfe: For, both hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates
his own forwardnes, and
casts the blame of the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
vpon God, &amp; (which is worse)
deliuers but halfe his answere: he
saies indeed, <hi>GOD refuses to giue
me leaue to goe:</hi> He saies not, as it
was, <hi>Hee charges mee not to curse
them, for they are blessed.</hi> So did
<hi>Balaam</hi> deny, as one that wisht to
bee sent for againe. Perhaps a
peremptory refusall had hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his further solicitation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement
of some truths, is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as faulty, as a deniall. True
fidelitie is not niggardly in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                  <p>Where wickednes meets with
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3791:163"/>
power, it thinks to commaund all
the world, and takes great scorne
of any repulse. So little is. <hi>Balac</hi>
discouraged with one refusal, that
hee sends so much the stronger
message; <hi>Mo Princes,</hi> and <hi>more
honourable.</hi> Oh that we could be
so importunate for our good, as
wicked men are for the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their own designes! A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
doth but whet the desires of
vehement sutors. Why are wee
faint in spirituall things, when we
are not denyed, but delayed?</p>
                  <p>Those which are themselues
transported with vanity, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
thinke that no heart hath
power to resist these offers. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacs</hi>
Princes thought they had
strook it dead, when they had
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3791:164"/>
once mentioned promotion to
great honour. Selfe-loue makes
them think they cannot be slaues,
whiles others may be free; &amp; that
all the world would be gladde to
runne on madding after their
bait. Nature thinks it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to contemne honour and
vvealth; and because too many
soules are thus taken, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
that any would escape. But
let carnall harts knowe there are
those, that can spitte the world in
the face, and say, <hi>Thy gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
perish with thee:</hi> and that in
comparison of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>science,
can tread vnder foot his best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
like shadowes, as they are; &amp;
that can do, as <hi>Balaam</hi> said.</p>
                  <p>How near, truth, and falshood
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3791:164"/>
can lodge together? Heere was
pietie in the lips, and couetousnes
in the hart. Who can any more
regard good words, that heares
<hi>Balaam</hi> speak so like a Saint? An
house-full of gold and siluer may
not peruert his tongue; his hart is
won with lesse: for if he had not
already swallowed the reward, &amp;
found it sweet, why did he againe
solicit GOD, in that which was
peremptorilie denyed him? If
his minde had not been bribed
alreadie, vvhy did hee stay the
messengers? vvhy did hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a change in GOD? Why
was hee vvilling to feede them
vvith hope of successe, which
had fedde him vvith hope of
recompence? One prohibition
is enough for a good man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:3791:165"/>
Whiles the delay of GOD doth
but hold vs in suspense, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is holy and seasonable: but
when once he giues a resolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
it is profane saucinesse to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
him. When we aske what wee
are bidden, our suites are not
more vehement, then welcome:
but when wee beg prohibited sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
our presumption is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
and abhominable: No
good hart will indure to be twise
forbidden.</p>
                  <p>Yet this importunitie hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a permission; but, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
worse then a denyall. I
heard GOD say before, <hi>Goe not,
nor curse them;</hi> Now he saies, <hi>Go,
but curse not.</hi> Anone, hee is angry
that he did goe. Why did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3791:165"/>
that, which hee forbad, if hee
be angry for doing that which he
permitted? Some things God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
with an indignation; not for
that he giues leaue to the act, but
that he giues a man ouer to his sin
in the act: this sufferance implies
not fauor, but iudgement: so did
GOD bid <hi>Balaam</hi> to go, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
bids the young man follow
the waies of his owne heart. It is
one thing to like, another thing to
suffer; <hi>Moses</hi> neuer approou'd
those legall diuorces, yet he tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
them: GOD neuer liked
<hi>Balaams</hi> iourney, yet hee displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
giues way to it: as if he said;
Well, since thou art so hote, set on
this iourney, be gone. And thus
<hi>Balaam</hi> tooke it: else, when GOD
after professed his displeasure for
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3791:166"/>
the iourney, it had been a readie
answer, <hi>Thou commaundedst mee:</hi>
but heerin his confession argues
his guilt. <hi>Balaams</hi> suit, and Israels
Quayles, had both one fashion of
grant, in anger. How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is it, to haue gracious denyals,
then angry yieldings?</p>
                  <p>A small perswasion hartens the
willing: It booted not to bid the
couetous Prophet hasten to his
way. Now hee makes himselfe
sure of successe: His corrupt hart
tells him, that as God had relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his licence to goe, so hee
might perhaps, in his licence to
curse; and he saw how this curse
might blesse him with abundance
of wealth: he rose vp early there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp; sadled his asse. The night
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3791:166"/>
seemed long to his forwardnesse.
Couetous men neede neither
clock nor bell to awaken them:
their desires make them restlesse.
Oh that we could, with as much
eagernesse seeke the true riches,
which only can make vs happy!</p>
                  <p>We that see onely the out-side
of <hi>Balaam,</hi> may maruell, why hee
that permitted him to goe; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
opposes his going: but
GOD that savv his heart, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
vvhat corrupt affections
carryed him: hee saw, that his
couetous desires, and vvicked
hopes, grew the stronger, the
nearer hee came to his end: An
Angell is therefore sent to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the hastie Sorcerer. Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
disposition, is the life of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3791:167"/>
our actions; according to that,
doth the God of spirits iudge vs,
whiles men censure according to
our externall motions. To goe
at all, when GOD had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to stay, was presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous:
but to goe with desire to
curse, made the act doubly sinful,
and fetcht an Angel to resist it. It
is one of the woorthy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of good Angels, to make
secret opposition to euill designs:
Many a wicked act haue they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
without the knowledge of
the agent. It is all one with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
to worke by spirits, and
men; It is therefore our glorie to
be thus set on worke: to stop the
course of euill, either by disswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or violence, is an Angelicall
seruice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:3791:167"/>
In what danger are wicked
men, that haue Gods Angels
their opposites? The diuell moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him to go; a good Angel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
him. If an heauenly Spirit
stand in the way of a Sorcerers
sinne, how much more ready are
all those spirituall powers, to stop
the miscariages of Gods deare
children? How oft had wee fallen
yet more, if these gardians had
not vpheld vs, whether by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
occasions, or by casting in
good instincts? As our good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors
are oft hindred by Satan;
so are our euill, by good Angels:
else, were not our protection e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to our danger; &amp; we could
neither stand, nor rise.</p>
                  <p>It had beene as easie for the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:3791:168"/>
Angell to strike <hi>Balaam,</hi> as to
stand in his way; and to haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him in his starting aside, as
to stoppe him in a narrow path:
But euen the good Angels haue
their stints, in their executions.
GOD had some-what more to
doe with the tongue of <hi>Balaam,</hi>
and therefore hee will not haue
him slaine, but withstood: and
so withstood, that he shall passe.
It is not so much glory to GOD
to take away wicked men, as
to vse their euill to his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
purposes. How soone could
the Commaunder of heauen, and
earth, ridde the world of badde
members? But so should he lose
the prayse of working good by
euill instruments. It sufficeth that
the Angels of GOD resist their
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:3791:168"/>
actions, while their persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                  <p>That no man may maruell to
see <hi>Balaam</hi> haue visions from
God, and vtter prophecies from
him; his very asse hath his eyes
opened, to see the Angel, which
his Maister could not; and his
mouth opened to speake more
reasonably the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> his Maister. There
is no beast deserues so much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as this of <hi>Balaam,</hi> whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense is aduanced aboue the
reason of his rider; so as for the
time, the Prophet is brutish, &amp; the
beast propheticall. Who can but
stand amazed at the eye, at the
tongue of this silly creature? For
so dull a sight it was much to see
a bodilie obiect, that were not too
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3791:169"/>
apparant; but to see that spirit,
which his rider discerned not, was
farre beyond nature. To heare a
voice come from that mouth,
which was vsed onely to bragge,
it was strange, and vncouth: but
to heare a beast, whose nature is
noted for incapacity, to out-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
his Maister, a professed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
is in the very height of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles:
Yet, can no heart stick at
these, that considers the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Almighty, in both.
Our eye could no more see a
beast, then a beast can see an
Angel, if he had not giuen this
power to it. How easie is it for
him that made the eye of man &amp;
beast, to dim, or inlighten it at
his pleasure? And if his power can
make the very stones to speake,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:3791:169"/>
how much more a creature of
sense? That euill spirit spake in the
serpent to our first Parents; Why
is it more that a spirit should speak
in the mouth of a beast? How or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
did the heathen receiue
their Oracles out of stones, and
trees? Doe not wee our selues
teach birds to speake those senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they vnderstand not? We may
wonder, we cannot distrust, when
we compare the act with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
which can as easily create a
voyce<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> without a body, as a body
without a voyce. Who now can
heerafter plead his simplicity, and
dulnes of apprehending spiritual
things, when he sees how God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts
the eyes of a beast, to see a
spirit? Who can be proud of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
visions, since an Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:3791:170"/>
to a beast; neither was his
skin better after it, then others of
his kinde? Who can complaine
of his owne rudenesse, and inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to reply in a good cause, when
the very beast is inabled by God,
to conuince his maister? There
is no mouth, into which GOD
cannot put words: and how oft
dooth he choose the weake, and
vnwise, to confound the learned,
and mighty?</p>
                  <p>What had it beene better for
the asse to see the Angell; if hee
had rushed still vpon his sword?
Euills were as good not seene, as
not auoyded; But now hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
the way, and saues his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
It were happy for peruerse
sinners, if they could learne of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3791:170"/>
this beast, to run away from fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
iudgements. The reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Angel stands before vs; and
though we knowe we shall as sure
die, as sinne: yet we haue not the
witte, or grace to giue backe;
though it bee with the hurt of a
foot, to saue the body; with the
paine of the body, to saue the
soule.</p>
                  <p>I see, what fury and stripes the
impotent Prophet bestowes vpon
this poore beast, because hee will
not goe on; yet, if he had gone
on, himselfe had perished. How
oft doe we wish those things, the
not obtaining whereof is mercy?
We grudge to be staid in the way
to death, &amp; fly vpon those which
oppose our perdition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:3791:171"/>
I doe not (as who would not
expect) see <hi>Balaams</hi> haire stand
vpright, nor himselfe alighting,
and appalled at this monster of
miracles: But, as if no new thing
had happened, he returnes words
to the beast, full of anger, voyde
of admiration; Whether his trade
of sorcering had so inured him
to receiue voyces from his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars,
in shape of beasts, that this
euent seemed not strange to him;
Or, whether his rage, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes
had so transported him,
that hee had no leasure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the vnnaturall vnusualnes
of the euent. Some men make
nothing of those things, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
others with horror, and
astonishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:3791:171"/>
I heare the Angel of GOD
taking notice of the cruelty of
<hi>Balaam</hi> to his beast: His first
vvordes to the vnmercifull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
are in expostulating of this
wrong. Wee little thinke it; but
God shal call vs to an account, for
the vnkinde and cruell vsages of
his poor mute creatures: He hath
made vs Lords, not tyrants; ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
not tormentors: hee that
hath giuen vs leaue to kill them,
for our vse, hath not giuen vs leaue
to abuse them, at our pleasure;
they are so our drudges, that they
are our fellowes by creation. It
was a signe the Magician would
easily wish to strike Israell vvith
a curse, vvhen hee vvished a
sworde to strike his harmelesse
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3791:172"/>
beast. It is ill falling into those
hands, whome beasts finde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these rubs,
<hi>Balaam</hi> goes on, and is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide
to ride on that beast, whose
voyce he hath heard: And now,
postes are sped to <hi>Balac,</hi> with the
newes of so welcome a guest:
Hee that sent Princes, to fetch
him, comes himselfe on the way,
to meet him; Although hee can
say (<hi>Am not I able to promote thee</hi>)
yet hee giues this high respect
to him as his better, from
whome hee expected the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of himselfe, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Oh the honour that hath
beene formerlie done by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
to them that haue borne
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3791:172"/>
but the face of Prophets: I
shame, and grieue to compare
the times and men: Onely, O
GOD, bee thou mercifull to
the contempt of thy seruants.</p>
                  <p>As if nothing needed but the
presence of <hi>Balaam,</hi> the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
King (out of the ioy of
his hope) feasts his gods, his
Prophet, his Princes; and on
the morrowe, carryes him vppe
to the high-places of his Idol.
Who can doubt whether <hi>Balaam</hi>
were a false Prophet, that sees
him sacrificing in the mount of
<hi>Baal?</hi> Had he bin from the true
God, he would rather haue said,
<hi>Pull me downe these altars of Baal,</hi>
then, <hi>Builde me heere seuen others:</hi>
The very place conuinces him
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3791:173"/>
of falshood, and Idolatry: And
why seuen altars? What needs all
this pompe? When the true God
neuer required but one at once,
as himselfe is one; why doth the
false Prophet call for no lesse then
seuen? As if GOD stood vpon
numbers? As if the Almighty
would haue his power either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
or limited? Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a glorious, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
pretence of deuotion. It
hath beene euer seene, that the
false worshippers of GOD haue
made more pompous showes, and
fairer flourishes of their piety, and
religion, then the true.</p>
                  <p>Now when <hi>Balaam</hi> sees his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
bulloks, and seuen rams smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon his seuen altars, he goes
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3791:173"/>
vp higher into the mount (as som
counterfair <hi>Moses</hi>) to receiue the
answere of God: But will GOD
meet with a sorcerer? wil he make
a Prophet of a Magician? O man,
who shall prescribe God what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to vse? he knowes how
to imploy, not onely Saints, and
Angels, but wicked men, beasts,
Diuels, to his owne glory: Hee
that put words into the mouth of
the Asse, puts wordes into the
mouth of <hi>Balaam:</hi> The words doe
but passe from him; They are not
polluted, because they are not
his; as the Trunk, through which
a man speakes, is not the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent
for the speech, that is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
through it. What a notable
proclamation had the Infidels
wanted of Gods fauor, to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:3791:174"/>
if <hi>Balaams</hi> tongue had not
beene vsed. How many shall
once say, <hi>Lord we haue prophecied
in thy name,</hi> that shall heare <hi>Verely
I knowe you not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What madnes is this in <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am?</hi>
He that found himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in soliciting, thinks to finde
GOD not constant in denying;
and, as if that infinite Deity were
not the same euery where, hopes
to change successe, with places.
Neither is that bolde forehead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
to importune God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in that, wherein his owne
mouth had testified an assurance
of deniall. The reward was in
one of his eyes; the reuenging An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
in the other: I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(for the time) hee more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3791:174"/>
the bribe, or feared the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
And whiles hee is in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction,
his tongue blesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his heart, and his heart cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
against his tongue. It angers
him that he dare not speake what
he would; and now at last rather
then lose his hopes, he resolues to
speake vvorse then curses. The
feare of GODs iudgement in a
worldly heart, is at length o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come vvith the
loue of gain.</p>

be saide of this Prophet of his:
According to the fashion of all

his actions abhominable: Hee

would not curse, but hee would
aduise; and his counsell is worse,
then a curse: For his curse had

Israelites. Hee that hath heard
God speake by <hi>Balaam,</hi> would not
looke for the Diuell, in the same
mouth. And, if GOD himselfe
hadde not witnessed against him,
who could beleeue that the same
tongue which vttered so diuine
prophecies, should vtter so villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and cursed aduise? Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
gaines this of men, that it
may doe euill, vnsuspected: But
now, he that heard what he spake
in <hi>Balacs</hi> eare, hath bewrayd, and
condemned his counsell, and
himselfe.</p>

                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:3791:176"/>
This policie was fetcht from
the bottome of hell; It is not for
lack of desire, that I curse not
Israel; thou doest not more wish
their destruction, then I doe
thy wealth, and honour: But so
long as they holde firme with
GOD, there is no sorcery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Iacob;</hi> withdrawe GOD
from them, and they shall fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
&amp; curse themselues; Drawe
them into sinne, and thou shalt
withdrawe GOD from them.
There is no sinne more plausible,
then wantonness; One fornication
shal drawe in another, and both
shall fetch the anger of God after
them; send your fairest women
into their tents, their sight shall
drawe them to lust; their lust to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:3791:176"/>
folly; their folly to Idolatry; and
now God shal curse them for thee,
vnasked. Where <hi>Balaam</hi> did speak
well, there was neuer any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
spake more diuinely; where
he spake ill, there was neuer any
diuell spake more desperately:
Ill counsell seldome succeedeth
not; Good seed falls often out of
the way, and roots not; but the
tares neuer light amisse: This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of the wicked Magician, was
too prosperous. The daughters of
<hi>Moab</hi> come into the tents of Israel;
and haue captiued those, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the
Amorites &amp; Amalekites could not
resist. Our first mother <hi>Eue</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
this dowry to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters,
that they should be our help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to sin; the weaker sex is the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>quest: Had the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3791:177"/>
sent their subtilest Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
to perswade the Israelites,
to their Idol-sacrifices: they had
beene repelled with scorne; but
now the beauty of their women is
ouer-eloquent, and succesfull.
That which in the first World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayd
the sonnes of GOD; hath
now ensnared Gods people; It
had beene happy for Israel if <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
had vsed any charmes, but
these. As it is the vse of God to
fetch glory to himselfe out of the
worst actions of Satan; so it is the
guise of that euill one (through
the iust permission of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
to raise aduantage to himself,
from the fayrest peeces of the
work-manship of God: No one
means hath so much inriched hel,
as beautifull faces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:3791:177"/>
All Idols are abominable: but
this of <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> was, besides
the superstition of it, beastlie;
Neither did <hi>Baal</hi> euer put on a
forme, of so much shame, as this;
yet very Israelites are drawne to
adore it. When lust hath blinded
the eyes, it carries a man whither
it lists; euen beyond all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of sinne. A man besotted with
filthy desires, is fitte for any vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.</p>
                  <p>Sin is no lesse crafty, then satan
himselfe; giue him but roome in
the eye, and he will soone be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of body and soule. These
Israelites, first saw the faces of
these Moabites, and Midianites:
then they grew to like their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
from thence, to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3791:178"/>
in their feasts: From their
bords, they are drawne to their
beddes; from their beds, to their
Idols; and now they are ioyned
to <hi>Baal-Peor,</hi> and separated from
GOD. Bodily fornication is the
way to spirituall: If we haue made
Idols of flesh, it is iust to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vp to Idols of wood, and
stones. If wee haue not grace to
resist the beginnings of sin, where
shall wee stay? If our foot slippe
into the mouth of hell, it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to stop ere wee come to the
bottom.</p>
                  <p>Well might God be angry, to
see his people goe a whoring in
this double fornication; neither
doth hee smother his wrath, but
himselfe strikes with his plague,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3791:178"/>
and biddes <hi>Moses</hi> strike with the
sword. Hee strikes the body, and
bids <hi>Moses</hi> strike the head. It had
beene as easie for him to plague
the Rulers, as the vulgar: &amp; one
would thinke, these should bee
more properly reserued, for his
immediate hand; but these, hee
leaues to the sword of humane
authority, that he might win awe
to his owne ordinances. As the
sinnes of great men are exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so are their punishments. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
procures so much credit to
gouernment, as strict &amp; impartial
executions of great and noble of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors.
Those whom their sins
haue embased, deserue no fauor
in the punishment: As God knows
no honor, no royalty in matter of
sinne, no more may his deputyes.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3791:179"/>
Contrarily, conniuence at the
outrages of the mighty, cuts the
sinewes of any State; neither doth
any thing make good lawes more
contemptible, then the making
difference of offenders; that small
sacriledges should bee punished,
when great ones ride in triumph.
If good ordinations turne once to
Spyders webs, which are broken
through, by the bigger Flyes, no
hand will feare to sweepe them
downe.</p>
                  <p>GOD was angry; <hi>Moses</hi> and
all good Israelites grieued; the
heads hanged vppe; the people
plagued: yet behold, one of the
Princes of Israel feares not to
braue God, and his Ministers, in
that sinne, which hee sees so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3791:179"/>
reuenged in others. I can
neuer wonder enough at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of this Israelite. Heere is
fornication, an odious crime, and
that, of an Israelite, whose name
challenges holinesse; yea, of a
Prince of Israel, whose practice is
a rule to inferiors; and that, with
a woman of Midian, with whom,
euen a chaste contract had beene
vnlawfull; and that, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of all gouernment; &amp; that,
in the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all Israel;
and that in a time of mourning, &amp;
iudgement, for that same offence.
Those that haue once passed the
bounds of modesty, soone grow
shamelesse in their sinnes. Whiles
sin hides it selfe in corners, there
is yet hope; for, where there is
shame, there is a possibilitie of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3791:180"/>
grace: but when once it dare look
vpon the sunne, and send chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
to authority, the case is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
and ripe for iudgement.</p>
                  <p>This great Simeonite, thought
hee might sinne by priuiledge;
He goes, as if he said, Who dares
controll mee? His nobility hath
raysed him aboue the reach of
correction. Commonly, the sins
of the mightie are not without
presumption: and therfore their
vengeance is no lesse, then their
securitie; and their punishment is
so much greater, as their conceit
of impunity is greater. All Israel
saw this bold lewdnesse of <hi>Zimri:</hi>
but their harts, &amp; eyes were so full
of griefe, that they had not roome

                     <hi>Phineas</hi> lookt on with the rest,
but with other affections. When
hee saw this defiance bidden to
God; and this insultation vpon
the sorrow of his people, that
whiles they were wringing their
hands, a proud miscreant durst
out-face their humiliation, with
his wicked dalliance; his heart
boyles with a desire of an holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge:
and now that hand, which
was vsed to acenser, &amp; sacrificing
knife, takes vp his Iaueline, and
with one stroke ioynes these two
bodyes in their death, vvhich
were ioyned in their sinne; and
in the very flagrance of their lust,
makes a new way for their soules,
to their own place. O noble &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall
courage of <hi>Phineas!</hi> which
as it was rewarded of GOD,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:3791:181"/>
so is woorthy to bee admired of
men. Hee doth not stand casting
of scruples: Who am I to do this?
The sonne of the high Priest; My
place is all for peace, and mercie;
It is for mee to sacrifice, and pray
for the sin of the people, not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
any of the people, for their
sin. My duty calls mee to appease
the anger of GOD, what I may,
not to reuenge the sins of men;
to pray for their conuersion, not
to work the confusion of any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
and who are these? Is not the
one a great Prince in Israel, the
other a Princesse of Midian? Can
the death of two so famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
goe vnreuenged? Or if it be
safe, and fit, why doth my Vncle
<hi>Moses</hi> rather shed his owne tears,
then their bloud? I will mourne
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:3791:181"/>
with the rest, let them reuenge
whom it concerneth. But the zeale
of God hath barred out all weake
deliberations; and hee holds it
now both his duty, and his glory,
to be an executioner of so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
a payre of offenders.</p>
                  <p>God loues this heate of zeale,
in all the carriages of his seruants:
And if it transport vs too far, hee
pardoneth the errours of our fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie,
rather then the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of luke warmnesse. As these
two were more beasts, then any
that euer he sacrificed; so the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of their bloud, was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptablest
sacrifice, that euer hee
offied vnto GOD: for both all
Israel is freed from the plague, &amp;
all his posterity haue the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:3791:182"/>
entayled to them, so long as
the Iewes were a people. Next to
our prayers, there is no better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
then the bloud of malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
not as it is theirs, but as it is
shed by authority. Gouernors are
faulty of those sinnes they punish
not. There can be no better sight
in any State, then to see a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
at the gallowes. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for vs, to stand gazing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wickednesse of the times,
(yea altho with teares) vnlesse
wee endeuour to redresse it: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
publique persons carry
not their Iauelin in their hand for
nought.</p>
                  <p>Euery one is ready to aske <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
for his commission: and those
that are willing to salue vp the act,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3791:182"/>
plead extraordinary instinct from
God; who (no doubt) would not
haue accepted, that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
wrought not. But what need
I runne so farre for this warrant,
when I heare GOD say to <hi>Moses,
Hang vp all the Heads of Israel;</hi>
and <hi>Moses</hi> say to the vnder-Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<hi>Euery one slay his men, that are
ioyned to Baal-Peor.</hi> Euery Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
is now made a Magistrate, for
this execution; and why not <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
amongst the rest? Dooth
his Priesthood exempt him from
the bloud of sinners? How then
doth <hi>Samuel</hi> heaw <hi>Agag</hi> in peeces?
Euen those may make a carcasse,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> may not touch it. And if <hi>Leui</hi>
got the Priesthood, by shedding
the blood of Idolaters; why may it
not stand with that Priesthood, to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:3791:183"/>
spill the bloud of a fornicator, and
Idolater? Ordinary iustice will
beare out <hi>Phineas</hi> in this act; It is
not for euery man to challenge
this office, which this double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
allowed to <hi>Phineas.</hi> All
that priuate persons can doe, is
either to lift vppe their hands to
heauen, for redresse of sin; or to
lift vp their hands against the sin,
not against the person. <hi>Who made
thee a Iudge,</hi> is a lawful question, if
it meet with a person vnwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Now the sinne is punished, the
plague ceaseth. The reuenge of
God, sets out euer after the sinne;
but if the reuenge of men (which
commonly comes later) can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake
it, GOD giues ouer the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3791:183"/>
chase. How oft hath the infliction
of a lesse punishment, auoyded a
greater. There are none so good
friends to the State, as courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and impartiall ministers of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
These are the reconcilers of
God, and the people, more, then
the prayers of them that sit

perilous enterprises,
now is <hi>Moses</hi> drawing
to his rest. Hee hath
brought his Israelites from Egypt,
through the Sea, and wildernesse,
within the sight of their promised
Land; &amp; now himselfe must take
possession of that Land, whereof
Canaan was but a type. When
wee haue done that wee came for,
it is time for vs to be gone; This
earth is onely made for action, not
for fruition; The seruices of Gods
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3791:184"/>
children should be ill rewarded, if
they must stay heere alwaies. Let
no man thinke much, that those
are fetcht away which are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to GOD; They should not
change, if it were not to their
preferment. It is our folly that we
would haue good men liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and account it an hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that they vvere. Hee that
lends them to the vvorld, owes
them a better turne, then this
earth can pay them. It vvere
iniurious to wish, that goodnesse
should hinder any man from
glorie. So is the death of Gods
Saints precious, that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> must go vp to mount Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,
and die. The time, the place,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3791:185"/>
and euery circumstance of his
dissolution, is determined. That
one dies in the field, another in
his bed, another in the water; one
in a forraine nation, another in
his owne, is fore-decreed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And, tho we heare it not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
yet God hath call'd euerie
man, by his name, and saith; Die
thou there. One man seemes to
die casually; another, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
violence: both fall by a
destiny; and all is set downe to vs
by an eternall decree. Hee that
brought vs into the world, wil ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vs out, according to his owne
purposes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> must ascend vp to the hil,
to die. Hee receiued his charge
for Israel, vpon the hill of Sinai;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:3791:185"/>
And now hee deliuers vppe his
charge, on the hill of Nebo: His
brother <hi>Aaron</hi> dyed on one hill;
hee, on another. As Christ was
transfigur'd on an hill: so, was this
excellent type of his; Neither
doubt I, but that these hills were
types to them, of that heauen,
whither they were aspiring. It is
the goodnes of our God, that hee
will not haue his children die any
where, but where they may see
the Land of Promise before them;
neither can they depart vvithout
much comfort, to haue seene it:
Contrarily, a vvicked man that
looks downe, and sees hell before
him, how can he choose but finde
more horror in the ende of death,
then in the way?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:3791:186"/>
How familiarly doth <hi>Moses</hi> hear
of his end! It is no more betwixt
God, and <hi>Moses,</hi> but Goe vp, and
die; If hee had inuited him to a
meale, it could not haue beene in
a more sociable compellation:
No otherwise then he said to his
other Prophet, Vp and eate: It is
neither harsh, nor newes to Gods
children, to hear, or think of their
departure; To them death hath
lost his horror, through acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
Those faces which at first
sight seemed ill fauoured, by oft
viewing, growe out of dislike:
They haue so oft thought, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
of the necessity, &amp; of the
issue of their dissolution, that they
cannot holde it either strange, or
vnwelcome: Hee that hath hadde
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:3791:186"/>
such entire conuersation vvith
GOD, cannot feare to goe
to him. Those that knowe him
not, or knowe that hee will not
knowe them, no maruell if they
tremble.</p>
                  <p>This is no small fauour; that
God warnes <hi>Moses</hi> of his end: He
that hadde so oft made <hi>Moses</hi> of
counsell, what hee meant to doe
with Israel, would not now doe
ought with himselfe, without his
knowledge. Expectation of any
maine euent is a great aduantage
to a wise heart; If the fiery chariot
had fetcht away <hi>Elias,</hi> vnlookt for,
we shold haue doubted of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
of his transportation: It is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, to come as a theef
in the night. God forewarns one
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:3791:187"/>
by sicknes, another by age, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his secret instincts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for their end: If our hearts
be not now in a readinesse, we are
worthy to be surprized.</p>
                  <p>But what is this I heare? Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
mixed with loue? &amp; that
to so faithfull a seruant as <hi>Moses?</hi>
He must but see the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
he shall not tread vpon it;
because he once, long agoe, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in distrusting. Death, tho it
were to him an entrance into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet shal be also a chastisement
of his infidelity: How many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proofes had <hi>Moses</hi> giuen of his
courage &amp; strength of faith? How
many gracious seruices had hee
done to his Maister? Yet for one
act of distrust, he must be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3791:187"/>
to his Fathers. All our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences
cannot beare out one sin
against God; How vainely shall
we hope to make amends to God
for our former trespasses, by our
better behauior, when <hi>Moses</hi> hath
this one sin laid in his dish after so
many and worthy testimonies of
his fidelity? When wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
our sinnes, yet GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
them, and (altho not in
anger, yet) he calls for our arera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Alas, what shall become of
them, with whom God hath tenne
thousand greater quarrels; That
amongst many millions of sinnes,
haue scattered some fewe acts of
formal seruices? If <hi>Moses</hi> must die

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3791:188"/>
loues, hee will not winke at sinne;
and if he do not punish, yet he wil
chastice: How much lesse can it
stand with that eternall iustice to
let wilfull sinners escape iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>It might haue beene iust vvith
God, to haue reserued the cause
to himselfe; and in a generality,
to haue tolde <hi>Moses,</hi> that his sin
must shorten his iourney: but it
is more of mercy, then iustice,
that his children shall knowe why
they smart; That GOD may at
once both iustifie himselfe, and
humble them, for their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
offences: Those to whom hee
meanes vengeance, haue not the
sight of their sinnes, till they be
past repentance. Complaine not
that God vpbraides thee with thy
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:3791:188"/>
old sins, whosoeuer thou art: but
knowe, it is an argument of loue;
whereas concealement is a fearful
signe of a secret dislike fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> God.</p>
                  <p>But what was that noted sinne
vvhich deserues this late expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration,
and shall carry so sharpe
a chastisement? Israel murmur'd
for water; God bids <hi>Moses</hi> take
the rod in his hand, and speake to
the rock to giue water; <hi>Moses</hi> in
stead of speaking, and striking the
rock with his voyce, strikes it with
the rod; Heere was his sinne; An
ouer-reaching of his commission;
A fearefulnes and distrust of the
effect; The rod, hee knew, was
approued for miracles; hee knew
not how powerful his voice might
be; therfore he did not speak, but
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:3791:189"/>
strike, and he stroke twise for fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
And now, after these many
yeeres, he is striken for it, of God;
It is a dangerous thing in diuine
matters, to goe beyond our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
Those sinnes which seeme
triuiall to men, are hainous in the
account of God; Any thing that
sauors of infidelity displeases him
more, then some other crimes of
morality. Yet the mouing of the
rod was but a diuerse thing from
the moouing of the tongue, it was
not contrary; He did not forbid
the one, but hee commanded the
other: This was but acrosse the
streame, not against it; where shal
they appeare whose whole cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are quite contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:3791:189"/>
Vpon the act done, God passed
the sentence of restrayning <hi>Moses</hi>
with the rest, from the promised
Land; now he performes it: Since
that time, <hi>Moses</hi> had many fauors
from God: All which could not
reuerse this decreed castigation;
That euerlasting rule is grounded
vpon the very essence of God; I
am <hi>Iehouah,</hi> I change not. Our
purposes are as our selues, fickle,
&amp; incertaine; His are certain, and
immutable: some things which he
reueales, he alters; nothing that he
hath decreed. Besides the soule of
<hi>Moses</hi> (to the glory whereof God
principally intended this change)
I finde him carefull of two things:
His Successor, and his Body: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
moues for the one; the other
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:3791:190"/>
God doth, vnasked: Hee was so
tender ouer the welfare of Israel,
in his life; would not slaken his
care, in death: Hee takes no
thought for himself (for he knew
how gainfull an exchange he must
make.) All his care is for his
charge. Some enuious natures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be missed, when they must
goe; and wish that the weaknes, or
want of a successour, may be the
foyle of their memory, &amp; honor:
<hi>Moses</hi> is in a contrary disposition,
It sufficeth him not to finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in his owne happinesse,
vnlesse he may haue an assurance,
that Israel shall prosper after him.
Carnall mindes are all for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and make vse of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
only for their owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
But good hearts look euer to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:3791:190"/>
the future good of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
their own, against their own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> did well to show his good
affection to his people; but in his
silence God wold haue prouided
for his owne: Hee that call'd him
from the sheep of <hi>Iethro,</hi> will not
want a gouernour for his chosen,
to succeed him; God hath fitted
him, whom he will choose. Who
can be more meet, then he whose
name, whose experience, whose
graces might supply, yea reuiue
<hi>Moses</hi> to the people? He that sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the Land before, was fittest
to guide Israel into it; Hee that
vvas indued vvith the spirite of
GOD, was the fittest deputie
for GOD: He that abode still in
the Tabernacle of Ohel-moed, as
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3791:191"/>
Gods attendant, was fittest to be
sent forth from him, as his lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
But, oh the vnsearchable
counsell of the Almighty! Aged
<hi>Caleb,</hi> and all the Princes of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
are past ouer; and <hi>Ioshua</hi> the
seruant of <hi>Moses,</hi> is chosen to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
his maister; The eye of God
is not blinded either with gifts, or
with blood, or with beauty, or with
strength: but as in his eternall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
so in his temporary, hee
will haue mercie, on vvhom hee
will.</p>
                  <p>And well doth <hi>Ioshua</hi> succeed
<hi>Moses;</hi> The very acts of God of
olde were allegories: where the
Law ends, there the Sauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;
we may see the Land of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in the Law; Onely Iesus the

mediatour of the new Testament
can bring vs into it. So was he a
seruant of the Law, that hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
all the defects of the Law, to
vs: Hee hath taken possession of
the promised Land for vs; he shall
carry vs from this Wildernes, to
our rest.</p>
                  <p>It is no small happinesse to any
State, when their gouernors are
chosen by worthiness; and such
elections are euer from GOD;
whereas the intrusions of bribery,
and vniust fauour, or violence, as
they make the common-wealth
miserable, so they come from
him, which is the author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion:
Woe be to that State that
suffers it; woe be to that person
that workes it; for both of them
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:3791:192"/>
haue sold themselues; the one to
seruitude, the other to sin.</p>
                  <p>I doe not heare <hi>Moses</hi> repine at
Gods choise; and grudge that this
scepter of his is not hereditary;
but he willingly layes hands vpon
his seruant, to consecrate him for
his successour. <hi>Ioshua</hi> was a good
man, yet hee had some sparks of
Enuy; for when <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi>
prophecied, he stomacht it; (<hi>My
Lord Moses forbid them.</hi>) He that
would not abide two of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Israel to prophecie; how
would he haue allow'd his seruant
to sit in his throne? What an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of meeknesse (besides all
the rest) doth hee here see in this
last act of his maister, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all murmuring resignes his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:3791:192"/>
chaire of state to his Page? It is
all one to a gratious heart, whom
GOD will please to aduance:
Emulation, and discontentment
are the affections of carnal minds.
Humilitie goes euer with regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
vvhich teaches a man to
thinke (vvhat euer honour bee
put vpon others) I haue more
then I am worthy of.</p>
                  <p>The same GOD that by the
hands of his Angels carryed vp
the soule of <hi>Moses,</hi> to his glory;
doth also by the hand of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
carry his body downe into
the vally of <hi>Moab,</hi> to his sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Those hands which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Law from him, those eyes
that had seene his presence, those
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:3791:193"/>
lips that had conferred so oft with
him, that face that did so shine
with the beames of his glory, may
not be neglected, when the soule
is gone: He that tooke charge of
his birth, and preseruation in the
reeds; takes charge of his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
out of the world: The care
of GOD ceaseth not ouer his
owne, either in death or after it.
How iustly doe wee take care of
the comely burials of our friends;
when God himselfe giues vs this
example?</p>
                  <p>If the ministery of man hadde
beene vsed in this graue of <hi>Moses;</hi>
the place might haue bin knowne
to the Israelites; but GOD pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceales this treasure both
from Men, and Diuels; that so he
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:3791:193"/>
might both crosse their curiosity,
and preuent their superstition. If
God had loued the adoration of
his seruants reliques; Hee could
neuer haue had a fitter oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for this deuotion, then in the
bodie of <hi>Moses.</hi> It is folly to place

                  <p>Yet, that diuine hand which
lockt vp this treasure, and kept

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Oshua</hi> was one of
those twelue sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
which were
sent to viewe the
Land of Canaan;
yet now hee addresses two Spyes,
for a more particular suruey:
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:3791:197"/>
Those twelue were onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the generall condition of
the people, and Land; these two,
to finde out the best entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the next part of the Countrey,
and into their greatest City. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
himselfe was full of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and had the Oracle of GOD
ready for his direction: yet now
hee goes not to the propitiatorie
for consultation, but to the spyes.
Except where ordinary meanes
faile vs, it is no appealing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
help of GOD; we may
not seeke to the posterne, but
where the common gate is shutte.
It was promised <hi>Ioshua,</hi> that hee
should lead Israel into the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Land; yet he knew it vvas vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to presume. The condition of
his prouident care was included
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3791:197"/>
in that assurance of successe. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is promised to vs; but not to
our carelesnesse, infidelity, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
Hee that hath set this
blessed inheritance before vs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposes
our wisedome, faith, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
                  <p>Either force, or policy, are fit to
be vsed vnto Canaanites. He that
would be happy in this spirituall
warfare, must knowe where the
strength of his enemy lyeth; and
must frame his gard, according to
the others assault. It is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
to a Christian, to know
the fashion of Satans onsets, that
he may the more easily compose
himselfe to resist. Many a soule
hath miscaried, through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of his enemie, which had
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3791:198"/>
not perished, if it had well known
that the weaknes of Satan stands
in our faith.</p>
                  <p>The Spyes can finde no other
lodging, but <hi>Rahabs</hi> house. Shee
was a victualer by profession, and
(as those persons and trades, by
reason of the commonnesse of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
were amongst the
Iewes, infamous, by name, and
note) she was <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot; I
will not thinke shee professed fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse:
onely her publique trade
(through the corruption of those
times) hath cast vpon her this
name of reproach; yea, rather
will I admire her fayth, then make
excuses for her calling. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
women in Israel (now <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
was dead) haue giuen such
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:3791:198"/>
proofes of their knowledge, and
faith? How noble is that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which shee makes of the
power and truth of GOD? Yea,
I see heere, not onely a disciple of
GOD, but a Prophetesse. Or, if
shee had once been publique, as
her house was; now she is a chaste
and worthy conuert; and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
her selfe for honest, and
wise behauior, that she is thought
worthy to be the great grand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Dauids</hi> Father: and the
holy line of the <hi>Messias,</hi> is not
ashamed to admitte her into that
happie pede-gree. The mercy
of our GOD dooth not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vs, by what wee were; It
would bee wide with the best of
vs, if the eye of God should looke
backward to our former estate;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3791:199"/>
there hee should see <hi>Abraham</hi> an
Idolater; <hi>Paul</hi> a persecutor; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi>
a necromancer; <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
a curtizan; and the best, vile
enough to be ashamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Who can despaire of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that sees euen <hi>Rahab</hi> fetcht
into the bloud of Israel, and line
of Christ?</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Rahab</hi> had receiued these
Spyes, but as vnknown passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
with respect to their mony,
and not to their errand, it had
been no prayse: for in such cases,
the thanke is rather to the guest,
then to the host: but now, shee
knew their purpose; shee knew
that the harbor of them, was the
danger of her owne life: and yet,
shee hazards this entertainement.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:3791:199"/>
Either faith or friendship, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tryed, but in extremities. To
show countenance to the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of God, whiles the publique
face of the State smiles vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> them,
is but a curtesie of course; but to
hide our own liues, in theirs, when
they are persecuted, is an act, that
lookes for a reward. These times
need not our fauour; we knowe
not what may come: Alas! how
likely is it they wold shelter them
in danger, which respect them not
in prosperity?</p>
                  <p>All intelligences of State come
first to the Court; It most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
Princes to harken after the
affayres of each other. If this
poore In-holder knew of the Sea
dryed vp before Israel, and of the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:3791:200"/>
discomfiture of <hi>Og</hi> &amp; <hi>Sebon.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this rumor was stale with the
King of Iericho; he had heard it,
and feared: And yet, in stead of
sending Ambassadors for peace<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
he sends Pursuiuants, for the spies<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
The spirit of <hi>Rahab</hi> melted with

All make not one vse of the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,

                  <p>The King sends to tell her, what
shee knew; shee had not hidde
them, if shee had not known their
errand. I knowe not whether first

                  <p>Who could haue hoped for
such faith in <hi>Rahab?</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
her life for the present,
that shee might saue it for the
future; neglected her own King
and Countrey for strangers,
vvhich shee neuer saw; and more
feared the destruction of that
Citie, before it knevv that it
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:3791:201"/>
had an aduersary, then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of her King, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
reuenge of that, which he wold
haue accounted trechery. Shee
brings them vp to the roofe of her
house, and hides them with stalks
of Flax: That plant which vvas
made to hide the body, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
and shame, now, is vsed
to hide the spyes from death. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
could these stalks haue beene
improued so well with all her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry,
after they were bruised, as
now before they were fitted to
her wheele: Of these she hath wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
an euerlasting web, both of
life and propagation. And now
her tongue hides them no lesse,
then her hand: her charitie was
good, her excuse was not good.
<hi>Euill may not bee done, that good
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:3791:201"/>
may come of it;</hi> wee may doe any
thing but sinne, for promoting a
good cause: And if not in so main
occasions; how shall God take it,
that wee are not dainty of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
in tryfles?</p>
                  <p>No man will looke that these
Spies could take any sound sleep,
in these beds of stalks; It is enough
for them that they liue, though
they rest not. And now, vvhen
they heare <hi>Rahab</hi> comming vp
the stayres, doubtlesse they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for an executioner: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
shee comes vp with a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
better then their sleepe; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their protection, aduise for
their future safety; whereto shee
makes way by a faithful report of
Gods former wonders, and the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:3791:202"/>
present disposition of her people;
and by wise capitulations for the
life, &amp; security of her familie. The
newes of Gods miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
for Israel, haue made
her resolue of their successe, and
the ruines of Iericho. Then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doe we make a right vse of the
works of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
vpon others, wee are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to auoyde our owne. Hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his acts for precedents of
iustice.</p>
                  <p>The parents, and brethren of
<hi>Rahab</hi> take their rest; They are
not troubled with the feare and
care of the succese of Israel; but
securely goe with the current of
the present condition: Shee wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for them all, and breakes her
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3791:202"/>
midnight sleepe, to preuent their
last. One wise and faithfull person
does well in an house; where all
are careless, there is no comfort,
but in perishing together. It had
bin an ill nature in <hi>Rahab,</hi> if shee
had been content to be saued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
that her loue might bee a
match to her faith, she couenants
for all her family; and so returnes
life to those, of whom shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
it. Both the bond of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of grace, will dravv
all ours, to the participation of
the same good, with our selues.</p>
                  <p>It had bin neuer the better for
the Spies, if after this nights lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they had beene turned out
of doores to the hazard of the
way: For so the pursuers had
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:3791:203"/>
light vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, &amp; preuented their
returne with their death. <hi>Rahabs</hi>
counsel therefore was better then
her harbor; which sent them (no
doubt, with victualls in their
hands) to seek safety in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
till the heat of that search
were past. He that hath giuen vs
charge of our liues, will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vs to cast them vpon wilful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures:
Had not these Spyes
hid themselues in those desert
hills, Israel had wanted directors
for their enterprises. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more expedient for the
Church, then that some of Gods
faithfull messengers should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselues, and giue way to
persecutions. Courage in those
that must die, is not a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
to the Gospell, then a
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:3791:203"/>
prudent retyring of those, which
may suruiue, to maintaine &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
it.</p>
                  <p>It was a iust &amp; resonable trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
betwixt them; that her life
should be saued by them, which
had saued theirs; They owe no
lesse to her, to whom they were
not so much guests, as prisoners:
And now they passe, not their
promise onely, but their oath.
They were strangers to <hi>Rahab,</hi>
and for ought shee knew, might
haue been godlesse: yet she dares
trust her life, vpon their oath. So
sacred and inviolable hath this
bond euer beene, that an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vvoman thought her selfe
secure, vpon the oath of an Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:3791:204"/>
Neither is shee more confident
of their oath taken, then they are
carefull both of taking, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it. So farre are they from
desiring to salue vp any breach of
promise, by equiuocation, that
they explaine all conditions; and
would preuent all possibilities of
violation. All <hi>Rahabs</hi> familie,
must be gathered into her house;
and that redde cord, which was
an instrument of their deliuerie,
must be a signe of hers. Behold,
this is the sauing colour: The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
Angel sees the doore
cheekes of the Israelites sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with redde, and passes them
ouer. The Warriours of Israel
see the window of <hi>Rahab</hi> dyed
with redde, and saue her familie,
from the common destruction.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3791:204"/>
If our soules haue this tincture of
the precious blood of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
vpon our doores, or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
wee are safe.</p>
                  <p>But if any one of the brethren
of <hi>Rahab,</hi> shall flye from this
redde flagge, and roue about
the Citie, and not containe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vnder that roofe, which hid
the Spyes, it is in vaine for him
to tell the auengers, that he is
<hi>Rahabs</hi> brother: That title will
not saue him, in the street; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doores it will. If wee will
vvander out of the limits, that
GOD hath sette vs, wee cast
our selues out of his protection;
wee cannot challenge the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his gracious preseruation,
&amp; our most precious redemption,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:3791:205"/>
when we fly out, into the by-waies
of our owne hearts; Not for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
but for safety and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the Church is that house of
<hi>Rahab,</hi> which is saued, vvhen all
Iericho shall perish. Whiles wee
keepe vs in the lists-thereof, wee
cannot miscary, through mis-opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
but when once we run out
of it, let vs looke for iudgement
from GOD, and error in

The Land is vnpeopled; or the

armes; vnskilfull of the discipline
of warre; but, (<hi>They faint because
of vs, therefore their Land is ours.</hi>)
Either successe, or discomfiture,
begins euer at the hart. A mans
inward disposition dooth more
then presage the euent. As a man
rayses vp his owne heart, before
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3791:206"/>
his fall; and depresses it, before
his glory: so God rayses it vp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his exaltation; and casts it
downe, before his ruine. It is no
otherwise, in our spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts:
If Satan see vs once faint,
he giues himselfe the day. There
is no way to safety, but that our
harts be the last that shall yield.
That vvhich the heathens attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to Fortune, we may iustlie
to the hand of GOD; That he
speedeth those that are forward.
All the ground that we lose, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

                  <p>This newes is brought but ouer

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3791:206"/>
hatefull and preiudiciall. Many a
one loses the Land of Promise,
by lingring: if wee neglect Gods
time, it is iust with him, to crosse
vs in ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioshua</hi> hastens till hee haue
brought Israel to the verge of the
promised Land: Nothing parts
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> now, but the riuer of Iordan.
There hee stayes a time; that the
Israelites might feed themselues a
while, with the sight of that, which
they shold afterwards inioy. That
which they had bin fortie yeers in
seeking, may not be seized vpon,
too suddenly: God loues to giue
vs cooles, &amp; heats in our desires;
and will so allay our ioyes, that
their fruition hurt vs not. Hee
knowes, that as it is in meates,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3791:207"/>
the long forbearance wherof cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

so it fares in the contemners
of the mind; therefore hee feeds
vs, not with the dish, but with the
spoone; and will haue vs, neither
cloyed, nor famished. If the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of GOD haue brought vs
within sight of heauen, let vs be
content to pause a-while, and
and vpon the banks of Iordan, fit
our selues for our entrance.</p>
                  <p>Now that Israel is brought to
the brimme of Canaan, the clowd
is vanished, which ledde them
all the way: And as soone as they
haue but crossed lordan, the
Manna ceaseth, which nourisht
them all the way. The clowd &amp;
Manna were for their passage,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3791:207"/>
not for their rest; for the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
not for Canaan. It were
as easie for GOD to worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
alwayes; but hee knowes,
that custome were the way to
make them no miracles. He goes
by-waies, but till he haue brought
vs into the rode; and then, hee
referres vs to his ordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
That Israelite should
haue been very foolish, that would
still haue said; I will not stirre, till
I see the clowd; I will not eat, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
I may haue that food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Wherefore serues the Ark,

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3791:208"/>
kingdome. If God beare vs in his
armes, when we are children, yet
when we are well grown, he looks
we should go on our owne feet.
it is enough, that hee vpholds vs,
tho hee cary vs not.</p>
                  <p>He that hitherto had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them in the clowd, doth now
goe before them, in the Ark; the
same guide, in two diuerse signes
of his presence. The clowd was
for <hi>Moses,</hi> the Arke for <hi>Ioshuas</hi>
time: the clowd was fit for <hi>Moses;</hi>
the Law offred vs Christ, but
enwrapped in many obscurities.
If he were seene in the clowd, hee
was heard from the couer of the
Arke. Why was it the Ark of the
Testimonie, but because it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
both his presence, &amp; loue?
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3791:208"/>
And within it, were his Word, the
Law; and his Sacrament, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.
Who can wish a better guide,
then the God of heauen, in his
word, and Sacraments? Who can
know the way into the Land of
Promise, so well, as hee that owes
it? And what meanes can better
direct vs thither, then those of his
institution?</p>
                  <p>That Arke which before was as
the heart, is now as the head: It
was in the midst of Israel, whiles
they camped in the desert; now
when the clowd is remooued, it
is in the front of the Army; That
as before they depended vpon it
for life, so now, they should for
direction. It must go before them,
on the shoulders of the sonnes of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:3791:209"/>
                     <hi>Leui;</hi> they must follow it, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
sight, not within breathing. The
Leuites may not touch the Ark,
but onely the barres: The Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
may not approach neerer
then a thousand pases to it.
What awfull respects doth GOD
require to bee giuen vnto the
testimonies of his presence? <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi>
payd deere for touching it;
the men of Bethshemesh, for loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into it. It is a dangerous
thing to bee too bold with the
ordinances of GOD. Tho the
Israelites were sanctified, yet they
might not come neere either the
mount of Sinai, when the law was
deliuered; or the Ark of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,
wherein the law was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
How fearfull shall their estate
be, that come with vnhallowed
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:3791:209"/>
hearts and hands to the word of
the Gospell, and the true Manna
of the Euangelicall Sacrament?
As we vse to say of the Court and
of fire; so may we of these diuine
institutions, we freeze if wee be
farre off from them; and if we be
more neere then befits vs, wee
burne. Vnder the Law, we might
looke at Christ aloof; now vnder
the Gospell, we may come neare
him: He calls vs to him; yea hee
enters into vs.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it onely for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that the Arke must be not
stumbled at, but wayted on, a far;
but also for conuenience, both of
sight, and passage: Those things
that are neare vs, tho they be lesse,
fill our eye; Neither could so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3791:210"/>
thousand eyes see the same
obiect, vpon a leuell, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
It would not content God,
that one Israelite should tell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
Now the Arke goes, now
it turnes, now it stands; but hee
would haue euery one his owne
witnesse. What can bee so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to a good heart, as to
see the pledges of GODs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and fauour? To heare of
the louing kindnesses of God, is
pleasant; but to behold, and feele
the euidences of his mercy, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
delectable: Hence the
Saints of GOD, not contenting
themselues with faith, haue still
prayd for sight, and fruition, and
mourned when they haue wanted
it. What an happy prospect hath
GOD set before vs of Christ
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3791:210"/>
Iesus crucified before vs, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
vnto vs?</p>
                  <p>Ere God will worke a miracle
before Israel, they haue charge to
be sanctified. There is an holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
required, to make vs either
patients, or beholders of the great
works of God: how much more
when wee should be actors in his
sacred seruices? There is more
vse of sanctification, when we must
present something to God, then
when he must doe ought to vs.</p>
                  <p>The same power that diuided
the red Sea before <hi>Moses,</hi> diuides
Iordan before <hi>Ioshua;</hi> that they
might see the Arke no lesse ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,
then the cloud; and the
hand of GOD, as present with
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3791:211"/>
                     <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to bring them into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
as it was with <hi>Moses,</hi> to bring
them out of Egypt: The bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the Arke hadde neede
bee faithfull; they must first set
their foote into the streames of
Iorden, and beleeue that it will
giue waie; The same faith that
ledde <hi>Peter</hi> vppon the vvater,
must carrie them into it. There
can be no Christian without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
in GOD; but those that
are neare to GOD, in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
seruices, must goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others no lesse in beleeuing,
then they doe in example.</p>
                  <p>The vvaters knowe their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
That Iordan, vvhich flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith full streams, when Christ
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:3791:211"/>
went into it, to bee baptized;
now giues way, vvhen the same
GOD must passe through it
in state: Then there was vse of
his water, now of his sand. I hear
of no newes of any rodde to
strike the vvaters; the presence
of the Arke of the Lord GOD,
the Lord of all the World, is
signe enough to these vvaues;
vvhich now, as, if a sinew were
broken, runs backe to both issues,
and dare not so much, as wet the
feet of the Priests, that bore it;
What ayleth thee O Sea, that
thou fledst, and thou Iordan that
thou wert driuen back? ye moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
that yee leaped like rams,
and ye little hills like lambs? The
earth trembled at the presence of
the Lord, at the presence of the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3791:212"/>
God of <hi>Iacob.</hi> How obseruant
are all the creatures to the God
that made them? How glorious
a GOD doe we serue; whom
all the powers of the heauens
and Elements are willinglie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto; and gladlie take that
nature which hee pleases to giue
them? Hee could haue made
Iordan like some solide paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of crystall, for the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
feet to haue trode vppon;
but this worke had not beene so
magnificent. Euery strong frost
congeales the water, in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
course: but for the riuer to
stand still, and runne on heapes,
and to be made a liquid wall for
the passage of Gods people, is, for
nature to run out of it selfe, to do
homage to her Creator: Now
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:3791:212"/>
must the Israelites needs thinke;
How can the Canaanites stand
out against vs, when the Seas and
riuers giue vs way? With what
ioy did they now trample vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the drie channell of Iordan,
whiles they might see the drie
deserts ouercome, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Land before them, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vvaters so glad of them, that
they ranne backe to welcome
them into Canaan? The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
into our promised Land
are troublesome and perilous;
and, euen at last, offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to vs the maine hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our saluation; which, after
all our hopes, threaten to defeat
vs: for what will it auayle vs to
haue passed a Wildernesse, if the
waues of Iordan should swallow
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3791:213"/>
vs vppe; But the same hand
that hath made the waie hard,
hath made it sure: Hee that
made the Wildernesse comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
will make Iordan dry; hee
will maister all difficulties for vs:
and those things, vvhich vvee
most feared, will he make most
soueraine, and beneficiall to vs.
O GOD, as wee haue trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee with the beginning, so
vvill vvee vvith the finishing of
our glorie. Faithfull art thou
that hast promised, vvhich wilt
also doe it.</p>
                  <p>Hee that ledde them about,
in fortie yeers iourney, through
the Wildernesse, yet now leades
them the nearest cut to Iericho;
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3791:213"/>
Hee will not so much, as seeke
for a ford for their passage; but
diuides the waters. What a sight
was this to their heathen aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
to see the waters make
both a lane, and a wall for Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell?
Their heartes could not
choose, but bee broken, to see
the streames broken off for a
waie to their enemies. I doe
not see <hi>Ioshua</hi> hasting through
this channell, as if hee feared,
least the tide of Iordan should
returne; but as knowing that
watery wall stronger, then the
walls of Iericho, hee pases slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
And least this miracle should
passe away with themselues, hee
commaunds twelue stones to be
taken out of the channell of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
by twelue selected men,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3791:214"/>
from euery Tribe; which shall
be pitched in Gilgal; and twelue
other stones, to be set in the midst
of Iordan, where the feet of the
Priests had stood, with the Arke;
That so both land &amp; water might
testifie the miraculous way of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
whiles it should be saide of
the one; These stones were fetcht
out of the pauement of Iordan;
of the other, There did the Arke
rest whiles wee walked dry-shod,
through the deepes of Iordan: Of
the one, Iordan was once as dry
as this Gilgal; Of the other, Those
waues which drowne these stones,
had so drowned vs, if the power
of the Almighty had not restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them. Many a great worke
had God done for Israel, which
was now forgotten: <hi>Ioshua</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3791:214"/>
will haue Monuments of
GODs mercy, that future Ages
might be both witnesses, and
applauders of the great
works of their
GOD.</p>

blood of their vncircumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.
The person must be in fauour, ere
the worke can hope to prosper:
His predecessor <hi>Moses</hi> had like to
haue beene slaine for neglect of
this Sacrament, when hee went to
call the people out of Egypt: he
iustly feares his owne safety, if
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3791:215"/>
now hee omit it, when they are
brought into Canaan: wee haue
no right of inheritance in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Canaan, the Church of
God, till wee haue receiued the
Sacrament of our matriculation:
So soone as our couenants are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with our Creator, wee may
well looke for the vision of God,
for the assurance of victory.</p>
                  <p>What sure worke did the King
of Iericho thinke hee had made!
he blocked vp the passages, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vppe the gates, defended the
walls, and did enough to keepe
out a common enemy: If wee
could doe but this to our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
aduersaries, it were as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for vs to be surprised, as for
Iericho to be safe. Me thinkes I
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3791:216"/>
see how they called their councell
of warre; debated of all meanes
of defence; gathered their forces,
trained their soldiours, set strong
gards to the gates, and walls; and
now would perswade one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that vnlesse Israel could fly
into their city, the siege was vaine.
Vaine worldlings think their ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
and Barricadoes can keepe
out the vengeance of God; Their
blindnesse suffers them to looke
no further then the meanes: The
supreme hand of the Almighty
comes not within the compasse of
their feares. Euery carnall heart
is a Iericho shut vp; GOD sets
downe before it, and displayes
mercy and iudgement, in sight
of the walls thereof; It hardens
it selfe in a wilfull securitie; and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3791:216"/>
saith, <hi>Tush, I shall neuer bee moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet their courage &amp; fear fight
together within their walls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their bosoms: Their courage
tells them of their owne strength;
their feare suggests the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
successe of this (as they could
not but thinke) inchanted gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and now whiles they haue
shut out their enemy, they haue
shut in their owne terrour. The
most secure hart in the world hath
some flashes of feare; for it cannot
but sometimes looke out of it selfe,
and see vvhat it would not. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
had notified that their hearts
fainted: and yet now, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
bewray nothing but resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I knowe not vvhether the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3791:217"/>
heart, or the face of an hypocrite
be more false; and as each of them
seeks to beguile the other, so both
of them agree to deceiue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders:
In the midst of laughter,
their heart is heauy; who would
not thinke him merry that laughs?
Yet their reioycing is but in the
face: vvho vvould not thinke a
blasphemer, or profane man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
carelesse? If thou hadst a
vvindowe into his heart, thou
shouldst see him tormented with
horrors of conscience.</p>
                  <p>Now the Israelites see those wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
cities, &amp; towers whose height
was reported to reach to heauen;
the same wherof had so affrighted
them, ere they saw them, and
were ready doubtlesse to say, in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3791:217"/>
their distrust, which way shall wee
scale these inuincible fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
what ladders, what engines
shall wee vse to so great a worke?
GOD preuents their infidelity;
<hi>Beholde I haue giuen Iericho into
thine hand.</hi> If their walls had their
foundations laid in the center of
the earth; If the battlements had
beene so high built, that an Egle
could not soare ouer them; this
is enough, <hi>I haue giuen it thee:</hi>
For, on whose earth haue they
raised these castles? Out of whose
treasure did they digge those piles
of stone? Whence had they their
strength, and time to build? Can
not he that gaue, recall his owne?
O yee fooles of Iericho; what if
your walls bee strong, your men
valiant, your leaders skilfull, your
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3791:218"/>
King wise; when God hath said,
<hi>I haue giuen thee the City:</hi> What
can swords or speares doe against
the Lord of hostes? Without him
meanes can doe nothing: how
much lesse against him? How vain
and idle is that reckoning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God is left out? Had the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Lords host drawne
his sword for Iericho, the gates
might haue beene opened; Israel
could no more haue entred, then
they can now bee kept from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring,
when the walls were falne.
What courses soeuer wee take
for our safety, it is good making
GOD of our side: Neither men,
nor diuels can hurt vs against
him; neither men nor Angels can
secure vs from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:3791:218"/>
There was neuer so strange a
siege as this of Iericho: Heere
vvas no mount raised, no sword
drawen, no engine planted, no
pioners vndermining; Here were
trumpets sounded, but no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
seene; Heere were armed
men, but no stroke giuen: They
must walke and not fight; seuen
seuerall dayes must they pase a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the walles, which they may
not once looke ouer, to see what
was within. Doubtlesse these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Iericho made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
merry with this sight: When
they had stood sixe dayes vppon
their walles, and beheld none but
a walking enemy; vvhat (saie
they) could Israel find no walk to
breath them with, but about our
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:3791:219"/>
walls? Haue they not traueled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in their forty yeeres pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
but they must stretch their
limmes in this circle? surely if their
eies were engines, our walls could
not stand: wee see they are good
foot-men; but when shall we trie
their hands? What, doo these
vaine men thinke Iericho will be
wonne with looking at? Or, doe
they onely come to count how
many pases it is about our City?
If this bee their manner of siege,
wee shall haue no great cause to
feare the sword of Israel. Wicked
men thinke GOD in iest, when
hee is preparing for their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Almighty hath waies
and counsells of his owne; vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vnlike to ours: which because
our reason cannot reach, we are
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:3791:219"/>
ready to condemne of foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and impossibilitie. With
vs, there is no way to victorie
but fighting; and the strongest
carryes the spoile: GOD can
giue victory to the feet, as well
as to the hands; and, when hee
will, makes weaknesse no disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.
What should we doe
but follow GOD through by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and knowe, that he will in
spight of nature lead vs to our
ende?</p>
                  <p>All the men of war must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
the City; yet it was not the
presence of the great warriours of
Israel that threw downe the walls
of Iericho. Those foundations
were not so slightly laide; as
that they could not indure ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:3791:220"/>
a looke, or a march, or a
batterie: It was the Ark of God
vvhose presence demolished the
walles of that wicked Citie. The
same power that droue backe the
waters of Iordan before, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
laide Dagon on the
floore, cast downe all those forts.
The Priests beare on their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that mighty engine of God,
before which those walles, if they
had been of molten brasse, could
not stand. Those spirituall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses,
yea those gates of
hell, vvhich to nature are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
inuincible, by the power
of the worde of GOD (which
hee hath committed to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of his weake seruants) are
ouerthrowne, and triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
Thy Arke, O GOD, hath
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:3791:220"/>
beene long amongst vs; howe
is it that the walles of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
stand still vnruined. It
hath gone before vs; his Priests
haue carryed it, wee haue not
followed it, our hearts haue not
attended vppon it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
how mighty soeuer it is
in it selfe; yet to vs, it hath
not beene so powerfull, as it
vvould.</p>
                  <p>Seuen dayes together they
walkt this round; They made this
therfore their Sabaoth-daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and who knowes whether the
last, and longest walke, which
brought victory to Israel, were
not on this day? Not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Israelit is stoned to death,
for but gathering a few sticks,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3791:221"/>
that daie: Nowe all the host
of Israel must walke about the
walls of a large and populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and yet doe not violate the
day. Gods precept is the rule of
the iustice, and holines of all our
actions: Or was it, for that reuenge
vpon Gods enemies is an holy
worke, and such, as God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes
to priueledge with his owne
day? Or, because when wee haue
vndertaken the exploits of God,
hee vvill abide no intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till wee haue fulfilled them;
Hee allowes vs to breathe, not
to breake off, till wee haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                  <p>It had beene as easie for God,
to haue giuen this successe to
their first daies walke, yea to their
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:3791:221"/>
first pase, or their first sight of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo;
yet hee will not giue it,
vntill the end of their seuen daies
toyle: It is the pleasure of God
to holde vs both in worke, and
in exeectation; And though hee
require our continuall indeuours
for the subduing of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
during the sixe dayes of
our life, yet wee shall neuer find
it perfectly effected, till the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
euening of our last day: In
the meane time, it must content
vs, that wee are in our vvalke,
and that these walles cannot
stand, vvhen wee come to the
measure, and number of our
perfection. A good heart grones
vnder the sense of his infirmities,
faine vvould bee rid of them,
and striues and prayes; but when
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3791:222"/>
hee hath all done; vntill the
ende of the seuenth day, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be: If a stone or two moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
off from these walles, in the
meane time, that is all; but the
foundations will not bee remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
till then.</p>
                  <p>When wee heare of so great
a designe as the miraculous win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a mightie Cittie, who
vvould not looke for some glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
meanes to worke it? when
vvee heare that the Arke of
GOD must besiege Iericho,
vvho would not looke for some
royall equipage? But beholde
heere, seuen Priests must goe
before it, with seuen trumpets of
rammes hornes. The Israelites
had trumpets of siluer, vvhich
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3791:222"/>
GOD had appointed for the
vse of assembling, and dissoluing
the Congregation, for warre,
and for peace. Now I doe not
heare them called for; but in
steade thereof, Trumpets of rams
hornes; base for the matter, and
not loud for sound; the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and equall measure of those

shrilnes of noyse, or varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
How meane and homely are
those meanes vvhich GOD
commonly vses in the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
workes? No doubt, the
Citizens of Iericho, answered this
dull alarum of theirs, from their
walles, vvith other instruments
of lowder report, and more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
ostentation; and the vulgar
Israelites thought; vvee haue
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:3791:223"/>
as clear, and as costly trumpets as
theirs; yet no man dares offer
to sound the better, when the
worse are commaunded: If wee
finde the ordinances of GOD
poore and weake; let it content
vs that they are of his owne
choosing, and such as whereby he
will so much more honour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as they in themselues are
more inglorious: not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
but the efficacy is it, that God
cares for.</p>
                  <p>No ramme of iron could haue
beene so forceable for battery,
as these rams-hornes: For when
they sounded long, and were
seconded vvith the shout of the
Israelites, all the walles of Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
fell downe at once: They
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:3791:223"/>
made the heauen ring vvith
their shout: but the ruine of those
walles drowned their voice, and
gaue a pleasant kinde of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to the Israelites: The earth
shooke vnder them, with the fall;
but the hearts of the inhabitants
shooke yet more: many of them
doubtlesse were slaine with those
walles, wherein they had trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
A man might see death in
the faces of all the rest, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned;
who now being halfe
dead vvith astonishment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the other halfe from the
sword of their enemies; They
had now, neither meanes, nor
will to resist; for if onely one
breach hadde beene made (as
it vses in other sieges) for the
entrance of the enemie; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:3791:224"/>
new supplies of defendants
might haue made it vp with their
carcasses: but now, that at once,
Iericho is turned to a plaine
fielde, euerie Israelite vvithout
resistance might runne to the
next bootie; and the throats
of their enemies seemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite
their swordes, to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
                  <p>If but one Israelite had knockt
at the gates of Iericho, it might
haue beene thought their hand
had helped to the victory: Now,
that GOD may haue all the
glorie, without the show of any
riuall, yea of any meanes, they
doe but walke and shout, and
the walles giue way. Hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to part vvith any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3791:224"/>
from himselfe: As hee
dooth all things, so hee would
be acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>They shout all at once. It is
the presence of Gods Arke and
our conioyned prayers, that are
effectuall to the beating downe
of wickednesse. They may not
shout till they be bidden. If wee
will be vnseasonable in our good
actions, wee may hurt, and not
benefit our selues.</p>
                  <p>Euerie liuing thing in Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,
man, woman, childe, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
must dy: Our follie would
thinke this mercilesse; but there
can bee no mercy in iniustice;
and nothing but iniustice, in not
fulfilling the charge of GOD:
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:3791:225"/>
The death of malefactors, the
condemnation of wicked men,
seeme harsh to vs; but wee must
learne of GOD, that there is a
punishing mercy. Cursed be that
mercy, that opposes the GOD
of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Yet was not <hi>Ioshua</hi> so intent
vpon the slaughter, as not to be
mindfull of Gods part, and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs:</hi>
First, he giues charge (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a curse) of reseruing all the
treasure for God; Then of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
the family of <hi>Rahab.</hi>
Those two Spyes, that receiued
life from her, now returne it to
her, and hers: They call at the
window with the red cord; and
send vp newes of life to her, the
same way which they receiued
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:3791:225"/>
theirs. Her house is no part of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo;
neither may fire be sette to
any building of that Citie, till <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
&amp; her family be set safe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the host. The actions of our
faith and charitie will be sure to
pay vs, if late, yet surely. Now
<hi>Rahab</hi> findes what it is to belieue
GOD; whiles out of an impure
idolatrous Citie, she is transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Church of God, and
made a mother of a royall,

                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:3791:226"/>
precepts, as in keeping those wee
haue. So much more guiltie are
we in the breach of one, as we are
more fauoured in the number.</p>
                  <p>They needed no commaund
to spare no liuing thing in Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho:
but to spare the treasure, no
commaund was enough. Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie
of execution is easier to
performe, then contempt of these
worldly things; because wee are
more prone to couet for our
selues, then to pitty others. Had
<hi>Ioshua</hi> bidden to saue the men, &amp;
diuide the treasure, his charge
had been more plausible, then
now to kill the men, and saue the
treasure: or, if they must kill,
earthly mindes would more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shed their enemies bloud, for a
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3791:227"/>
booty, then out of obedience, for
the glory of their Maker. But
now, it is good reason, since God
threw downe those walls, and not
they; that both the bloud of that
wicked Citie should be spilt to
him, not to their owne reuenge;
and that the treasure should bee
reserued for his vse, not for
theirs. VVho but a miscreant
can grudge, that GOD should
serue himselfe of his owne? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
blame the rest of Israel, if they
were well pleased with these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
onely one <hi>Achan,</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the peace, and his sinne is
imputed to Israel: the innocence
of so many thousand Israelites, is
not so forceable to excuse his one
sinne, as his one sinne is to taint
all Israel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:3791:227"/>
A lewd man is a pernicious
creature: That hee damnes his

his mischiefe; hee commonlie
drawes vengeance vpon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
either by the desert of
his sinne, or by the infection.
VVho vvould not haue hoped,

Oh righteous people of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
that had but one <hi>Achan!</hi> How
had their late circumcision cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the vncleane foreskin of their
disobedience? How had the blood
of their Paschall Lambe scoured
their soules from couetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?
The world was well men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with them, since their stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne
murmurings, in the desert.
Since the death of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the
gouernment of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> I doe not
finde them in any disorder. After
that the Law hath brought vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conduct of the true <hi>Iesus<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                     </hi>
our sinnes are more rare, and our
liues more conscionable. Whiles
we are vnder the Law, wee do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
so keepe it, as when wee are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from it: our Christian free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is more holy then our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:3791:228"/>
Then haue the Sacraments
of God their due effect, when their
receit purgeth vs from our old
sinnes, and makes our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cleane, and spirituall.</p>
                  <p>Little did <hi>Iosua</hi> know that there
was any sacriledge committed by
Israel: that sinne is not halfe cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
enough, that hath not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
secrecy. <hi>Ioshua</hi> was a vigilant
Leader, yet some sins will escape
him: Onely that eye which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
where, findes vs out in our
close wickednesse. It is no blame
to authority, that some sinnes are
secretly committed: The holiest
congregation, or family, may be
blemisht with some malefactors:
It is iust blame, that open sinnes
are not punished; we shall wrong
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:3791:229"/>
gouernment, if wee shall expect
the reach of it should be infinite.
Hee therefore, which if hee had
knowne the offence, would haue
sent vp prayers, and teares to
GOD, now sends Spyes for a
further discouery of Ai; They
returne, with newes of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their aduersaries: and (as
contemning their paucitie) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> that a vving of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
is enough to ouershadow
this Citie of Ai. The Israelites
were so fleshed vvith their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
victorie, that now they think
no walls, or men can stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. Good successe lifts
vppe the heart vvith too much
confidence; and vvhiles it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
men from dooing their
best, oft-times disappoynts them.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3791:229"/>
With God, the meanes can neuer
be too weake; without him, neuer
strong enough.</p>
                  <p>It is not good to contemne an
impotent enemy. In this second
battell the Israelites are beaten:
It was not the fewness of their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylants
that ouerthrew them, but
the sin that lay lurking at home.
If all the host of Israel, had sette
vpon this poore village of Ai,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>hey had beene all equally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited:
the wedge of <hi>Achan</hi>
did more fight against them, then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ll the swords of the Canaanites.
The victories of GOD go not by
strength, but by innocence.</p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse these men of Ai, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
in this foyle of Israel, and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3791:230"/>
said; Loe these are the men, from
whose presence the waters of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
ran back, now they run as fast
away from ours: These are they,
before whom the walls of Iericho
fell downe; now they are fallen
as fast before vs; &amp; all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
tooke heart from this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Wherein I doubt not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the punishment of Israels sin,
God intended the further obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Canaanites: Like as
some skilfull player loses on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
at the beginning of the
game, to draw on the more abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The newes of their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
spred as far as the fame of
their speed; and euery Cittie of
Canaan could say, Why not wee,
as well as Ai?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:3791:230"/>
But good <hi>Ioshua,</hi> that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Moses,</hi> no lesse in the care of
Gods glory, then in his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is much deiected with this
euent. Hee rends his clothes, falls
on his face, casts dust vpon his
head, and (as if he had learned of
his Maister, how to expostulate
with GOD) sayes, <hi>What wilt
thou doe to thy mighty Name?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Ioshua</hi> might see, GOD
tooke no pleasure to let the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
lie dead vpon the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their enemies; himselfe is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for but lying all day, vpon his
face, before the Arke. All his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulations
are answered in one
word, <hi>Get thee vp, Israel hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
I doe not heare God say, Ly
still, and moure for the sinne of
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3791:231"/>
Israel. It is to no purpose to pray
against punishment, while the sin
continues. And though GOD
loues to be sued to; yet hee holds
our requests vnseasonable, till
there be care had of satisfaction.
When we haue risen, and redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
sinne, then may we fall down
for pardon.</p>
                  <p>Victorie is in the free hand of
God, to dispose where hee will;
and no man can maruell that the
dice of Warre run euer with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
on both sides: so as GOD
needed not to haue giuen any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason of this discomfiture of
Israel, but his owne pleasure: yet
<hi>Ioshua</hi> must now know, that Israel,
which before preuailed for their
faith, is beaten for their sin. When
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:3791:231"/>
we are crossed in iust, and holie
quarrells, we may well think there
is some secret euil vnrepented of,
which GOD would punish in vs;
which, tho we see not, yet hee so
hates, that he will rather be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his owne cause, then not
reuenge it. When we goe about
any enterprise of God, it is good
to see that our hearts bee cleare
from any pollution of sinne; and
when wee are thwarted in our
hopes, it is our best course to
ransack our selues, and to search
for some sinne hid from vs in our
bosome, but open to the view
of GOD.</p>
                  <p>The oracle of God, which told
him a great offence was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
yet reueales not the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3791:232"/>
person: It had beene as easie for
him, to haue named the man, as
the crime. Neither dooth <hi>Ioshua</hi>
request it; but referres that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
to such a meanes; as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the offender (finding himselfe
singled out by the lot) might bee
most conuinced. <hi>Achan</hi> thought
he might haue lyen as close in all
that throng of Israel, as the wedge
of Gold lay in his Tent. The same
hope of secrecie which mooued
him to sinne, mooued him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in his sin: but now, when
he saw the lot fall vpon his Tribe,
hee began to start a little; when
vpon his family, hee beganne to
change countenance; when vpon
his houshold, to tremble and fear;
when vpon his person, to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confounded in himselfe. Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:3791:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men thinke to run away with
their priuie sinnes; and say, Tush,
no eye shall see me: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they
think themselues safest, God pulls
them out with shame. The man
that hath escaped iustice, and now
is lying downe in death, vvould
thinke; My shame shall neuer be
disclosed: but, before men and
Angels shall hee bee brought on
the scaffold, and finde confusion,
as sure, as late.</p>
                  <p>What needed any other eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
when GOD had accused
<hi>Achan?</hi> Yet <hi>Ioshua</hi> will haue the
sinne out of his mouth, in whose
hart it was hatched; <hi>My sonne, I
beseech thee, giue glory to GOD.</hi>
Whom God had conuinced as a
malefactor, <hi>Ioshua</hi> beseeches as a
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:3791:233"/>
son. Some hote spirit would haue
said; Thou wretched traytor, how
hast thou pilfred from thy GOD,
and shedde the bloud of so many
Israelites, and caused the host of
Israel to show their backs, with
dishonour, to the heathens: now
shall wee fetch this sin out: of thee
with tortures; and plague thee
with a condigne death. But like
the disciple of him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> whose seruant
he was, he meekly intreates that,
which hee might haue extorted
by violence, (<hi>My son, I beseech
thee).</hi> Sweetnes of compellation,
is a great help towards the good
entertainment of an admonition:
roughnes and rigor, many times

conuince, or reproue, little good

of the sinne, may well stand
with fauour to the person: And
these two, not distinguished, cause
great wrong, either in our chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or iustice; for, either wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably
hate the creature of
GOD, or vniustly affect the euil
of men. Subiects are, as they are
called, sonnes to the Magistrate:
All Israel was not onely of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
but, as of the loynes of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua;</hi>
such must be the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
such the prouisions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
as for their children; as
againe, the obedience and loue of
subiects must be filiall.</p>
                  <p>GOD had glorified himselfe
sufficiently, in finding out the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:3791:234"/>
wickednesse of <hi>Achan;</hi> neither
need he honor from men, much
lesse from sinners; They can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
him by their iniquities: but
what recompence can they giue
him, for their wrongs? yet <hi>Ioshua</hi>
sayes, <hi>My sonne, giue glory to God;</hi>
Israel should now see, that the
tongue of <hi>Achan</hi> did iustifie God
in his lot. The confession of our
sinnes doth no lesse honour God,
then his glory is blemished by
their commission. Who would
not be glad to redeem the honor
of his Redeemer, with his owne
shame?</p>
                  <p>The lot of God, and the milde
words of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> won <hi>Achan</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself, ingenuously, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially:
a storm perhaps would not

Magistrates and Iudges, must pase
slowly, &amp; sure, in the punishment
of offenders. Presumptions are
not ground enough for the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death; no, not in some
cases, the confessions of the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
It is no warrant for the Law
to wrong a man, that hee hath
before wronged himselfe. There
is lesse ill in sparing an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then in punishing the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>Who wold not haue expected,
since the confession of <hi>Achan</hi> was
ingenuous, and his pillage still
found entyre, that his life should
haue beene pardoned? But heere
was, Confesse, and dye: He had
been too long sick of this disease,
to bee recouered. Had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:3791:236"/>
beene speedy, and free, it
had saued him. How dangerous
it is, to suffer sin to lye fretting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the soule! vvhich if it vvere
washt off betimes with our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
could not kill vs. In mortall
offences, the course of humane
iustice is not stayd by our peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
It is wel for our soules that
we haue repented; but the lawes
of men take not notice of our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
I knowe not whether the
death, or the teares of a malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
be a better sight: The censures
of the Church are wip't off with
vveeping, not the penalties of
lawes.</p>
                  <p>Neither is <hi>Achan</hi> alone cald
foorth to death, but all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
all his substance. The
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:3791:237"/>
actor alone doth not smart with
sacriledge; all that concerns him
is enwrapped, in the iudgement.
Those that defile their hands
with holy goods, are enemies to
their owne flesh, &amp; blood. Gods

                  <p>Only the Hiuites are wiser then
their fellowes, &amp; will rather yield
and liue. Their intelligence was
not diuerse from the rest; all had
equally heard of the miraculous
conduct, and successe of Israel:
But their resolution was diuerse.
As <hi>Rahab</hi> saued her family, in
the midst of Iericho: so these

and both of them, by belieuing

works, is not in the acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

some are ouer-come with those

for weake.</p>
                  <p>Had these Gibeonites ioyned
with the forces of all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they had perished in their
common slaughter; If they had
not gone a way by themselues,
death had mette them; It may
haue more pleasure, it cannot
haue so much safety, to follow the
multitude. If examples may lead
vs, the greatest part shuts out
God, vpon earth, and is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from GOD elswhere. Some
fevv poore Hiuites yeeld to the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:3791:239"/>
Church of GOD, and escape the
condemnation of the world. It is
very like, their neighbours flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at this base submission of the
Gibeonites; &amp; out of their tearms
of honor, scorned to beg life of an
enemy, whiles they were out of
the compasse of mercy: but when
the bodies of these proud Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
and Perizzites lay strawed
vpon the earth, and the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
suruiued, whether was more
woorthy of scorne, and insulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>If the Gibeonites had stayed
till Israel had besieged their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
their yieldance had beene
fruitlesse; now they make an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
peace, and are preserued. There
is no wisedome in staying till a
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:3791:239"/>
iudgement come home to vs; the
onely way to auoid it, is to meet
it halfe way. There is the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of warre, and of danger:
To prouoke an enemy in his own
borders, is the best stay of inuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to solicite God betimes
in a manifest danger, is the best
antidote for death.</p>
                  <p>I commend their wisedom in
seeking peace; I doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their falshood, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of seeking it: who can looke
for any better of Pagans? But as
the faith of <hi>Rahab</hi> is so rewarded,
that her lye is not punished: so
the fraude of these Gibeonites, is
not an equall match to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe;
since the name of the Lord
GOD of Israel, brought them
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:3791:240"/>
to this suit of peace.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is found fitter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
Gods people, then a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
copy of age. Heer are old

that had worne one suit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeeres, seemed new-clad in
comparison of them. It is no new
policie, that satan would beguile
vs with a vaine colour of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
clothing falshood in ragges.
Errours are neuer the elder, for
their patching: Corruption can
doe the same that time vvould
doe; vvee may make age, as
well as suffer it. These Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
did teare their bottles, and

them naught, that they might
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:3791:240"/>

it is a signe wee haue not
consulted with GOD.</p>
                  <p>The sentence of death vvas
gone out against all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of Canaan. These Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites
acknowledge the truth, and
iudgements of GOD, and yet
seeke to escape by a league with
Israel. The generall denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the vengeance of God,
enwrappe all sinners; Yet may
vvee not despayre of mercie.
If the secret counsell of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
had not designed these
men to life, <hi>Ioshua</hi> could not
haue beene deceiued, vvith
their league. In the generalitie
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:3791:241"/>
there is no hope: Let vs come in
the old ragges of our vilenesse, to
the true <hi>Ioshua,</hi> &amp; make our truce
with him; we may liue, yea, wee
shall liue. Some of the Israelites
suspect the fraude; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all their old garments,
and prouisions, can say, <hi>It may be
thou dwellest among vs.</hi> If <hi>Ioshua</hi>
had continued this doubt, the
Gibeonites had torne their bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
in vaine. In cases and persons
vnknowne, it is safe not to be too
credulous: Charitie it selfe will
allow suspicion, where wee haue
seene no cause to trust.</p>
                  <p>If these Hiuites had not put on

and their tongues agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and both disagree from
the truth: Deceit is euer light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
wrapped vp in plausibilitie
of vvords; as faire faces oft times
hide much vnchastitie. But this
guile spedde the better, because
it vvas cladde vvith much plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
For vvho vvould haue
suspected, that clouted shooes,
and ragged coates could haue
couered so much subtiltie? The
case seemed so cleare, that the
Israelites thought it needlesse
to consult vvith the mouth of
the Lord. Their ovvne eyes
and eares vvere called onelie
to counsell; and now their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie
hath drawne them into
inconuenience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:3791:243"/>
There is no way to conuince
these Gibeonitish pretences of
antiquitie, but to haue recourse
to the oracle of GOD. Had this
been aduised with, none of these
false ragges had shamed the
Church of God: whether in our
practise, or iudgement, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
cannot faile vs; whereas,
what we take vp on the words of
men, proues euer either light, or
false wares.</p>
                  <p>The facilitie of Israel had ledde
them into a league, to an oath, for
the safety of the Gibeonites: and
now within three dayes they finde
both their neighborhood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
Those old shooes of theirs,
would easily hold to cary them
back to their home. The march
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:3791:243"/>
of a great Army, is easy: yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three dayes the Israelites were
before their Cities. <hi>Ioshua</hi> might
now haue taken aduantage of
their owne words, to dissolue his
league; and haue said; Yee are
come from a farre Country, these
Citties are neare; These are not
therfore the people, to whom we
are ingaged by our promise, and
oath: And if these Citties bee
yours, yet ye are not your selues.
Ere-while, yee were strangers;
now ye are Hiuites, borne and
dwelling in the midst of Canaan:
wee will therefore destroy these
Citties neare hand, and doe you
saue your people a farre off. It
would seeme very questionable,
Whether <hi>Ioshua</hi> needed to hold
himselfe bound to this oath; for
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:3791:244"/>
fraudulent conuentions oblige
not; and Israel had put in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
caueat of their vicinity: yet
dare not <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
trust to shifts, for the eluding
their oath; but must faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
what they haue rashly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioshuas</hi> heart was cleare from
any intention of a league with a
Canaanite, when hee gaue his
oath to these disguised strangers:
yet hee durst neither repeale it
himselfe, neither doe I hear him
sue to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the high Priest,
to dispense vvith it; but takes
himselfe tyed, to the very strict
words of his oath; not to his own
purposes. His tongue had bound
his heart and hands: so as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:3791:244"/>
might stirre; lest while hee
vvas curious of fulfilling the will
of GOD, hee should violate
the oath of GOD. And if these
Gibeonites hadde not knowne
these holie bonds indissoluble,
they neither had beene so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to obtaine their vow,
nor durst haue trusted it beeing
obtayned. If either dispensation
with oathes, or equiuocation in
oathes, had beene known in the
world, or at least approoued,
these Gibeonites had not liued,
and Israel had slaine them without
sin: Either Israel wanted skill; or
our reseruers, honestie.</p>
                  <p>The multitude of Israel, when
they came to the walls of these
foure exempted Cities, itched to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:3791:245"/>
be at the spoile: Not out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to fulfill Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but to enrich themselues,
would they haue falne vpon these
Hiuites; They thought all lost
that fell besides their fingers. The
wealthy Cittie of Iericho, was first
altogether interdicted them; the
walls &amp; houses either fell, or must
be burnt; the men and cattell kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
the goods and treasure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate
to GOD. <hi>Achans</hi> bootie
showes that Cittie was both rich,
and proud: yet Israel might be no
whit the better for them, carying
away nothing but empty victory;
and now foure other Cities must
be exempted from their pillage.
Many an enuious looke did Israel
therefore cast vpon these walls; &amp;
many bitter words did they cast
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:3791:245"/>
out against their Princes, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of their gaine; whether for
swearing, or for that they would
not forsweare: But how-soeuer,
the Princes might haue said in a
returne to their fraud; We swore
indeed to you, but not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
yet, if any Israelite had but
pulled downe one stone from
their walls, or shed one droope
of Gibeonitish blood; hee had no
lesse plagued all Israel for periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
then <hi>Achan</hi> had before plagued
them, for sacriledge. The sequel
showes how GOD would haue
taken it: For, when three hundred
yeeres after, <hi>Saul</hi> (perhaps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the vow of his fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
slew some of these Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
althogh out of a wel-meant
zeale; all Israel smarted for the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:3791:246"/>
fact, with a three yeares famine,
and that in <hi>Dauids</hi> raigne: who
receiued this oracle from God,
<hi>It is for Saul, and for his bloudie
house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</hi>
Neither could this wrong be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated,
but by the blood of <hi>Sauls</hi>
seuen sonnes, hanged vp at the
very Court-gates of their father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Princes had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
them life; they promised
them not libertie: no couenaunt
was past against their seruitude.
It was iust therefore with the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of Israel, to make slauery the
price both of their liues, and their
deceit. The Israelites had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
been drudges, if the Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites
had not beguiled them, and
liued. The old ragges therefore
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:3791:246"/>
wherewith they came disguised,
must now be their best suites, and
their life must bee toylesomlie
spent in heawing of wood, and
drawing of water, for all Israel.
How deare is life to our nature,
that men can be content to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
it with seruitude? It is the
wisdom of Gods children to make
good vse of their ouer-sights. The
rash oath of Israel, prooues their
aduantage: Euen wicked men
gaine by the out-side of good
actions: Good men make
a benefit of their
sinnes.</p>
