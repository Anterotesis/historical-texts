         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with great charge and hazzard, and the expence of twenty yeers time, which work I did the

that Commoditie rough and unpolliſhed upon pain of confiſcation, and other heavy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in reſpect the grinding, graving, polliſhing, and foyling thereof doth imploy great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of poor people, and afford them maintenance, which benefit doth hereby redound to
the Natives of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Window-Glaſſe</hi>—Is made of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Materialls, as Aſhes, &amp;c. And though the price of Aſhes, is of late yeers raiſed
from 6. 7. and 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. the Buſhell to 9. 10. and 11<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. the Buſhell: And although the meaſure of this
ſort of Glaſſe heretofore was ever uncertain, And that the number of feet formerly contained
in each Caſe of Glaſſe, did greatly differ, As ſometimes the Caſe contained 120 feet, ſometimes
140 feet, and never above 160 feet; Now each Caſe in the meaſure is reduced to a certainty,
always containing 180 feet, And the price alſo certain at 22<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>per</hi> Caſe, at the Furnace doore,
which containing as before, amounteth but to threehalfpence the foot at the moſt. All Window
Glaſſe in this Kingdome is ſold for the price aforeſaid except a ſmall quantity made by me at
<hi>Woolwich,</hi> which work I erected to prevent any ſcarſety of Glaſſe that might happen in the
Winter time, And notwithſtanding I ever ſold the Glaſſe made there to my great loſſe and
hinderance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Green-Glaſſes</hi>—Of all ſorts are made likewiſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Materialls, which works after I had ſuſtained great
loſſe, and undergone great vexation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (in the diſpoſing of them) I let to a Gentleman of
known honeſty, and of experience in Glaſſe, and a man every way reſponſeable for any errour
that can be laid to his Charge, And though I know his Materialls, and Fewell are dearer
then in former times, yet I did never hear of any complaint of his carriage, nor of any price
raiſed by him of his Glaſſe either in the Citie or Country, But that he ſold his Glaſſe at the
rates which were many yeers ſince ſet down by the agreement of all the Glaſſe-ſellers, and
Glaſſe-makers.</p>
               <p>THe whole Manufacture of Glaſſe with Sea-coale, and Pit-coale hath been perfected and
preſerved in this Kingdome by me, with the expence of above 30000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. of my Fortune,
whereby the great conſumption of Tymber and Wood is prevented, Many thouſands
of the Natives of this Realm are imployed and maintained, who (if liberty of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of forraign Glaſſe ſhould be permitted) muſt of neceſſity be deprived of
their means of livelihood, And many others of the Natives are brought up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Myſtery of Glaſſe-making, beſides the great ſummes of money paid for
wages in the ſeverall branches of the Manufacture, are retained in the Kingdome.
There are alſo many other great benefits that accrew to the Common-Wealth from
theſe branches of His Majeſties grants to me, All which particulars, received a full
and deliberate hearing, and examination in the Parliament held in <hi>Anno</hi> 21<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Jacobi
Regis.</hi> And His Majeſties ſaid grant was then priviledged by a ſpeciall Proviſo in the
Act of Parliament then made, with the generall approbation of both Houſes, As by
the ſaid Act may appear.</p>
               <p>From the conſideration of all which reaſons I have taken humble boldneſſe to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my ſuite by way of Petition for a ſpeedy hearing and examination of the Premiſſes
which I beſeech you, to further, when it ſhall be preſented.</p>
