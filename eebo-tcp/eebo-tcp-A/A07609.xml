            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which manner only, he would offer it that tyme) but in his last supper when he consecrated his pretious body &amp; bloud vnder the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and accidents of bread and wine.

               <p>It is therfore to be known, that not only the Sacrifice of the Masse was instituted by our Sauiour in his last supper, but also the name of

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13096:23"/>
him vnto his eternall Father offering him in Sacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyes saying,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That the sacrifice is tearmed</hi> Missa, because the people by the Priest, the Priest by the Angel sends prayers vnto God.</p>
               <p>The second explication makes the word <hi>Missa</hi> to be deriued of the hebrew word <hi>Missach,</hi> which signifies, a voluntary oblation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the 16. Chapter of Deuteronomy v. 10. where our translation hauing <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Oblation</hi>; the Hebrew word corresponding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

                     </gap>. 34.</note> that he doth not doubt but the Blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles tooke this name of the Hebrew, and the Latin Church receauing it of them hath still co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>serued the same. And seing the Apostles and their Disciples euen before Masse was sayd in latin, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the word <hi>Missa,</hi> as hath byn proued, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that <hi>Missa</hi> is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word signifying a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary

offering made vnto God, in gratitude for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and specially for that of the freeing his people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seruitude of Aegypt.</p>
               <p>For this signification doth very properly agree to our most holy Sacrifice of the Masse, in which is offered vnto the eternall Father, his only-begotten Sonne, who voluntarily, and of self-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord offered himself, as <hi>Esay</hi> testifieth, <hi>he was offered because he would:</hi> and our Sauiour to his enemies that were solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to lay plots how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue him of life:<note place="margin">Isa. 53. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <head>That the Masse is an Embassage vnto the most holy Trinity, in the behalfe of humane kind, about the most important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in the World. CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THE Masse contaynes in it so many, so hygh, so Diuine, so Soueraigne mysteries, that one defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13096:25"/>
is not sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same, nor to make manifest the notion therof. Wherfore to explicate what the Masse is, we shall vse the way vsed in declaring thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are immense, and imbrace within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues a kind of infinity, which are declared by many &amp; diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent descriptions; because many put togeather may discouer what one only by it selfe were not able to do. Let this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the first des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first Etymology of the word <hi>Missa,</hi> to wit, that the Masse
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13096:26"/>
is an Embassadge sent by mankind vnto the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trinity, that is, vnto the true and liuing God. By mediation of the Priest, that in the name of all, he treate the affaires of most weight and moment that euer were or can be treated of in the world, as now we shall declare</p>
               <p>First the Masse to be an Embassadge sent vnto the most B. Trinity is cleere, because to God only sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is to be offered, and not to any creature, no not vnto the most holy virgin Mary,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13096:26"/>
the most Excellent of all creatures. So the Priest whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beginnes to offer sayth, <hi>suscipe Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cta Trinitas hanc obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> accept o holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this Oblation: which in the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he repeats againe, <hi>To thee</hi> they offer their vows and prayers, the true eternal liuing God. That this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage to be se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind, or by the whole Catholicke Church, the Preist himselfe signifies, saying in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, This oblation of our seruice and of thy whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. It is tearmed the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or sacrifice of our serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13096:27"/>
that is, of vs Priests and Ministers of the Aultar, who are peculiarly your serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts dedicated vnto your diuine worship and seruice, and we offer this sacrifice in acknowledgment of the seruice and subiection we owe you. And it is not only our offering, that as conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Ministers offer it, but of your whole family, that is, of the whole Catholicke Church, and all your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full who by our handes and ministery offer, &amp; in who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se name we make this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation vnto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:13096:27"/>The same the Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peates agayne straight vpon consecration saying, <hi>wherfore being mindfull, we thy seruants and thy holy people.</hi> We Priests that are peculiarly thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and ministers, and thy Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people all ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning togeather do offer this holy sacrifice. This also the sacred Councell of Trent declares, defining all Masses though priuate and not sayd in publicke, are &amp; ought to be estemeed common, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Priest, as publicke Minister offers them not for himself only, but generally
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13096:28"/>
for all the faythfull that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto the mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ. In summe, is it the most certayne and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall doctrine of the holy Fathers and Deuines, that the Masse is sayd in name of the whole Catholicke Church, and of the whole Christian people; not only the faythfull that liue yet in the world, but also the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased that are detayned in purgatory, because they haue their proper part of fruit in the Masse, being in so great necessity therof; all which the company of the faithfull
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13096:28"/>
both liuing and departed send the Priest as Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to deale their affaires with God.</p>
               <p>Yea which is a thing to be pondered, the Priest goeth this Embassadge in name not only of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that are in the Militant Church, but besides of the Sayntes that now rest in the triumphant, because also to them reacheth part of the fruite of the Masse. For though they haue no need to satisfye for their sins, from which they are already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cleansed, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13096:29"/>
fauours for themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, being in the blisfull possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whatsoeuer they can desire: yet the Masse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles them vnto accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall glory, and helpes them to giue thankes vnto God for the Benefits he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed and still bestowes vpon them; which thing is to them occasion of very speciall conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, because they still acknowledge themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues charged towardes God with an infinite debt of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, &amp; that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fully and perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselues therof.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13096:29"/>
This is that, vvhich the Church signifyes in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Masse, saying that she offers the Sacrifice, to the glory of the most holy Virgin Mary, and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostles, that the same may auayle vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them, and all saints. So that by the Masse honour and accidentall glory comes to all the Saints, and a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ioy which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in regard of the glory that is therin giuen vnto God, and of the thankes so effectually presented vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:13096:30"/>The affaires in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which the Priest treates in this Embassadge, are of highest importance, as any eyther be, or can be in the world. For the busines trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is the acknowledgment of subiection &amp; vassallage, which all creatures owe to their Creatour, and of the Maiesty &amp; Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the same Lord hath ouer all: &amp; in acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to pay him the great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and present him with a gift of inestimable pryce: to giue him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that from him they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13096:30"/>
receaue, to obtayne pardon of their offences committed against them, to request great graces and fauours and reliefe of all necessities, and finally to craue ayde and assistance to attayne vnto glory &amp; blessednes euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: which thinges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradction or question, are the greatest that are possible.</p>
               <p>Hence we may gather &amp; ought much to consider, the great authority of a Priest being at the Aultar, how great a personage he beares, being as it were the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13096:31"/>
Sollicitour general of al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind, and (as S. <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome sayth) like a common Father of the whole world;</hi>

                  <hi>and so it is his duty to haue care of all, as God hath whose vicegerent he is:</hi> or as the same Father saith in another place,<note place="margin">Hom. 5. in c. 6. Esa.</note> 
                  <hi>as a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt God and humane Nature, bringing from thence benefit vnto vs, &amp; conueying from hence our prayers thither.</hi> S.

                  <hi>that the Priest in the celebration of the Masse, hath the office of mediatour, and therfore ought to be intercessour for all sinners.</hi> Which office of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes to himself and other Preists saying;<note place="margin">2.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimur,</hi> we are the Legats or Embassadours in the name &amp; place of Christ. For Christ is the principall Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, chosen to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessour and mediatour of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13096:32"/>
all mankind, to obtayne them pardon of all their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, &amp; all other benefits they haue need of, which office Priests now exercise in his name.</p>
               <p>And the Fathers note, that for this reason that the Priest of the old Testament who was a figure of the Priesthood of the new, in his sacerdotall garment did carry pictured the whole world, as the holy Ghost doth clearly signify in the book of Wisedome.<note place="margin">Sap 18.24.</note>Because as S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others note, by the colour, matter
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13096:32"/>
and fashion of the Priestly garment were signifyed the fower Elements, of which this inferiour world doth consist, as also the celestiall Globes, the starres and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, euen vnto the <hi>Caelum Empireu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which is the Court and Hall where the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed assist. By the leafe of Gold, which he wore on his forhead, wherin was ingraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ineffable name of God, was represented the Lord himself and Creatour of all, who as Monarche, standes and rules ouer the whole Hierarchy of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13096:33"/>
All this doth declare the maiesty of a Priest, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned in his Sacerdotall Robes, when he celebrates the most holy Mysteries as the messenger or sollicitour Generall of all mankind: which considerations are deduced from the first signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word <hi>Masse,</hi> which signifyes a message, or a thing sent.</p>

               <head>That the Masse is a liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Mysteries of our Sauiour, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and mystically perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againe therin. CHAP. IIII.</head>
               <p>LET this be another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Masse. The Masse is a liuely and perfect representatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Mysteries of Christ Iesus our Lord his Incarnation, Natiuity, &amp; most holy life, his Passion, Death, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Resurrection and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Al which is done with so much truth, life, propriety
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13096:34"/>
and perfection, that Christ Iesus himselfe really is there present, and by himself, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his owne person and part, performing by himself the most Diuine and sacred mysteries, a thing worthy of all veneration and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and of most high &amp; attent consideration.</p>
               <p>That this may be better vnderstood, we must call to minde a point of most certaine Christian Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to wit, that Christ our Lord, is the supreme and principall Priest, who by himself really, properly, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13096:34"/>
efficiently worketh the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all Sacraments. Thus though the Priest say <hi>I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thee,</hi> yet Christ is the person, that as principall &amp; efficient cause, washeth the soule, cleansing it from the stayne of sinnes: and though the Priest in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce say <hi>I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue thee,</hi> yet Christ is he that absolueth &amp; releaseth men, freeing them from the giues of sinne, by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Ministery of the Priest, &amp; of that sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall action. This is yet more properly &amp; singularly true
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13096:35"/>
in the most sacred mystery of the Eucharist. Christ is he that worketh that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Transubstantiation, and conuersion of bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Body, and of wine into his Bloud, and the Priest is no more but the instrument &amp; Minister that pronounceth the wordes, in the place &amp; name of Christ himself. And so when the Priest saying in the Canon, <hi>He tooke bread into his sacred &amp; venerable handes,</hi> himself ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the bread into his own sinfull handes: and though he say, <hi>This is my body, &amp; this is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13096:35"/>
my bloud,</hi> yet the conuersion is not made, into the body and bloud of the Priest, but into the body and bloud of our Lord.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teach expresly, that he by himself worketh these mysteries and offers that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, yet by the handes &amp; ministery of the Priest, as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> affirmes.<note place="margin">Hom. 83 in Mat.</note> These be not workes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power: He that did them in that Supper, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me now also doth them: we haue the office of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but he that works, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13096:36"/>
changeth, is Christ himself: which thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so defined by the Councell of Trent.<note place="margin">Trid. Sess. 22. c. 1. &amp; 2.</note> And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is Christ in the Psalmes tearmed Priest for euer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech.<note place="margin">Psa. 109. v. 4.</note> For he should not be tearmed perpetuall Priest according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchisedech, if he offered the sacrifice but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once; but he is perpetual Priest, because he still offers the sacrifice by the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Priests, and neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to offer, and shall not cease to offer vnto the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13096:36"/>
worlds end. Yea to speake more properly, he only is the sole &amp; principall Priest, for though we be tearmed, and are verily Priests, yet we are so only as his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deputies, not his successors in Priesthood but his substitutes, who offer in his name sacrifice, yet the principall offerent is only himself.</p>
               <p>Hence we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that difficile passage of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrews where he sayth; That in the old Law, it was need there should be many Priests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13096:37"/>
they were mortall men, and there was a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity that one should succeed another, that so Priest-hood might be continued: But in the new Law, we haue an eternall Preist which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and continues for euer, and so there is no necessity there should be more then one, as in very truth there is no more, but only one that as principall cause, and in his owne name consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Mysteries, and offers the diuine Sacrifice. And according to this the difference is, that in the old
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13096:37"/>
Law, the children succeeded in the Priest-hood, vnto their Fathers, not as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties or Ministers, but as their successors in the Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall office, exercising the same with the self-same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as their Predece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssours. But in the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Christ only is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Priest, who still actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offers sacrifice where &amp; when he will haue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me offered. Other Priests though they haue the name &amp; office of Preists, yet they be not successours of Christ, nor do offer in their owne
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13096:38"/>
name, nor by that authority as he did vse, but as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and Ministers. For this reason the Councell of Trent affirmes, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged place, that though the Priest be naught and a sinner, this can not destroy nor diminish the value and efficacy of the Sacrifice, for this dependes of, and is answerable vnto the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes of the principall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and not of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is made cleere by this example. If a Prince giue a great almes and send it by the handes of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13096:38"/>
though the seruant be naught and a sinner, and giue it with an ill will, yet the almes therby looseth nothing of his goodnes and merit, because this depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the will and vertue of him that is the principall giuer therof, though he vse ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand. In this sort we, how wicked soeuer we be, cannot hinder or impayre the vertue of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, because we are no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ministers and instruments, celebrating in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ Iesus our Lord.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13096:39"/>
it is a great honour and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of the sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that such a Priest &amp; Bishop doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate &amp; performe them. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered when he sayd: <hi>It was decent,</hi> that we should haue such a Priest, holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, vnspotted, seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from sinners, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher then the heauens: for the law appoints Priests subiect to infirmity, but the Word of the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the Sonne for euer perfect. Oh let all creatures blesse our God for euer, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13096:39"/>
would honour and grace vs, by giuing vs for our Priest and Bishop, not any person lesse then his only begotten Sonne, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs his Ministers in working so soueraigne Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. But it is to be noted, that Christ our Lord is sayd to be the sole High-Priest and principall Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the holy mysteries, not only for the reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared already, because all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Priests offer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate them in his name, by his authority, and as his Ministers: for though this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13096:40"/>
cause be good and sufficient in case there were no other, yet the more principall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and admirable cause is, because Christ himselfe truly and really is present, at as many times, and in as many mysteries, as the most sacred mysteries are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and he concurres thereunto as principall and efficient cause, to worke and bring them to effect, by meanes of the Priest who is his instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; vicegere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p>Hence also proceedeth that the representatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mysteries of the life &amp; death
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13096:40"/>
of our Sauiour made in the Masse, is so liuely, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and naturall, that many Fathers not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so say that the Masse is a representatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mysteries of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as hath been sayd; but exaggerate the thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, affirming that the sayd mysteries are celebrated and wrought a new. Blessed <hi>S. Gregory</hi> in one of his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies sayth,<note place="margin">Hom. 37 in Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.</note> that Christ our Lord dyed once in mortall flesh, but now being ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the dead, and that he cannot retourne agayne to dy, nor to suffer in fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:13096:41"/>
as then he did, he will haue his passion and his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and repeated in the mystery of the Masse, in which he suffers and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes againe his Passion in mysticall manner, for our profit and perfection. In which sense S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> also sticketh not to say, <hi>the passion of our Lord is the sacrifice we offer.</hi> S. <hi>Martiall</hi> one of the seauenty-two Disciples, &amp; S. <hi>Peters</hi> companion, sayth that what the Iewes in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Christ to rid him and his name out of the world did massacre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13096:41"/>
the same, vnto our owne saluation, do we performe vpon the sanctified Aultar, this being the meanes of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing life and chasing away of death, commanded by our Lord himself saying, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In lyke sort, if we cast a right accompt, the whole life of our Lord Christ Iesus fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the instant of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, vntill he last brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed on the Crosse, was no other thing, but as it were the saying of a Masse. In the bowells of the most Blessed Virgin, as in a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13096:42"/>
Sanctuary and Diuine Sacristy, he vested himself with humane flesh, the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall and sanctified orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which he was to offer his Sacrifice: &amp; from thence girded which forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he came forth full of ioy, as a giant the runne the race of redemption· The whole time he liued in this life, was a continuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the sacrifice he was to offer, in so much as he made not a steppe which was not guided to this end, as himself signified saying, <hi>I am to be bathed, and how am I

straitened vntill be performed,</hi> to wit, the bath of his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bloud wherwith he was bathed, shedding the same when he offered sacrifice on the Crosse. The seauenteen howers that his passion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, to wit, from his prayer in the garden when falling into mortall agonyes he was couered with sweat of bloud, vntill he gaue vp the ghost on the Crosse, all this tyme he spent in offering vp the sacrifice. The three houres he liued fastened with nayles to the Crosse, consuming away

through most cruell payne, &amp; much more through the fire of his burning loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes man. These houres he spent in the <hi>Consumation</hi> of that Diuine Holocaust, and in the concluding of that sacred Masse, vntill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken the ablution of gall and vinager he came to say <hi>Ite missa est,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced the words, <hi>It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated,</hi> &amp; bowing down his head gaue vp his spirit. These things so great and magnificent, so diuine and soueraigne, are represented liuely and properly, or to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13096:43"/>
speake with more force and expression, these thinges we celebrate, we repeate, we performe in mysticall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the most sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Aultar: and this is properly to say Masse.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Masse, by all the mysteries of the life and death of our Sauiour, may be made particuler, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat by application therof to one only mystery in this sort. To say Masse is to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrat really the Supper our Lord made with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in the night of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13096:44"/>
and to sit with him at table, and receaue from his hand his sacred Body &amp; the cupp of his precious Bloud; &amp; this not by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, not by figure, but truly, really, properly, as if he were sitting with his Apostles. For the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Apostles cannot be wanting where is personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very Master and Lord of the Apostles consecrating his Body and Bloud, and giuing the same to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles with that very loue &amp; affection as he then gaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it:<note place="margin">Hom. 83 in Mat.</note> and so S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13096:44"/>
to say: This is the same table, the same banquet: the Lord that there gaue his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; Bloud to his Apostles, the very same now giues it to his faithfull: he that did consecrate then, consecrates now, the same meate is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be eaten, the same cuppe is giuen to be drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p>And so we must consider, that speach of the Canon, which we vse when we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the Chalice to consecrate it, <hi>In like manner, when supper was ended, taking also this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Chalice,</hi> which signifies
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13096:45"/>
that the Chalice we now drunk, is the same that Christ consecrated and gaue to his Apostles, not the same cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of syluer, for that these are different, &amp; this, be it the same or not the same, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes not much to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, but Chalice is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the drinke contayned therein, as we commonly say, that a pot of water is drunke vpp not the pot it selfe, but the water therof. And this speech is vsed because wine cannot be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into our handes but in the cup, and so it could not be sayd, that he tooke
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13096:45"/>
the wine into his handes in the manner as he is sayd to haue taken the bread; and for this reason we say he too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the chalice. And because that which is contayned in our Chalice, when we take it into our handes, is a thing of the same kind, as that was contayned in the chalice our Sauiour tooke into his, to wit wine, made of grapes of the wine, and that which is giuen afterward to drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, is the selfe same not only in kind, but also the same in number, to wit, the true Bloud of Iesus Christ: he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13096:46"/>
it is that with reason &amp; truth it is sayd that our Sauiour tooke into his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Chalice, we now vse, and as he did consecrate it then, soe doth he conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate it now, and giue it saying, This chalice is my Bloud which is offered in remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all sinnes Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seing our LORD that keepes the feast is the same, seing the meate that is taken is the same, seing the chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of drinke is the same, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally seing the intention &amp; drift of supping is the same, it is cleere that the supper &amp;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13096:46"/>
banquet is the same. And so our Lord supping with his disciples sayd vnto them, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> He sayd not, represent this, nor doe another thing like vnto this, which may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy this, but doe this very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that I now doe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. Let him be for euer praysed by the Angels in Heauen, that left vs such a memoriall vpon earth.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13096:47"/>
God that was euer offered, or can be offered vnto him. This is the proper definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which doth most essentially declare, what the Masse is; all other definitions that haue been, &amp; may be brought, being made complete and perfect by the Oblation vnto God of that most Diuine Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the true purposes &amp; ends thereof. And this is the most proper office of the Priest, &amp; for this, peculiarly and singularly is giuen the order and power of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and in his soule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13096:48"/>
a character or spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all marke, wherby he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to offer vnto God sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the Masse. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration whereof we are to remember, that mankind being lost by the fall of their first Father, God out of the bowels of his inestimable mercy resolued to repayre the losse, by making men able to offer vnto God a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of such value, as might euen in rigour of iustice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire pardon of their sinns, reconciliation with God, the bestowing of grace and fauour, as much as they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13096:48"/>
should neede; that so they might seeme to haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they were lost by their owne fault.</p>
               <p>This was an inuention of infinite wisedome; but in all mankind, yea within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe of all created things, there was no possibility to offer such a sacrifice. For, sinne against God conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within it selfe demerit and malice, in manner infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it was requisite, that the Sacrifice for the Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne, should be of infinit worth and value, which was not to be found
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13096:49"/>
in the whole vniuerse of creatures, much lesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the boundes of only mankind, who were all by sinne enemyes of God. To ouercome these many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and impossibilities, Gods infinite wisedome and goodnes, inclining him from the beginning to loue men, (loue being the master of strange deuises) sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out a wonderfull way and stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme, so strange that the like was neuer seene in the world, &amp; euen the very Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims were put into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof. For in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13096:49"/>
Court of the most Blessed Trinity, it is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the Word of God and his only begotten Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne should become Man, that being made partaker of the nature of men, their losses &amp; their restitution might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him as their kinsman, and brother of them all. Hence flowed an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him to be the Priest &amp; Sollicitour generall, of all huma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kind &amp; their surety, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him their debts, &amp; their discharge by offering a propitiatory sacrifice vnto God. This sacrifice, being
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13096:50"/>
offered by a man of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me nature as are the rest, was a true and proper sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, &amp; might be of merit and satisfaction, specially being offered by the party indebted &amp; engaged, or by his age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; surety. And on the otherside, the person offering the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, being the true God, (for this neuer ceased nor could cease to be) the sacrifice came to be of infinite value and merit, to reconcile men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to satisfy for their sinnes, and to obtayne whatsoeuer their manifold necessityes might require.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:13096:50"/>And as the Priest was of so supreme dignity, the true and naturall Sonne of God, &amp; the cause of offering sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice so mayne, and of such high importance, it was reason also, that the Victime to be sacrificed, should also corresponde and haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion heereunto. This proportion was not found in any creature existing, nor in any that could be made creatures, being inferiour &amp; without any comparison or proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the dignity of Christ the Priest. And so it was conuenient that this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13096:51"/>
Priest should offer no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oblation or victime, besides his owne human flesh, taken of man, which as being vnited personally vnto the Eternall Word, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes all creatures, &amp; being true nature of man, mortall &amp; passible as others are, was very fit to be offered in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in these wordes.<note place="margin">l. 4. de Trin. c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>What Priest more iust and holy then the Sonne of God? What could be more conueniently offered for men, &amp; by men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh? &amp; what thing more fit, and apt to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13096:51"/>
or immolated then mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall flesh? What thing more cleane could be giuen for the cleansing of sinne, then the Flesh of God borne of the Virginall wombe? And what gift could be more gratefully eyther offered or recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then the flesh of our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, made the body of our Priest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the counsell &amp; designe of the Diuine Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, so much lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, and so entirely wishing the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of mankind. And the Son of God straight accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this office and Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, &amp; tooke to his charge the Redemption of men,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13096:52"/>
and to offer himself in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them. And from that instant he offered vnto his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father all that which in due subsequent tyme he was to performe or suffer for men: which oblation was so pleasing in the sight of the eternall Father, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> straight he pardoned the sinnes of men, and receaued them into his friendshipp, bestowing on them great benefits and fauours, all in trust, and in the vertue of that sacrifice which was to be offered for them: a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice already offered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13096:52"/>
in the aforeseing knowledge and goodnes of God. And though it be a most certayne truth, that all the fauours God shewed vnto men were shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in trust, and confidence of that sacrifice that was in the end to be offered for them, yet his Diuine Maiesty was pleased to require of men for the receauing of these graces, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues should still be offering pledges and pawnes, that at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the full and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent price of their ramsome should be payed. This was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13096:53"/>
the cause of the sacrificing of bruite beasts, and other thinges vnto God, which were figures and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this most Diuine sacrifice, and a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all these fauours they receaued vpon trust &amp; confidence thereof.</p>
               <p>Hence came it to passe that iust &amp; holy men by the instinct of God, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, still offered him sacrifices, as did the Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Abel of the best &amp; fattest of his flocke,<note place="margin">Gen 4.</note> whose sacrifice God approued, shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing his approbation thereof
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13096:53"/>
by a visible signe, se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen fire that consumed the same,<note place="margin">In qq. Hebra.</note> as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Afterward the iust Noe, the great continuing storme of the vniuersall floud being blowne ouer, built an Aultar &amp; offered thereon a sacrifice of the cleane beasts that had been preserued in the Arke. The sacred Text sayth, that God was pleased with the sweet odour of the sacrifice, &amp; that thereupon he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by oath, neuer more to destroy the world by water, and that in testimony therof he would place his rayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13096:54"/>
vpon the Cloudes, for the comfort of men, and their assurance that God was still mindfull of his promise. After this agayne, Noe his Sonne the Great Priest Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech offered the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sacrifice of bread and wine, as also the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Abraham, Noe his Nephew in the eight degree of descent from him, is read to haue made Aultars, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered sacrifices in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So likewise did Isaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, the iust &amp; patient Iob, &amp; other Saynts. In the law of Moyses giuen him ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13096:54"/>
of God, the greatest part thereof contaynes the ceremonies and manners of offering sacrifices, which without question were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God, not in respect of what they were in themselues, but as they were figures, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of that true and most excellent Sacrifice, that was to be offered by his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Law so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peates, that her Sacrifices were a most sweet odour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, certainly not for their owne naturall odour which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13096:55"/>
rather was stronge &amp; noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloud and entralls of brute beasts, but because they figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his only begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Son, of whome S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>That he loued vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for vs an oblation vnto God, and a sacrifice of sweet odour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of grace was come,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tearmes the perfection of the Law, and Christ now had offered that most Diuine Sacrifice of the Crosse, and thereon built, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished his Church, it was
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13096:55"/>
not dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that this most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Religious Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth should want proper sacrifices to giue honour and worship vnto God. Nor was it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient or sutable with the dignity of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament to offer the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sacrifices, seing these were but figures of what now was put in execution: and truth being come, the figure was to cease. Therefore Christ Iesus our Lord the day before he offered this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sacrifice vpon the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the Crosse, in his last supper with his Disciples,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13096:56"/>
doing the office of the true Priest, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchisedech,<note place="margin">Sess. 2. c. 1.</note> (as the Councell of Trent noteth,) ordained, that perpetually in his Church should be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the same sacrifice he was to offer on the Crosse; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he would not haue this perpetuall sacrifice bloudy, nor with those fits and accidents of death, but vnbloudy vnder the formes, and accidents of bread and wine, yet in such ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner that in substance and in essence it should be the very same. And to the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13096:56"/>
end that the defects and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthynes of Priests might not preiudice in any kind, or diminish the value and dignity of a sacrifice so high and Diuine, he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs still remayne with the office and stile of eternall Priest, really, and in truth sacrificing, by himselfe, as principal Priest, other Priests being but his instruments, performing the exteriour ministery: and this is that we do, in the Masse, offer vnto the eternall Father, as Ministers of Christ, the same sacrifice his sonne offered on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13096:57"/>
the Crosse. And in saying, We offer the same sacrifices, we say a world of magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, dignities &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies. For being the same, it must needs haue the same vertue, the same value, the same sufficiency, the same merit, as it then had, &amp; other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable honours worthy of much consideration.</p>
               <p>Now that the Masse is the same sacrifice really &amp; essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, is a truth most certaine seing the same victime is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the same Priest is the principall offerent, the same God vnto whome it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13096:57"/>
and the same reason of offering, as the Councell of Trent defineth, only the manner of offering being different,<note place="margin">Sess. 22. c. 2.</note> that of the Crosse being bloudy, and with the extremities of death, this vnbloudy couered with the externalls of bread &amp; wine, without woundes or sores, or accidents of mortality. To this purpose pertaine the wordes of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Super Hebra. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>One and the same is our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with that Christ offered. For he is our High-Priest who offered the cleansing victime for vs; the same we offer now that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13096:58"/>
then.</hi> Do this (sayth he) in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, not another sacrifice, as did the Priests in the old Law, but the same we still offer.<note place="margin">Homil. 2. in 2. Tim.</note> And S <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, The sacred Oblation what Priest soeuer offers, it is still the same with that Christ gaue his Disciples: neyther hath this any thing lesse then that had. For men do not sanctify this Victime, but Christ himself: who conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated that, doth in lyke manner sanctify this:</hi> which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of great comfort, and worthy of the noting. And for this reason <hi>S. Paul</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes so many tymes in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13096:58"/>
Epistle to the Hebrews, that we haue not in the Church, and that we haue no other sacrifice, besides that which Christ offered on the Crosse. And it is the truth, that that sacrifice was most sufficient, and that we neyther need nor haue any other, but the same sacrifice we daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate and renew on the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Aultar, for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all memoriall and thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing as our Lord himself ordayned, to the end that the vertue of that most suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient sacrifice, may be in particular, with efficacity,

And for the satisfying of this reason was instituted peculiarly that kind of sacrifice tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Holocauste, in which some brute beast was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, burnt &amp; consumed with fyre, wholly &amp; entirely, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13096:61"/>
remayning therof, to signify that whatsoeuer a creature is, all is due vnto God, and all to be offered for his honour and glory.</p>
               <p>And if God would vse his vttermost rigour, &amp; not regard men with a louing and gratious eye, he might most iustly chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that they should offer him in sacrifice their very liues, or the liues of their deerest children, or other things (if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) more deare and pretious vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this cause he commanded in his law, that to him should be offered
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13096:61"/>
all the first begotten of man or beast, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that he is Lord of all, and the best and most beloued thing is due vnto him,<note place="margin">Exod. 13 Gen. 12.</note> often repeating this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof, <hi>Mea enim sunt omnia: For all is mine.</hi> Thus he charged his friend Abraham to offer in holocaust his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne, whome he loued as his owne soule, yet being satisfied with the prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his obedience, and readines to offer euen his owne life, if had God made request thereof, he procured him a Ramme, to be offered
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13096:62"/>
in liew of his Sonne. And with his people, he was contented with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement and ceremony of offering their first begotten Sonnes, with protestation that they were Gods and due vnto him, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty tooke possession of them and receaued them as his owne, but straight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored them backe againe to their parents, neuer permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that in effect any huma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> person should be sacrificed vnto him. Only God gaue his consent, that in his only begotten Sonne, this rigour
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13096:62"/>
should be vsed of being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in sacrifice, because he alone did suffice for all, as being the first begotten of all creatures. On the other side, the Diuell, as being proud and ambitious of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worshipp, and a cruel enemy of mankind, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of people, deceaued and brought vnder his tyranny, that they should adore him by sacrificing &amp; massacring their sonnes and daughters vnto him, as also they did in effect sacrifice a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Innocent Infants vnto their Idols, according
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13096:63"/>
to that of the Prophet Dauid <hi>They did immolate their sonnes and daughters vnto the Diuells &amp; spilt innocent bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second reason or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that men should offer Sacrifice vnto God, is, to giue them thanks for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours he doth them, and to acknowledge that all good thinges come from him, and in gratitude and in place of tribute, to giue him some part of these goods, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, What from thy hand we receaued, we haue offered vnto thee,</hi> and this kind of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is tearmed pacificall and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13096:63"/>
sacrifice of prayse, and of thankesgiuing. In this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice though the beast were wholly offered vnto God, yet all was not burnt, but only the fatt and entralls, &amp; the remaynder was for the foode of the Priest, and of the Officers, to signify here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the goods which GOD giues vs, he will haue vs offer them vp to him, referring all to his glory, with a good hart &amp; inward content; and that the rest be for vs, and for our profit.</p>
               <p>The third reason is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:13096:64"/>
for sinnes, which is called propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or sacrifice for sinne, or for offences. This kind of sacrifices were very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the old Law, where are set downe peculiar sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for euery sinne, which are ordayned, and recorded at large in the booke of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus.</p>
               <p>The fourth title and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of offering Sacrifice is, to request, and obtayne of God the fauours and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we stande in need off. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God is of this dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that with him gifts
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:13096:64"/>
and offerings are of great importance and force to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase vs the graces, for which we are supplia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And this sacrifice is tearmed Impetratory, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime of saluation.</p>
               <p>Now if all this that hath been sayd, be well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and put by meditation togeather, it will most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, that this most holy Sacrifice we offer in the new Testament, hath incomparable dignityes, &amp; vnspeakable eminencies aboue all the Sacrifices that auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly were offered. For
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13096:65"/>
in this only sacrifice, with great aduantage and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, concurre the former fower reasons and tytles, &amp; innumerable other that may be called to minde, as the holy Church iudgeth and signifyeth in one of her col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects or Oraisons saying: <hi>O Lord that by the perfection of one Sacrifice hast fully established &amp; set downe vnto vs all the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the legall Victimes.</hi> And so we shall more largely &amp; perfectly declare how fully the fower afore-mentioned reasons agree vnto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>

so by this sacrifice we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and acknowledge the Maiesty, magnificence, and dignity of our God to be so great, that no lesse is due vnto him then a sacrifice of infinit worthynes &amp; value.

               <p>AS touching the second reason of sacrificing, to wit, thereby to giue thankes vnto God for his benefits done vs, it is apparant with what eminency thankes are giuen vnto God by this our most holy Sacrifice, aboue all other that haue been at any tyme offered in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13096:71"/>
world. For in other sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, howsoeuer great and precious the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were, yet me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not offer all that they had, but only a small portion, reseruing the farre greater part for themselues: as Iacob sayd in his Vow vnto God, I will offer thee the tithes, or the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th part of all the things that thou shalt giue me. What great thing is it, that a man, vnto him that giues all, returne backe agayne the tenth part therof by way of gratitude, retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nyne partes for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? wherfore this kind of

gratitude, is more esteemed by the inward affection of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kesgiuing, in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Sacrifice is offered, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the value and sufficiency of the gift. But in our most Diuine Sacrifice we offer a thing, of farre greater price, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is all that which he hath giuen vs, because we offer him his very Son, whome also he gaue vs that we might offer him, and by this oblation repay whatsoeuer we owe him, seing he doth no lesse discharge the debt that payeth it by that which is freely giuen him, then he

who payeth it out of his owne stocke.</p>
               <p>And if respect be had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inward affection, it is certayne, that the gratitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of all creatures put togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is lesse then the benefits they receaued of God; to supply which defect we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the affection &amp; the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our Lord Iesus Christ.

               <p>AS concerning the third Title of Satisfaction for sinne, the difference is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous betwixt the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sacrifices and this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to satisfy for one only sinne, as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> many tymes affirmeth, specially in his Epistle to the Hebrews, where he sayth, that it is impossible
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13096:74"/>
that by the bloud of bulls or goates sinne should be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. And in the same Chapter he writes to the same effect, Euery Priest is occupied in offering againe &amp; againe the same Victimes or Sacrifices; but this Priest (Christ Iesus) hauing offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one Sacrifice sits for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at the right-ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13096:74"/>
are not able of themselues to satisfy for one only sinne: whereas our great High-Priest Christ Iesus, by one only Sacrifice satisfyed for all the sinnes of the world, and of a thousand worldes were there so many: &amp; this satisfaction is not only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but also abundant, not only equiualent and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but also obtaying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don euen in rigour of iustice as is the most common true Doctrine of the Theologers: for (as S.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13096:75"/>
he consummated for euer the sanctification of men; which <hi>most sufficient,</hi> &amp; superabundant satisfaction, he applyes <hi>efficaciously</hi> vnto vs, as often as we do offer the most holy Sacrifice of the Masse. This is the reason that the most holy Councel of Trent defines, <hi>that this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is truly propitiatory: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God by this Oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by granting the grace and gift of Pennance, pardons mayne and heynous crimes.</hi> Hence it is, that a most graue &amp; Deuout Authour affirmes, that a man hauing committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

&amp; most grieuous sinnes, by one only Masse, which he should say, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient disposition, if there be no default on his part, might be as perfectly freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them all, by vertue of the sacrifice, as he was before he sinned: so that he might strayght enter into Heauen without any impediment.

to be departed this life, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed euery weeke vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne day Masse to be sayd for him.

               <p>AS co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the fourth title, and reason of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sacrifices, to the end to obtayne of God, that which we demaund, it is cleere, that our Sacrifice doth farre excell all other. For if the offering vnto God of a lambe, or kidd, or some other bruite creature, was so efficacious a meanes, to obtayne the thing desired,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13096:79"/>
and therefore such kind of Sacrifices were ordinarily offered; how much greater efficacy is there in the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto him, his very Son with the whole treasure of his merits? Without doubt this is greater beyond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If God made such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by Oath to do fauours vnto him, and to all his posterity, only in regard of the will he had to sacrifice his Sonne; what benefits, and graces will he bestow on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that offer and sacrifice vnto him, really &amp; truly, his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:13096:79"/>
Sonne? what fauours will he not grant? what can one aske with such a present that he will not giue? with reason we may heere vse the wordes of the Apostle Saint Paul: He that spared not his only Sonne, but gaue him for vs all, how can it be, that he hath not giuen vs all togeather with him? Or how can he deny vs any thing that we can aske?</p>
               <p>If the Lawes both human and Diuine, so strictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite vnto Iudges, and Princes (whose office is to gouerne the affayres of the

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bound to do vs fauours, hauing receaued of vs a gift so great and precious as we offer him in the Masse? And if the Prouerbe, that <hi>Gifts breake rocks,</hi> be true, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

shewes it is, there being no hart so hard, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents do not make relent &amp; yield vnto the giuer; how can we thinke that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an hart, not of stone, nor hard, but most sweet louing, mercifull, &amp; inclined to do vs fauours, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to do vs any thing we shall request, hauing taken of vs such a rich gift as we present him in our sacrifice? Certayne it is, that the holy Sacrifice of the Masse is a most efficacious meanes to obtayne of God, all that we desire, so that the Church
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13096:81"/>
did euer vse to say Masses, to aske of God Health, Peace prosperity, &amp; other benefits generall, and particular, as well corporall as spirituall, neither need I stay lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in prouing so cleere and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a truth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I will only here set downe a most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and pious consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a graue and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine of our age, most true, &amp; conformable both vnto Theology &amp; holy scripture. This is, that Christ our Lord now in Heauen though he be not in the state to merit
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13096:81"/>
or satisfy for vs a new, yet he is in a state where he may pray and make intercession for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in verity he doth,<note place="margin">Suare 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tom. 3. in 3. p.

                  <hi>We haue an Aduocate vnto God the Father, Christ Iesus the Iust.</hi> Hereupon this learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour sayth, that it is a thing very credible &amp; likely, that Christ our Lord, as often as the Sacrifice of the Masse is offered, doth intercede and pray for them that offer it,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13096:82"/>
and also for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for whome it is offered. A consideration most true: For seing it is most certayne, that Christ our Lord doth actually and in truth exercise the office of our Priest and Aduocate, seing also that the proper office of Priest is to pray &amp; intercede for the people, we may rest in this persuasion without any doubt, that our Lord being in all his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s most perfect, will complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe this office, not only by offering the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice particularly for them, for whome it is offered,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13096:82"/>
whereof there is no questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also by praying &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding actually for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may obtaine what they request and desire, if the same agree with their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and Gods glory.</p>
               <p>And it may seeme that the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Hebrews, doth signify, or insinuate this truth, where treating of the Eternall Priest-hood of Christ, he sayth, That he can saue for euer them, that by him haue accesse vnto God, who liues euer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede and pleade for vs:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13096:83"/>
and thereupon he straight addeth, <hi>It was conuenient that we should haue such an High-Priest.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> Where he seemes to conioyne praying and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for vs, with the office of Priesthood, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that to discharge that duty perfectly it is necessary that he pray, and intercede for them that are vnder his charge, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for them for whome he offers his Sacrifice: which thing is no wayes inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in Christ, but very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with reason, as the Venerable Father <hi>Dionysius
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13096:83"/>
Carthusianus</hi> notes in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this speech of the Apostle, <hi>Qui etiam inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat pro nobis.</hi> Which also is the Doctrine of that great Saint <hi>Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> Patriarch, who wrytes thus in a certayne Sermon. <hi>When Christ is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed vpon the Aultar, our sayd Redeemer cryeth for vs vnto his Father, shewing the sacred marks of his Woundes,</hi> to saue men from eternall punishments by his intercession.</p>
               <p>This being so (as I do firmely belieue it is) what a soueraigne and excellent thing, and full of reuerence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13096:84"/>
and veneration is the holy Sacrifice of the Masse? If we do highly esteeme that some Saints in Heauen pray par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly &amp; actually for vs, or some person liuing vpon earth whome we know to be vertuous &amp; in singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God; how much more ought we to prize the only Son of God his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intercession for vs vnto his eternall Father? Out of all which it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proued, that this one Sacrifice of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contaynes in it, most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, &amp; with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13096:84"/>
all the perfection, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and efficacy of all the Sacrifices of the old, as the same afornamed Saint doth elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; briefly set down in these words. <hi>It is cleere that no Sacrifice can be offered more acceptable vnto God, eyther to giue him honour, or to render him thankes, or to obtayne pardon, or to deserue glory, then the most holy Sacrifice of the Body, and Bloud of Christ.</hi>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13096:85"/>

This is the reason that the Saints adorne this Sacrifice with so many choice &amp; exquisite Epiphets and tearmes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it a Mystery, Dreadfull,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13096:86"/>
Terrible, Diuine, Deificall, Sacro-saynt, full of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Honorable, Supreme, Singular, and other such Names, that euery where occurre in the writings of the Holy Fathers. Out of whome omitting many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent thinges which they say of the dignity of the Masse, I will only set down two or three short sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which to me seeme most notable.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> writes, that being present at Masse, we must not imagine we are vpon earth, but that we are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13096:86"/>
carryed vp into Heauen, &amp; that we are seated amongst the Quires of Angels, and Seraphims. His wordes are these.<note place="margin">Chry. l. 3. de Sacerd.</note> 
                  <hi>When thou doest behold our Lord sacrificed, the Priest performing his office therin, and the people bedewed, and as it were grained and purpled with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Bloud, do not thinke that thou art amongst men, nor that thou dost abide vpon earth, but rather that thou art transtated into Heauen: and so casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all carnall imaginations and earthly thoughts, with a pure minde contemplate the things of that Celestiall Court. Oh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle!
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13096:87"/>
Oh Benignity of God! who sitting aloft with the Father, at the same tyme is taken into the handes of men, and giues himselfe vnto such as will receaue him.</hi> To the same purpose S. Gregory wryteth in this sort. <hi>What Christian can doubt but that in the tyme of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Heauens open at the voyce of the Priest; and at this very Mysterie of Christ Iesus, the Quires of Angels assist; Earth is conioyned with Heauen; this wale of teares with the pallace of Blisse; and that visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible things meete togeather in one.</hi> A wonderfull, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13096:87"/>
&amp; venerable thing, that at the voyce of a Priest the Heauens should open, that the glorious Court should come down vnto earth, that with the Faythfull of the Militant Church, though poore and sinfull, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Church should ioyne, the King of glory and his Courtiers desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, so that of Heauen and earth is made one Company and Church. What thinge of greater veneration or more strange, then that when the Priest is at the Aultar, many millions of Angells kneele
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13096:88"/>
with greate reuerence about the same, adoring the most holy Sacrifice, &amp; the handes of the Priest that holds it; acknowledging his dignity in this regard to be greater then theirs, seeing to none of them such power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was euer giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our Lord, giuing him the thankes, which wee through our grosnes do not render vnto him; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying other defects which we in this duty commit. Oh holy Angels, how often am I ashamed, &amp; do I blush to consider that you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13096:88"/>
seeing you shall be at the day of Iudgment wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of our vngratitude &amp; rudenes, that God hauing placed vs in so high a state of honour, we do neyther know it, nor esteeme it, nor exercise it with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and reuerence that is due.</p>
               <p>In fine, that quires of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells assist at the time that Masse is sayd, is a most setled and receaued doctrine of the Saynts, namely of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> in his Bookes written of the dignity of Priest-hood. And <hi>S. Chrysost.</hi> deposeth to haue
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13096:89"/>
heard the same of venerable and holy men, to whome God granted the fauour to see this, euen with corporall eyes. S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Euthimius</hi> relates of him, that at the tyme when he sayd Masse, he saw An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels assisting about the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, some ministring vnto the Priest, some prostrate adoring the Sacrament, and all shewing great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> may seeme to insinuate this thing making a comparison and differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the old Testament,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13096:89"/>
and these of the new, and betweene the Maiesty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God descended to giue the Law on the Mount Sina, &amp; that Maiesty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with now he comes downe vpon the holy Aultar in an inuisible manner, he sayth thus. <hi>You are come not vnto a Mountayne, that is felt with the handes, nor vnto a fire which is seene with the eyes, nor vnto stormes and mystes, tempests &amp; the sound of trumpets, but you are come to the Mount Sion, and the Citty of the liuing God, and the Heauenly Ierusalem, and vnto the company of many thousand
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13096:90"/>
Angels, and vnto the Mediatour of the new Testament Iesus, and the sprinkling of his Bloud, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in better manner then that of Abel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Reg. 4.</note> And without doubt if God should ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our eyes, as he did vnto the seruant of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> we might there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold celestiall Armyes, and we should learne the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reuerence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they assist vnto their King and Lord, &amp; perceaue how much they are offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at our irreuerence and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this point, omitting many other

sayings of the Saints, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the veneration and reuerence due to the holy Sacrifice of the Masse, I will only relate the words of the most deuout, learned and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant Father Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> Patriarch of Venice, who wrytes in this manner. <hi>There is not any oblation greater, none more profitable, none more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>

                  <hi>none more gracious in the sight of the Diuine Maiesty, then the holy Sacrifice of the Masse, which restores honour vnto God, company vnto Angels, Heauen vnto banished men, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the worship of Religion, the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13096:91"/>
right of Iustice, the rule of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, the obedience of the Law, giues Fayth vnto Nations, ioy vnto the World, comfort vnto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers, peace vnto People, light vnto the minde, hope vnto them that trauayle, the sight of God vnto them that runne out their race. For by the celebration of these Diuine Mysteries is renewed the memory of the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of our Sauiour, the contumelies he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, the scourges he receaued, the drafts of vinager and gall, the woundes of the nayles and lance. Christ Iesus his assumpted Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is offered vnto the eternall Father, that he may acknowledge
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13096:91"/>
whome he begot, and whome he sent into this world, and by his Mediation grant pardon vnto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his hande vnto the lapsed, life vnto the iustified. We may well belieue that at the tyme of this Sacrifice the Heauen is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Angels behold with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, the Saints singe with ioy, the Iust exult, the Captiues are visited, the fettered are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased, Hell mourneth, and the holy Church our Mother reioyceth in spirit. Hence is gathered with what veneration the Priest ought to assist, to whome the office &amp; authority is giuen, to consecrate this Sacrifice, and to intercede
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13096:92"/>
and pray for the whole world, who therefore ought to be a louer of Gods honour, religious towardes himself, humble of hart, and full of compassion towards the sinnes of his Neighbours.</hi> Wordes worthy of the great spirit of this Saynt, and sufficient to comfort and inflame him that readeth them, and to make him conceaue great respect and reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the most holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Masse.</p>

               <p>And the reason hereof, hath been signifyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, that in all, and euery MASSE, Christ our Lord is the principal Priest, who actually makes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation of that Sacrifice: and the proper office &amp; duty of Priesthood is to giue prayse and honour vnto God. So that Christ in euery Masse is the chiefe worshipper and honour of God, &amp; to make amends for our defects, he, as the chiefe and supreme
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13096:98"/>
Offerer, giues the thankes, the honour, prayse, and worship that is due vnto him: and most certayne it is, that all creatures put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not yet yield vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God so great honour, prayse, and content, as his only Sonne alone can doe. Whence it is conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the Sacrifice of the Masse, aswell in regard of the thing offered, as also in respect of the person that offers: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably exceedes all Religion, worship, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which may be rendred vnto God, by all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13096:98"/>
both of Heauen and earth, that thus Priests may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what soueraigne treasures and richesse God hath put into their handes, whereby they may supply their wants, &amp; enrich their pouerty. It is great pitty to behold with what facility &amp; carlessenes many depriue themselues of such inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasures, only because they will not take a little paynes to prepare themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and make pure their consciences.</p>
               <p>This most high and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consideration, I find to

               <p>Considering with my selfe many tymes, the most high Mysteries of the holy Masse, and the office which God, out of great loue hath bestowed vpon vs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate his most sacred Body and precious Bloud, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13096:99"/>
handle the same so familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and receaue the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bowells: I haue iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and do dayly more and more cleerly and assuredly iudge, that the glory and pleasure which the eternall Father receaues, when the Priest offers vnto him, his most beloued Sonne, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and inclosed within the most venerable Sacrament, is so great, that the glory &amp; pleasure which all the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Angels, and of the rest of the Blessed in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him, in comparison here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is as nothing. For the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:13096:100"/>
works of creatures how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; high soeuer that they be, haue no proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the works of the Creatour: and the Priest that offers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eternall Father, and vnto the whole most Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity, the most vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person of the Sonne, in the Sacrament, offers God vnto God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infinite prayse, infinite glory, infinit content, and finally all goodnes that is, the true and eternall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And the Angels with the whole celestiall Court, how great soeuer their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:13096:100"/>
are that they do vnto God, how great soeuer the honours and contentments they yield him, though they continew for all Eternity, yet doe they not offer God vnto God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all is little or nothing in respect of this most Diuine Oblation, in the which God himselfe is offered.</p>
               <p>To this Consideration, another succeedes no lesse excellent then this, of the great fauours that God doth continually bestow vpon men, and the motiues men haue to loue him, and to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13096:101"/>
render him infinit thankes, honour, prayse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Being in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, I felt within my selfe a certayne internall voyce, saying, that if I wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and desired this, that then no meanes could be found more fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, then to receaue in the state of Grace, and with due preparation, the most holy Sacrament of the Aultar: and after that I haue recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and layd hold thereof, hauing it within my breast and in my power, being at is were Maister and owner
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13096:101"/>
thereof, to giue and offer it agayne vnto the Eternall Father; retyring my selfe for this end, vnto some quiet place, or recollecting my selfe with quiet of soule, in the place I should find my selfe. This Oblation is to be made with the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward desires of the hart, and with most affectious acts of the will, and with all the humility and reuerence that is possible. For giuing and offering vnto the Eternall Father this gift and oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, infinite glory, prayse, and content is giuen and offered
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13096:102"/>
vnto him in regard of the dignity thereof, which ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels of Heauen, nor all the Blessed Saynts, can giue vnto God by any other way.</p>
               <p>Hitherto be the words of this Authour, God of his mercy make vs able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them well, that we may practise according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

               <p>ANOTHER Excellency of the MASSE that is conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of what hath byn sayd, is, that the <hi>Masse</hi> is a thing that most pleaseth, &amp; giueth greatest content vnto the most sacred Humanity of our Lord Iesus Christ, and whereby we do him more seruice and honour, then by any other seruice,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13096:103"/>
or seruices that we can do him. This truth is cleere out of the doctrine that hath been set down. For the will of our Sauiour being so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and conforme vnto the will of his Father, he knowing that his Father by this Oblation, receaues so much honour and glory; in lyke sort his Blessed Soule cannot but receaue the same pleasure and content, seing that (as he sayd) euen why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest he liued in this world, all his pleasure and content was to fulfill the will of his Father.<note place="margin">Ioan. 4.</note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:13096:103"/>Besides which, there is another speciall reason of this doctrine, to wit, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the representation which is made in the Masse, of the Life, Passion, Death, and all the Mysteries of our sayd Lord Iesus Christ. For declaration we must know, that all the Blessed that are in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receaue great ioy, complacence, and content in all the thinges that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, and gaue him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this lyfe, and herein their content is so much the greater, by hovv much the thinges they ioy in, were
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13096:104"/>
more gratefull and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in God his presence. And this is amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so settled an affection, that any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it were possible, would leaue the glory whereof he is possessed, to do, or suffer the same againe and againe many tymes ouer. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs reioyce and be glad of their former torments and paynes, the Monkes and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remits and the rest of the Confessours of their fasts, watchings, Pennances and Mortifications: and they would all haue done and suffered more for God his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13096:104"/>
honour. And seing it is not possible now to returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this World to suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they receaue new ioy &amp; accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall glory, that we vpon earth make Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Martyrdomes labours and merits: and that we offer them vnto God, &amp; that we giue him thanks that he gaue them such grace as they might do him such excellent seruices.</p>
               <p>That which to none of the Saints is gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, is gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the humanity of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour, which being v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto the Diuine Perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13096:105"/>
may haue, or do whatsoeuer the same will wish to haue, or do. And he finding that his Passion and Death, so pleased, and gaue such ioy content and glory vnto his Father, he both was able to inuent, and sufficient to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a meanes, whereby the same may be renewed, and repeated ouer many tymes in such manner, as his Father at euery repetition thereof should receaue no lesse ioy, content, &amp; honour, then he receaued the first tyme the same was suffered and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Crosse: which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13096:105"/>
manner is this, that seing he now being risen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, and glorious in Heauen, cannot returne to suffer and dy againe, he hath ordayned the most sacred Mystery of the Masse, wherein his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Death is so liuely represented, as if he did eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now suffer and dy againe. And this is not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, but also in mysticall manner performed, effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and repeated the very same Sacrifice he offered on the Crosse, being offered a new vnto the Eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the same valew,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13096:106"/>
merit, and powerfulnes as it then had, and as able to giue him pleasure, content, glory, and honour. This we doe when we celebrate Masse, and consequently we yield vnto Christ our Lord the greatest pleasure and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and we doe him the best seruice, that can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be giuen vnto him, and (if we may so speake) we doe him the greatest charity that may be, &amp; herein shew ourselues to be his seruants and friends more then in doing for him all other thinges in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:13096:106"/>And verily we should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme this, as a great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and treasure, and our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues herein most fortunate, that we haue some thinges wherein we may do seruice, and yield pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vnto our most louing Lord and Master Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, specially a thing that we may haue so good cheape, a thing so dew vnto him, who with so much payne, and at the deare rate of his pretious Bloud procured the same for vs, not sparing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny labour, nor stying any difficulty to make the same

profitable vnto vs. And what is sayd of the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Humanity of our Lord Iesus Christ, may be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto, and with a kind of proportion vnderstood of the most sacred Virgin his Mother, and euery other Saynt, that we can do them no better seruice, we can giue them nothing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter content, nothing can we more shew that we are their most affection at frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, then in offering vnto God the holy Sacrifice of the Masse, in their name &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.

               <p>If we be, (as it is reason we should be) desirous to giue vnto the most glorious Queene of the Angels, as much honour and glory, as is due vnto her, we must coming from the Masse, or holy Communion with the like ardent charity, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reuerence, offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her most pure armes her most sweet &amp; louing Sonn, whome we haue in our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody.

Wherefore, it being a thing cleere, what great glory, honour, prayse, and content Priests, &amp; all other Christians may giue vnto God, &amp; vnto the soueraign Virgin Empresse of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the other Saynts of the Celestiall Ierusalem, by meanes of the most holy Sacrament of the Aultar; Let all that haue notice hereof, consider what great cause they haue to spend themselues, and to doe the

Whereunto besides what hath byn sayd, this consideration may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise encourage them, that they may assure themselues, that by the meanes of this rich present, sooner then by any other, they shal obtayne of the Father of Mercyes, &amp; of the Blessed Virgin Mary our B.

excellencyes, and magnificencies, may be sayd of the holy Masse, and are gathered of the former defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, declarations, and explications giuen thereof, which if we should particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly declare, this Treatise would grow of too great a bignes.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13096:113"/>
Diuine Oblation, because the Heretickes of our tyme do oppose specially against these Ceremonies, &amp; impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne the Externall Rite and Worship vsed by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church in the Diuine seruice. Wherfore it is good reason that we, who thinke ourselues happy in that we are Catholicke Christians, and by Gods singular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, true children of the sayd Catholicke Church: it is good reason, I say, that we should think it part of our honour to be opposite vnto the foolish fancies of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13096:113"/>
as much as may be: &amp; by how much they more reprehend and despise the sayd ceremonies, by so much we ought to be more careful and religious to performe them with the greatest reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; exactnes that may be.</p>
               <p>And to vnderstand the ground of these externall Ceremonies and Rites, we are to note, that man being compounded of two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to wit, soule and body, and God being Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Authour aswell of the one as of the other, is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13096:114"/>
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to acknowledg wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God, and adore him not only with soule, but also with body, <hi>for with the hart one belieues vnto Iustice, &amp; with the mouth he confesseth his fayth vnto saluation.</hi> So that it is not inough to belieue with our hartes, but also we must make professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof with our mouth, and so religion bindes vs not only to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God internally with our soule, but also to yield vnto him externall reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and honour with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Hystory lykewise shewes, that the Gentills in their impious worship of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, vsed sundry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse

crremonies. For the Diuel, who was adored by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those Idols, as he still perseuered in his first pride, and sottish enuy, seeking to vsurpe to himselfe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and adoration due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, knowing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Reuerence is a signe and a character of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and in this respect most due vnto the true God; required of his deceaued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorants, and ordayned that they should adore him, and sacrifice vnto him with great variety of externall Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, Rites, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13096:115"/>
And in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we reade, that those most vnfortunate Priests of Baal, did inuocate him with Sacrifices, &amp; with clamors, bending their knees, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating themselues on the ground, and being barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; inhumane, lyke to the Diuell they serued, with knifes did lance themselues till they were all embrued in blood.</p>
               <p>The difference which in this poynt hath been accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of liues and states, is that in the first state called, <hi>The Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:13096:116"/>
as God had not giuen them any written forme of Religion, or Law, there was no set order of these kind of Ceremonies, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one followed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall instinct and inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, who taught them in what manner he would be honored &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by them. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when God gaue vnto his people a written Law, a most principall part therof pertayned vnto the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, and diuerse sorts and fashions of Worship to be by them vsed, in their offering
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13096:116"/>
Sacrifices; praying, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duetyes belonging to the Diuine seruice. Also there were appointed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes of Ministers for the more full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these thinges, some being Priests, some Leuits, some Singers, some Porters, some Exorcists, and diuerse other kindes, euery one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his office and Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry assigned him, with most strict and seuere command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that each of them should be most punctuall &amp; exact in his owne office, without medling with the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13096:117"/>
office of others, enacting most grieuous punishment vnto any that should fayle, though but in small matters: all which appeares by the Books of the Law, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that of Leuiticus, and Deuteronomy.</p>
               <p>It is true that all these Precepts and ceremoniall Lawes are now ceased and abrogated by the Law of the Ghospell, that now is not necessary, yea now it were a sinne to obserue them; but in their place other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies doe succeede, better and perfecter, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:13096:117"/>
and conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with the perfection of the Law of Grace, which the Church gouerned by the ho. Ghost hath established, as receaued and deriued by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from Christ and his Apostles. For though some particular ceremonyes haue been altered and changed, according to the state and conueniency of tymes, yet most certaine it is, that some of them were vsed by Christ himselfe in tyme and place, and as they were conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his person. Thus we reade, that sometymes he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13096:118"/>
prayed on his knees, <hi>positis genibus orabat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> sometymes standing, as in the prayer he made after his last supper, sometymes prostrate on his face,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Procidit in faciem suam,</hi> sometymes lifting vp his eyes vnto Heauen,<note place="margin">Ioan. 17</note> 
                  <hi>Subleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Iesus oculis dixit.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he instituted the most vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrament, hauing ended the ceremonies of the old Testament, he washed the feete of his Disciples, sat downe at the Table, tooke bread into his hands, cast vp his eyes vnto Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gaue thankes vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:13096:118"/>
blessed the bread, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated it, deuided it, gaue it to his Disciples, which were the ceremonyes for that tyme, place, and season.</p>
               <p>After our Sauiour was ascended vnto Heauen, the Blessed Apostles hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the holy Ghost, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presently to vse ceremonyes in the Masse, and ordayned such as were to be obserued, as appeares by most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient formes of Masse by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> composed, and by S. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Disciple, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour of S. Peeter, and by the decrees of other Popes,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:13096:119"/>
and Councels very auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which to auoyde prolixity I omit. The Apostle S. Paul in his Epistle to those of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> appoints that Wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in the Church with their heades couered, and Men with their heades bare, as also many thinges concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the order that they were to keepe, when they did meete togeather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the most Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, saying in the end, <hi>Cetera cùm venero disponam,</hi> I will giue order by word of mouth, about the rest of these thinges when I come
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:13096:119"/>
my selfe. Certayne it it that the Apostle was not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt the thinges essentiall vnto the Sacraments, (for these our Sauiour ordayned, and he only could, and had power to ordayne them) but only certayne ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies concerning the vse of the Sacraments. And so it is a most certayne truth, that the ceremonies of the Church speaking of them in generall be very auncient: &amp; many particular ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies come by traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Christ and his Apostles, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe Bishops,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13096:120"/>
and Councells.</p>
               <p>For it was not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the vse of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and exteriour Religious Rites in the holy Sacrifice of Masse, should be left to the liberty of euery one, because such liberty might be occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many errours, ignorances, and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that the Church should haue the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. The ground of which exteriour obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances is found in the holy Scripture set downe by S. Paul in the first Epistle to those of Corynth the 14.

Chapter, <hi>Omnia secundum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem fiant in vobis,</hi> Let all things be don with order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, which shewes that it is requisite that the Church should ordayne &amp; appoynt order to be kept, euen about the least thinges that concernes this most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice. For if this were left to the choyce &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery one, many indiscreet and vnseemly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies would be vsed: neyther ought any thinge that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes so high a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, be thought little, or of small esteeme, as not to

be done with grauity, and decency: the direction S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> giues, being here of speciall vse, we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour the pleasing of the Diuine eyes, euen in the outward gate and composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our body.

Ceremonies, that were but figures, and shadowes of the mysteries of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how Sacred, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and worthy of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, are these ceremonies of the Church, which wayte and attend immediatly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most sacred Mysteries themselues now present &amp; effectuated? These Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were vsed to the end that with due exteriour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency might be performed the sacrifice of a lambe, or calfe, or of some other bruite beast, or were exercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the handling and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating the most holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Iesus Christ, and his pretious Bloud, and to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and worship with due &amp; religious reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the same true and liuing mysteries, which by those dead figures &amp; shadowes were signified.

the new Testament aboue the old; the same excellency haue the ceremonies now vsed aboue those that then were receaued. And so we may &amp; ought to reason, that that if of those ceremonyes, &amp; the obseruation of them, God made so great an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, greater account with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question he makes of these, seing they are (as hath byn sayd) in many respects much more excellent then the other were.</p>
               <p>We may also giue a ghesse, at great and Diuine thinges by consideration of what
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:13096:123"/>
passeth human thinges, that in respect of them are vayne vile, and childish. It is a wonder to see Noblemen, &amp; Knights that liue in the Court, how perfect they are in the knowledge of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, how curious and punctuall to keepe them. All is reduced vnto Rules and Principles, euery one knowes who is to be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the presence of the King, and who is to be bareheaded, the termes of salutations and courtesies that are to be vsed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other curiosityes; then
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13096:124"/>
reason it is that in them and their exact obseruance, we learne what is to be done and kept in a thing of truth and importance, such as are the ceremonies of the holy Masse. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King drinks it is a sight to behold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, the order, the leasure, the attention vsed, one of the greatest Princes takes the goblet, and with a certayn number of ceremonyes he makes his reuerence, and kneeles whylest the Prince is drinking, with such an humble kind of reuerence that it may seeme he would
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:13096:124"/>
euen put himself vnder the ground. And yet what is a King compared with God? Surely, but a corruptible worme, that hath the name of King made fast vnto him as it were with pins, which yet are not so stronge, but a little blast of infectious ayre is able to take it from him. On the other side co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what we doe, or rather what we omit to do, through negligence, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, want of carefull exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the immortall King of all worldes &amp; ages, who

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13096:126"/>
related by both these Euangelists in those places, is very notable, and of great consideration for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For the modesty and mildnes of Christ IESVS, being exceeding great and wonderfull, that in all the tyme of his lyfe, we do not reade, that he chastised any offence with his owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; hauing seen and dayly seeing so many, and so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and hauing had so many occasions to doe it, that once they would haue cast him downe headlong from a mountayne, and an

other tyme they tooke sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to stone him to death, &amp; diuers tymes they vsed vnto him rude and blasphemous wordes: In all these and many other like occasions, our Sauiour behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with very great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and mildnes: &amp; towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des all sinners in generall he shewed this meekenes in great excesse, scarse euer in any occasion shewing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure or indignation.

might make fire come downe from Heauen, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Samarita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that had byn so discourteous towardes him, as not to let him haue any lodging or entrance into their Citty. All this being so, yet the first tyme that he ascended vnto Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem with his Disciples, finding some that had lost all respect and reuerence towardes the holynes of the Temple, buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and negotiating in the same, though these negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations were about thinges belonging vnto the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13096:128"/>
that were therein day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and howerly offered, yet he tooke such indignation and displeasure against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he made a whippe of certayne cordes he there found, and therewith set vpon them, and droue them out of the Temple, threw downe their tables, cast their siluer and moneys on the ground, rebuked them sharply &amp; with hard tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, in a manner calling them theeues, saying, <hi>Make not of the house of my Father a denne of theeues.</hi> This happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not only once in

Not only for these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects Christians Churches be tearmed the House of God, but also vpon greater
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13096:131"/>
reasons, in regard of which this honorable stile, doth belonge vnto them, much more properly then it did vnto the auncient Temple, to wit, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe dwelleth in them real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; personally in the most Blessed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in which the person of the Worde, and only begotten Sonne of God abides in more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner then in any other parte, or creature in the world.

Presence, &amp; Power, but also the most sacred Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of our Lord Iesus Christ, the which is seated in Heauen at the right hand of the eternall Father; this selfe-some Humanity with the selfe same Glory, Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and Greatnes is really and personally in the most holy Sacrament, though couered with the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall formes of Bread, so that his presence is inuisible, but only vnto eyes enlightned with fayth, who see his wordes verified, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and his promise acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>This is the glory, and most singular priuiledge of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, to haue Iesus Christ the true GOD for their Neighbour, &amp; a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourner in all the Churches of Christianity, in such sort that there is not any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Towne, or Villadge, how small and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible soeuer, wherein our Lord hath not his proper and peculiar house: so that, if in a Village there be but twelue Neighbours, he

For this cause I sayd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, that there is no need to say much of this poynt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we open the eyes of fayth, and consider attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, that Temples be the house of God, and that in euery one of them IESVS Christ our Lord is really,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13096:133"/>
and personally present with all his Glory and Maiesty; a truth most sure &amp; certayne, yea that also many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of Angels accompany him, making the Church his Court therein, yielding him perpetuall prayses and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall honour. And so in the prayer of the holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Office, wherewith the last Houre and Compline is concluded, sayth in this manner: Visit we beseech thee o Lord, this habitation, and let thyne Angels who dwell therin, keepe vs. The glorious Apostle S. Paul in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13096:133"/>
Epistle to the Hebrews see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to affirm no lesse where he sayth,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>You are not come to a materiall mountayne, nor vnto a fire that may be seene, but you are come to the mountayne of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Citty of the liuing God, the Heauenly Ierusalem, the resort of many thousandes of Angels, the Church of the Primitiues.</hi> If this be so, as without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion it is, to the end that we beare due respect, reuerence, and veneration vnto holy places, no more is needfull, but that we open our eyes, and consider the great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and veneration that is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13096:134"/>
due vnto the Holy places, which are the true houses of God where he is present, &amp; hath his aboade, togeather with his Celestiall Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers.</p>
               <p>And if we looke into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture we shall find it a very auncient custome of holy Men, to beare great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto such places where God was present, or did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himselfe in particular manner. In Genesis is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Patriarch Iacob, that flying from the house of his Father to auoyde the wrath of his Brother Esau,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13096:134"/>
the first dayes iourney he was benighted, in a forlorne place. There falling a sleep he saw a great Ladder which did reach from Heauen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earth, vpon the which Angels went vp &amp; downe, and God stood on the toppe thereof. The holy Iacob a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking out of his sleepe, conceaued so great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto that place, because he had seene the former vision therein, that full of feare and astonishment he sayd: How dreadfull is this place, verily here is nothing else but the court of God &amp; gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13096:135"/>
In testimony wherof, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated the sayd place as far as he could, raysing vp the stone that he had laid that night vnder his head, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing it with oyle (which was still taken for the signe of consecration) and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the same there as a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the place was sacred, and honour and veneration due vnto it, because God had therin shewed himself: and vnto the Citty that was neere vnto that place called <hi>Luza,</hi> he gaue the name of Bethel, which signifyes <hi>House of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:13096:135"/>In Exodus, it is recorded that holy Moyses leading the flocke of his Father-in-law through the most soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary &amp; woodiest part of the Mount Horeb, God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him in a very stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and meruaylous manner, to wit, in a Bush which did burn with a great fire, but did not consume. And when Moyses did approach to see the sayd Miracle more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly nigh at hande, the Angell that represented the person of God cryed vnto him: Stand still, approach no nearer for the place wher
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13096:136"/>
thou art is holy land. Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hearing the voyce decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God to be there present fell prostrate on his face, not dearing to lift vp his eyes, nor to cast them towardes the place where God did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. And from that tyme euer after the Mountayne was held in great veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and called the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, the Mountayne of God, as appeares by the third Booke of Kinges, the ninteenth Chapter. In this respect the Apostle S. Peter calleth the Mount Thabor the holy Mountayne where
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13096:136"/>
our Sauiour was transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because there he once, shewed his Maiesty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Now if these places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God once appeared in them became so specially ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and reuerenced, how much more ought our Temples to be honoured where our Lord himselfe makes his mansion and his aboade, as in his ordinary residence and pallace, where he worketh dayly so many wonders, and bestoweth on men so many fauours? If those holy Patriarchs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13096:137"/>
with such humble respect the place, where once or twice they saw God, or an Angel that spake to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his name; what honour would they beare, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect would they shew to our Churchs, had they liued in so happy an age as we liue in, but through rudenes and ingratitude, doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme nor acknowledge our happines? If the holy Patriarch Iacob conceaued such dread and reuerence to the place, where in his sleep he saw a lader on which the Angels went vp and down,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13096:137"/>
what reuerence and dread would he conceyue should he see (as we dayly see with the eyes of fayth) the very Son of God to come down, and place himselfe in the handes of Priests. And this not seene in sleepe or in a dreame, but by sight more certayne, &amp; more infallible then any thing can be, that we see with eyes, and feele with handes; with how far greater reason would he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme: Verily dreadfull is this place, verily God is in this place? And with much more truth haue sayd, verily
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13096:138"/>
this is the house of God and entrance of Heauen? If holy Moyses co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued such feare and reuerence, not daring to looke on the Bush out of which an Angell spake vnto him in the name &amp; person of God, what reuerence would he conceaue, what deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would he declare, if he should enter into our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and see the most vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrament, knowing as certaynly as we do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there God is in person being made Man for our sake, and so sweet and courteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes men, that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13096:138"/>
and eaten of them. Oh holy Patriarches, me thinkes, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your seates of Heauenly glory you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold vs on earth, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to see our stupidity and rudenes, who know not how to esteeme and honour such sacred and venerable places as are our Churches, nor how to enter into them, and stay in them with the dread and reuerence, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son requireth of vs. One day you shalbe our Iudges, and condemne vs as rude &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly, seing we do not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13096:139"/>
