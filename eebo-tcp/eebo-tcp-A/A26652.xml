         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My Brethren in Chriſt Jeſus,<lb/>
I Have had occaſion at my firſt meeting you in this place, and under the <hi>Holy Character</hi> I now bear, to expreſs my hearty and unfeigned Thanks for your great and unmerited Kindneſs to me, in Elevating me to that <hi>High Office</hi> in the Church of God, which the ſenſe of my own unworthineſs and unfitneſs for ſo great a Burthen, did hinder me from aſpiring to. And as I told you at that time, ſo I muſt pleaſe my ſelf in telling you it again, I ſhall endeavour to behave my ſelf in this moſt <hi>Holy Station,</hi> as none of you ſhall have reaſon to repent your Choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Brethren,</hi> Unity was always the Characteriſtick mark, as well as the Bulwark of the <hi>True Catholick and Apoſtolick Church,</hi> and diſcord upon the other hand was always the conſtant attendant, as well as the bane of the <hi>Falſe one.</hi> But it ſeems God for our puniſhment of late, has divided the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and united <hi>thoſe</hi> that have abandon'd the true ſheepfold of Chriſt in the ſtricteſt bonds of Friendſhip. Hence flow our Tears, and here is a Subject that draws the deepeſt ſighs from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of our Hearts. Since then the Divine Providence has Elevated me, tho unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to the <hi>Chair of St. Peter,</hi> I think it incumbent on me to uſe all poſſible means to Reconcile all the Members of the <hi>Holy Church</hi> committed to my <hi>Apoſtolick Care.</hi> The Hereticks do look upon theſe ſad Diviſions which we ſo juſtly regrete, as the happieſt opportunity they can wiſh for, to propagate their Hereſies, and to incroach upon not only the Religion, but the Civil Intereſts of the Catholicks, knowing that the ſureſt way of doing it, is to divide us one from another.</p>
            <p>In order to ſow up theſe unhappy Breaches, I muſt commit to your ſerious and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Conſideration, as being Members of <hi>the Holy Apoſtolick Colledge,</hi> and the <hi>Councel</hi> I ſhall always have recourſe to in matters of difficulty, theſe four Heads, which I deſire you may impartially weigh in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, laying aſide all particular Intereſts whatever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49466:2"/>
The <hi>Firſt Head</hi> is the <hi>preſent War with the Turks,</hi> in which <hi>His Imperial Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>the Moſt Sercne State of Venice,</hi> with their <hi>Allies,</hi> are Engag'd. In this we are to conſider, whether it be more conduceable to the benefit of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> to continue this War, or to make up a Peace with theſe Enemies of our Religion, as being content of the Advantages we have already obtain'd over them. If the firſt be thought fitting, I here promiſe on my part to give all the Concurrence to it that lyes in my power. And iſ the ſecond be found more reaſonable, then conjoint Meaſures must be taken among the <hi>Allies,</hi> that none of them may for their own private advantage, pack up a ſeparate Peace with the <hi>Ottomans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Head</hi> which lyes under your Conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Is the preſent War betwixt His Imperial Majeſty, His Catholick Majeſty, and the Moſt Chriſtian King.</hi> I hope there are none in this <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> but finds it neceſſary for the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> that theſe Princes, who are all of them the great Supporters of Religion, and true <hi>Sons</hi> of the Apoſtolick Church, ſhould be reconcil'd one to another. I confeſs to do this will require the greateſt vigour of mind, and the neareſt application poſſible; and yet there appears no impoſſibility to effect it. If <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>e theſe Princes can be brought to Treat upon terms of Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſome <hi>Neutral State,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Serene State of Venice,</hi> or the <hi>Great Duke</hi> become Mediators for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if you who are Protectors of theſe Crowns, concur heartily in the work, I may ſay there is juſt ground to expect a good iſſue.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Imperial Majeſty</hi> has always manifeſted a love to Peace, and to the Repoſe of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> and at this time, his Intereſt obliges him to continue theſe thoughts; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is in War with an Enemy upon the other ſide, of whom he can gain more, than by a War with <hi>France.</hi> What this <hi>Prince</hi> gains of the <hi>Turks,</hi> is properly <hi>his own,</hi> and is immediately joyn'd to the reſt of his <hi>Hereditary Countries:</hi> But what he ſhould acquire upon the <hi>French ſide,</hi> cannot be <hi>his,</hi> but would accrew to other Princes of the <hi>Empire,</hi> that lye upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The <hi>Catholick King</hi> has no other Quarrel againſt <hi>France,</hi> but that of the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s, and to retain his <hi>own.</hi> And the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> himſelf, if he were well managed, I doubt not but would yield to reaſonable Propoſals, for ſetting things upon the ſame bottom as they were on, by the <hi>Twenty years Truce.</hi> And if there be any ſtop from the affair of the <hi>Election of Cologn,</hi> there may be ſome Methods fallen upon to accommodate that buſineſs, to the juſt ſatisfaction of all parties.</p>
            <p>There is a Third Thing which requires your prudent Conſideration, and that is the Differences betwixt the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> which has been managed with too much heat already: I have reaſon to hope that King will give all reaſonable deference to what we ſhall repreſent to him as neceſſary to be done, in the Affairs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the <hi>Franchiſes,</hi> and the <hi>Reſtitution of Avignion,</hi> eſpecially that we have here his <hi>Extraordinary Ambaſſador,</hi> whom we all know to be a <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſon of great Devotion to the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and ready to take ſuch Meaſures as may put an end to their debates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt thing</hi> which at this time I muſt recommend to your ſerious Conſideration, and which calls for a zealous concern from all of us, is the Affair of <hi>His Majeſty of Great Britain.</hi> How far the Differences betwixt Catholick Princes has occaſion'd that Kings Misfortunes, I need not acquaint you. He is a Prince of our Communion, and devoted to the Holy Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and We as the <hi>Common Father</hi> of the Univerſal Church, are obliged to ſee none of <hi>our Sons</hi> periſh for want of aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Brethren in Christ,</hi>
               <lb/>
I need not enlarge further on theſe Heads, as ſpeaking to ſo Great and Venerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who I doubt not have a great ſenſe of them upon your ſpirits. In fine, let us and each of us in our Station, do all that in us lyes, to diſappoint the Enemies of our Holy Religion in their expectations grounded upon the Differences among Catholick Princes, and let us in theſe Affairs that lye before us, evince to the world that we prefer the true Intereſts of the Catholick Apoſtolick Church before all other Conſiderations whatever.</p>
