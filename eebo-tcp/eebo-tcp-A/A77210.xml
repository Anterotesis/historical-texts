         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Appendix to my humble Petition, lately preſented to the moſt Honourable Courts of Parliament: wherein I did but lightly touch upon the point of Conſecration: Now becauſe as I conceive, the Kings Supremacy is therein denied, I humbly crave leave further to clear up this point.</head>
            <head>Of a Biſhops Conſecration to his Office.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Office</hi> of a Biſhop as I humbly conceive, is a mixt office, partly divine, and partly humane or Civill: It is <hi>Divine,</hi> as concerning the Adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments. It is <hi>Humane,</hi> as concerning the uſe of their coercive power in the Church: For 1. They receive authority to excerciſe a coercive power by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King; and therefore it is humane. 2. It cannot be proved to be Divine, and therefore it muſt be humane. 3. I prove, it is not Divine; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbade his Apoſtles, and in them all the Clergy to <hi>exerciſe authority,</hi> Mat. 20.25, 26. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade it ſaying, Not as though <hi>ye were Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> or people, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. So that this Juriſdiction, Authority, and Coercive power is not divine, becauſe Chriſt forbad it. 4 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power in the Church hath been uſed by Kings, Princes, and Rulers, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.8. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.27. And therefore it is not <hi>divine,</hi> but <hi>humane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Biſhop was ordained a Miniſter, before he was conſecrated and made a Biſhop: and when he ſteps above the Miniſtry, into the office of a Biſhop, then <hi>De novo</hi> he takes upon him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to rule and exerciſe authority and his coercive power over an whole Dioceſs. If then he preach and adminiſter the Sacraments (which few of them do, or do as other Miniſters conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) then he preacheth not as a Biſhop, but as a Miniſter: And when he ruleth over a Dioceſs, he ruleth not as a Miniſter, but as a Biſhop. Whereby it appears, that the office of a Biſhop, as he is a Biſhop, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> onely to rule and exerciſe a Coercive power: and this power is an humane or Civill thing. Hence it follows,</p>
            <p>That being this Authority is humane, it muſt be of and from the King, and muſt be derived from the King, who is ſupream in Authority in or over the Church: The <hi>King</hi> derives his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſupremacy from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. But Biſhops like other Magiſtrates muſt derive all their authority, not from Chriſt immediately, but from the King: Wherefore if the King may have his right, Biſhops muſt be conſecrated onely in the Kings name, not in Chriſts name; for this is to derive from another and higher power than the King, and to make themſelves next unto CHRIST, and equall to the KING, for the King onely is next unto Chriſt: but Biſhops are now conſecrated by authority of Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and <hi>Peters</hi> keys: not in the name of the King, whereby they deny the Kings authority and ſupremacy in the Church, in their conſecration as I conceive it. I have formerly wrote in defence of the Kings Prerogative and Supremacy, and here added this, as being more full, and more cleer.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>But Biſhops may ſay, We have authority from the King, to</hi> exerciſe <hi>our Coercive power: and therefore we acknowledge the Kings Authority and Supremacy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 1. By diſtinguiſhing between an office and the exerciſe of that office. If therefore you own the Kings Supremacy in the exerciſe of your office, yet it followeth not, that thereby you own it in your office, and in your Conſecration to your office: It is evident, that you deny it in your Conſecration, becauſe you refuſe to conſecrate in the Kings Name, and do all in the name of another and higher power. 2. Your authority from the King, to exerciſe your office, doth not imply the Kings Supremacy: thereby indeed you acknowledge the Kings Authority, but not his Supremacy. 3. As far as I can ſee, you acknowledge neither the Kings Supremacy, nor his Authority in your office, nor in the exerciſe of it: For in your Courts, you iſſue out all <hi>Citations, Proceſſes, Summons,</hi> and <hi>Excommunications,</hi> not in the Kings name, but in your own names. 4. Suppoſing but not granting, that in the exerciſe of your office, the Kings Supremacy is by conſequence implied, why then do you not in expreſſe words do it alſo, but refuſe to do it in the Conſecration to your office? For both the office and the exerciſe of it, are wrought to be from the ſame hand and power.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>Again, Biſhops may ſay, We took the Oath of</hi> Supremacy <hi>at our Conſecration, and therefore we own the Kings Supremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſw.</hi> 1. You took this Oath indeed <hi>at</hi> your Conſecration, but not <hi>in</hi> your Conſecration: before it, but not in it: for about a quarter of an hour before Conſecration this Oath is taken: but in Conſecration it is not, nor any words expreſſing or implying the Kings Supremacy: And yet all Magiſtrates in the Kingdome, who exerciſe a Coercive power, do beſides the Oath of Supremacy, take alſo a Commiſſion in the Kings name, as deriving their Authority from him, and ſo ſhould Biſhops do in Conſecration. 2. Biſhops a little before Conſecration, do ſwear that the King is ſupream in Authority, but preſently after in their Conſecration they deny it; for they refuſe to name the King, or own his Supremacy: For they are Conſecrated in the name of another and higher power than the King, as in the name of Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt, and as by the authority of <hi>Peters</hi> keys. Suppoſe, a Judge, high Sheriffe, or Mayor of a City, who after they have taken the Oath of Supremacy, ſhould refuſe to take alſo a Commiſſion for their office in the Kings name? and will derive their Authority from ſome other or higher power, as from the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> would not this be a deniall of the Kings Authority and Supremacy? It will not excuſe the matter to ſay, we firſt took the Oath of Supremacy: and can the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Biſhops from denying the Kings Supremacy in their Conſecration? My humble Petition therefore is, that if it may ſtand with your Honours wiſdome, this <hi>Conſecration</hi> may be altered and changed into a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> in the Kings name; like as it is with all Magiſtrates, who exerciſe a Coercive power under the King.</p>
