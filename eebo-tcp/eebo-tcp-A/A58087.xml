            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

or any faction spirituall or temporall
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Of whom to make a more generall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very:
They first, skrew themselves into the
hearts and thoughts of Princes, villifying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all other Sects and Orders, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to preferre and dignifie their owne; by
which crafty meanes they have inpatronized
themselves into the best Abbyes, Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and other Cloystered and sequestred
places of Religion; and by the supplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of others interessed, and inherited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
by which meanes growing rich and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41686:3"/>
they may the better mannage all
their politick proceedings; the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
followeth.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> lives their Father generall, to
whom the inferiour sort (cald his assistance)
tender due obedience, and these are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd
through all the parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and beare the names of the places in
which they recide, as the assistance of Spain,
of France, of Italy, England, &amp;c. who by
meanes of their correspondents, who disperse
themselves into the principall Cities of that
Province, first informe themselves of the state,
condition, and quality of that Kingdome,
and informe the assistants of all passages and
occurrants, of which they give notice to
the Father generall at <hi>Rome,</hi> who curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
examining them, and conferring
them together, at last conclude to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the affaires of one Prince, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the designes of another, as shall
best correspond with their owne pleasure;
and profit, being most preposterous and
almost against Reason, that these pure
Professors, should onely intend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41686:4"/>
themselves in matters of State, for
raine from their Oath and Order, and in the
meane time carelessely neglect both the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of their owne soules, and others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge, for which the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their society, and brother-hood, was
at the first authorised.</p>
            <p>It is apparent to all men, that they are
Confessors to the greatest part of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
through all the Roman Catholike estates,
not without great prejudice to the Princes
themselves) to which office they were also
to them admitted, by which they penetrate
into every designe and purpose, of which they
give intelligence to their further generall;
and as secrefie is the sole preservation of a
State, without which it is not able to subsist;
and that Princes themselves punish with the
greatest vigour such as discover their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
(as the greatest enemies both to their
owne Principality, and the safety of their
Kingdome) yet the Jesuites by their Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Consultations, which their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondents
have, being planted in the chiefe
Cities of the Christian world, are sincerely,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41686:4"/>
and punctually advertised of all determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
concluded in their most secret Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
and Closets; so that they better know
the power, possessions, expences, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
projects of Princes, than themselves,
suppressing or advancing their affaires at
their pleasures; which they may easily do, by
reason that by their auricular Confessions,
they penetrate even to the very secrets of
their soules; by which meanes the secrets of
State being discovered, breeds sometimes a
jealousie in Princes of, their best and most
faithfull Servants, and Officers, not without
the great prejudice both of the King and
Subject, and indangering the whole state of
the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And to continue their stratagems, the
better these Jesuiticall Machiavells distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
themselves into foure rankes or degrees:
the first consists of secular or lay-persons,
who are joyned to their fraternity, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves wholly to their power and
patronage; and these are for the most part of
the prime Gentry, of both Sexes, wealthy
widdowes, Citizens, and Merchants; from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41686:5"/>
whom by their flattery and insinuations they
draw rich donatives, perswading from some
annuall pensions; and others to forsake the
world, and leave all their revenues, move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,
coyne, and jewels, to enrich their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitating
Monasteries, perswading them
that it will prove meritorious for the health
of their soules, whilst they with these profits;
Feast, and fat their owne bodyes. A second
sort consists of men onely, and these as well
of Priests, as Lay-men; such as professe a seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
life and retired, capable of Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
but with a vow to take upon
them the habit, whensoever it shall please the
Father general to call them unto it; and such
are called Jesuites in <hi>voto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third are those that live in Cloysters
and Monasteries, and these are either Priests,
Clarkes, or Converts, who because they were
not originall of that profession, may by the
authority of the Father generall, be deprived
and degraded (though they before have ty'd
themselves to keep it by oath) and these not
being as yet called to Office, are subject in all
things to the superintendents command. The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41686:5"/>
fourth, are the prime politicke Jesuites,
through whose hands passeth all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion, who labour to reduce
their society to an absolute Monarchy, and
to plant and settle the head thereof in <hi>Rome,</hi>
(where all the affaires of the Christian
world meet together) as in a center, that
being also the seat of the Father generall,
and divers of his agents, who are dayly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the houses of Embissadors and
Courts of Cardinals; by which meanes they
preoccupate the affaires of forra<abbr>i</abbr>ne Princes;
that notwithstanding the importunity of
their Embassadors and agents, nothing can be
there determined, or concluded of, which
stands not with their pleasure, and redounds
not to their profit; by which they are grown
to that pride and arrogancie, that they have
publikely boasted, that they can make Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
Nuntioes; and in temporall affaires,
Lieutenants, Praefects, and Governors; that
their Generall in these times have more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the Pope himselfe; adding, that it is
better, and much more noble to make Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
than to be a Cardinall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41686:6"/>And for their avarice, and greedy accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of wealth and riches, they are so farre
from obeying the Cannon which enjoynes
them to humility, integrity, and austerity of
life: but they ingage themselves into all
temporall affaires, to the great distaste and
detriment of most of the Romish Kings and
Princes; and further, make Merchandize of
Pearles, Rubies, Emeralds, Diamonds, and all
stones of estimation and value, which they
trade in from the Indies, and else where, that
there is an opinion through <hi>Italie,</hi> that the
greatest part of them that are sold in <hi>Venice</hi>
are the proper goods and commodities of
those Jesuites, the ground of which opinion
hath beene received from their owne Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
who have had the sale of them. But to
rip up all their juglings, legerdemaines, stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemeticall
plots, and combustions in state,
which would aske a voluminous Tract, I shall
intreate the Reader to satisfie himselfe for
the present with this compendious and briefe
Preface: onely my purpose being in the next
place to discover them not onely for bloody
Butchers, but most rigorous regicides; their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41686:6"/>
damnable plots and practises, (deserving the
hatred and detestation of all men) which
I shall strive to doe by some few examples;
and if the Tree may be judged of by the fruit,
wee shall easily see what these Iesuites are.</p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>France, Henry</hi> the third of
that name, after he had for their many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and massacres of the Protestants, and
withall their insufferable insolence to him,
caused the two brother Guizes, the Duke and
Cardinall to be slaine at <hi>Chartres;</hi> after being
reconciled to the Protestant King of <hi>Navarr,</hi>
and marching to beleaguer his rebellious
Subjects in <hi>Paris,</hi> being at a place called St.
<hi>Clawds,</hi> hee was most traiterously stabbed
with a knife in the bottome of the belly, by a
Fryer of the Order of <hi>Iacobin,</hi> set on by the
Iesuites, of which wound he dyed the next
day following in the midst of his Army.</p>
            <p>And his successor, first King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and
after of <hi>France,</hi> for his many noble victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
stiled <hi>Henry</hi> the great, having subdued
<hi>Champaigne,</hi> and all <hi>Picardie,</hi> in his returne to
<hi>Paris</hi> was stab'd in the face with a knife also,
by a yong desperate Student, whose name
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41686:7"/>
was <hi>Iohn Chastell,</hi> instigated and set on by the
former faction; for which preditorious fact
he was deservedly torne to pieces with wild
horses, the twenty ninth of December, but
the King by Gods preservation was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of that hurt: For which hee instituted
Knights of the Order of the Holy Ghost, in
Ianuary, being the yeare of grace one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
five hundred ninety five: but this tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
violence offered him was but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of a future, but more fatall disaster.</p>
            <p>For this potent King, the next day after
hee had seene his Queene most magnificently
crowned at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> upon friday being the
foureteenth of May, and in the yeare 1610.
about foure of Clocke in the afternoone, was
murthered in his Coach by two stabs with a
knife, passing the street called <hi>Ferroneny</hi> (by
one <hi>Francis Ravillack</hi> born in <hi>Angolisme</hi>) which
happened after hee had lived sixe and fifty
yeares, and one and thirty dayes, having
reigned in <hi>Navarre</hi> thirty seven yeares and
eleven moneths, or thereabouts, and in
<hi>France</hi> twenty yeares, nine moneths, and
thirteene dayes: but the Traytors death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41686:7"/>
it was so remarkable give mee leave a
little to insist.</p>
            <p>He was by profession a Lawyer; and by
the conjecture of all men, was spurred on to
perpetrate this horrible act by the Iesuites:
though all which hee openly confest was,
that what hee did was by the instigation of
the Devill; and his reason, because the King
tollerated within his Kingdome two Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the manner of his death was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
after being rackt, and enduring severall
sorts of torments in prison, he was brought
thence in his shirt, with a Torch of two
pound weight lighted in his one hand, and
the Knife with which he had murthered the
King chain'd to the other, and then set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in a Dung-cart, the people ready to
teare him in peeces, had not the Officers
restrayned them; thence he was brought to
the Scaffold, where he crost himselfe, to shew
he dyed a Papist: he was next bound to a St.
<hi>Andrewes</hi> Crosse, and his hand chained to the
knife burnt in a furnace of fire and brimstone,
yet would confesse nothing, onely lamentably
roared, but by none pittied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41686:8"/>Then was his flesh pulled off with hot
burning pincers, and oyle, rosin, pitch and
brimstone powred into his wounds, and on
his navell clapt a roundle of clay, into which
was powered molten lead; at the last his body
was torne in peeces with foure strong horses,
which were not able to plucke his sinewy
limbs asunder, till the flesh under his armes
and thighs was cut, and then was hee totally
dis-membred, then were his limbs burnt to
ashes, and cast into the wind, his goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate
to the King, the house in which hee
was borne utterly demolished, and made even
with the earth, never any structure to be built
there after, and his father and mother to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Realme, never more to returne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The like (in the Low Countries) was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted

               <p>IN the yeare of Grace, one thousand six

in Spaine (by the consent of their

of the Iesuiticall Society, (who called
themselves the holy Synod) in which one
grave Seignior, who was the Prolocutor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
as followeth: Deare brothers of the most
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41686:9"/>
Sacred Order, wee being here convented this
day (being the birth day of our Father and
Founder (of ever-living memory) <hi>Ignatius
Loyalla</hi>) it is fit that we consult and determine
of some affaires, that may tend to the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
of our power, the advance of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
and the enriching of our coffers,
(at which there was a generall hum thorow
the Table) when hee proceeded: But as I
have proposed you a thing fit to bee done, so
there ought meanes to be devised and found,
how it may bee accomplished: the course it
selfe, of which I have maturely deliberated,
and in which I crave the assistance of your
counsell, is by setting England and Scotland
(Nations that have too long lived in frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
love and amity) at odds, or to use the
Scottish phrase, at Deadly Feud: which best
how to bring to passe, I sollicite you to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you sundry censures.</p>
               <p>All of them unanimously applauding the
matter, now began singly to speake their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the manner: saith one, I thinke it
may be done by some new plot &amp; practice of
treason: saith another, I suppose rather by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41686:9"/>
sowing some seditious libels amongst them, to
make one Nation jealous of the other: a
third replyed, to invade one of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
by sea, to which purpose they would
sollicite the Catholike Princes to joyne in a
solemn combination: but a fourth cut him off
and said, I like not these attempts by sea, since
the bad successe and utter overthrow of the
great Armado in Eighty eight, though it had
the Popes blessing along, and was by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
stiled <hi>Invincible.</hi> O but, said the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutour,
the reason of that may be easily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for the sinnes of the Land were not then
ripe, which since are growne to full maturity:
But had it then prevailed, with our pistols
and ponyards, steeletto's and knives, whips,
fire, and faggots, we would have made them
taste of that Purgatory here on earth, which
they will not beleeve to have place in any
corner of Hell.</p>
               <p>But to leave others, let mee now acquaint
you with a project of mine owne, that I think
wants president; for policie hath prevailed,
where puissance hath been repulst, and fraud
hath entred, where force could not: for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41686:10"/>
                  <hi>Vlysses</hi> did more in his Tent, then <hi>Ajax</hi> did in
the field. At this all their eares were prickt
up in attention, when he spake on as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
The King of Spaine is stiled the most
Catholike, the King of France the most
Christian King, and the King of England is
titled, Defender of the Faith, having under
his Dominion three Kingdomes, England,
Scotland, and Ireland; the first Protestants,
the second Puritans, the third Papists. Now
in this distraction of religions, how easie is it
to raise troubles and tumults? Now wee have
Iesuites <hi>in voto,</hi> ingenious and active, and fit to
be employed in these deep and mysticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.</p>
               <p>Now if you ask me the manner how? they
are to bee sent over, and disperst into the
Courts and families of Noble-men, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
bought them, or offices in which they
may gaine the best intelligence, by screwing
themselves into the bosomes, as well of the
noble as ignoble rank: now if you object
and say, this cannot bee without charge, and
great disbursments of money? I answer, have
we not Collectors, Receivers, and Treasurers
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41686:10"/>
to that purpose, employed in severall parts of
Christendom: as M. L. the Goldsmith in Fleet-street
for the parts of Flaunders; <hi>M.</hi> &amp; <hi>D.</hi> for
France; Mr. <hi>Borrowes</hi> for Spaine, and others
elsewhere? (these of the English Nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
and them our penetrating and insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Agents and Ministers, being so planted
and placed neare about the Prince, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
persons of those three Kingdomes, they
may take their opportunity, and catching oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
by the fore-lock, find severall tooles
and engines to work with, as to incense the
Papists (with whom our Society is most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced)
against the Puritans, and set them
and other Separatists against the Papists, and
both against the Protestants, to bring in new
Innovations into the Churches of England
and Scotland, such as wee know the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste,
and can worst digest; to alter their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Liturgy, by inserting new additions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their books of Common prayer, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
into Church livings, none but such
as can conforme themselves to all such Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
as shake hands with the Romish Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Doctrines; and to thrust out of
their Benefices, all such as stand stiffe for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41686:11"/>
Reformed Religion, but especially to thrust
in Ceremonies (such as they call Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
Altars, and the like, into the Scottish
Kirk, which Nation we know to be perverse,
obstinate, and impatient of any Innovation
or change, especially in their Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus wanting power to conquer their
Countries, let it be our practice to undermine
and blow up their consciences, ruinating
them in their distraction about Religion; for
what will not men or women hazard, even
goods, lands, nay life it selfe too for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
for what is more deare or nearer to a
Christian than his God and his Religion?
what will cause more dissension, than not to
have freedome of their Religion? Nay, the
very Turke himselfe will not feare to dye,
though a pseudo-Martyr, even by torments
or tortures, ere hee can bee compelled to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Now we knowing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
so constant in his Religion, that hee
will suffer no alteration, the Papist so selfe-will'd
he will brook no reformation, and the
Puritan so obstinate hee will endure no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and all these spurr'd on by our subtill
Agents animation: what seditions, what sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41686:11"/>
what commotions, what combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are probable to ensue thereof; but by
this Incendiary kindled in their Kingdomes,
Ireland may grow tumultuous, Scotland com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions,
and take armes, and Englands peace
bee altogether disturbed and disquieted at
least, to the exhausting of their treasure, if
not their blouds, to their great detriment, if
not their generall desolation: and in these
jealousies and troubles, to bring in forraine
Forces, there would be some hope to attaine
our ends. Which speech being gravely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
was by the rest greatly applauded, and
the Assembly dissolved, with a determinate
resolution to put all the former projects in
speedy practice with an <hi>Et caetera.</hi>

Clergy? Her damage by water, when her
barge at a low ebbe grated upon the arches of
the Bridge, when shee was sent a prisoner to
the Tower? by fire, when her lodgings were
burnt over her head, during her confinement
at Woodstock. In the beginning of her
reigne, what complotting by the Iesuites of
Spaine, France, and Italy, to supplant her from
her true and lawfull inheritance, by dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
her Subjects from their loyalty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>Troubles also were raised in her Kingdom
of Ireland by one <hi>Nicolas Saunders,</hi> a pestilent
Traytour, and one of that seditious Order,
whose pen and tongue spared not only mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
to calumniate the Queene her selfe,
but the Lady <hi>Anne Bulleine</hi> her mother, who
having purchased a consecrated Banner with
power Legantine, landed amongst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
whither was sent also <hi>S. Iosephus</hi> with an

the revolted Earle of Desmond, his brother
<hi>
                     <unclear>Fitz</unclear> Morris,</hi> and others: but their army was

and <hi>Saunders</hi> fell mad, and dyes starved in the

The like machinations were devised against
her by Cardinall <hi>Allen, Englefield,</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi>
as also by Doctor <hi>Parry,</hi> by travell Hispani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied,

               <p>I will conclude all the Iesuitical Treasons
against her (and those by her own Subjects,)
which that as <hi>Edward Squire</hi> are belonging to
the Queenes stable, who beeing in <hi>Spaine</hi>

by one <hi>Walpoole</hi> a revolted runnagate,
and entred into the Iesuiticall order (one of

the pummell of her saddle, who after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>England</hi> attending his opportunity,
one day when her Majesty was to take horse,
came openly with a smiling countenance in
the presence of many, and having prickt the
bladder, and wearing a thick tand glove for
his owne security, chapt his hand vpon the
pummell of the saddle, and with a lowd and
cheerefull voyce sayd God save the Queene:
but it pleased God out of his mercifull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to take his word not his meaning; for
neither mounting, nor alighting, nor all
the way shee roade, (wearing a thinne glove)
shee once layd her hand vpon the pummell?
but the Treason beeing after discovered, he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41686:13"/>
by his owne conviction was convicted and

to raigne over <hi>Israel</hi> til the people made him
King vpon the foolish answer of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but
yet notwithstanding all their syllogisticall
Flourishers, it was proved vnto them (to their
costs,) That in <hi>England</hi> there is no <hi>Interregum,</hi>
because the King never dyeth, and that the
Coronation is but a ceremony to shew the
Prince to the people, for which onely there
dyed (which was the Kings great mercy)
the two Iesnits <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ninth of November, and <hi>George Brookes,</hi>
vpon the first of December next ensuing.</p>
               <p>But that Damnable and Diabollicall plot
of the Gunpowder arch-Treason, exceedeth
all president or example, the like from the
beginning of time not read or heard: hatcht
in the Iesuiticall nest of that most bloudy
Brotherhood, which because it is yearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
in every Pulpet almost thorow the
Kingdome, I spare further to aggravate, only
to put the reader in minde that no such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
act could be put in agitation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Iesuit to prompt and further it: witnes
Father <hi>Garnet</hi> an arch provinciall Priest of
that murder, who as the rest of those conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours
in that satannical Conjuration dyed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41686:14"/>
the death of a Traytour being drawn, hangd,
and quartered.</p>
               <p>Now to descend as low as the Raigne of
our Soveraigne Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> even but
yesterday, since the beginning of this now
hopefull Parliament, one <hi>Iohn Iames</hi> a <hi>Kentish</hi>
man a Iesuiticall Romist, thinking now by a
pretended madnesse to colour his notorious
mischiefe, in <hi>Westminsterhall,</hi> in the very face
<figure/>
of the Iudiciall Courts, with a rusty dagger,
stabbed Iustice <hi>Heywood,</hi> as he was going to
the parliament house to deliver up a catalog
of divers papists and Iesuits names which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41686:15"/>
in or about <hi>Westminster,</hi> who being
commanded, and according to his office, to
give notice thereof, for the good of his king
and Country, was violently (as I sayd before)
assaulted and stabbed in the side, thinking
to have deprived him of his life, which God
be thanked, proved otherwise, and this was
by the Iesuiticall faction held a meritorious
act: Thus doth these Iesuits still persist in
their malice and spleene against King and
State, contriving and plotting mischiefe even
upon their beds, for their study is onely for
blood, their Religion is Rebellion, their
treaties are only treacheries, their plots are
only powder-plots, their matches are onely
to out-match us, even by gun-powder and
match, their pollicies are pestilences, their
union is onely tending to a dis-union, and
their devotions are cozening devotions. They
will by their power depose Emperours, and
kill Kings, stab and poyson princes; for how
many princes have suffered by and thorough
their divellish and inhumane murders and
conspiracies. It was surely one of their
plots to urge our Bishops to make those new
Cannons, and to put in the word <hi>Et caetera,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41686:15"/>
that they might be heard to roare like a Bull
as farre as <hi>Rome,</hi> and all these devices are
covered with a cloake of religion, even with
a long cloake of knavery reaching down to
their heeles.</p>
               <p>These are but a few amongst many, and
ere I proceed any further, I must intreate
the indifferent and unpartiall Reader, to
take some things necessary into his considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
First how the adversaries spare not both
in their words and writings bitterly to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse
and condemne the severity of the
Lawes, for the cutting of such pestilent
and preditorious Malefactors, as if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
were all conscience and Christianity, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellously
traducing them, as if they were
like <hi>Braccoas</hi> (the Legislator amongst the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi>)
writ in blood, pretending ours to
bee a meere usurped power, no better than
Tyranny, whom their bloody and mercilesse
persecutions, they strive to mittigate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuat
by the countenance and authoritie of
the Church, and Apostolicall Iurisdiction,
when Christ himselfe left as his last Legacy
upon earth, his peace amongst them; when
the Apostles never assumed to themselves any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41686:16"/>
Pontificall state and habite, but were Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and teachers of the Word: when all
their successors in the Primitive Church were
so far from being persecutors, that themselves
patiently suffered persecution and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for the Gospell sake: when the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
prelates of these times; instigated and
spurd on by their Iesuiticall Engineeres, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Prayer, Fasting, Exhortation, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
and pious instruction, deale al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
in Fire and Faggot Daggers, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolls,
powder-plots, and the like, excluding
all mercy and charity, so they can but adde
the least Mite to their Papall Monarchy.</p>
               <p>When on the contrary our Lawes stretch
no further than to punish runnagates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters
of our owne Nation; such as being
borne naturall subjects renounce their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to their lawfull Prince and Soveraigne,
transplanting themselves into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
acknowledging forraigne supreams, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that supremacy of their owne naturall
Liege, refusing to subscribe to the oath of
allegiance; and not herewith contented, they
most traiterously seeke to seduce and alienate
the hearts of the subjects from their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41686:16"/>
faith, and obedience, in contempt of the Lawes,
which in duty and conscience by the Lawes of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they are bound to observe. Nor are these just
punishments inflicted upon their capitoll delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
without giving them warning to flie and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Realme: but upon their peremptory and
willfull returne in despight of Proclamation, and
meere contempt both of prerogative and Parlamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
authority they as it were dare justice, and in their
selfe-wild obstinacy thrust themselves into the hands
of the hangman, as if they were borne hereditary to
the halter.</p>
               <p>For instance, (and which is now at this present in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation)
one <hi>Iohn Goodman,</hi> a Priest and Iesuite, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all former caveats and premonitions,

away, and brought unto his tryall, having all the
favour that could be shewne to a Malefactor in that
kind, by his owne free and voluntary confession accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and condemn'd himself, and when judgment must
of necessity (as in all such cases) be, and was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against him, yet the Kings Majesty out of his great
and unbounded clemency &amp; mercy, when he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be drawn to execution, sent him a Reprieve for
his life: and since being delivered up unto the high
Court of Parlament, they, in hope of his reformation,
and recantation, have not as yet proceeded against
his life; unto whose mercy I leave him, &amp; with whom
I conclude this briefe Tractate: Desiring with all the
Reader to take further into his consideration the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of our lawes, and the milde proceedings therein
to spare Christian blood: when on the contrary, our
adversaries with their <hi>Corrigidoes</hi> and Catchpooles,
