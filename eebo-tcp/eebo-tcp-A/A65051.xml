         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS not without ſome violence to my own Inclinations, that I come once more to take notice of this mans <hi>Impertinencies</hi>; Excuſe me therefore Readers, if I appear not <hi>over-ſerious</hi> Where I have to do with one ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly <hi>Ridiculous</hi>; For why muſt we needs uſe <hi>ſyllogiſmes</hi> to confute the <hi>Brayings of an Aſs,</hi> or come forth with <hi>Sword and Buckler</hi> to Duel the Knight of the <hi>Windmills,</hi> and Attacque a <hi>Scarcrow</hi> of <hi>Beanſtalks</hi> and <hi>Bulruſhes</hi>? In truth were it not to remove certain <hi>miſtakes</hi> too boldly ſpread by <hi>Ill-deſigning</hi> people, and too unwarily ſwallowed by ſome <hi>well-meaning</hi> Citizens, (more than out of any regard to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his <hi>trifling</hi> Pamphlet,) I ſhould have left the <hi>Angry man</hi> to talk <hi>alone,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the glory of the <hi>laſt word,</hi> which he ſhews himſelf ſo eager to obtain, though in ſpight of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and with the intire forfeiture of all the ſmall Remains of his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our pretended Citizen begins this ſecond paper in the ſtile of <hi>Splitting-Dick</hi>; as if he would have us take him for ſome ſmall <hi>Label of the Law</hi> or ſmatterer in <hi>Clerkſhip</hi>; But he offers at it ſo woodenly, that the verieſt <hi>Fac-ſimile-Dulman,</hi> the ſillyeſt <hi>Three half-penny Hack</hi> in all <hi>Chancery Lane</hi> would be aſham'd on't. The ſaid H. B. <hi>for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer</hi> Taken <hi>to the Exceptions in the ſaid Vindication, anſwers and ſayes,</hi> If either of the Giants in <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> can make <hi>ſenſe</hi> of this, I'le burn <hi>Weſts Preſidents,</hi> and give him my <hi>Green Bag</hi> into the Bargain. Nay ſo accompliſht he appears in his own <hi>Craft</hi> as not to underſtand the very <hi>terms</hi> us'd in the proceſs of a Suit in <hi>Equity.</hi> For his firſt Libel which he meant for an <hi>Anſwer</hi> he call'd a <hi>Replication</hi>; and this, which (according to his reckoning) ſhould have been a <hi>Rejoynder</hi> he miſnames an <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his Defects of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> are made up with a ſurpluſage of <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Ill-nature</hi>; The firſt caſt of his skill being an Ill-favour'd ſquint on Sr. <hi>Tho. P.</hi> who, he ſayes, <hi>might as reaſonably have taken him for a Jew, as a Prieſt or Papiſt.</hi> What Sr. <hi>T.</hi> took him for, or whether he ever vouchſafed him the honour of his generous thoughts, is to me <hi>unknown.</hi> 'Tis indeed ſomewhat improbable that he ſhould be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> becauſe commonly that Tribe ſhew themſelves cunninger Knaves, and write with more <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi>; but that he may be a kind of <hi>Mungrel,</hi> an indifferent well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willer to the <hi>Red-Letter,</hi> a mercenary Tool that would be an Advocate for <hi>Popery</hi> for ten Groats, there are ſtill ſome violent ſuſpicions. For why ſhould we not ſuppoſe him a <hi>Janus</hi> in opinion, that wears a couple of names, <hi>H. B.</hi> in the Front, but <hi>N. R.</hi> in the Rear of his Pamphlet, and yet 'tis probable neither of them ſo much as the initial let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his <hi>true</hi> Appellation? If he be one of our <hi>principal Citizens,</hi> and really of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94916:2"/>
               <hi>the Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as he alledges, why all this <hi>Shuffling</hi> and <hi>Masking</hi>? Or who but one that is a <hi>favourer of Papiſts</hi> at leaſt, would go about to divide us in ſuch a juncture with groundleſs ſurmiſes, and <hi>ſcandalize</hi> ſo Noble a Gentleman, <hi>only for his zeal to the Proteſtant Religion</hi>? 'Tis true, he would <hi>cloak</hi> himſelf under the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; but how many of late pretend to her Honourable <hi>Livery,</hi> only that they may <hi>wound</hi> her more unſuſpectedly?

            <p>He would by this maliciouſly inſinuate as if Sr. <hi>T.</hi> were <hi>Author</hi> of the paper called <hi>The Vindication,</hi> but can he hope to make any people in their wits believe it? In vain, Sir! in vain you aſpire to the <hi>Honour</hi> of ſuch an Opponent, <hi>Aquila non capit Muſcas,</hi> That Gentleman has other buſineſs than to trouble himſelf with <hi>Domitians</hi> fly-flap, or regard the barkings of every <hi>Cerberus.</hi> The <hi>Vindication</hi> was written, as the <hi>Notes of his Speech</hi> were printed, wholly without his <hi>Conſent or Privity</hi>; For being ſatisfied with the Teſtimony of a good <hi>Conſcience,</hi> he valued not your <hi>ſlanders,</hi> yet 'twas thought a duty owing to <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Honour of the City</hi> (which in general you had aſperſec) That the ſame ſhould be expoſed by a meaner hand, who has no <hi>other</hi> obligations to that worthy <hi>Knight</hi> than what every <hi>true Proteſtant</hi> muſt gratefully own. Our Author next <hi>obſerves, That in the Opinion of the Fanaticks, the Popiſh Plot cannot be ſuppreſſed without their Help.</hi> Tell us, O thou <hi>Man of mickle Obſervations,</hi> when they told you ſo? and yet I am glad to hear, they are <hi>ſo ready to help</hi> towards it, when 'tis Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>The water being diſturb'd</hi> (he ſayes) <hi>they put in their Hooks and Lines and Nets to catch the Fiſh, the Government.</hi> 'Tis a dainty <hi>Allegory,</hi> the very <hi>Cream</hi> of his Rhetorick, and ſo let it paſs. But why was not he ſo <hi>Loyal</hi> (eſpecially when I <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd</hi> him to it) to diſcover ſome of theſe dangerous <hi>Hook-and-Line-Men</hi>? We all do, or ſhould know, 'tis the old <hi>Fiſher-man</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Journey-men, that are now buſily <hi>Angling</hi>; and ſure when an <hi>Inundation</hi> is ſo palpably threatned, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every good Subject that <hi>aſſerts the Kings Legal Prerogative, and the eſtabliſht Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to endeavour to ſupport the <hi>Banks,</hi> and I wiſh ſome whoſe Duty and true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt 'tis to maintain them, did not go about to <hi>undermine</hi> them, and by unſeaſonable <hi>Breaches</hi> let in the Popiſh <hi>Torrent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his laſt he charg'd Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> with three fooliſh Ill-deſigns; now he ſays but <hi>two,</hi> and undoubtedly next Edition they will be dwindled into <hi>none</hi> at all. Yet for publick ſatisfaction I cannot but take notice of <hi>two things</hi> induſtriouſly ſpread to that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans diſadvantage; 1. That he ſhould be concern'd in promoting Mr. <hi>J.</hi> for <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff.</hi> 2. That he <hi>broke promiſe</hi> in not appearing before the Lieutenancy <hi>Sept.</hi> 18. Now if both theſe ſhould happen to be found <hi>miſtakes,</hi> what have they next to object?</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, 'Tis moſt certain, and ready to be <hi>proved,</hi> That Sir <hi>T.</hi> was ſo far from having any hand in that deſign, that he endeavoured all he could to <hi>diſcourage</hi> it; and as ſoon as ever he heard the leaſt intimation thereof, (which was but on the <hi>Friday</hi> Evening) earneſtly deſired ſeveral of Mr. <hi>J.</hi>'s friends to deſiſt, telling them, <hi>If they had an intent to prejudice the ſaid Mr.</hi> J. <hi>as much as in them lay, they could not take a more expeditious courſe to effect it.</hi> Now if they would afterwards <hi>proceed,</hi> is it not moſt unreaſonable, that he ſhould be <hi>burthened</hi> with the acts of <hi>others,</hi> or miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by reaſon of an <hi>Accident,</hi> which (though unluckily happening the ſame day) he was ſo remote from advancing, that he <hi>oppoſed</hi> it?</p>
            <p>And here by the way, Though I am wholly a ſtranger to Mr. <hi>J.</hi> nor intend to be his Advocate, yet finding Sr. <hi>T.</hi> unjuſtly reflected upon, on his account, and <hi>Jenkiſme</hi> here reckon'd up as one of the Cities <hi>new Hereſies,</hi> I could not but inquire what might be the <hi>reaſons,</hi> that he ſhould thus become the ſubject of every <hi>Lampoon,</hi> and Coffee-houſe <hi>Cenſure</hi>; and I proteſt I can find <hi>nothing,</hi> but that he is a regular <hi>Conformiſt</hi> to the eſtabliſht Church, and a Citizen of unblameable <hi>Converſation</hi>; only ſome years ſince he made a motion in the <hi>Common Council</hi> (whereof he was a Member) expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome apprehenſions of what we are ſince generally <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and ſuppoſing ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94916:2"/>
Inconveniencies might attend <hi>over-long</hi> Parliaments, deſired they would become ſuiters to the chief Magiſtrates of the humbly City to petition his Majeſty to call <hi>a new one,</hi> if he thought fit. The matter of this requeſt is thought to have been ſince <hi>Juſtified by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> ſignifying the ill conſequences of ſuch tedious Seſſion. Or ſuppoſe it a Crime, might not a <hi>ſmart impriſonment</hi> atone for Raſhneſs, or time and further experience extenuate the <hi>Guilt,</hi> but that it muſt ſtill remain an <hi>Immortal ſtain</hi> (as our Author ſpeaks in another Caſe) <hi>never to be deleted</hi>?—But leaving Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to be his own <hi>Compurgator,</hi> (whoſe concerns are <hi>foreign</hi> to our preſent buſineſs) we return to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand.</p>
            <p>The ſecond objection againſt Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> is about his ſuppoſed <hi>Breach of promiſe,</hi> which if well examined, there will perhaps as little be found therein, as in the former; nor is this meant to caſt the leaſt reflection on the <hi>Honourable</hi> Gentlemen of the <hi>Lieutenancy,</hi> for ſince even a <hi>General Council</hi> is on all hands acknowledged liable to error in matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> 'tis not impoſſible they might be <hi>miſinform'd,</hi> or their <hi>Clerk,</hi> by a popular Rumour, led into a miſtake, as to that particular mentioned in the <hi>Gazetted</hi> Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>That then and there he promiſed to meet</hi>; for 'tis credibly affirm'd, that the Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> only <hi>referr'd</hi> or wiſht him <hi>to come at ſuch a time</hi>; in which caſe he was certainly left to his own <hi>Liberty,</hi> nor ought to be tax'd with ſuch a formal violation of his <hi>Word,</hi> as ſome pretend, when he was never <hi>engag'd</hi> further than Prudence and future conſideration of Circumſtances ſhould adviſe him.</p>
            <p>This will be ſufficient anſwer to his ſecond and third Paragraphs to <hi>men of ſenſe,</hi> though perhaps not to <hi>H.B.</hi> who does nothing there but with falſe and malicious imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, render himſelf (to uſe his own <hi>Bull-phraſe</hi>) at the ſame time both <hi>Idle and Officious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Folly he next advances to two or three notorious <hi>Falſhoods</hi> in a Breath, That the Vindicator ſhould affirm the City is not obliged by the Acts for ſettling the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, that the City have the <hi>abſolute</hi> Command (for ſo he muſt mean, or nothing to the purpoſe) of their <hi>Militia,</hi> and that all the <hi>Burghers</hi> in the World have ſuch command of theirs; whereas all that was alledged was, That the <hi>Act it ſelf</hi> gives the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable City of <hi>London</hi> a particular Latitude beyond other places, in ſome reſpects, and in regard of <hi>extraordinary duties</hi>; not in the leaſt denying the Militia every where throughout <hi>England</hi> to be abſolutely in the power of <hi>the King,</hi> who, 'twas prov'd, had allow'd of the <hi>City-guards,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But would you know what troubles the man? He cannot for his Gutts, <hi>reconcile the matter for one that is Chamberlain of</hi> London <hi>to be a Parliament man.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I pray? <hi>Becauſe the unlimitedneſs of that priviledge made uſe of, may tend to the ruine of Orphans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer,<list>
                  <item>1. What is this to the Vindicator? How comes it in here by head and ſhoulders, being wholly <hi>Extrinſick</hi> to the matter in debate?</item>
                  <item>2. Is not this not only impertinently to <hi>foreſtal</hi> the freedome of Elections, but alſo to arraign the <hi>Prudence</hi> of the whole City, that knew well enough <hi>not long ſince</hi> how to reconcile it? Nor has any thing that I know of, or he can alledge, ſince happened, that ſhould juſtly cauſe them to <hi>alter</hi> their ſentiments.</item>
                  <item>3. Does he not here give us reaſon to judge that he looks upon our Parliaments little better than <hi>Routs,</hi> ſince he beſpeaks them Guilty of ſuch <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> as to protect one of their members, if he ſhould (that is, if he could) violate ſuch a <hi>Publick Truſt</hi>? Can it be imagined the Honour of an Engliſh Parliament (where we hope ſhall never ſit any <hi>Penſionary Bankrupts</hi>) would ever ſuffer it? but would upon Application, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch a Delinquent to the utmoſt <hi>ſeverity</hi> of Law.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, To knock this objection on the Head, can he be ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Citizen,</hi> and vers'd in their uſages, that makes it? Whence is it poſſible this <hi>Imaginary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> ſhould ariſe? Is the Chamberlain <hi>alone,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>principally</hi> concern'd in diſpoſing <hi>Orphans</hi> eſtates? Wherein is he liable to be <hi>ſued</hi> by the Creditors of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94916:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Chamber</hi>? and if he miſpend or fail in <hi>reſpect of the City,</hi> has he not given ſufficient <hi>Security,</hi> who are liable to anſwer the Truſt repoſed? Where is then the danger?</p>
            <p>But <hi>H. B.</hi> begins to draw his <hi>breath faintly,</hi> and now comes ridiculouſly to his General <hi>Traverſe, VVithout That,</hi> &amp;c. Now I appeal to all the World whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has <hi>clear'd</hi> himſelf, or ſo much as touch'd, ſeveral things home-charg'd upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> his reflecting on the Government of the City as <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> Their unjuſt ſcrewing out of money (as he would have it) in election of <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> Their undoing young men by <hi>Livery-Fines,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Demurrer</hi> is of the ſame ſtamp, the man begs hard for his <hi>Charges,</hi> prethee who ſuborn'd thee to write two ſuch paultry Pamphlets as would not bear their own <hi>Expences</hi>? e'en let thy <hi>Clients</hi> pay the <hi>Coſts,</hi> for infallibly they are <hi>Non-ſuited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Bead-roll of <hi>harſh Terms</hi> which he muſters up at the Fag-end of his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet, it cannot be Imagined what he means by it, unleſs to prove (what the Vindicator ſeem'd to queſtion) that he is fit for the dignity of a <hi>Scavenger,</hi> by ſhewing his dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in <hi>Kennel-raking</hi>? yet it muſt be obſerv'd, that <hi>moſt</hi> of thoſe Epithetes were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to <hi>H. B.</hi> but fix'd on the <hi>Popiſh Traytors,</hi> who enough deſerve them, others are his own Appellations of himſelf, and the reſt no more than what his attempts render him obnoxious unto; ſuch ill-weeds muſt like <hi>Nettles</hi> be handled <hi>roughly,</hi> elſe they'le <hi>ſting</hi> us, and I know not why we may not call a Spade, <hi>a Spade.</hi> But
<q>Conſcius ipſe ſibi de ſe putat omnia dici.</q>
So much for the Worſhipful <hi>H.B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to you the worthy Members of this Honourable <hi>City</hi> I humbly addreſs; If Sr. <hi>T. P.</hi> have hitherto demean'd himſelf as a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> to his King, as a <hi>Faithful Servant</hi> to this City, as a zealous Patriot for the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> and that of the <hi>Publique,</hi> if his late Calumniated <hi>Application</hi> was but in purſuance of his <hi>office</hi> (ſeveral perſons coming to <hi>call in their moneys</hi> on the late Juncture, and he, for the ſatisfaction of them and others, only modeſtly ſtating their apprehenſions) if it be lawful in all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities</hi> from the greateſt Monarchy to the meaneſt <hi>Ships-Crew,</hi> for any perſon hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to give notice of <hi>threatned</hi> dangers, and this practiſed all the world over without <hi>Reprehenſion,</hi> yea received with <hi>thanks</hi> for the good will, though prov'd <hi>miſtaken,</hi> where is then <hi>his offence</hi>? how comes he to ſuffer in any good mans eſteem? or why ſhould he be given up <hi>a Sacrifice</hi> to the clamours of the <hi>debauch'd,</hi> the Revenge of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Incendiaries, the malice of <hi>Whiſperers,</hi> or the groundleſs <hi>Ill-impreſſions</hi> of the Ignorant? He that has laudably diſcharg'd an <hi>eminent Truſt</hi> amongſt you, and for you, ſure deſerves your Confidence in a <hi>greater</hi>: As both better knowing the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Intereſts</hi> of your City, and more <hi>experienc'd</hi> in the duty you are to chuſe him to. I am not fit to <hi>Adviſe</hi> you, but will not ceaſe to <hi>pray</hi> that you may <hi>Elect</hi> ſuch as may be <hi>fit</hi> to ſerve you and the nation in ſo weighty a work. A <hi>Work</hi> that requires men of parts and of <hi>Reſolution</hi> too. Every <hi>Rich</hi> man (though a competent Eſtate be abſolutely neceſſary) nay every <hi>honeſt</hi> man (though none elſe are) may not be proper for a <hi>Senator</hi>: There may be ſome that ſcarce underſtand the Queſtion, but would give an <hi>I</hi> or <hi>No</hi> at randome, when a <hi>ſingle</hi> vote may almoſt be worth a <hi>Kingdome.</hi> There are ſome that like <hi>Glaſſes</hi> may be blown into any <hi>ſhape</hi> with a <hi>Flattering</hi> or <hi>Threatning</hi> Breath. I am confident you would not diſhonour your ſelves with ſuch a Choice—May the <hi>Almighty Counſellor</hi> direct you ſo now and ever as may moſt tend to his <hi>Glory,</hi> the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Vicegerent our Gracious <hi>Soveraign,</hi> the preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> the Honour of the <hi>City,</hi> and the <hi>Publick Weal</hi> of the Nation.</p>
