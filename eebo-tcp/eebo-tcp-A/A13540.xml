            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>and board here. The best aduise in this cause wee haue
in the sacred word of God; next vnto that, in the paines
of holy and godly men, who haue both gone before vs,
and are now, through Gods mercy, continued to vs. In
the number of which, let me commend vnto thee, the
labours of this iudicious and learned Diuine, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this ensuing Sermon. God, by him, hath giuen
vnto his Church, many helps in points of Diuinity; and
especially, in regard of this subiect: his directions alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
this now, and others shortly to be printed, may serue
for a Christian rule this way. I must confesse, that it
had beene ere this time printed, had not the humility
and modesty of the Author hindred it: Willing hee is,
and hath beene to doe good by preaching, but I am sure,
he glorieth not with many, in voluntary printing of
those things that are very vsefull for the Church of God.
Secondly, the expectation of an other Sermon, which by
importunity I obtained; the Coppy whereof (as soone as
it is corrected by the Author himselfe, and returned to
me, according to promise) you shall haue for your further
direction, in the holy choise &amp; godly vsage of your selues
in this so honourable estate. The God of Grace guide
your hearts that read this, to the conscionable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of it, that you may all blesse God for such worthy
helpe, and helpe them with your prayers, who desire to
further you in the way to saluation.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S IOHN himselfe was a forerunner of
Christ in his person and office, so the
Euangelist S. <hi>Luke</hi> beginning his holy
storie, maketh the conception of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
forerun the storie of the conception of Christ: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which two was not an obscure correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
For first, both of them were predicted and
promised by an Angell, who described both their
persons, both their offices, and gaue them both their
names. Secondly, both their conceptions were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
by the mightie power of God, transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the strength of nature. Thirdly, both of
them borne of vnlikely persons, the one of a Virgine
against nature, the other of an old barren woman
beyond nature. Fourthly, both of them were to be
borne after a new and vnusuall natiuitie: first that
the strange conception of the one, might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more credible by the other: and secondly, that
both of them might by all men be conceiued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
most eminent persons, of extraordinarie spirit
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23551:3"/>
and seruice in the world, who after so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
manner came into the world. For so when <hi>Iohn</hi>
was borne, the neighbours asked. <hi>What manner of
child shall this be?</hi> verse 66.</p>
            <p>Now our Euangelist stayeth a great while in the
confirmation of <hi>Iohns</hi> extraordinarie conception
and honourable birth for these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because his calling was to be extraordinary,
he was to be <hi>a man sent from God.</hi> Ioh. 1. 6. not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by man, but by God immediatly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his office was to be <hi>a witnesse of the
truth, and that all men through him might beleeue.</hi> v. 7.
And because the truth of a testimonie dependeth
vpon the worth of the witnesse: to adde more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to <hi>Iohns</hi> testimonie, he sheweth the person
to be an extraordinarie man, in holinesse and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and therefore most faithfull, and worthie of
all credite and highest respect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iohn</hi> was to be the first witnesse and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Preacher in the new Testament, yea to be the
forerunner and immediat seruant of Christ. Hence
is he called <hi>Iohn</hi> by the Angell: which word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<hi>fauour</hi> or <hi>grace:</hi> first because he was bestowed
by Gods speciall grace on his parents, when they
were old, and by the course of nature could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
him: secondly, because he was to be the first
Preacher of grace in the new Testament. Next ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was to insist in the large and honourable
mention of so neare a seruant to Christ: seeing the
more honourable the seruant is, the more is the
glorie and eminencie of the maister.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because the faith of the Church was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23551:3"/>
to leane vpon this testimonie of <hi>Iohn:</hi> therefore is
the Spirit of God more industrious to make his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
certaine, and leaue it most infallible.</p>
            <p>Now among other arguments of <hi>Iohns</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
he is in the words read, commended by the
worthinesse of his parentage. For first both his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are named, his father was <hi>Zacharie,</hi> that is, one
mindfull of God: his mothers name was <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
which signified God is my rest, and it appeareth they
were not vnanswerable to their names. Secondly,
both of them were of an holy stocke and progenie.
He was of the <hi>order and stocke of Aaron,</hi> and she was
of the <hi>daughters of Aaron:</hi> and so both of them were
well descended. Thirdly, both of them were as holy
in their owne persons, as in their parentage: For
<hi>both of them were iust before God, and walked in all
the commandements and ordinances of the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reproofe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Both of them were iust</hi>] First, neither of them was
without infirmitie, neither of them without sinne.
Secondly, neither of them was legally iust, which
requireth whole conformitie of the whole man, to
the whole Law, and that in the vtmost perfection.
Thirdly, neither of both were iust, or iustified by
workes, and much lesse by meriting or desert. For
why then was <hi>Zacharie</hi> presently strucke dumbe for
his vnbeliefe, verse 20. Or if that which the Rhemists
on this place were true: what did <hi>Zacharie</hi> here in
the Temple offering sacrifice, first for his owne sins,
and then for the peoples: if he did so perfectly fulfill
the Law as they say?</p>
            <p>How then were they both iust? A. Both were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23551:4"/>
iust Euangelically. First by <hi>imputation,</hi> to both of
them was Christs iustice imputed: so as though
both of them laboured vnder their personall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
yet God for Christs sake did not impute
their sinnes vnto them. Secondly, by <hi>acceptation</hi> God
did approue them both for iust and righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
beholding them in the couenant of his loue:
which accepteth of impure and vnworthie actions
of his children as righteous and iust, and affordeth a
large couer for their daily defects and frailties.
Thirdly, by <hi>inchoation,</hi> in that both of them being
renewed by Gods Spirit, endeuoured to keepe all
the commandements of the Lord, and were heartily
grieued when they failed in their true endeuour.
Fourthly, by the <hi>Lords iustification</hi> both were iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by God from hypocrisie and raigning guile:
What they did, they did before God, in truth, and
vnfainedly as in his sight, and by their fruites of faith
both of them were iustified before men: who by
their externall righteousnesse saw that their faith
was sound, and themselues true beleeuers. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
were righteous before men, but this is opposed
to all pharisaicall iustice; they were both iust before
God.</p>
            <p>Hence we note
some obseruations. <list>
                  <item>1. As they were religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</item>

            <p>Many sinne against this rule,<note place="margin">Luc. 10. 42. 2. Vse.</note> who prize not
nor speake of the graces of God conferred vpon
their brethren, because either their hearts affect not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23551:5"/>
grace, or because they enuie it, or else because they
turne out this subiect, by blazing the wants and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of godly men, or else by furthering some blots,
and casting some staine vpon them. Our Lord Iesus
contrarily affected, and commended euen shewes of
goodnesse in the young man for example.</p>
            <p>3. Others make pietie and grace the buts to shoot
all their venome and poysoned arrowes against, all
their discourses runne against persons fearing God,
and their godly practises, that if diuels had tongues
of their owne, thus would they employ them: but
not hauing them of their owne, they borrowed these
mens to this purpose. For Christ must be a butt
and signe of contradiction still, not in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
only, but in his members also. But against whom
hast thou blasphemed? Or whom hath railing <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sechie</hi>
reuiled? Or where shall these arrowes shot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
heauen light, but vpon the head of him that
shot them? Who euer aduanced himselfe in blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
against the God of heauen and prospered?</p>
            <p>Now as they were married persons, because our
present errand calleth vs to this part,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> we may learne.
In that both these persons were iust, and yet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
that marriage hindereth no man or woman: no
nor the Ministers of God from being holy and iust
before God and men. <hi>Zacharie</hi> a Priest here in his
office in the Temple, in the action of sacrifice was a
married man, and yet holy: which could not be if
the marriage of Ministers hindered their holinesse.
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Priests wife, yet commended by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God for an holy and iust woman, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wiues of Ministers are set by God in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23551:5"/>
foremost ranke of Christ, holy, gracious and godly
women.</p>
            <p>To detest that diabolicall doctrine and religion
of Papists,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> which cannot be true, but this Scripture
and many other must be false. In that they hold, that
first marriage is a being in the flesh, and an vncleane
thing. For did God institute an vncleane thing, and
that in Paradise before any sinne and vncleannesse
was? Did Christ grace and honour an vncleane
thing by his presence and first miracle? Is one of the
Sacraments of their holy Church become on the
sudden so vncleane a thing? Lyars haue great need
of good memories. Secondly, that holy ministerie is
as deadly a disease of marriage as the foulest adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which onely ought to dissolue marriage. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which opposeth marriage to virginitie as chaffe
to wheate, or as euill to good: whereas Scripture
opposeth not marriage to virginitie, as lesse good in
it selfe, but as more inconuenient by the corruption
of persons, or persecution of the times. Neither do
they oppose virgins to married persons (Reu. 19. 9)
but to the filthy fornicators of that whore of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.
Fourthly, which disauoweth marriage, but not
lust, abandoneth Gods sacred ordinance according
to nature, but not burning concupiscence and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
filthinesse, not to be named among Saints,
for it is one of their beastly and shamelesse consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions:
that their Priesthood is not bound to put
away an whore or Concubine, so it abiure a lawfull
wife. Not to take any longer in this Sodomiticall
sincke, we conclude with our text. That marriage
hindereth neither inward holinesse, nor the most
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23551:6"/>
holy externall duties neither priuate nor publicke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Both were iust:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Doct.</note> An happie coniunction it is when
two godly persons meet in marriage, of whom may
be said: both of them are iust, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca, Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila, Zacharie</hi> and
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is an equall yoke when both are like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and draw one way;<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> both haue their names
written in the booke of life; when both are of one
tribe and religion, as this couple was; when both
worship the same true God; both care for the things
of God; both intend the one thing necessarie; both
are decked with the same graces, and both are heires
of the same saluation; when both are fit and mutuall
helpes, marriage becometh a sweete yoke.</p>
            <p>When both are iust,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> the familie will be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Church of God, a place of Gods worship, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
delight, and blessing.</p>
            <p>From such a coniunction is an expectation of
a godly seede,<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> and an hopefull posteritie to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
vs, to worship God in earth when we are gone
hence, as from this gracious couple, descendeth <hi>Iohn</hi>
a gracious sonne, of nearest seruice to Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Let all that are to enter into this estate,<note place="margin">1. Vse.</note> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what their first ayme ought to be: not on finest
houses and riches, which are the inheritance of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but a prudent wife which is the gift of God,
that is a speciall and most choise gift of his loue:
Seeke first for goodnesse, and for goods after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
faile in this rule and thou shalt buy gold too
deare.</p>
            <p>All married couples must learne and labour,<note place="margin">2. Vse.</note>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23551:6"/>
to be both iust, both religious, and fearing God
Wiues are as straightly bound to be religious as
husbands, both must labour for Gods approbation,
both must care to be spouses of Christ, both must
striue to be in the couenant of grace, both must be
married to faith, loue, godlinesse, and holinesse, both
must seeke to be rich, beautifull and glorious within,
as the spouses of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>3. All married persons must aboue all things, loue,
respect and cherish grace one in another: ground
not thy loue vpon beautie, riches, portion, youth,
or such failing foundations: but pitch it first in God
and grace, and it will hold. Let it begin at the soule,
and thence shew it selfe to the body. The man and
wife ought to seeke the sauing one of anothers soule,
1. Cor. 7. 5. Christ the husband of his Church
did all; suffered all, bestowed all his wisedome,
strength, riches, yea his precious bloud for his spouse
to sanctifie and saue her: an vnfailing patterne for all
spouses.</p>
            <p>Where both are iust, true grace will be valued at
the highest rate one in another; the one will hold
the other worth so much as there is religion and the
feare of God. Betweene this beauty of soule, riches
of mind, wealth of grace is esteemed at an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
rate; and these entise and draw on heauenly,
spirituall, and lasting loue. When both are iust,
grace will be cherished in each more then good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
grace is excited by each in the exercise of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
duties; they pray with and for one another;
they reade, conferre, and counsell together; they
edifie one another on their holy faith, and this is a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23551:7"/>
strong cement of loue. Where both are iust, both
praise God (as for inferiour endowments) so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the measure of grace receiued, and for that
holy religion to which they are married. Where
God hath giuen this blessing there is wealth, beauty,
loue, and euery sweet and needfull comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before God</hi> from hence note this doctrine:<note place="margin">Doct.</note> That
<hi>those be indeed truly religious and righteous that are so
before God:</hi> that set themselues alwayes before God,
and in sinceritie of heart know and remember they
haue to do with God in all things. Iam. 1. 27. pure
and vndefiled religion <hi>before God:</hi> the thing that true
religion doth, is, it bindeth God to man, and man to
God.</p>
            <p>None can be iust before God, Psal. 143. 2. Rom.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
3. 20. No flesh can be iustified before the Lord.</p>
            <p>1. That is, <hi>no man onely flesh</hi> without Christ and
his Spirit.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. No man can <hi>personally</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> be iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so as his person and worke can passe allowable in
strict iustice.</p>
            <p>3. No flesh <hi>in his sight</hi> vnlesse it be seene in the
sight of Christ. But by mercifull <hi>acceptation</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
is iustified and approoued as iust seene in
Christ 2. By sound <hi>resolution</hi> he setteth himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Gods eye, and in his presence, as a witnesse of his
righteous and godly course: and so seeketh in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of heart to be approued of him in all things.
And thus <hi>Zachery</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are said to be iust in
this place.</p>
            <p>The reasons of this Doctrine are these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23551:7"/>
               <hi>Such a worshipper only the Lord requireth,</hi>

Oh that there were such an heart in them, that they

<hi>Onely such are accepted of him who are</hi> Iewes
within. <hi>Rom. 2. Who worship</hi> in Spirit and truth.
<hi>Ioh. 4. for because he is the seer and searcher of the
hearts, he loueth</hi> truth in the inward parts. <hi>Psal. 51.
And</hi> hath pleasure in vprightnesse. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 17.</p>
            <p>Here is a manifest distinction betweene godly
men and euill:<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> who haue faire shewes; &amp; are smooth
outwardly, can draw neare with their lips, but God
is not in their thoughts, their hearts are remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him. The Pharisey can wash the outside of the cup
and platter, and can do many things to be seene of
men. But the godly man setteth himselfe in the eye
of God, and doth things with the heart, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himselfe to seeme good, but to be so, nor with a
forme of godlinesse without the power of it. This
man shineth from the heart within, and is better in
substance then in show. The goodnesse of this man
is not to the eye and outward; but inward from his
heart before God.</p>
            <p>All Euangelicall obedience is chiefly in purpose of
heart,<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> in holy desires and hearty resolutions. The top
of the beleeuers perfection, is not in perfection of
action, but affection and in strife against imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and truth of desires, as Acts 11. 23. When
with <hi>full purpose of heart we cleaue vnto the

            </p>
            <p>A day cometh wherein the Lord will pronounce
of euery man as his heart shall be before him:<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> as here
of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> In which he will vnfold
and turne out all the windings and corners of mens
hearts. If a peace of the heart or of vprightnesse be
wanting, he will misse it. As in many kings of Israel,
who did such and such good things but not with all
their hearts. Then shalt thou know that all is nought
without vprightnesse.</p>
            <p>Now the notes of a man iust and religious before
God.<note place="margin">Notes of a iust man.</note> He bringeth his inner man still
before God;<note place="margin">Note 1.</note> as in his <list>
                  <item>thoughts.</item>
                  <item>intentions.</item>
                  <item>desires.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. He dareth not suffer his <hi>thoughts</hi> too long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from God, Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I haue set the Lord euer in
my sight.</hi> He is much and often in secret soliloquies
with God by prayer, by meditation.</p>
            <p>Of the wicked man it is said, God <hi>is not in his
thoughts.</hi> But a truly godly man thinketh on God by
day and by night.</p>
            <p>2. His <hi>intentions</hi> are not to get applause or credit
of men: but to get grace, both with God and in
himselfe.</p>
            <p>3. His <hi>desires</hi> are after God to prepare him a place
in his heart, without whom he cannot liue, no more
then without aire. A soule destitute of desires after
God is a great plague. And for God he affecteth all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23551:8"/>
goodnesse for goodnesse sake, and for no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>His actions are wrought in God for ordinarie

<hi>that they are wrought in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All his actions I say are wrought in
God for ordinarie course, both in <list>
                  <item>1. The rise.</item>
                  <item>2. The rule.</item>
                  <item>3. The end.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. In respect of the <hi>rise,</hi> which is the loue of God.
It is the loue of God <hi>constraineth</hi> vs to euery good
action, that is the rise and foundation. 2. Cor. 5. 12.</p>
            <p>2. Of the rule which is the light of Gods word. All
the Israel of God <hi>walke by thus rule,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. And
as many as walke according to this rule, peace be on
them, and mercy, and vpon the Israel of God; this is
the lanthorne to their pathes, Psal. 119.</p>
            <p>3. Of the end, which is either of Intention. or, Execution.</p>
            <p>1. Of intention,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 9.</note> which is Gods glory and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
our endeauour is at home, or from home
to be pleasing vnto God in all things.</p>
            <p>2. The end of execution. Grace goeth through
such and continueth vnto the end: what is done of
conscience is of continuance. A good heart is as
carefull to perseuere in good; as once to be good,
knowing that God is best at last.</p>
            <p>In respect of sin. 1. The religious heart admitteth
not,<note place="margin">Note 3.</note> nor committeth any. Because he knoweth, all
<hi>are before God.</hi> As <hi>Ioseph,</hi> shall I do this wickednesse
<hi>and sinne against God.</hi> It striueth against all sinne in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23551:9"/>
this respect, Psal. 94. 7. 8. <hi>Shall he that formed the
eye and eare, shall not he see and heare?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He seeketh not to hide or to cherish any sinne
committed. But casteth out all by confession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all is before God, Psal. 51. <hi>Against thee, against
thee ô Lord.</hi> I haue done euill <hi>in thy sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. He shameth more that his sinne is before God:
then if it were in all mens eyes, and if all men should
cry shame on him, he would not be abashed, as he
is with holy blushing, that his shame and sinne lyeth
vncouered before God.</p>
            <p>4. He hateth all euils as well as one, in one as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
In friends as well as foes, secret as open, but
of all is most seuere against his owne sinnes which
lye closest to his owne heart.</p>
            <p>4. Holding himselfe euer in Gods presence,<note place="margin">Note 4.</note> he is
still like himselfe, and the same as God is, before
whom he walketh.</p>
            <p>First, companie corrupteth him not. In all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
he is as if he were alone, and alone as if he
were in companie, the same man among superiors
and inferiors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, places change him not, he is the same
in his owne house that he is in Gods house, Psal. 10 1. 2.
at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, times altering alter him not: he is the
same on the weeke day as on the Sabbath: he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
he is euer before God who is euer the same.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, no estate disturbeth him, but in all estates
he is the same. In prosperitie, in aduersitie, whereas a
wicked man can crie in his distresse, &amp; the Hipocrite
in his affliction: Hos. 6. last. <hi>Seeke God diligently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:23551:9"/>
5. He is neuer so well contented as in those
meanes in which God is pleased to conuerse with
men,<note place="margin">Note 5.</note> in euery ordinance of God he reioyceth, as in
a more solemne presence of his grace. (Whereas the
wicked wilfully excommunicate themselues:) and
yet the godly man is not contented with these with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a longing desire of his blessed presence of glory:
to stand before him, to praise him, in immediate
fruition for all eternitie.</p>
            <p>

here is a daily going nearer saluation, and nearer the

prospereth not in goodnesse: he that is not daily
nearer heauen, walketh not that way. Neither will it
serue that men set their tongues a walking and
wishing, if their hands be bound, or feete fettered
with idlenesse or lusts. Therefore see in thy selfe.</p>

               <item>First, that thy workes be more at last then at the

purpose.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they seuered not the commandements
in the practise of their life: as seruants who will
chuse their worke, and do what pleaseth themselues,
and leaue vndone what liketh them not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they made the whole word their rule:

Fourthly, they walked in all: but not without
some slips and slidings; as in the fairest way a man
may slip and yet keepe his way and walke still.</p>
            <p>They walked,<note place="margin">Note 1.</note> first in morall precepts, and then in
ceremoniall: Christian wisedome taught them; and
<hi>must teach vs, to do all duties, but the greatest with the

men. The first and great commandement first: first
the great things of the Law, and then Tyth Mint,
and Comin.</p>
            <p>The application might be enlarged in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as to stirre vs vp:</p>

            <p>They are peruerse that neglecting sinceritie of
heart, saith, and good conscience, compose their
liues to ciuilitie and deuotion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The way wherein the Saints must walke to heauen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note. 2.</note>
               <hi>is the way of Gods commandements:</hi> for as a way doth
tend to some intended place, so doth the statutes of
God tend to heauenly happinesse: Hence is the
word called the <hi>way of God,</hi> Acts 13. 10. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23551:11"/>
to <hi>Elimas</hi> the sorcerer, said, wilt thou not ceasse to
peruert the <hi>right wayes</hi> of the Lord: the <hi>way of
peace,</hi> Luke 1, 97. <hi>of saluation,</hi> Act. 16. 17.</p>
            <p>2. Whosoeuer are out of this way, and transgresse
this rule, are said to wander and erre, Psal. 14. 3. They
<hi>are all gone out of the way.</hi> And as a man hauing lost
his way, knoweth not where to find himselfe at last.
So such as go their owne wayes, and follow the
lusts and sight of their eyes, little thinke where they
shall lodge when the night of their lives cometh.</p>
            <p>Labour to know this way;<note place="margin">1. Vse. Ier. 6.</note> aske the way of those
that know the countrie and the way to it better then
thy selfe: As the Iaylor asked: <hi>what shall I do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</hi>
enquire the old and ancient way, for thou nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowest nor findest it of thy selfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, labour to keepe this way. A traueller
must keepe the high and beaten way. But this is the
way, the kings high way, pathed and troden of all
trauellers to heauen.</p>
            <p>Our thoughts must not stray out of this way, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus
20. <hi>Thou shalt not couet:</hi> words must be held in
this way, of euery idle word we must giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
actions must be done in this way. What I
command thee that do onely, whether great or
small: the whole and parts; the smallest pinnes of the
Tabernacle must be according to the patterne in the
Mount: Hence those many precepts; turne not to
the right hand or the left, for it is a right way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ioyne with those that walke in this way
which is called the <hi>way of men.</hi> It is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in a strange way to go with good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.
Delight in men fearing God, in Saints excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23551:11"/>
in vertue,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.</note> and with <hi>Iacob</hi> still pray God to go
with thee in thy iourney, who is a faithfull and sure
guide.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, walke vprightly, not halting in this way,
and follow it where euer it leadeth: vprightnesse
looketh not where multitudes go, but where it selfe
ought to go: nor what may be the issue, but which is
the way. This way may leade thee into many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of disgraces, losses, crosses, &amp;c. But as Israel
going through the wildernesse, they must prouide
shooes on their feete, so prouide thou the shooes of
the preparation of the Gospell, fencing thy selfe with
Christian resolution to follow where euer the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
leadeth thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A good and sincere heart striueth to vniuersall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note 3.</note>
it will walke in all commandements and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
as <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Psal. 119. 6.
then shall I not be confounded when I haue <hi>respect
to all thy commandements:</hi> I set <hi>all thy lawes before me,</hi>
and esteeme <hi>all thy precepts</hi> right: though he cannot
do all, yet he must set all before him.</p>
            <p>First, because a good heart so prizeth euery part
of the word, as that he will gather vp the very frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the law: he knoweth the perfection of it,
that as nothing need be added, so nothing ought to
be detracted. Nothing else, nothing lesse must be
obserued: it holdeth it not enough to serue and obay
in some things, but in all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a good heart knoweth that it selfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deuided; the religious heart is the whole
heart, which maketh no composition with Satan or
sinne. Sure it is it; a small neglect of an inferior duty
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23551:12"/>
or sinne, will make way and open a dore for greater:
and a little deceite or guile; a small reserued and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
sinne, is as a little leauen, souring the whole
lumpe, or as a little Colloquintida poysoning all our
vertues and obedience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he knoweth the Law cannot be deuided,
for it is so vnited, that he that breaketh one, sinneth
against all: A good heart therefore consenteth to the
whole Law, that it is good, iust, and holy, and as a
soueraigne potion prescribed must be taken all: else
the whole operation is hindred, so also it is here.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, here is a difference betweene sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and vnsoundnesse, none are so bad but are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey in some commandements so farre as
they touch not their pleasure, their profite, or credit.
<hi>Herod</hi> will heare <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, till he touch him in his
<hi>Herodias, Iudas</hi> and <hi>Dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> will do many good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but will not leaue couetousnesse and worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But soundnesse denyeth all vngodly &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lusts, Tit. 2. 12. If not in act, yet in desire, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
purpose of heart; and holdeth no duty so small
as to be neglected and despised.</p>
            <p>Thinke not as the most do,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that thou hast well
acquitted thy selfe, if thou beest onely, no adulterer,
murtherer, theefe, periurd person, while thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensest
with thy selfe in the lower degrees of sinne.
Thou art no whoremonger; if conscience make thee
none, thou then wilt not be a wanton or vncleane in
thy speeches.</p>
            <p>Thou are no murtherer, but conscience maketh
thee not so, vnlesse thou hate and resist, rash anger,
hatred, wrath, hastie and furious speeches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23551:12"/>
Thou art no thiefe, and neuer stolest thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
goods: but hast thou not bene, or art thou not
vniust: an vsurer, a lyer, and swearer to deceiue?
These petty thefts shew that conscience keepeth
thee not from greater thefts and roberies.</p>
            <p>Thou art no periured person; nor swearest
wounds, and bloud, &amp;c. but art thou accustomed
to petty oathes? If thou beest a vaine rash and idle
swearer, thy conscience keepeth thee not from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury.
Nay a frequent swearer cannot but be often
periured.</p>
            <p>But doest thou fauour no sin, but makest warre
vpon all the cursed cananites and lusts in thine owne
bosome? Here is some argument of soundnesse.</p>
            <p>Examine the vprightnesse of thy heart by these
notes.<note place="margin">Notes of an vpright heart.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Doest thou hate all wayes of falshood, and as
desirous to forsake all thy sinne, as that God would
forgiue all thy sinne?</p>
            <p>2. Doest thou giue the Lord thy whole heart
and man, not making a profession to serue the Lord,
and reserue some idoll in thy soule?</p>
            <p>3. Desirest thou to do euery part of Gods word,
without either reseruation or exception, (not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy selfe any liberty against any one Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,)
or expostulation or reasoning when the
Lord expresseth no reason: As <hi>Abraham</hi> in going
out of his countrey, and sacrificing his sonne. Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
thou on simple obedience, in difficult, costly,
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous duties? Here is the sound of a good heart.</p>
            <p>The manner of walking <hi>without reproofe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Manner.</note> they
walked not without fault, infirmitie or sinne; but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23551:13"/>
without taint of crime or infamy.<note place="margin">Non dicit sine peccato: sed sine querela.</note> They could not
be iustly charged with grosse sinne or crime before
men. As their sinceritie was approued before God:
so was their conuersation laudable, and without iust
exception before men. The righteousnesse of their
<hi>actions</hi> testified to the righteousnesse of their <hi>persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next care to the pleasing of God must be to
walke innocently,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and inoffensiuely amongst men:
so as none can challenge the Christian iustly of any
crime, Iames 1. 27. religion vndefiled before God,
seeketh to keepe it selfe <hi>vnspotted of the world,</hi> Phil.
2. 17. walke <hi>blamelesse as lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible not to be blamed:<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Christs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
was traduced, and so is that of his seruants.</p>
            <p>Keepe thy selfe vnspotted, though thou canst not
keepe off the spattering of euill men:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> let them not
iustly spot thee, though they will blame thee, be
thou sure thou beest not blame worthie.</p>
            <p>What more seemely for the babes in Christ then
to be without maliciousnesse:<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> or for the doues of
Christ then innocencie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what greater honour of godlinesse,
then for to challenge the aduersarie; as <hi>Samuel,</hi> whose
oxe or asse haue I taken? which of you can accuse
me of crime? I can accuse my selfe of too much sin
before God: but which of you can accuse me iustly,
when <hi>Iob</hi> can take the booke of his aduersarie and
carrie it as his crowne?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what greater cut and conuiction of the
aduersarie, when he wanteth nothing but matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the seruant of God? this choketh him, &amp; stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his mouth, whose malice cannot be stopped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:23551:13"/>
Fourthly, what greater gaine to the truth and to
our selues, when our vnblameable course, not onely
giueth no offence, nor layeth blocks to hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from the profession: but may gaine them to
imbrace the religion which is so innocent, 1. Pet. 2.
12. Hauing your conuersation honest amongst the
Gentiles, that whereas they speake euill of you as
euill doers, they may by your good workes which
they shall behold glorifie God in the day of their
visitation.</p>
            <p>And to our selues not onely in auoiding the woe
due to them by whom offences come: but the retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a cleare conscience void of offences towards
God and all men.</p>
            <p>To provoke vs to the care of walking without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe;<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
here we are to consider the cautions which
we are to take in this case: and secondly the meanes
how we may walke without reproofe.</p>
            <p>The cautions are: first, neuer thinke to auoide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
of wicked ones, but let them haue no cause,
and then barking against the Sunne they may see
their owne madnesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, auoide not mens reproofe by incurring
Gods reproofe; nor by omitting any part of thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
nor committing any euill to please them. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man please his neighbour in <hi>that which is good:</hi>
and the <hi>least euils</hi> must not be done for the attaining
of the greatest good. Rom. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, neuer care for that credit amongst men,
which is seuered from religion, 3. Ioh. 12. <hi>Demetrius</hi>
hath a good report of <hi>all men, and of the truth</hi> it selfe.
Neither care for credit in the world; if thy graces be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23551:14"/>
not witnessed in the Churches 3. Ioh. 6. Let all the
world reprooue thee rather then the godly, which
haue the spirit of discerning.</p>
            <p>The meanes by which a man may walke without
reproofe are:<note place="margin">Meanes of walking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, ioyne the care of a good name with a good
conscience, Rom. 12. 17. <hi>Prouide things honest in the
sight of God and all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, labour for faith, Heb. 11. 2. by faith our
fathers receiued a good report: Faith as it purifieth
the heart, so the life also.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, get puritie of mind, spirit, and thoughts,
get naturall corruption cast out of thy soule; else it
will breake out into thy iust reproofe: curb therefore
thy naturall lusts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, auoyd all sinne, not onely apparant
sinnes, but appearances of euill, motes as well as
beames, thy motes (being a Professor) become
beames quickly.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, meddle not with other mens businesses:
but diligently attend thy owne, but so as thou seeke
other mens good as well as thine owne, 1. Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.
10. 24.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, be aboundant in good workes according
to thy power, place, and opportunitie, Coloss. 1. 10.
Workes of righteousnesse and mercie commend a
man to men. Those vertues are amiable euen in the
eyes of wicked men. And iust dealing with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of good workes bringeth a great deale of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to religion.</p>
            <p>Now a word of application according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.<note place="margin">Application to the Bride groome.</note>
First you my worthy friend and man of God.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23551:14"/>
I assure my selfe your care and ayme was (before you
gaue me this text,) to make it your owne rule: that
of your selfe, and the spouse whom you haue chosen
the words of this text might be verified: <hi>They were
both iust before God:</hi> I need not say much to one
apprehensiue. But remember the counsell. Let him
that is iust be iust still, be still adding vnto your pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
holinesse, and religious courses: you haue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
grace and religion in your selfe, and solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
till this day: Now you must mannage it in
your other selfe, in whom you are thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, wisely to encourage it, carefully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it, and in case she bring you thousands of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
yet hold this her worth, her wealth, her chiefe
stocke and portion. You haue in your single estate
worthily taught others as a man of knowledge, now
you must dwell as a man of knowledge; for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing
of that stocke of grace which is in common
betweene you, that your fiue tallents may be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to ten; when our Lord shall call the seruants to
their reckoning. You haue this day taken vpon you
authority and headship, and with that a double care:
first how to vse it, secondly how to keepe it The way
well to vse it, is to command and rule in the Lord:
that all your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands may carrie a stampe of Gods
impression vpon them, then shall they preuaile on
the conscience, and win obedience from the wife,
when the power of both husbands is vnited in them.
As for keeping your authoritie you know the way,
and so do not many, it will not be kept by force of
armes or violence: but by religious example, and
shewing your selfe the best and most godly, yea the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23551:15"/>
patterne of pietie to the rest of your familie. Gods
shining image will not easily be contemned: for
grace hath an attractiue and adamantine nature to
allure and draw to it selfe whosoeuer can espie it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it cannot but be expected that you who haue
more strength and knowledge, should expresse more
grace: you haue now vndertaken to loue your wife,
as Christ loued his spouse, do it as he did, earnestly,
wisely, liberally, and all to the end to helpe her to
heauen, couering and curing all her infirmities; this
you will not faile to do, if you remember, that not a
daughter of men: but a daughter of Israel is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to your charge.</p>
            <p>And to you whom God hath this day ioyned to
an husband:<note place="margin">To the Bride.</note> Know that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was iust as well as
<hi>Zacharie:</hi> and holinesse is here as commendable in
her as it was in him. Nay it was expected that <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
should shine in grace and godlinesse aboue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
women, because she was <hi>Zacharies</hi> wife, the
Priests wife, the wife of so holy a man. Grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
decketh and adorneth all women in all ranks;
but especially Ministers wiues, as wedded to more
then ordinary meanes, and must be more eminent
in you, as wedded to one (were he not present I
would say) aboue many ordinary Ministers. Let your
care be that it faile not on your part, but that it may
be truly affirmed. <hi>They are both iust before God</hi> Both
pious, both wise, both modest, both holy. As your
husband must dwell with you as a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
so must you with him as with a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
You are this day married to an head, whom
you must obey in all things which he commandeth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23551:15"/>
in the Lord, that is, in whatsoeuer you cannot
proue to be sinne: and this willingly, chearfully, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.
For thus doth the Church (whose daughter
you are) performe obedience to her head and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
Iesus Christ. The same grace will cause you to
honour his person in your heart, life, and whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour:
esteeming of him as the Church doth of
Christ; the chiefe of ten thousand. In one word it
will make you do him good, and not euill all your
dayes. Oh what will not the fauour and wisedome
of God do, when both married persons are thus iust
before God. It will set a worke and quicken all Gods
graces bestowed on both. It will lead into the sight
and obseruance of all good duties mutuall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall.
It will ease and lighten all crosses and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.
It will sweeten and sanctifie all your societie,
companie, and comforts, Well, said <hi>Salomon,</hi> hold
her, and she will vphold you. And now we dismisse
you with our humble prayer to God for his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and direction of you both in this your new
estate; that as you haue both entred this day into
the couenant of God, so you may now couenant
with your selues; that according to this patterne held
before you, you will both ayme to be iust before
God; and both walke in all Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
and ordinances (especially in
this holy and comfortable ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
without reproofe.</p>
