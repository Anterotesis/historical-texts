            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The humble Petition of</hi> Thomas Brewer, <hi>Gentl: And</hi> William Pawlin, Elizabeth Queſted, <hi>Widdow, and</hi> Ann Beſwick, <hi>Daughter of</hi> Ann Beſwick, <hi>Widdow, Creditors of</hi> Ulick <hi>Earl of</hi> St. Albans, <hi>and</hi> Clanricard, <hi>on the behalf of themſelves, and other the Creditors of the ſaid Earl.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat the ſaid Earl being much indebted, and having occaſion to take up more money, did earneſtly importune Sir <hi>Henry Compton</hi> (ſince deceaſed) Sir <hi>Lewis Dive,</hi> and your petitioner <hi>Thomas Brewer,</hi> to be ingaged with him, for whoſe indempnity, he would convey all his eſtate in <hi>Kent</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>That 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>May</hi> 1637 the ſaid Earl did by his Deed and Fine thereupon levyed, convey and aſſure unto the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Compton</hi> Sir <hi>Lewis Dive,</hi> and your Petitioner <hi>Thomas Brewer,</hi> and their heirs; all his lands (by name) in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> to ſave them harmleſs againſt all ſuch debts, as they had or ſhould ſtand engaged, with and for him the ſaid Earl, and alſo with power to raiſe monys, by ſale or other wiſe for payment thereof, in caſe himſelf did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them within ſeven years next after the ſaid 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>May</hi> 1637.</p>
            <p>After wards the ſaid Truſtees did becom engaged with, and for the ſaid Earl, as his Sureties in ſeveral obligations amounting unto above 20000 l. principal Money.</p>
            <p>But for that the ſaid Earl did not ſatisfy the ſaid debts within the ſaid 7. years, nor at any time after, the ſaid lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came abſolutely veſted in the ſaid Truſtees (who were accordingly ſeized thereof) for the purpoſes aforeſaid, who have been ever willing to perform their truſt, aſwel to the ſatisfaction of the ſaid Creditors, as diſingagement of themſelves, but have been interrupted by reaſon of the late diſtempers.</p>
            <p>That about <hi>Feb.</hi> 1647. The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> then of the Lords houſe, &amp; Sr. <hi>Robert Pye</hi> then of the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being two of the ſaid Earls Creditors) did upon the ſame Security, by virtue of the ſaid Deed, obtain an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parlament, unknown unto your Petitioner <hi>Thomas Brewer,</hi> for payment of their reſpective debts, out of the profits of the premiſſes.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner, <hi>Tho.Brewer</hi> being a Priſoner in <hi>Maidſtone</hi>-Goal (only for refuſing the late Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance) where he had been deteined from <hi>Novem.</hi> 1642. was ſent for in <hi>July</hi> 1649. by order from the Committee appointed for preparing an Act for ſettling 2000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> upon <hi>John Bradſhaw</hi> Serjeant at law; and ſo ſoon as your ſaid Petitioner had made anſwer to ſuch queſtions as were then put unto him, touching the buſineſs then before them, he was forthwith returned back again to priſon, where he remained until <hi>April</hi> 1652. not with ſtanding the ſaid Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance were 10 of <hi>February</hi> 1648. by Act of Parlament repealed, made void and null.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1649. divers Mannors and Lands of the Lord <hi>Cottingtons,</hi> together with the ſaid Earls lands in <hi>Kent,</hi> were by Act ſettled upon the ſaid Serjeant <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> and his heirs, with a <hi>Saving</hi> to ſuch as had any right to any part of the ſaid eſtates, So as they entred their claim before the Juſtices of the common pleas, before the laſt day of <hi>January</hi> 1649.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as your Petitioner, <hi>Thomas Brewer</hi> was a Priſoner as aforeſaid, and had no knowledge, or could come to the knowledge of the ſaid Act, which was never publiſht, it was impoſſible for him to take any benefit of the <hi>Saving</hi> therin contain'd, or to ſet forth any claim or title to any part of the ſaid eſtate, though never ſo good, perfect &amp; abſolute in law or equity whatſoever, which otherwiſe he would moſt readily have don and ſo no default in him therein. And for that your Petitioner <hi>Thomas Brewer</hi> hath been, and now is ſued for many of the ſaid debts entred into, with and for the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> and for which the ſaid eſtate is made over as aforeſaid, and which your Petitioner <hi>Tho. Brewer</hi> is no waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſatisfy or pay, but if proceeded againſt, his perſon muſtly as a pawn or prey in perpetual priſon. And for that the Lord <hi>Cottingtons</hi> lands paſſed by the ſaid Act, are upon enquiry, and as your Petitioners are informed, and doubt not but they ſhall be able to prove, found to be of much better value than 2000 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which was the yearly revenue only by the ſaid Act intended to have been ſettled upon the ſaid <hi>Serjeant Bradſhaw;</hi> and for that your Petitioners the ſaid Creditors, were wholly ignorant of the ſaid Act and Settlement, neither had they anyeſtate in law, in the ſaid lands, whereby they might put in any legal claim thereunto, accordng to the ſaid Act, had they known thereof. And for that the ſaid Earls lands were ſo long ſince ſettled as aforeſaid, and upon ſo good, valuable and equitable conſiderations, and concern your Petitioners the ſaid Creditors, who are many of them poor widows and Orphans, and who together with your Petitioner <hi>Tho. Brewer</hi> will be utterly ruin'd, unleſs relieved by the juſtice of your Honours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it therefore pleaſe your Honours to take the premiſſes into your pious conſiderations, and to do therein what to your grave wiſdoms ſhall ſeem meet, wherby your Petitioner,</hi> Tho. Brewer (<hi>notwithstanding the ſaid Act) may be indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. and the ſaid Creditors ſatisfyed (by and out of the ſaid Earls eſtate in</hi> Kent, <hi>according to the ſaid ſettlement in</hi> May 1637.) <hi>Your honours Inſtice magnifyed, and God in all, and by All, glorified.</hi>
