            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VVhich dutie in semblable maner should novv

their holie and iuste authoritie, fully bee ended.
Now, vvhen as vve at this time, are subiect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste
vnto all the afflictions vvhich can come
vnto a church, blessed of God vvith such a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

vvith the famine of hearing the vvorde of God

vvee can thinke of no vvaye for reconciling the

vnion of both their forces, for a couragious set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vpon the common aduersary, then the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
peaceable and reasonable vvay following.
VVhich is, that vvhereas both by bookes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
written, and by treatizes latelye and novv
published, it may appeare vve seeke that vvhich
at the least in the iudgement of all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
hath no small probabilitie (as vve iudge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie)
of trueth out of the scriptures: it maye
please her most excellent maiestie and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb facs="tcp:12169:3"/>
to appoynt on both sides the best learned,
most Godly &amp; moderate men to debate all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of vvaight betweene them and vs. So
that first vpon sufficient consideration, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
to be debated be vvithout all ambiguitie
set downe, the reasons of both sides vvithout all
out-goynges shortly and plainely deliuered in
vvriting each to other, that after vpon sufficient
examination the reasons of both be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
confirmed and resolued, till eyther by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of truth one part yeeld vnto the other;
or the folly and madnes of those vvhich gayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say it, do in equall iudgement become manifest,
in regarde of the contradictions and absurdities
vvhereto they shall bee dryuen by the force of
Gods vvorde. VVhich vvay though it shoulde
come naked vnto vs can not well be refused, but
beeing richly attyred vvith all robes and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
vvhich the scripture giueth vnto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall

namely that there bee<note place="margin">Act. 15. 7.</note> * much searching of the

away of the matter with no substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
vvhere no authoritie, pregnancie of vvit,

there be<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 33</note> * peace without all bitternes, reuilinges,
<pb facs="tcp:12169:4"/>
suspicions, chargings of men dead &amp; aliue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
affections are mooued, iudgement blinded,
and men driuen as vvith a mighty streame from
the loue of the truth: vvhen it commeth thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
vve thinke, that vvhich we labor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to be so honorable<note place="margin">Act. 14. 16.</note> * not only before God,
but also before men, that none can iudge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
of it then vve doe. For if any shall obiect,
that the graue authoritie of Archbishops &amp; Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
shall receiue a checke, whilest they are
brought to deale with those, whome they iudge
fewe, young, vnlearned, and not comparable to
them selues: or that it is a challenge not much
vnlike the Papistes: or lastly, that it shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall
to the estate of gouerment established:
It maye please their wisedomes vvho are to bee
iudges, to consider what vvee haue to aunsvvere
vnto these things: which, if they haue the truth
of God his word, containe the safest &amp; best way
in such cases, tend to the full quieting of all, and
the remoouing of the plagues vvhich are vppon
vs, and are like dayly further to come, euen from
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon aduersary: VVe may boldly yet most
humbly vppon our knees requyre them before
God and all his elect Angels no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> to cast it away.
VVherfore for the first, let vs grant the great
difference vvhich they make of yeares and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet the speech of Elihu giueth them suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
answere,<note place="margin">Iob. 32. 7. 8.</note> that this vnderstanding is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to such outvvard respectes but to the<note place="margin">Iob. 32. 21. 22.</note> * reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Gods spirit, and to accept in such cases
the persons of men, or to giue titles, is but to
prouoke God to destroy vs. Yea let the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Epistles, and euen of *<note place="margin">Act. 11. 1. 2. 3 4. &amp;c.</note> Peter in yeelding to the
challenge of some not so well instructed mooue
them, vvho not onely not refused the Leuites &amp;
Elders; but accepted the people in some maner
to be heard to speake, and to authorize their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
and writings: at least let their own
opinion, that, in interpreting the scriptures and
deliuerye of doctrine,<note place="margin">D. VVhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifts booke. page. 389.</note> we are equall vvith them,
persvvade them, not to refuse those, vvho if they
coulde straine their consciences to subscribe to
the Archbish. articles, they would gladly receiue
them to be the Ambassadors of Iesus Christ. As
for the fevvnes it may bee, if the ignorant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
the varietie of other which subscribe, some
doing it vvith this limitation &amp; some vvith that,
some holding their former iudgement as not
gaine sayd by their subscription, some lamenting
their slip in that behalfe vvere deducted, the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the one vvoulde not so greatly surmount
the other. As for the challenge of the Papistes
knit vp vvith the consideration of the estate, the
difference may be considered in the matter and
maner. Concerning the matter, they make it in
the substaunce of religion vvhich hath in diuers
assemblies abroad and at home beene disputed,
resolued, and novv publikly maintayned for our
true &amp; holy faith. VVe in maters concerning the
gouernment of Christ of great moment indeed,
yet neuer thus handled, nor vrging the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but perfection of the estate of the Church, &amp;
further good of the common wealth, vvhilst by
this means amongst many other things of great
importance, the ignorant ministery, &amp; by it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,
<pb facs="tcp:12169:5"/>
&amp; by popery rebellion should be auoyded,
vvhich by the other are most manifestly bred &amp;
nourished. Concerning the maner, they call it to
a sudden and tumultuous reasoning, vvhere the
readiest vvit, the best memorye, the moste filed
speech, shall carry avvaye the truth, at least mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailously
moue the vngrounded harers. VVe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that where both sides may vpon mature &amp;
sufficient deliberation be beard vvithout any of
these shewes, and the matter deliuered vnto her
maiestie, their Hh: and vvhomsoeuer they shall
chuse, to receiue and examine the allegations of
both sides: So that it neede not be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto the people, vntill the manifest light of
truth appeare first vnto them. And if this so safe
and reasonable an offer, cannot be liked in the
respect of the last obiected consideration, vve
thinke it impossible, but the persons vvhich de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
a vvay so sound, peaceable and dutifull, shall
recouer this fauor that vvith safety of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
they shall exercise their ministery vvith
that libertie, vvhich is meet for those, vvho shall
be tyed in all thinges to haue especiall regard to
the peace of the Church and publique orders.
VVherefore most christian Reader, vvhen thou
shalt by these sevve, take knovvledge of these
things, pray vnto God for vs, and as thy place is,
solicite and further so iust a cause, to this ende
onely, that Christes kingdome may be perfectly
established, the consciences of al the godly qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted,
and the happy regiment of her maiestie
honored, vvith much peace ioye and quietnesse
at home.</p>

prescribed by the Housholder
himselfe: Which order is not to bee

perfect rule of all our life, and able
to make the man of God perfect,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 17.</note>

            <p>This foundation being surely layde,<note place="margin">VVhat mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are appointed in the church.</note>
against which the gates of hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

by which he woulde haue his house
or church to be directed in al things,
appertaining to the eternall saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Nowe we finde in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that our sauiour Christe ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into Heauen, was not vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of his Church on earth,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11.</note> but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
an holy ministerye of men,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> to
the building vp of the body of Christ
in vnity of faith and knowledge. We
finde also, that as the offices are
diuerse of this ministery: so they are
not generall vnto all the Church, but
as order and necessitye require, for
executing of their office, distributed
and limitted vnto certaine places or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12169:6"/>
particuler Churches, according to
the diuision of Regions, Cities, and
Townes. For we reade that <hi>Paule</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> ordeyned at <hi>Derbe, Lystra,
Iconium, Antiochia, &amp;c:</hi> Elders by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in euery Churche,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 23.</note> with Prayer

to the Lorde, in whome they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.<note place="margin">Titus. 1. 5.</note>
Also <hi>Paule</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> in the Ile of
<hi>Creta,</hi> that he shoulde ordaine Elders
in euery City, as hee had appointed.
Concerning the diuers offices of the
Ministery, wee are taught by Saynte
<hi>Paule.</hi> Rom. 12. 6. Also 1. Cor.
12. 28. and Ephes. 4. 11.<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6. 1. Cor. 12. 28 Ephes. 4. 11.</note> Where
we reade, that God hath ordained in
the ministery of his Church, these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
offices: Namely, <hi>Apostles, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes,
Prophetes, Pastors, Doctours, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoures</hi>
and <hi>Deacons:</hi> Also men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed

            <p>Of these offices, some were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
seruing onelye for the firste
planting &amp; foundation of the church
amonge the Heathen: some are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12169:7"/>
perpetuall, pertaining to the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
and building vp the Church for
euer. Of the former sort were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Prophets, Euangelists, men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the graces of powers, of
healings, and of diuerse tongues. Of
the latter kinde are doctors, Pastors,
Gouernours and Deacons. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were ordained by God, and sent
foorth immediatly by Christ, hauing
a generall Commission to spread the
Gospell ouer all the worlde: Which
worke when they had accomplished,
that office ceased.<note place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> Such were the 12.
Apostles,<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And for this cause the Apostles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Mathias</hi> in the place of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 1. 15.</note>
according to the Scriptures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
neuerthelesse, the election
vnto God, by casting of Lots, that the
number might bee full, for the first
planting of the Churche. But when
<hi>Herod</hi> had slaine <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of
<hi>Iohn</hi> with the sworde,<note place="margin">Act. 12. 2.</note> they chose no
man to succeede in his place, because
they had no warrant of Gods worde,
but the holy ghost, as he sawe it was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12169:7"/>
expedient for the Church, afterward
separated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at <hi>Antioche,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 2.</note> as Prophetes and
Teachers, to the worke whereto hee
had called them.</p>
            <p>The Prophets were suche as were
indued with a singular gifte of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
in the interpretation of the
Scriptures,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> and applying them to the
present vse of the Church:<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11.</note> of whome
some also did foreshewe of thinges to
come,<note place="margin">Acts. 11. 28<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> &amp; 21. 10.</note> as <hi>Agabus.</hi> Also there were
in euery City that Prophecied to S.
<hi>Paul,</hi> as he passed by them, that bonds

at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts. 20. 23</note> This office being in the
number of them that were ordeyned
for beautifying the Gospell, in the
first publishing thereof, it ceassed with
that singuler and extraordinary gift,
to bee an ordinarye function of the
Church.</p>
            <p>The Euangelists were such as were
stirred vp of God, to assist the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in their ministerye of generall
charge: in planting the Gospell, and
confirming the same by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12169:8"/>
but inferiour in dignity to the
Apostles.<note place="margin">Acts. 8. 5.</note> Such was <hi>Philip</hi> that firste
preached the gospel in <hi>Samaria:</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were sent by the
Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 14.</note> to conferre vnto them by
prayer and imposition of hands, the
visible Graces of the holye Ghoste,
which <hi>Philip</hi> did not. The same <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
in Act. 21.<note place="margin">Acts. 21. 8.</note> verse 8. is called an
Euangelist. So is <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2. Timoth.
4. 5.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 5. 5</note> Such was <hi>Titus, Silus,</hi> and many
other. This office also with the order
of the Apostles is expired, and hath
no place. Likewise, as wee doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see, that the gifts of healing, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvers
or myracles, and of diuerse
tonges, haue long since ceassed to be
in the Church: So the offices of them
which were grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded vpon these gifts,
must also cease and bee determined.
Therfore the Papists do vainly retain
the name &amp; office of Exorcists, when
they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not cast out diuels: &amp; extream
vnction, when they cannot cure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases:
and to speak with straunge
tonges, which they haue not by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
&amp; that without any interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12169:8"/>
which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.<note place="margin">1. Corin. 14.</note>
There remayneth therefore
of these before rehearsed, onely in the
Church, these Ecclesiasticall offices
instituted of God:<note place="margin">VVhat offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces remaine in the Church.</note> namely, <hi>Pastors,
Doctors, Gouernours,</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> By
which the church of God may, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his worde, be directed in all
matters, which are commonly called
Ecclesiasticall. And therefore as it is
vnlawful, so it is vnneedeful for men,
following the deuises of their owne
brayne, without the warrant of Gods
worde, to institute and ordayne anye
other offices or kindes of ministerye
beside these, appointed &amp; approued
by God himself, exercised in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
&amp; pure church, vntil the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of iniquity working a way for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristes
pride &amp; presumption, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Gods ordinance, and brought in
al kind of false doctrine &amp; confusion:
and now againe, restored in al rightly
reformed Churches, with such daylie
increase, and glory of the kingdom of
Christ, and suppression of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Sathan, that the onelye expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12169:9"/>
hereof, might bee a sufficient
perswasion to vs to leaue this disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
state of ours, wherein we haue
so long laboured with so little profit:
and to imbrace that most beautifull
order of Ecclesiastical regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, which
God so manifestlye doth blesse and
prosper in our neighboures handes.
But while we speake of Ecclesiasticall
gouernment, it maye bee thought of
some, that we shoulde intreat first of
the supreame authority of Christian
Princes: Whereuppon it seemeth that
al the regiment of the church depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
which is such a myst to dazle the
eyes of ignoraunt persons, that they
thinke all thinges in the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
state, ought to be disposed by that
onelye high authoritye and absolute
power of the Ciuil magistrate. Others
there be, with more colour of reason,
that referre onely indifferent matters
to the disposition of Princes: but in
determining indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t matters, they
shewe themselues not to bee indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Iudges. For, whatsoeuer it shall
please the Ciuill Magistrate, or them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12169:9"/>
to call or count indifferent, it
must be so holden of all men, without
anye further enquiry. But of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
authority of christian princes
in Ecclesiasticall causes, howe farre it
exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth by the word of God: we shal
haue better occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to intreat hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when we haue described the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
state. And that it is neither
needefull nor agreeable to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of teaching, to begin first there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
it may be plaine to euerye man
by this reason. The Church of God
was perfect in all her regiment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was any Christian Prince:
yea, the Churche of God may stande,
and doth stande at this day in moste
blessed estate, where the Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
are not the greatest fauorers.
By which, it is manifest, that the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and gouernement thereof, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
not vppon the authority of
Princes, but vpon the ordinaunce of
God, who hath most mercifully and
wisely so established the same, that as
with the comfortable ayde of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Magistrates, it may singulerlie
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12169:10"/>
flourish &amp; prosper, so without it, it may
continue, and against the aduersaries
therof preuail. For the church craueth
help &amp; defence of christian Princes, to
continue &amp; go forward more peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
&amp; profitably, to the setting vp of
the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Christ: but al hir autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
she receiueth immediatly of God.
Let vs therfore return to those offices
of Ecclesiasticall regiment, which now
remain to be exercised in the Church
of God, being instituted &amp; ordained
by Christe himselfe, which before we
haue proued out of the scriptures to
be only these, <hi>Doctors, Pastors, Gouernors</hi>
&amp; <hi>Deacons,</hi> wherof some appertain to
doctrin,<note place="margin">Doctors.</note> some to gouernment and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
The duty of doctors &amp; Pastors,
is chiefly to teach and instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
of god, in al things that God hath
appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to learne. The office of
Elders &amp; Deacons, is to prouide that
good order and discipline bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the church. These offices being
rightly established &amp; exercised in the
Church, are able to make vs meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the vnity of faith, and know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12169:10"/>
of the sonne of God, vnto a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect
man acording to doctrine.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 13.</note> And
both for doctrine and order of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
to make vs one body of
Christe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 27.</note> and members one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Nowe what shoulde be desired
more then this in the church of God?
or what wisdom of man can espy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the spirite of God, by what
means this shold be brought to effect
which we do desire? what mans wit ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
deuise better, then the wisdom of god
hath expressed? Or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> God hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
an order, for the administra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of his own house: what presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of man dare change it? But what dare
not dust &amp; ashes presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e to do against
his maker, &amp; that with greatest inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience,
when with best pretences of
correcting and reforming that, which
they do thinke to be vnperfect in his
doings? Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple thereof we haue most
euident. That which is alleaged as the
chief defence of this disordered state,
which now remaineth in our church:
namely, that our fathers of old time
were not content with the simple or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12169:11"/>
instituted by Christe, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by his Apostles: but for better
gouerning of the Church, thought
good some offices to ad therto, some
to take away: some to alter &amp; change:
and in effect to peruerte and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Christian and Ecclesiastical
pollicie, which was builded vpon the
foundation of the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 20.</note>
Iesus Christ being the cheeft
corner stone. But how vnhappy a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
this good intent, (as they call
it) of theirs deserued to haue of God,
who alwayes abhorreth all good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes
of men, that are contrarye to
the good pleasure of his will, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in his holy worde, the age before
vs (alasse) hath felt, the present time
doth plainly see, and wee praye God
the posterity, warned by examples of
their auncesters, maye take heede of
it. For where there are specially two
thinges propounded in the Churche
of God: Doctrine and Discipline, as
if a man woulde say, knowledge and
practise, by which the glory of God
is sought and shineth therin: In steed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12169:11"/>
of true Doctrine, followed all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of corruptions of the same, both
in the whole and in euery part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as ignorance, heresies, idolatry, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
&amp;c. The Discipline dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
vnto intollerable tyrannye
and external domination, clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye
to the commaundemente of
Christ, whereof insued all vnbrideled
license of vngodly liuing. To be short,
the exchaunge of the ordinaunce of
God and Christ,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> brought in nothing
else, but the Diuell and Antichriste.
Wherefore if we minde such a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as shall bee acceptable to
God, &amp; profitable vnto his church:
We must thoroughly bee resolued to
set vp no new kinde of ministerye, of
our owne inuention, neyther for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
nor for discipline in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
state, but bring all thinges to
that most perfect and absolute order,
which God himselfe hath established
by his worde. And because all offices
of the Churche are so lincked togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the members of one bodye,
whereof Christe is the heade: we will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12169:12"/>
so describe one part, as the descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> al may be sufficiently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
therin. As if a man wold set forth
the manifold office &amp; vses of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d,
he shold declare what it doth alone, &amp;
what it doth with the helpe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, or with the arme, with the
brest, with the knee, or with the foot,
&amp;c: what it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> do with diuers kinds of
tooles, &amp; what without al maner of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts. This order we thought good
to obserue, in describing the ministery
of the Church, as by which, both the
distinction &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of al offices
&amp; seruices in the Church, might most
plainli appear. Otherwise we force not
by what method, so the same truth be
plainly set forth by any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. And as we
controle not other mens methods by
ours, so we wold not, that other mens
maner of teaching shold be preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to ours. This we say because of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
which either for lack of wit, or thorow
too much wilfulnes, if they see any dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference
in the form &amp; order of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of diuers men, though in matter &amp;
substaunce they all agree, they exclaim
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12169:12"/>
there is no vnitie, &amp; therfore no truth
among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. Let vs then proceed in our
purpose. The office of teaching is the
chiefe &amp; principall office that is in the
church. By that we be taught to know
God, &amp; how to serue him, &amp; what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to look for at his hand, without
which knowlege, ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> be no felicity
but only destruction loked for, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the saying of the wise man:
<hi>Wher propheciyng fayleth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 29. 18.</note> 
               <hi>ther the people pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
The ministery is diuided into two
functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s: they that exercise the first are
called <hi>Pastors:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The office of a Doctor.</note> the other are called <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
or <hi>Teachers.</hi> The office of a <hi>Doctor</hi>
is to teach, as the very name doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
but yet euery teacher is not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
thereby, for it appertaineth to Pastors
also to teach: yet this latter is distinct
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the former. Almighty God, being
carefull that true doctrin should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his church, from time to time
most wisely prouided, that certain me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
shold be appointed in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he hath endued with gifts
meete for the same purpose) which
shoulde employe themselues, either
wholly or principally to the studie of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12169:13"/>
holy scriptures, therebye to learne to
auouche the principles of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to represse and beate downe
al false and strange opinions, of which
sathan neuer ceaseth to sow the seeds,
but cheefly where this office is not set
vp &amp; mayntained according to Gods
ordinance. These men must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselues with contemplatiue
knowledge: but, as by the grace of
God they excell other men in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
so they must diligentlye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the same learning,
and openly confute al false Doctrine
and herisie: and especially they ought
to take payne in the instruction of
such men, as maye bee made meete
to serue in the Churche: as Pastoures,
and to succeede in their place as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.
Their institution is set foorth,

ambitious desire of exercising Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
exhorting them to painfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
because they were Byshops or
Ouerseers: to a ready care, because
they were Pastoures, and therefore
should labour for loue of the flock,
and not for lucre like hirelinges: to
modest humility, because their cheef
dignity in that they were Elders, was
to excell in Godlinesse, that they
might be an ensample to the flock,
which cannot bee, except they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

of <hi>Archipresbyter</hi> or chiefe of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
pertayneth tono mortall man,
may bee seene by this place, where
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> that excellent and high
Apostle, who if anye man coulde,
might as well as anye, haue chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
that name, durste not call
him selfe other then <hi>Sunpresbyteros,</hi>
a fellowe Elder, no not when hee
sought authoritie to him selfe, by
that name to be bold, to exhort the
Elders of the Church. But least any
man shoulde thinke wee staye onely
in names and tearmes, which are
not so greatlye materiall: let him
consider, that Sainte <hi>Peter</hi> expresly
forbiddeth the Elders, to exercise
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12169:19"/>
Lordship ouer their seuerall congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
how much more ouer their
fellowe Elders. Which thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
our Sauiour Christ precisely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth,
when there was a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among his Apostles, about the
prymacie.<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 25.</note> 
               <hi>The kings of the nations haue
dominion ouer them, and they that beare
rule ouer them are called gratious Lordes
or beneficiall, but you shall not be so.</hi> Also
Math. 20. 25.<note place="margin">Mat. 20: 25.</note> and Mark. 10. 41. vpon
the ambitious request of the sonnes
of Zebedy,<note place="margin">Mark. 10. 41.</note> and the disdaine of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against them. <hi>The Princes of the
Gentiles, exercise Lordship ouer them, and
they that be great, exercise authoritie ouer
them, but it shall not be so amongst you, but
who so will be great amongst you, let him be
your Minister, and he that will be first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, let him be your seruaunt.</hi> The
same thing he taught by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when hee washed his Apostles
feet,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13. 13.</note> and commanded them to shew
the like humilitie one towarde an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which were all brethren, which
he their Lord and maister shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. Also Math. 23. 8.<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 8.</note> &amp;c. he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12169:19"/>
forbiddeth all ambitious Titles of
Rabbi, Maister, Father, &amp;c. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hee addeth, <hi>for you are all Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
For these names agree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to God &amp; Christ. For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
dignitie of an Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a ministery, and not a lordship.
S. Ioh.<note place="margin">3. Iohn. 9.</note> also in his third epistle sharply
reprooueth Diotrephes, because he
was <hi>Philoproteuon,</hi> one that desired
the primacie in the Church. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in this case we must take heede,
that we spoyle not the ministers of
the church, of al their lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
For, although these testimonies
of scripture, directly condemne the
authoritie of one Pastour aboue an
other: yet neither do they set euery
pastour at libertie by him selfe, to do
what they list without controlment:
nor yet doe take away the lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
he hath ouer his flocke: but
that imperious and pompeous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
which is meet for ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
and great Potentates to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
in worldly affayres: otherwise
in respect of their lawfull authoritie,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12169:20"/>
they are called by the Apostle in his
Epistle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note> Guides,
such as are appoynted to ouersee
the flocke with authority, and vnto
them submission and obedience is
commaunded in the same Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
verse 17. Other names are
applied to them in the Scripture,
but they bee for the moste parte
more generall, pertaining to all
kinde of Teachers in the Church of
GOD, both in the time of the Lawe
and of the Gospell, as <hi>Seers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
VVatchmen, Angelles, Labourers,
Builders, Stewardes,</hi> and such like: all
which with many other, serue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
some parte of their office, as
their knowledge, their diligence, their
authority, their faithfullnesse, their
discretion: also the necessity of them,
the commoditie that commeth by
them &amp;c. But concerning the names
of Pastours, as they are a speciall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Church, this maye suffise.
But for as muche as we haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
so to describe a Pastour and
and his office, as all other offices of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12169:20"/>
the Church, may be described there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
wee must not staye onelye in
the name, but set foorth also the
whole substaunce of the person. For
which intent, it shall bee necessarye
for vs to consider a Pastour or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
these two wayes: in the proper
function of his Ministerye, and in
gouernement with his Elders: By
which we shall vnderstande how this
Ministerye ought to bee refourmed
and restored amongest vs. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
his office, something hath
beene sayde before generallye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the description of his seuerall
names. But now more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
wee must examine, what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to his charge. The Pastor must
be limitted to one onelye congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such competent number, as
he, (if hee be but one,) or if they be
two, may be sufficient, to the instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all and euerye member of the
same Church. And first, he may no
more lawfully haue charge of two or
three churches, then he can be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in diuerse places. No more then a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12169:21"/>
sheephearde of whome he taketh his
name, may haue the leading of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
flockes in diuers places: neither
maye he be absent from his charge,
with better reason, then a shepheard
from his flocke. As for substitutes or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>
hyrelinges, will not bee allowed in
this case: for Pastors are substitutes
of God, and haue an office of credite
committed vnto them, therefore by
no good reason may they make any
substitutes in their place, or commit
their charge vnto an other. The law
of a man grounded vppon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
alloweth not substitutes of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes:
nor committing ouer of an
office of credite in temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
How shall God almighty then
take it in good part, when the flocke
of Christe, which he hath purchased
with his own bloud, shal be so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected, to the endaungering
of their euerlasting saluation? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ordinaunce of God is, that
the Pastor should attend vnto his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

vnmeete for the office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor

minde suche a reformation, as God
shall thereby bee glorifyed, and his

remooue al the vnlearned pastors, as
men by no means to be tollerated to
haue any charge ouer the lords flok:
&amp; also prouide that herafter none be

            <p>But here it will be aunswered, that,
as it is a thing greatly to be desired:
To it is altogether vnpossible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
the Church of so many learned

required at our hands by God

no impossibilitie, especially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
our owne negligence, is the cause of
all the difficultie, or if you will so
call it, impossibilitie. We confesse it
will be harde at the first, but we must
doe our endeuour, and commit the
successe vnto God, and there is no
doubt but in time it will grow to an
happy ende. But when we shall be
altogether carelesse, as we haue been
of long time, and that is worse, not
acknowledging anye default in this
behalfe, (as there be that doe not):
and that is most of all, mayntaining
suche lets and hinderaunces as bee
continuall nurseies of ignoraunce
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12169:24"/>
and ignorant pastors: We may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to alledge that difficulty, for
which none are to be blamed but we
our selues. We may be ashamed, now
that our church hath had rest and
peace, with free preaching of the gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel
this 25. or 26. years, vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tection
of our most gratious Queen,
to bee so vnfurnished of learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
as we are: whereas, if that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

might and shoulde haue beene em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
of all them, that vnfaignedly
seeke the kingdome of God and his

what diligent &amp; carefull prouision is
able to do with the blessing of God:

Church or parrishe be prouided of a
learned Pastour. For vnskilful sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes
haue beene to long thrust
vppon vs, to the great dishonour of
God and defacing of the Gospell of
Christe. We haue hitherto taken
vpon vs without warraunt of Gods
worde, to allow such for Pastours of
mens soules, whom no carefull ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Cattell, woulde make ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer
of his sheepes bodyes. Which
thing almightye God hath alwayes
detested, and signified his mislyking
by diuers testimonies, both of the
olde and newe Testament. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sayeth by the Prophet Esaye,
complayning of the vnlearned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
of Israell, which was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
cause of their affliction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.
<hi>Their watchmen are all blinde,
they haue no knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 56. 10. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>they cannot barke,
they lye and sleepe and delight in sleeping,
and these greedie dogges can neuer haue
ynough, and these sheepheardes cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
for they all looke to their owne
way, euery one for his aduantage and for
his owne purpose. Come I will bring wine,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12169:27"/>
and we wil fill our selues with strong drink,
and to morrowe shall bee as, this day, and
much more aboundant.</hi> If the Prophet
had liued in these our days, might
he not haue spoken the same more
truely of many Shiers in Englande?
We see therefore that blinde watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ignoraunt dumbe Dogges,
and idle greedie Curres and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sheepheardes that serue for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to fill their owne purses,
or their paunches, by the testimonie
of God his spirite, are denied to be
meet Pastours of the people of God.
The prophet Ezechiell also inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at large, against the vnfeeding
sheepheardes of Israell:<note place="margin">Eze. 34. 2. 3. 4</note> saying <hi>(Woe)
be vnto the sheepheardes of Israell which
feede them selues: shoulde not the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes
feede the flockes? Yee eate the fat
and you cloth you with the wooll: yee kill
them that are fedde, but yee feede not the
sheepe. The weake haue yee not strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the sicke haue yee not healed, neither
haue yee bound vp the broken, nor brought
againe that which was driuen awaye, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue yee sought that which was lost,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12169:28"/>
&amp;c.</hi> throughout the whole Chapter.
When feeding of Gods sheepe is a
matter of so great importaunce, and
consisteth of so many partes, which
the Prophet hath heere described,
how shoulde we admit them whome
God reiecteth? which being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
and vnlearned, knowe nothing
at all, and therefore nothing can do
that appertaineth to this charge, or
any part thereof. Vndoubtedly the
retaining of such, is a manifest token
of the vengeance of God against vs,
for so he threatneth by the Prophet
<hi>Zachary:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zac. 15. 16. 16</note> his wordes are these. <hi>And
the Lorde sayde vnto me: Take to thee yet
the Instrumentes of a foolish Sheepheard,
for loe, I will rayse vp a Sheapheard in the
Lande, which shall not looke for the thinge
that is lost, nor seeke the tender Lambes,
nor heale that is hurt: nor feed that which
standeth vp, but he shall eat the flesh of the
fat, &amp; tear their hooues in peeces. O Idole
sheaphearde that leaueth the flocke, the
Sworde shall bee vppon his arme, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his right eye: his arme shall be cleane
dried vp, and his right eye shall bee vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12169:28"/>
darkened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, seeing we are taught by these
wordes of the Lord God, that it is a
greate and horrible plague, to haue
the church of God encumbred with
such foolish and Idole Sheapheards:
Let vs study to remoue such plagues
from the flocke of Christe, vvhose
armes are cleane dried vp that they
haue no force, and their eyes vtterly
darkned, that they haue no skill, so
that they are not able to perfourme
those duties, which pertaine to a
vvise and faythfull Sheaphearde, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
wee will betraye the Sheepe
of Christe, into the mouthes of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous
Wolues, and speciallye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Lyon the deuill,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 8.</note> who neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
going aboute to seeke whome
hee may deuoure for his pray. For
what doe these readinge Ministers
differ from those Idole Sheapheards,
which God in his vengeance threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to sende for the ingratitude of
the people?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:12169:29"/>
It wil be answered (no doubt) that
to supplie their ignorance, there are
added to their appointed seruice, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Godly &amp; learned homilies, which
if they read with their seruice, there
is not so great neede of Preaching, &amp;
interpretation of the scriptures. We
will derogate nothing here from the
dignitie of those homilies: we will
not accuse here the vnsensible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of vnlearned ministers, neither
yet the vnreuerent contempt of the

those exhortations that are not

is the office and duetie of a Pastor,
both to be able and willing to teach

his flocke, and that no ignorant and

or a Wolfe of a Sheapheard, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in steede of light, or Salt that is
vnsauory, to season withal. But while
we intreat of teaching, to be the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a pastor, we do not only meane
publike preaching, when the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is assembled, but also priuate
exhortation, reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sion, consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
of euery particular person within his
charge, so often as need shall require.
And that this also is the duetye of a

but also he must instruct euery fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
priuatelie, vvhersoeuer hee shal see
it to be needfull or expedient, which
duty cannot bee accomplished by a

Pastors in teaching, both publikely
and priuately: as well generallye all

one of them. Hee therefore that is
vnapt to execute this parte of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors

the least charge that can bee, to such
persons as he knoweth to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that can be, the saluation of so many

But necessitie (you wil answere) hath

through the desaulte of teaching, in

may be supplied, either by restoring
the sacriledges of Abbies, as Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12169:32"/>
and exhorting so many as
are able, to take that charge in hand,
by ouerseeing the Readers &amp; schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in diuinity in the Vniuersities, to
doe their duties, the one in teaching

or vnwilling to set forward the study
of diuinity in their seuerall huoses, &amp;
placing diligent and learned gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
&amp; students in their places, &amp; by

And in the meane time till God shal
blesse vs with a sufficient number of
learned pastors, to take some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie

instructed and gouerned: yet
so many shall not be altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
of al knowledge and spiritual
gouernment, as ther are now in this
most corrupt state of the Church, in
which we haue hitherto continued.
If any man thinke this is ouer harde
to be brought to passe, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that there was neuer worke of
more difficulty, then to build vp the
Church of God: so that the necessity
and commodity of the work, should
cause vs to stay nothing at the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie

endeuor, we shall not want the migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty

our Godly labours, with greater suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
then we can looke for. If God

the high authority of our dread so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
the Queenes Maiesty, and

which we enioy, vnder her most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

the time, that is already prosperous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passed, of her Maiesties moste ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and glorious reigne, the
necessity of learned pastors shall bee
so well supplied, as wee shall haue no
great cause to complaine for lacke
of them, if we may vse like diligence
to continue them: if not, we wil spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d
the rest of oure life in mourning, &amp;
expectation of the heauy vengeance
of God, which must needes fall vpon
vs, for this manifest contempt of his

of increasing the glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of our Sauiour Christe. In the

the Apostle. Act. 20.<note place="margin">Actes. 20. 26. 27.</note> 
               <hi>We testify vnto you

Hitherto wee haue somewhat at
large set foorth, the principall parte
of a Pastors office, which is to preach
the word of God, and to instruct the
people committed to his charge in
the same. Here followeth now in the
second part of his duety, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in right administration of the
Sacramentes of God. For seeing it
hath pleased God to adde such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
signes to be helpes of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
as seales for confirmation of
his promises, vttered by his worde

the duetie of Pastours to feede the
flocke of God committed to their
charge, with all maner of spirituall
pasture of their soules, appoynted by
God. 1. Cor. 4. 1.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 1.</note> And that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12169:34"/>
are a part of this spiritual
food, it is manifest that it belongeth
to the dutie of Pastors, to administer
the holy Sacramentes: and that the
Sacramentes appertaine to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
and worde of God, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that whome God hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be minister of the worde, him
also hath he made to be minister of
the Sacramentes: and as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
are compared by the holye
Ghost vnto seales: and the worde or
promise of God vnto writinges: so
it appertaineth to him to deliuer the
seale, which deliuereth the writings.
For, as the seale hath alwayes relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto the writinges: so haue the
Sacramentes vnto the word of God.
By this it appeareth, that as it is the
duetie of euerye Pastour to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Sacramentes of Christe: so
this office appertayneth to none, but
to those which are ministers of the
worde. Our Sauiour Christ autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
his Apostles to Baptize all
Nations, sayeth: <hi>Goe yee foorth and
teache all Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 28. 19.</note> 
               <hi>baptizing them

foorth the Lords death vntill he come.</hi> By
these testimonies it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, that the
administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts ought
to bee committed to none, but vnto
such as are Preachers of the worde,
that are able to teach them that they
baptise, that are able to preache the
mystery of Christs death to them, to
whom they doe deliuer the outward
signe thereof. Howe intollerable an
abuse then is it, of the sacraments of
the Lord, to commit the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them to those men, that are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12169:35"/>
not able to expounde the mystery of
them. And seeing the elementes of
the worlde, of which the outwarde
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>acriledge to seperate the ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of preaching of the worde from
the sacramentes? And forasmuch as
the spirite of God, compareth the
Sacraments to seales that are added,
for confirmation of writinges; wee
knowe well that a worde or writing,
may be auailable without a seale, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ommit the administration of the
Sacramentes to those men, who not
onely haue beene knowne to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but also haue beene forbidden
to preach the word. And that which
is more strange, to be suffered in this
cleare light of the Gospel, to permit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12169:36"/>
the ministration of baptisme, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ignorante men, but also to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which haue no voyce to speake
in the congregation. 1. Cor. 14. 34.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 34.</note> &amp;
1. Tim. 2. 11.<note place="margin">Tim. 2. 11.</note> and that in priuate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but in case (they say) of necessity,
as though there were such necessity
of the outward signe, when it cannot
bee ministred according to the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Christ, which is nothing els
but to affirme with the Papistes, that
Sacraments confer grace of the work
wrought: and that the sacrament of
baptisme, is a sacrament of such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
that whosoeuer is not dipped
in water, must be eternally condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Which hereticall opinion, as we
haue hissed out in our profession and
preaching, so is it a great shame for
vs to maintain by such corrupt vsage
of Christes holy sacramentes. Let vs
therefore reteine this principle, that
the administration of the sacraments
is a part of the pastors duety: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the office of preaching bee
more excellent, then of ministration
of the sacraments, as S. Paul speaketh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12169:36"/>
comparatiuely. <hi>Christ sent me not to
baptize but to preach.</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 17.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 17.</note> Yet
they are of such affinitie, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
cannot be seperated from the
principall thereof. For where is no
preacher of the worde, ther ought to
be no minister of the Sacramentes.
Furthermore, it pertaineth to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the pastor, to make prayers: as
Act. 16. 16.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 16.</note> not onely priuate, as all
men are bound to doe, but also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
prayers in the name of the whol
Church. Act. 6. 4. 1. Timot. 2. 1. being
the mouth thereof.<note place="margin">Acts. 6. 4.</note> For whereas the
spirit of God,<note place="margin">Tim. 2. 1.</note> commandeth al things
to be done in decent and comely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 16.</note>
and forbiddeth all confusion and
disorder. As it were great confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> &amp;
vncomelines, for euery man to make
his seuerall praiers in the publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies:
so is it orderly for one to
pronounce the praier in the name of
the rest, and the rest to pray with him
in silence, &amp; to answer Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. It is also
dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t that he which is the shepherd,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14 40.</note>
should go before the sheep in praier,
&amp; the sheepe to follow him in lifting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12169:37"/>
vp of their harts in mutuall consent.
Moreouer for asmuch as preaching
and administration of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts,
ought not to bee vsed without pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
prayers: as it is the Pastors of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to preache, and minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
so is it his duety also to go
before his flocke in publique pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>But heere we haue to obserue two
things: the first, that as it perteineth
to the Pastor to conceiue publique
praiers: so it is the duty of the whole
Church, in the name of the whole
Church, to ioyne in hart with the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in the same praiers, that they
knowing and vnderstanding what he
hath praied, may at the end giue ther
consent by answering Amen.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 16</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their is great abuse in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
For, as though it weare noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to keepe out preaching by
longe prescribed formes of praier:
these praiers are so pronounced by
the minister, that a great number, &amp;
some not of the worst disposed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
thinck, it perteineth not to them,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12169:37"/>
to giue eare or consent of mind vnto
them. We speake not here of such
insensible Readers, whose voyce ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot be heard, or else cannot
be vnderstood, wherof there be great
numbers: nor of the vnfit place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
for the ministers, standing at
prayer in the east ende of the house,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the simple people shal stand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>times
40. or 50. yards of in the west
ende: or of the confusion of voyces
whilest all speake at once: besides
scrines of roode-lofts, Organe lofts,
Idoll cages, otherwise called Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
Chappelles, and high pewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them: which although they
do manifestly hinder edifycation, yet
may they not be remooued in many
places, for defacing the beauty of the
materiall houses, whereas S. Paule so
much estemeth the building of gods
spirituall house, that he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the glorious giftes of the holye
Ghost to cease in the congregation,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 28.</note>
when they do not helpe to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But we speake of this that a great
multitude thinke they haue wel ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12169:38"/>
God: if they haue been present
at common prayers, or anye part of
them, as they were wont to thinke in
popery, although they bee neuer so
vainly occupyed in the Church, some
in walking, some in talking, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of money, not onely for the
poore, but for other contributions,
&amp;c. And they that thinke they doe
best, are occupyed in their priuate
praiers, or in reading of books, while
their minister pronounceth publique
praiers.</p>
            <p>Thus as preaching is neglected, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
colour of publique prayers: So
publique prayers by priuate exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
are made altogether vnprofitable
to a great number. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the right vse of publique prayer,
but they that are taught by the word
of God. Let vs therfore establish pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
preaching, and publique pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will follow of necessitie. But if
we continue to vpholde formal prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that preaching bee neglected, it
will come to passe, that neither shall
be regarded. For what did thrust
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12169:38"/>
out preaching from the Romishe
Church, but long prescript formes of
reading, of singing, of praying: so that
their ordinarye was ynough, and to
much to occupye the whole daye,
though there were no sermon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
contrariwise there woulde be no
ordinarie publique prayer without
preaching. Which terrible example
of the practize of Sathan in the man
of sinne, shoulde make vs afrayde to
giue any like occasion of such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience
hereafter to come. For is
not this opinion already growen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great manye mens heades, that
the seruice maye not giue place to a
sermon, no though the time be not
sufficient for both? And are ther not
many that had much rather heare a
chaunted Mattens and Euensong,
then a godly &amp; learned sermon? Yea
they frequent the one, and refuse the
other. Let Cathedral Churches, &amp;c.
be an example, where you shall see a
great number, that tarrye while the
seruice is songe, but depart so soone
as the Sermon beginneth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:12169:39"/>
While the Organes pipe, some are
drawen with the sweetnes of musike
to come vp, but while the preacher
cryeth out, continue beneath and in
laughter or brawling, be lowder then
he oftentimes. So, that which was
wont to be sayd of the Masse, <hi>Missa
non mordet,</hi> the masse was a gentle
beast, and did bite no man, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was so well beloued of manye,
may rightly be verified of our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
seruice. For therefore a great
number can so well away with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it doth not sharpely reprooue
them of theire sinnes, nor disclose
the secreates of their heartes, but
that they maye continue still in all
kinde of voluptuousnes, and al other
kind of wickednes. Wheras by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
their conscience is gauled, ther
wickednes and hipocrisy discouered,
their damnation threatned, they are
called to repentaunce and forsaking
of their pleasant sinnes, and to holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and innocencie of life. So that
if there be any sparke of the feare of
God in them, hearing preaching, so
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12169:39"/>
often as they vse to heare seruice,
they will fall downe on their faces &amp;
worship God, acknowledging the
great power of God in his ministers.
1. Cor. 14. 15.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 15</note> But that they cannot
away with all, beeing like vnto Felix
the liefetenaunt of the Romanes in
Iewrie: Who when he heard Paule a
poore prysoner that stoode before
him bound in chaines, preaching of
righteousnes, of temperaunce, and of
the iudgement to come, he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of him because he was a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressour,
and an intemperate person,
and therfore feared the iudgment of
God for his sinne, which he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to forsake. Such is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
of Gods word, when it is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
that either it boweth or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the wicked in pieces. God grant
therefore that in steede of ordinarie
formes of praiers, we may haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in all places.</p>
            <p>The seconde thing that we haue to
obserue is this, that although we
make it the dutie of the Pastour, to
pray in the name of the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12169:40"/>
yet we doe not so meane,
but that the whole congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> with
one heart,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15 &amp; 26.</note> and with one voyce maye
praise God, with singing of Psalmes,
all at once. For this custome hath
continued in the church from the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning,
that the congregation haue
praised God with Psalmes singing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather.
And these three partes of
a pastors dutie, to preach, to minister
the sacramentes, and to praye, are so
necessarilye requyred of him in the
word of God, as no man may rightly
execute the office of a Pastor, but he
that performeth al these, each one in
their due time. And to this part of
prayer, maye be referred the blessing
of marriages, not of necessitie, but of
an auncient vse of the Church. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
in those thinges that are
necessarie partes of the Pastours of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the Church hath authoritie to
dispose them. as touching the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstaunces,
for order and comely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
sake: but cheefely for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As the dayes and times of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12169:40"/>
the places meet for the same,
&amp; for publique praiers: also the form
and maner of vsing those thinges, so
that all things be don comely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
to order, but especially that
in all things, principall regarde be had
to edification, which S. Paule so often
and so precisely vrgeth in the 14. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter
of the 1. Cor. For therfore ought
our assemblies and comminges toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to serue, that therefore we maye

besides these thinges, certaine other

of women, buriall of the deade,
thoughte to belonge to the office
of a Byshoppe or Pastour. Whereof
the firste two are meere deuises of
men, and ought to haue no place
in the Churche of Christe. The
other, albeit it bee to bee retayned
with a certayne honestye, yet it is
not to bee tied to the proper office
of a Pastour. And as for Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

it ought altogether to bee

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12169:43"/>
people of God to lacke the onelye

constitutions. But to conclude, it is
the duty of euery true Pastor, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
those thinges that are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the lawfull authoritye of the
church, concerning ceremonial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for order and comlinesse sake,
and for edification, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
publique order,<note place="margin">Acts. 28. 29.</note> by his priuate
iudgement, but vpon great &amp; waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
causes. Wee haue hitherto intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the proper dutye of a Pastour
himselfe: nowe it followeth, that we
likewise set foorth his authoritye
in common gouernment with the
Elders. But least any man shoulde
mistake that, which wee purpose to
say of his authority, wee haue neede
to expresse what wee meane by this
worde authoritye. For euen those
thinges that wee haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to bee the duetye of a Pastor,
may also bee called his authority, as
to preach and teach, wherein is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
his authoritye to forgiue
and retaine sinnes: also his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12169:43"/>
to minister the Sacramentes,
and to doe other thinges in the
Churche, which none may doe but
hee. But in this place, wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
authority, for power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
in the Church. Whereof
the Apostle speaketh,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> that it is one
of the graces and giftes of GOD
necessarye for the building of his
Church. This authority of regiment,
we haue declared that it ought not
to be a Lordly ruling,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 3.</note> neither ouer
their flocke:<note place="margin">Luke. 23. 26.</note> nor yet ouer their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
seruauntes and brethren: and
leaste of all, that they ought to haue
dominion or Lordship ouer the faith
of the Church.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 14.</note> In all these the man
of sinne hath exalted him selfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the worde of God: So that
he would be head of all the Church,<note place="margin">Hierarchia.</note>
Byshop of all Byshops, and haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye
to make nevve Articles of
Faythe. Whose vntollerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
as we haue long since ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out of this Lande: so we wish
that no steppes of such pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy,
might be left behind him:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12169:44"/>
namely, that no elder or minister of
the Church, shoulde challendge vnto
himselfe, or accept it, if it were offred
vnto him, any other authority, then
that is allowed by the spirit of God:
but cheefly to beware that hee vsurp
no authority which is forbidden by
the word of God. For wherefore do
wee de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>est the Pope and his vsurped
supremacy, but bicau<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi>se he arrogateth
the same vnto himself, not only with
out the warrant of Gods worde, but
also cleane contrarye to the same?
Now, if the same reasons &amp; authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that haue banished the Pope, do
serue to condemn all other vsurped
authoritye, that is practised in the
Church: Why shoulde not all such v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
authority be banished as well
as the Pope? We can alledge against
the Pope and rightly, that which S.
Ioh. Baptist did answere to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

from them, but shewed foorth
the decree, wherein he was authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:
By what rule ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> any man reteine
that authority in the church of god,
which is not called thereto by the
worde of God? Likewise we can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
again, against the supremacie
of the Pope, to proue that Peter was
not superiour to the other Apostles,
that which our sauiour Christ sayeth
to his Apostles,<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 26.</note> Luk. 22. 26. and Mat.

and all you are brethren.</hi> If these places
prooue, that the Pope ought not to
bee aboue other ministers of the
church: Why doe they not likewise
proue, that the Ministers are equal
among themselues? And for the most
part, all those arguments and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of Scripture, that are vsed
to confute the vsurped authoritie of
the pope, are of as great force aganst
all other vsurped authorities of one
pastor ouer an other. Therfore while
we intreate of the authoritie of the
pastors, we must take heede that we
open not a window to popish tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
in steede of pastorall authoritye,
&amp; that we enlarge not the bounds of
authoritye, without the boundes of
the Scripture. Wherefore while wee
search the Scripture, the onelye rule
whereby the Church of God oughte
to be gouerned, we finde that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
&amp; gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of the church,
the pastor, bishop or elder, hath none
authority by himself, seperated from
other. For in the Church, ther ought
to be no monarchy or sole absolute
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12169:45"/>
gouernment, but that is referred pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
to our sauiour Christe only,
2. Tim. 6. 7. Iude. 4.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 6. 15.</note> And that regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
which hee hath left vnto his

Math. 18. 19.<note place="margin">Math. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>If two of you consent vpon

Father, which is in Heauen: For wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
two or three bee gathered together in
my name, there am I in the middest of
them.</hi> Seeing therefore that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christe, hath neither authorized
nor promised to blesse anye other
forme of regiment, then that which
consisteth of the consent, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together of his Seruauntes in
his name: wee holde vs content with
this simplicity, and therefore we are
bolde to say, that the authoritye of
a Pastour in publique Regiment or
Discipline, seperate from others, is
nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Let vs then see, what is his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ioined with others, and first, who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12169:46"/>
are so ioyned in Commission with
him, that without their consent hee
can do nothing. We say therefore,
that the authority of Christ, is left
vnto his whole Church, and so to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
church, that none may challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ge
Episcopall or Metropoliticall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as it is with vs at this day ouer
other, without greate tyrannye and
manifest iniury. For, seeing our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christe, promised his presence
and authority to euery Churche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentlye,
Math. 18. 19. 20:<note place="margin">Math. 18. 19. 20.</note> None
may challenge any such prerogatiue
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ore other: but as the Churches
are limitted out for order &amp; conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency,
so is euery one of them of
like authority in it self: but because
they make al but one church, &amp; one
body of Christ, therefore there is but
one authority in them, to determine
of matters concerning them all. By
which ther appeareth to be a double
authority of the Pastor: one with the
seuerall congregation, in which he is
Pastour, the other with the whole
Synode or assembly, whereof hee is a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12169:46"/>
member, and both these authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
wee finde sufficientlye authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the Scripture, as shall playn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
appeare in the seuerall Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of them. First therefore, wee
will speake of his authoritye in his
seuerall Churche, in which hee maye
doe nothing without the consente
of the Churche. And first, let vs
examine, whether this authority bee
so diffused ouer the whole Churche,
that the hearing, trying and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myning
of all matters, pertayneth
to the vvhole multitude, or to some
speciall chosen persons amongest
them, meete for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The authoritye is the power of our
Lorde Iesus Christe, graunted vnto
the Church: But because the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the multitude is confuse,
whereas God is not the authoure
of Confusion, but of order: and
that we finde in the worde of God,
certayn Officers appoynted for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmente:
vvee are bolde to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that that charge belongeth
vnto those that are such.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:12169:47"/>
And that doth S. Paule playnely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
where hee putteth a difference
of the seuerall offices of the Church,
whereof hee nameth Gouernors for
one. 1. Cor. 28. 29.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 28. 29<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </note> and Rom. 12. 8.<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>2. 8.</note>
               <hi>Let him that ruleth doe it with diligence.</hi>
Therefore there ought to be in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church a Consistory or segnorye
of Elders or gouernors, which ought
to haue the hearinge, examination
and determining of all matters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to Discipline and Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Congregation: which
authoritye of theirs neuerthelesse
ought to be moderated, that their
iudgment may be rightly accounted
the iudgement of the holy Church.
Which thing consisteth in these two
pointes. First, that the Elders bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and chosen by consent of the
whole Congregation, men of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and Wisedome, in whome the
whole Churche reposeth such confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that they commit vnto them
their authoritye, in hearing &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
such matters, as without hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible
confusion they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not perform
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12169:47"/>
themselues. And hereto also may be
referred that, which is sayde of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Pastours, that the Apostles
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did ordain, by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the congregation, Elders vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many Churches, Actes. 14. 23.<note place="margin">Acts. 14. 23.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
the name of Elders is common
to both: to Pastors and Gouernors,
and is vsed in the Scripture to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
both at once, as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
manifestly by S. <hi>Paul. 1.</hi> Tim. 5. 7.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 7.</note>
               <hi>Those Elders that gouern well, are worthy
of double honor, especially those that labour
in the word and doctrine.</hi> Of which testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
we learne these three things:
First, that there bee Elders in the
Church, which meddle not with tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
but are occupied altogether
in gouerning. Secondly, that the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which labor in teaching, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
called Pastors, are ioined also in
gouernment with them, which teach
not. And thirdlye, that the name
of Elder, comprehendeth both sorts
of Elders. And especially in the place
before alleadged for election, ther is
great reason to lead vs to think, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12169:48"/>
the elders for gouernment, are as wel
vnderstood, as the other for doctrin,
because it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the same place,
that after they had ordeined them
Elders in euery congregation by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Acts. 14. 23.</note>
as hauing set the Churches in
perfect order (which could not be, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept
thei had established discipline as
wel as doctrine) they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to
the Lorde, in whome they beleeued.</p>
            <p>The second point for moderation
of the elders authority, in such sorte
that their sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce may be the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
of the Church is this, that when the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sistory hath traueled in examining
of causes pertaining to Ecclesiasticall
Discipline, and agreed what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to passe vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they propound it to the whole
multitude, that it may be confirmed
by their consent. Wherof S. Paul spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
touching the execution of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>munication

               </gap> prooue that

so largely taken, as in other places
for the whole multitude, but for the

vnto the assembly of elders that was
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g the Iews, which they called but
corruptlie of a greeke worde <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drion,</hi>
which signifieth a Counsell or
Consistory, <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> which had the
hearing and determining of all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
and waightie matters among
the Iews, the like wherof hee willed
to be established in his Churche, for
administration of gouernment. For,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12169:49"/>
seeing it was first instituted by God
for gouernement of his Church in
the olde lawe, as hath beene shewed
before out of Num. 11. 6.<note place="margin">Num. 11. 6.</note> although it
was shamefully abused by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Iewes, our sauiour Christ tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it into his Church also in the
new Testament: and the name of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
doth moste aptlye agree vnto
them that bee gouernours in the
Church now, euen as it did to the
ancients of Israel: so that the Pastors
seme to haue borrowed the name of
Elders, speciallye in respect of their
gouernment. The name of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory
also in the new Testament, we
finde to be agreable with that of the
Iewes, whereof our sauiour Christe
speaketh when he sayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Tell the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation

of handes of the Eldership,</hi> where the
greeke word is <hi>Presbyterion</hi> the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
or Consistorye of the Elders.
Which worde is vsed also by Saint
Luke in his Gospell, speaking of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12169:49"/>
consistory of the Iewish Elders. Luke
22. 66.<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 66.</note> 
               <hi>As soone as it was daye, the whole
Eldership or assemblie of Elders came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather,
both chiefe Priestes and Scribes,
and brought him into their counsell.</hi> In
which saying, their counsel <hi>Synedrion</hi>
is called <hi>Presbyterion.</hi> Also Saint Paule
Act. 20. 5.<note place="margin">Acts. 20. 5.</note> that he had beene a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
of christians, taketh witnesse of
the high priest and of the whol con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory
of Elders, vsing the same word
<hi>Presbyterion.</hi> By which it is euident,
that our sauiour Christ by this word
<hi>Ecclesia</hi> in that place, meaneth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory
or assemblye of Elders, whose
authoritie he doth ratifie with such
power, that whatsoeuer is bounde or
loosed by them on earth, in the feare
of God, and with heartie prayer, the
Lord will bring it to passe, yea he him
selfe will be in the middest of them,
as President of their counsell, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their consultations, to the glory
of God, and the profite of his owne
Church. Therefore in euery Church,
there ought to be a consistory of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
or Gouernours, which with the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12169:50"/>
Pastor may take charge of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
discipline, and good order to bee
obserued in the church, to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of vice, and the aduauncement
of true vertue. These, if they gouerne
well, as Saint Paule doth testifie, are
worthy of double honour, both that
honour which is due to Godly men,
and that which is due to good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>How necessarye it is,<note place="margin">The ende of Discipline.</note> that Discipline
shoulde be in the Church, to keepe
men in awe from offending, and to
bring offenders to repentaunce, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
the infection of sinne, within
the Church, and the reproche that
groweth by neglecting the punnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sinne, among them that are
without the Church: We thinke it
needlesse to stande long in proouing,
the matter of it selfe is so apparaunt,
and hath such plentifull testimonies
in the scripture. And especially let the
reasons of Saint Paule.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> 1. Cor. 5. and 2.

where yee should be sad and ashamed.</hi> For
ignominie: <hi>We deliuer him to Sathan, to
the destruction of his fleshe, that his spirite

repentance, publique reprehension of
manye, which beeing Godly refuse to
eat with such one, is profitable both
to driue him selfe to repentaunce, and
to keepe other in order for feare of
like punishment. Where this Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is not, no maruell if all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
ouerflowe, to the dishonour of
God, and of his Gospel, to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of many &amp; corrupting of more,
to the griefe of the Godly, offence of
the weake, incouragement of the
wicked, and reioycing of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore proceede, in setting
foorth the authoritie of the Pastour
with the Elders, which is; first to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
offendours, and bring them to
repentance: or else to cut them cleane
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the church, as rotten and infected
members. But heere we haue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
for what offences the Church
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12169:51"/>
may proceede to so sharpe a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For God forbidde that the
swoorde of excommunication, shold
be drawne out to cut off the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our bodie, for euery small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
that is in them, but onely when
the disease is deadlye, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
rotted thereby. For, we ought as
hardly to be brought to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
anye of our brethren: as we
woulde haue a legge or an arme, cut
off from our body. Therfore the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
tyrannie is detestable, which
thundereth out their pretended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
for euery trifle: yea
suche as are no sinnes; as non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a little mony, where it is not
deteyned of fraude: non apparance,
where men otherwyse haue neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
impediments, as though it were
but a smal matter, to put men out of
the protection of Christ, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them vnto the tyrannie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than:
to depriue them of eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and to cast them into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
damnation. Least therefore we
should vse such vnreasonable rigour,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12169:51"/>
the spirite of God teacheth vs, what
maner of sinnes deserue excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.

concerning those that were idle, and

and good order, but if they
woulde not be refourmed for anye

to be seperated by excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But it may be obiected that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
appeareth not so great vse of
this Consistorye, why it shoulde bee
thought necessarye for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
Neyther doth Saint Paule
make mention of it in all places,
where he speaketh of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We aunswere, that although the
simple institution of Christ, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the holy Ghost, shoulde
suffice vs to thinke it necessarye: yet
there are many necessary vses thereof
to be alleadged. For wheras our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ commandeth in priuate
offences, the matter to be brought
before the congregation, except you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12169:52"/>
vnderstande thereby, the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or assemblye of Elders: there shall
follow horrible confusion and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereby. For, admit a man might
accuse his brother vnto the whole
multitude, yet how should the whole
multitude admonish him, and exhort
him to repentance? Againe, of these
notorious offences that are worthye
of excommunication, some are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
knowen, so that they neede no
tryall, as the adultery of that Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.

                  </gap>.</note> some are in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
and are to be examined, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, Saint Paule warneth
Timothie, that he admit not any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
against an Elder, but vnder
two or three witnesses: and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him before GOD, and before
the Lorde Iesus Christe, and his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Aungelles, that he doe nothing
thorow rashe, or ouer hastie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and that hee doe all thinges
without partialitie or affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
parties. 1. Timothie 5. cap. 19.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 19 &amp; 21.</note>
and twentie one verse. We see heere
manyfestly a necessarye vse of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12169:53"/>
Eldership. For howe is it possible for
the whole Churche, to examine and
discusse such difficult controuersies?
Therefore it behooueth the Church,
to haue such ordinary Delegates, as
may and ought to applye their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
vuto such matters. Moreouer,
to ouersee the Church for matters
pertaining to order and Discipline:
How can the multitude ouersee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
or the Pastours onelye, which
haue a principall care of Doctrine, to
atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d vpon? And to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d part of
the obiection, that S. Paul doth make
mention of the Eldership or Consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of Elders in all places, where he
speaketh of Excommunication: wee
aunswere, that it is not necessary hee
should so do. For, wheras our sauiour
Christ hath prescribed a form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that hee which obeyeth not the
Congregation should be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated:
and that in other places, hee
maketh sufficient mention, both of
the Elders and of the assemblie, wee
oughte to vnderstande, that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is, to obserue that forme to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12169:53"/>
vttermost. And although he doe not
always make expresse me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tion therof,
yet must we not imagine, that he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t
to alter or chaunge the same. In the
first to the Corinthians the fift verse,
It is manifest, that albeit he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nothing more, then that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous
Adulterer should bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
of him for his owne part,
as absent in body, but present in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:
yet hee acknowledgeth that hee
could not be excommunicated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being gathered together in the
name of our Lorde Iesus Christe. 1.
Cor. 5. 4.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 4.</note> Likewise when he shoulde
be receiued againe, he was to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
not onelie by him, but by
them also. 2. Cor. 1. 10.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 10.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if so high an Apostle, could not
by his priuate authority excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
that Corinthian: we must not
thinke, that by his priuate authority
but by consent of the Churche of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi>
he excommunicated <hi>Himmine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
&amp; <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 20.</note> although he do not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12169:54"/>
make expresse mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the consent
of the church in that place. 1. Tim. 2.
20.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 20.</note> So likewise where he speaketh to
<hi>Timothie</hi> in the singular nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the hearing &amp; determining
of matters pertaining to Discipline,
we ought to acknowlege, that he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
in <hi>Timothie</hi> his person, the duty
of elders, &amp; neuer ment to giue <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
an absolute or singular authority,
to be iudge in these matters, without
consent of the Eldership, whereof he
maketh mention but a little before.
To conclude therfore, the Pastor with
aduise &amp; consent of the Elders, hath
authoritie to heare &amp; examine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
pertaining to Ecclesiasticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and as the cause requireth to
excommunicate offenders, and vpon
their repentance and amendment, to
receiue them againe into the bosom
of the church, approued by the word
of God. Insteede of which, Antichrist
hath set vp a tyrannicall iurisdiction
of one Bishop to be iudge of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
which is practized ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for causes sufficient, nor by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12169:54"/>
authoritie, in so much as it
hath beene alreadye testified by the
scripture, that the power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
is in no one man, no not
in an Apostle, but is common to the
whole church, &amp; ought to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by lawful delegats of the church
also. But so much that vsurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
presumeth, that the bishop as an
absolute owner therof, commiteth it
ouer to his chancelor or Archdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
the Archdeacon to his Official, &amp; he
to his register, &amp; he again to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
and his substitute to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
man or boy as it happeneth: in
so much that a learned preacher, may
be excommunicated by a folish boy.
If this matter seeme not to requyre
speedy reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, god hath blinded
our eies that we can not see the clere
light of the sun shining in our faces.
For if we loke to banish the tyrannye
of the Pope out of all mens harts, we
must vtterly remoue al his detestable
enormities out of the Realme, as it
was wont to be sayd in the common
prayers of the Church in the time of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12169:55"/>
K. Henry and Edward, whereas now
by reteining stil, all the detestable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities
of his prerogatiue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
&amp; whole course of his Canon
law, the papacie is not so much bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in name, as translated in deede
from the Sea of Rome, to the Sea of
Caunterbury, vnder the shadowe of
the Princes supremacie, with as hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
iniurie and contumely, of the
lawful authoritie &amp; godly suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the Prince, as ioyned with the
great dishonour of God, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
disorder of the Church. But
we meane not in this place to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
our iust complaintes, nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh
againste the abuse of these
thinges, with such vehemencie of
wordes as the worthines of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
deserueth: but onelye in setting
foorth the plaine trueth, to giue a
glimpst by the waye of the contrarye
falshoode.</p>
            <p>We must therefore returne to the
authoritie of the Pastour, which he
hath ioyned with the Elders of the
Church, whereof he is pastour. The
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12169:55"/>
Church hath alwayes had great care
for prouision of the poore, by which
compassion they shewed, that they
were liuely members of the body of
Christ, and auoyded great reproch of
them that were without. For what
shame is it, for them that professe to
be all sonnes of one father, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all brethren: yea that be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
all of one body, to suffer their
brethren &amp; fellow members, to lacke
necessaries to sustayne their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
life: as though they that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
in all spiritual graces and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes,
were not worthye to take part
of these worldlye benefites, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
so farre forth as to supply their
necessities? Therefore our Sauiour
Christe, alwayes commendeth bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
loue among his Disciples, to
teach vs how ready we ought to be,
to distribute vnto the necessities of
our brethren, which is a true testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of our loue declared by his
owne example. For, although hee
were so poore, that he liued of the
almesse and liberalitie of other men:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12169:56"/>
yet of that which was more then
serued his owne necessitie, he vsed to
bestowe vppon the poore: as Iohn.
13. 29.<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 29.</note> to teache them whome hee
hath blessed with Temporall riches,
which hee refused, to enrich vs with
heauenlye treasures, that they of
their superfluitie, woulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to giue to the reliefe of their
poore bretheren, which he did not
neglect in his extreame pouerty: To
teach also them that haue but mean
substaunce, that they ought not to
bee excused, but somewhat to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
vnto the necessitie of their
poore bretheren, when he that had
nothing at all but that which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
euen of that bestowed part.
Therefore the Apostles in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, thought it to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
for the better prouiding for
the poore, that certaine men shoulde
be appoynted of approoued Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and diligence, which shoulde
take the speciall charge of the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
vnto the poore. Act. 6.<note place="margin">Actes 6.</note> These
men were called Deacons or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12169:56"/>
because they did minister and
serue the poore in their necessities,
and because the occasion of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce
continueth alwayes (as our
Sauiour Christ hath sayde) we should
alwayes haue the poore amongest
vs, Iohn. 12. 8.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 8.</note> vvhereby GOD
woulde exercise our charitie. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

Therefore the Apostle Saint Paule,
prescribeth what kinde of men are
meete for that office. 1. Timothie.

               </gap>esse: as Romans

Which kinde of Deacons. 1. Cor. 12.

seruice of this office, were appointed
diuers olde poore widowes, who as

so they serued the church, attending
vppon the other poore, who beeing
sicke and impotent, had neede not
onely of things necessary, but also of
seruice and attending. 1. Timoth. 5. 5.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 5.</note>
These offices being instituted by the
spirit of God, for the necessary vse of
the Church, which vse still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
ought also to be reteined among
vs. For we see, for want of these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
what great inconueniences are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, concerning the poore. For,
although ther be very good politike
laws made for prouision of the pore:
yet smal reliefe commeth thereby to
the poore indeed: at least wise manie
abuse the reliefe which they receiue,
which commeth of this, that there be
not in euery church or congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
such Deacons as the holy ghost hath
appointed, which should take a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
care, &amp; employ a great diligence,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12169:57"/>
for the prouision of the poore: not
only some, to gather and distribute,
but also to see it well imployed on
the poore, and to imploy the poore,
that liue of the almes of the church,
to the releefe of their fellow poore,
which are more impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they, as
it was vsed in the Primatiue Church.
And aboue all thinges, to beware
of them that walke disorderlye,
and labour not if they be able. Of
which kinde of people, when there
is so greate multitudes in this land,
that they doe euen ouerflowe the
Countryes, and haue beene knowne
to bee practizers of greate matters
agaynste the state: It is maruayle,
that neither by politique, nor by ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Lawe, they are broughte
into order, and sette to laboure, or
else (as Saynt Paule prescribeth,) so
that they shoulde not eate, vntill
they bee willing to labour. 2. Thes.

            <p>But now, to return to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Deacons. Concerning the form
of chusing of Deacons, we may reade
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12169:58"/>
at large. Actes. 6. that they were
chosen, by consente of the vvhole
Churche, and hadde the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Apostles. And because
wee maye not thinke, there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
confusion in that blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye,
wee muste needes confesse,
that vvhich hath beene before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that there were euen in that
assemblie and firste Churche at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
certayne elders appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which in the name and by the
consente of the rest, had the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of suche matters, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by manie places of the Actes of
the Apostles, where the Elders are
named with the Apostles: As Actes
15. 4. 12. &amp;c. but especiallye
concerning this matter of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
vnto the poore, we reade,
that when the Church of Antiochia,
was so wel disposed as to make a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
to bee sente vnto the poore
Brethren that dwelt in Iury, they
sent vnto the Elders, by the handes
of Barnabas and Saule. Actes. 11.<note place="margin">Act. 11. 30.</note>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:12169:58"/>
30. By vvhich it appearethe, that
the Elders had the disposition and
appoynting of suche as shoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
it vnto the Congregation,
which were the Deacons. For it
is agreeable to reason, that hee that
should doe any seruice in the name
of all, should be chosen and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the consent of all. For the
Regiment of the church, as it ought
to bee furthest of from all Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye:
so ought it to be as farre from
Confusion and disorder. Tyranny is
auoyded when no one man, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the ordinaunce of Christe)
shall presume to doe anye thing in
the Church, without the aduise and
consent of others that bee Godlye
and vvise, and authorized by the
consent of the Church. Confusion is
preuented by the graue counsayle,
and orderlye assemblye of Elders,
vnto vvhome the Churche hathe
committed her authority.</p>
            <p>By this it maye easily appeare,
vvhat great defaulte there is in our
Church, where those that are sayde
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12169:59"/>
to be ordeined Deacons, neuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in their life to execute any part
of a Deacons office, neither are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for that end: but only that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a short time after, they may bee
made Priestes or ministers, nothing
in the worlde differing from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of Popery: where the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Deacon was conferred onely,
as a step vnto priesthood. As though
it were necessarye, that euerye one
which is ordayned an Elder, shoulde
first be a Deacon, and yet when he is
made a Deacon, hee is but an Idoll,
yea scarse an Idoll of a Deacon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no resemblaunce at all vnto a
Deacon indeed, but that he is a man.
This prophaning of Gods instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God will not alwayes suffer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished,
especially when it is not
maintained of ignoraunce or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
but defended against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and vpon wilfulnesse. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Collectors are more like to
deacons a great deal, then those that
the Byshops make Deacons. For, first
they haue after a sort election of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12169:59"/>
Church, whereas the other haue, but
the approbation of one man. And
secondly, they gather and distribute
the common almes vnto the poore,
which the other neuer think of. But
yet we may not allow them for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Deacons indeede, because they
are not alwayes endued with suche
qualities, as the Apostle requireth.

                  </gap>.</note> For they ought to bee men
of good estimation in the Churche,
full of the holy Ghost, and of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that should be chosen, Acts. 6.
For, as it is an office of good credit,
so ought the person to bee of good
reputation. Therefore saith S. Paule,
that <hi>Those Deacons that Minister well,
doe get them selues a good degree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and

doth salute in speciall wordes the
Deacons, next to the Byshops or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseers
in the Churche of Philipi.<note place="margin">Phillip. 1. 1.</note>
Wee reade also, what worthye men
were chosen to be the first Deacons;
as Stephen the first Martyr, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,
which afterwarde was an Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12169:60"/>
when the Churche was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
thoroughe the persecution
raysed aboute Stephen. So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ignoraunte contemptible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonne,
is not to bee allowed vnto
this office: but as Godly, wise, and
vvorshipfull, as maye conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
bee founde in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
maye not thinke them selues
too good to minister vnto Christe,
in his members, and in the name
of the Churche. The Election also
of oure Collectours, is too Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
for so holye an Office. Wee
maye reade in the Historye of the
Actes: Actes. 6.<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> with vvhat graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
reuerence, and religiousnesse,
the Apostles ordayned Deacons,
vvith Prayer and Imposition of
handes. For these and suche like
causes, althoughe the ordinarye
Collectors haue some resemblance,
with the Deaconship of the church:
yet wee cannot in all poyntes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
them for Deacons: whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
truely consisteth onelye in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
vnto the poore, as wee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12169:60"/>
haue shewed, in that they bee Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.
Wee haue declared before,
that there is a double authority of
the Pastour, the one ioyned vvith
the Elders of the Churche, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee is Pastour: the other vvith
the Synode or holy assembly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is a member.</p>
            <p>Of the former wee haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hitherto. Nowe it followeth,
that wee speake of the latter. There
aryseth oftentimes in the Church,
diuerse Controuersyes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee othervvise expressed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
to the state of the vvhole
Churche, then by a generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye
of all the Pastoures of that
Churche, vvhich is called a Synode
or generall Counsayle. Also there
bee diuerse cases, vvherein the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
Churches, are driuen to pray
the ayde of the Synode, vvhere
matters can not bee determined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them selues. For this cause,
the Holye Ghoste hathe ordayned
these Holy assembles, with promise,
that they being gathered together
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12169:61"/>
in the name of Christe, he him selfe
will bee among them. With the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,
the Pastour hath authority to
determine, concerning regiment of
the Church. Wherefore we haue to
enquire, of what persons a Synode
doth consist: For which intent wee
finde in the history of Act. 15. 6. that
when a cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Ceremonies of the Lawe,
whether they were to bee vsed, by
those Christians that were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Gentiles: The Apostles &amp;
Elders came together to consider of
this matter, and that the people was
not excluded, appeareth by the 12.
verse, the whol multitude, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by the argumentes alleaged
by Peter, helde their peace, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
hearde Paule and Barnabas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what signes &amp; wonders, God
had wrought by them amongest the
Gentiles. And least ye should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the multitude in that place, for
the multitude of the Apostles, It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the 22. verse. <hi>Then it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Apostles and Elders, with the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12169:61"/>
whole Church, to chuse certaine men. &amp;c.</hi>
By which scripture we learn, that the
Synode consisteth principally of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,
Elders, Teachers, and men of
wisdome, iudgement and grauitie, as
it were of necessary regents. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the whole multitude came
togeather, yet the Apostles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
came togeather to enquire, and
consider of the matter in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
the multitude heard, and for their
better instruction and modestye, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their consent, vnto the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Apostles and Elders.
All mens reasons were hearde. For
there was great disputation, but the
authoritie of Gods worde preuailed,
good order was obserued. So, after
the matter was throughly discussed,
by the godly arguments, alledged by
Peter and Barnabas, &amp; Paul, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
was concluded by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Iames, to whom that prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
was graunted, not of singular
authoritie, but for orders sake. And
this place doth admonishe vs, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
some what of the preeminence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12169:62"/>
of one Elder or pastor aboue the rest
We confesse that in euery assemblye
or company, some one of necessitie
must haue this prerogatiue, to order
and dispose the same with reason, or
els great confusion is like to follow.
But this preeminence is onely of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and not of authoritie, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
matters to be decided, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the reasons and consent of the
rest, and so to conclude, &amp;c. As we see
in this place Iames did: of whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
we reade, that he had this preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
Act. 21. 18,<note place="margin">Act. 21. 18.</note> &amp;c. And we maye
gather the same. Gal. 2. 9. 12.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>al. 2. 9. 12.</note> Not
that Iames had greater authority in
his Apostleship, then Peter or Paule,
or Iohn, or anye other of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
But because he was chosen of
the rest to haue prerogatiue of order,
which some one must haue in euerye
assembly, and such was the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
at the first, which was graunted
sometime to the bishop of Rome, &amp;
sometime to some other bishops, to
be president or prolocutor in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
counsels, being chosen therto
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12169:62"/>
for the time by consent of the rest, as
the prolocutor is chosen in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s,
that are called with parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Therfore, as it were an absurd
thing for our prolocutor in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
to take vppon him to be a
controller of the whole synode, &amp; to
challenge that office to him and to
his heires for euer: so vnreasonable is
the authority that the Pope claimeth
ouer generall counsels. One therfore
is to be chosen by consent, to be as it
were the prolocutor or moderator of
order, but not of authoritie in euery
assembly, whose prerogatiue must so
be tempered, that in al thinges tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
be auoyded. Which we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
easely crepeth in vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> proud
natures, to whome if you graunt an
inch, they wil be ready to take an ell,
according to the Prouerbe. But let vs
return to the authority of the sinode
which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sisteth in deciding &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
such maters as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in perticular churches be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
either because they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerne the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> state of al churches, or because
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12169:63"/>
they lacke sufficient authoritie in
some one church. First therefore the
lawfull Synode hath to consider, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
controuersie of doctrine do arise,
that it be determined by the word of
God: for in the controuersie of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Gentiles, to the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the ceremoniall lawe, was a
matter of faith and doctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it hath to determine of
the vse of the ceremonies, not of will
without reason or grounde of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but vpon necessary causes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding
offence and similitude of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
of bearing with the weak,
of order and comelinesse and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So did the Synode of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Elders, command for a time
abstinencie from meate offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
otherwise lawfull in it selfe, for
offences sake, and for auoyding of all
pollution of Idolatrie. Act. 6. 20. 29.<note place="margin">Act. 6. 20. 29</note>
and forbearing the weaknesse of the
Iewes in abstinencie, from eating of
bloud &amp; of strangled, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by God before Moses time,
to teach that Childishe age of Gods
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12169:63"/>
people to abstaine from cruelty, as in
Gen. 9. 4.<note place="margin">Genes. 9. 4.</note> Such ceremoniall constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are but temporall, and so long
are to be reteined, as the cause conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth,
for which they were made. So
that if weaknes cease, or be turned to
obstinacie, they are no longer to be
reteined. Also for order and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and best edification, the Synode
hath to determine, what shall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in particular charges: as of the
time, place, and forme of preaching
and praying, and administring of the
sacraments. For, who shoulde be able
to know what order, comelines and
edification requireth according to
Gods worde, but they that be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and preachers of the same vnto
al others? For it is absurde, that they
shoulde bee taught by such in these
small thinges, as ought to learne the
truth of them in all matters. This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
therefore cannot be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto any Ciuill Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that without consent of the
learned Pastours and Elders: yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their consent (of whom, as in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12169:64"/>
some respect hee is a feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
he maye lawfully make ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
Constitutions, whereby the
Church muste be gouerned, in meere
Ecclesiasticall matters.</p>
            <p>It is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>e of all controuersye,
that before there vvere anye Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Magistrates (for wee will, not
speake of SERGIVS PAVLVS
proconsull of Cyprus, because hee
was but a Lieuetenaunt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Emperour) this authoritie was
proper vnto the Synode.</p>
            <p>Which authoritye vvee knovve
to bee graunted to the Church by
oure Sauioure CHRISTE: pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized
by his Apostles: continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their successours three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares, before there was anye
Christian Emperours, (for wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
not Phillip for a Christian
Emperour) and long time after there
were Christian Emperours, euen as
long as anye puritie continued in
religion, vntill both Emperours and
Synodes were thrust out of all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
authoritie, which they ought to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12169:64"/>
haue in the Church, by the tyrannie
of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>But wee finde not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
this authoritye graunted by
Christe to Ciuill Magistrates, which
in his, and his Apostles tyme were
not, nor anye promise that when
they were, the Synode shoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
it vnto them. Therefore it
remayneth, that it bee shewed by
them, that defende that this abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
authoritie is in the Ciuill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
by what spirite or reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Scripture (if there be anye
that wee know not): For, we woulde
bee gladde to learne howe this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
was translated from the
Church, (in which it was once law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye
vested) vnto the Ciuill Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Magistrate.</p>
            <p>Therefore, vntill this maye bee
shewed, by sufficient warraunt of
GODS holye worde, vve holde
that the Synode of euerye Prouince,
hath authority to decree concerning
ceremoniall orders of the Church:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12169:65"/>
Whereof some may be generall to al
congregations, some particular to
certaine Churches. For, as it were to
be wished that all places might bee
brought to one perfection: So it is
not alwayes necessarye, that they be
like in all thinges. The wisedome of
the Synode therefore ought to haue
such regard of all churches, that they
haue speciall respect to euerye one.
Wherin we of long time in England
haue beene caried away, with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
principle, that vniformitie must
be in all places, and thinges a like, as
though we would feede old men and
sucking infants all with one kind of
meat: or as though we would cloath
all ages in a robe of one assize: and
that which is more absurde, compell
men of ripe age to sucke the dugge,
to weare their biggins, and to carrye
Rattles and other Childish bables.
Our lande is not yet wholly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christe (so great hath beene
our negligence hitherto) therefore
there can not bee suche an vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye
of orders in all places, as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12169:65"/>
shall be profitable for all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it were meete, that the Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
and Elders of the Churche,
shoulde come together to consider
of this matter, what orders were
moste meete for diuerse places, to
bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce of Christ:
what for the furtheraunce of them
that are newly come, and what for
the continuance and increase, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
that are very well come on.</p>
            <p>The same doctrine, although not
the same parts of Doctrine, is to bee
euery where: but ceremonies, euen
as they be ceremonies, do admit va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety:
as time, persons, and occasions
serue to be diuerse. Yea Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
in them somtimes, is necessary
to be testified, because there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
so simple, that they know not the
difference betweene those thinges,
that are necessarye in the Churche,
and those that are not of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.
There be that thinke a Crosse
or Font (as they call it) is as necessary
in baptisme, as water: and that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at the Communion is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12169:66"/>
then preaching of the Lordes
death: that a Surplusse in common
prayer, is more necessary, then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
minde: and greate occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
offered to the ignoraunt so to
thinke, vvhen they see them that
preache moste diligently, pray most
feruentlye, and minister the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
moste reuerently, according
to Christes institution, to be displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of all ministery, for a Crosse or
a Fonte, or a Surplusse, or some such
other trifle. The Synode therefore,
oughte to bee carefull in orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Ceremonyes, not onelye
that they bee pure and agreeable to
the worde of God: but also that
they bee expediente for the time
and personnes, for whose vse they
are ordayned: And as wilfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of good orders established
by publique authoritye, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to bee corrected, so intangling
of mens consciences, or tyrannicall
coaction in these indifferente mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
must alwayes bee auoyded.
The Synode hathe further authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12169:66"/>
concerninge Discipline, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
and redresse by Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Censure, all suche defaultes and
controuersies, as cannot bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the particuler Churches:
as for example: If the Pastour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
haue neede to bee seuerelye
punished, vvhere there is but one
Pastour in a Churche: or if Elders,
vvhiche shoulde bee refourmers of
others, haue notoriouslye misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
them selues: or if they haue
beene ledde by affection, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
an Innocente, or to iustifye
the vngodlye: in these and suche
like cases, all Contention is to bee
concluded, by the authority of the
Synode. Some example vvee haue
thereof. Acts. 15.<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> where those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
Schismatiques, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
Paule and Barnabas at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia,
were constrained to yeelde
by authoritye of the Councell, and
Paul and Barnabas restored to their
credite.</p>
            <p>For which causes, Synodes ought of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12169:67"/>
to bee assembled, though
not general of the whole realme, but
particular of euery prouince or shire,
as it may be most conueniently, that
such thinges as are to be refourmed,
may bee redressed with speede.</p>
            <p>Last of all, forasmuch as the election
of Pastors, is a great &amp; waighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which ought not to bee permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the iudgement of anye one
man, but pertaineth to the Church,
whereunto they shoulde be chosen,
both for better aduise in chusing of
a meete man, and for authority in
causing him to accept their election:
it is conuenient that it bee done by
iudgement of the particular Sinode.
That no one man hath authority to
ordaine Pastors, and to impose them
ouer churches, hath bene before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
by example of the Apostles
Paule and Barnabas, who although
they were Apostles, yet would they
not challenge that prerogatiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues, but by common ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
they ordained Elders in euery
Church. Acts. 14. 23.<note place="margin">Actes. 14. 23.</note> Timothy also
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12169:67"/>
receiued his charge, although it were
through prophecy, by imposition of
handes of the Eldership. 1. Timoth.
4. 14.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 14.</note> Therefore as it hath bene eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declared before, the assembly
of Elders, consisting of graue, wise,
and Godly men, ought to enquire,
when the Pastors place is voyd, wher
they may finde a man meete to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
his roome, and therein to desire
aide of the Synode. The man by such
Godly aduise so chosen, ought to be
presented to the Congregation, and
of them to be allowed and receiued,
if no man can shew anye reasonable
cause to the contrarie. This is the
right election and ordaining of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
grounded vppon the worde of
God, and practised by the primatiue
Church, two hundred yeeres after
Christ, vntil the mistery of iniquity,
grew to work more openly to the
setting vp of the tyrannicall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Antichrist. By this we may
plainly see, that our presentation of
patrons, is both prophane and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicial:
our giuing of orders by By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12169:68"/>
is presumptuous, and full
of absurdities. Firste, because they
take vppon them to do that, which
none of the Apostles durst doe: that
is, without election of Churches, to
ordayne Elders. Secondly, that they
giue an Office vvithout a charge,
to make a Pastour, and sende him
to seeke a Flocke, where hee canne
finde it: which is as vnreasonable a
thing, as if one were chosen to bee
a Church-warden, and had neuer a
Churche to keepe: or made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
that had neuer a Towne or
place appoynted, whereof he should
bee Constable. For the name of a
Pastour, Elder, or Ouerseer, is the
name of an office in Act and esse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a proper Relatiue, and not
a Potentiall abilitye in the Cloudes.</p>
            <p>If Byshoppes as they bee nowe,
were consecrated after the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to seeke theire Byshoprickes,
vvhere they coulde finde them, it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> no greater absurdity, then it is
to ordayne Pastoures, and let them
proll where they can for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12169:68"/>
Thirdlye, by this wandring
(we may also say vagabounde) mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
shifting from place to place, and
in all places to bee counted a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
where he hath no charge, it wold
grieue a man to thinke, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences
doth follow, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
how filthily it stinketh of the olde
Popish indelible character, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
it hath his ground, and neither of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reason, or of the worde of God.
And yet forsooth it is so perfect, that
it may abide no reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if you will see how well the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which they claime and practize,
is vsed of them, that onelye haue the
choyse and admission of Ministers:
Looke ouer the vvhole Realme of
Englande, What a multitude of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte
Pastours shall you finde in euery
place? So that Ieroboam neuer
made worse Priestes of the refuse
of the people, to serue his Golden
Calues, then they haue ordayned
Ministers to feede the Flocke of
Christe, which hee hathe purchased
with his owne bloude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:12169:69"/>
This complaint we confesse is gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
but the indignity of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inforceth it. We know that vaine
excuses shall not be wanting, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
&amp;c. But if necessity compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to take such at the first; what
necessity compelleth them, to suffer
them to bee such still? For, if they
woulde needes admit ignoraunt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to that charge: yet should they
haue enforced them to study, as wel
as to other thinges, they haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them vnto, that in time they
might haue growne to be meete for
their calling. Which if they had done
in 10. 12. or 13. yeeres space, a great
many might haue proued excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly
well learned, and able to serue in the
Church with great fruit and profit:
and the rest according to proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their time, might haue come to
some mediocrity in knowledg, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
nowe as ignoraunt and as vnfit as
they were the first day, so are they
still for the moste parte, and will so
continue to theire liues ende, if
they may be suffered in idlenesse, as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12169:69"/>
they haue beene hitherto. Then it is
a torment to thinke what ambitious
suing, what enuious labouring, what
vnseemelie flattering, what prodigall
bribing, is vsed to attayne to greate
dignities in the Church, to farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete
for the modesty and grauitye
that shoulde be in Christian preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
And as for the inferior benefices,
from the fattest Parsonadge, to the
poorest Vicaradge almoste, if it bee
worth 40. pounds by the year, what
Symonicall bargains of leases, Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,
Reseruations, exhibitions: yea,
notwithstanding the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Anno. 13. by Antedates and
other subtil conueyances, what chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
heart can think of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
detestation of such horrible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses?
Shall we speak here any thing
of the popish priesthood, the greatest
blasphemy that euer was: how long
was it allowed for a lawfull ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
vntill by the Godlye meaning of
the sayde Parliament, some brandmarke
of shame, was set vppon it?
But howe pitifullye that authority
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12169:70"/>
was abused, which was by the same
statute committed to the bishops, in
allowing of priests that came to doe
their penance, by negligence of the
bishops, &amp; bribery of their Officers:
the country crieth out of it, and the
state of the church, is little amended
by it. Old Sir Iohn Lacklatin, that had
not seen some of his benefices, a dose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
yeare before, was carried aboute on
his Mare, and sometimes on a Cart:
First to the bishop whom he chose, if
he might for his purpose, such one as
had bene a priest of his owne order,
and cared leaste what ministers serue
in his Diocesse, and then from Shire
to Shire, one distant an hundred mile
from another, mumbling vp his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in his morowmasse voice, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Church where hee had liuing,
and returned as very a beaste as hee
came.</p>
            <p>But this and all other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
before rehearsed, shoulde
vtterlye bee auoyded, if wee mighte
once establish the lawfull election
of Pastours, according to the word
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12169:70"/>
of God. It were also greatly to bee
wished, that it might bee broughte
to passe, that in euery Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there shoulde be two pastors at
the least, both because the charge is
great, and also for supplying the lack
of the one, if the other were sicke or
absent vppon necessity, or any such
like case. Which thing were both
agreeable to the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike
Churche, and also verye
profitable for the Congregation.
Wee doe not meane this in euerye
Parish, as they bee nowe distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
but in euery Congregation as
they may be disposed, both for best
edifying and also for sufficient liuing
for the Pastors.</p>
            <p>It will bee obiected, when we haue
all thinges at our pleasure, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Election of Pastors, yet will
there creepe in many abuses. Wee
answere, they shall not so soone, nor
so easily, nor so many abuses creepe
in, as nowe at wide Windowes, yea,
great port-gates doe throng in.</p>
            <p>But if as many or more abuses (if
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12169:71"/>
more coulde bee) were crept in, yet
were the case better then it is now:
for we shoulde be sure, that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth
our order, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the abuses, because it is groun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
vpon Gods worde, whereas now
he abhorreth both.</p>
            <p>But of the authority that Pastors
haue as members of the Synode, we
haue spoken hitherto sufficiently.
By which it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, how all things
haue beene corrupted in Poperye,
which had at the first any good insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
which corruptions we also re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
at this day, without desiring of
any refourmation. For, to begin first
with our particuler Synodes, good
lord what a mockery they are of law
ful synodes, beeing holden for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ende almoste, but to gather vp
fees, both ordinary &amp; extraordinary,
with dayly newe deuises to poll the
poore Priestes of their mony, which
they extort for seeing the Letters of
orders, for Dynners and suche like
matters. And yet a newe inuented
pyllage, vvhereby they compell men
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12169:71"/>
to buy Bookes of them for 4. pence
or 6. pence, which are to deare of a
peny or two pence: and not onelye
suche small Ware, but also greate
bookes, beeing such as euerie parish
is appointed to buy, must be bought
of them for two or three Shyllinges
in a Booke dearer, then it may bee
bought in Paules Church-yarde: yea
otherwhiles, though the Parish bee
furnished of them alreadye, they
are not authenticall, except they be
boughte at Master Chauncellers and
Officiall, at Master Regesters hands.
As for refourmation of any thing
in the Churche, there are indeede
many presentments, and men sworn
to presente matters, but little or
none amendmente at all doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.
So that it is a common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Countrie, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
is once receyued, they shal
neuer heare more of it. Soone after
the Visitation or Synode, the petit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bribing
Sumner, rideth foorth laden
with Excommunications, which hee
scattereth abroad in the Country, as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12169:72"/>
thicke as Haileshot, against this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and that Vicar: this Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and that Side-man, whome hee
himselfe when he came to summon
him to the Synode, for a Cheeze
or a Gammon of Bacon, had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to excuse for none appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce.
But when he is once Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
there is no remedy,
but hee must trudge to the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour
or Officiall for absolution,
who after hee hath once absolued
his Purse of a fewe Groates, giueth
him his blessing and sendeth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
And this is the image of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or particuler Synode.</p>
            <p>Our generall Conuocations haue
a more shevve of good order,<note place="margin">Chusing of Clearkes of the Conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> house.</note> but
in effect little better. For firste, they
are stuffed full of Popish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Chauncelloures, and other
Lawyers, which beeing meere laye
men, and vnlearned in Diuinitie, by
their owne Lawe, ought to be no
members of the Synode: And yet
these will beare the greatest sway in
all thinges. The Byshops, as though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12169:72"/>
they were greater then the Apostles,
must haue their seuerall couuenticle,
wheras the Apostles and elders came
together with the whole multitude,
Actes 15.<note place="margin">Actes 15.</note> And as they are seuered in
place, so will they bee higher in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
So that whatsoeuer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
amongest them, that must bee
called the determynation of the
whole Synode. So that no manne
muste bee suffered to speake anye
thinge agaynste it, bee it neuer so
reasonable, or agreeable to the
vvorde of GOD: yea, vvhosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vvill not subscribe to all suche
thinges, as they decree, muste bee
excluded out of the Conuocation,
as vvas practized and threatened in
the Conuocation at the foresayde
Parliamente, vnto diuerse Godlye
and learned Preachers, that offered
to speake agaynste dyuerse grosse
and palpable erroures, that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
the Byshoppes decrees. As
for the distinction of Canonicall
and Apocriphall bookes, for expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the clause in the article of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12169:73"/>
Predestination: where it is sayde,
that the elect may fall from Grace,
and such like matters. If this bee
not to practise Lordshippe ouer our
faith: to set downe decrees of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which must bee accepted of
all men, without eyther reason or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Scripture to prooue
them, and no man permitted to shew
anye reason or Scripture, that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
his Conscience to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
but onely to hang vppon the
authority of bishops: Let some other
declare what Paul meaneth, 2. Cor. 1.
4.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 14.</note> where he denieth, that he woulde
excercise any Lordship, ouer the faith
of the Corinthians.</p>
            <p>For, although their decrees were
neuer so perfect, yet it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of tyrannicall Dominion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to giue reasons to satisfie the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt
them selues, nor to hear or
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fute that which might be alleaged
against them by others, but for a few
lordbishops in comparison of all the
conuocation, to sit by them selues &amp;
order all thinges at their pleasures,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12169:73"/>
as though the Gospell sprang firste
from them, or had come vnto them
only, it sauoreth of nothing so much
as of popish tyranny: Whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is well knowne they are not al
of the best learned, nor all of longest
study, nor all of soundest iudgement,
nor all of greatest zeale, nor all of
best example, and therfore not mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to be the onely determiners in
Ecclesiasticall matters, to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the whole synode. Wherefore
it is greatly to be desired, that our
synodes also, which are so farre out
of order, maye be refourmed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the scripture, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the primitiue Church, that all
thinges may be done with such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
grauitie &amp; iudgement, as they
were by the Apostles and Elders.<note place="margin">Actes. 15.</note> Act.
15. And now that we haue set forth
the whole Ecclesiasticall ministerye,
according to the word of God, with
all the duties &amp; authoritie that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
vnto it: the place requyreth,
that we should also intreat of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the ciuil Magistrate in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12169:74"/>
ecclesiastical. Of the title of the
princes supremacie, if it be truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
we moue no contronersie:
but that it doth properly apperteine
to the ciuil magistrat, to be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
gouernor of al persons within his
dominion, so that the soueraign Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre
of God be kept whol. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
resteth all the doubt, howe this is
truely to be vnderstoode, &amp; that shal
we best vnderstand by the contrarie:
namely by the vsurped tiranny of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
For antichrist did challenge
vnto himselfe al authority, both that
which is proper to god, &amp; that which
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon to men. Therefore that the
pope claimed to be that only head of
the church, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> which the whol body
receiued direction, &amp; was kept in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of faith: This was blasphemous
against Christ, &amp; therfore may not be
vsurped by any Ciuill magistrate, no
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> by the pope. Likewise, wher
hee challengeth authoritye to alter,
change &amp; dispence with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of god, to make new articles
of faith, to ordain new sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ts, &amp;c.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12169:74"/>
this is also blasphemous and ought
not to be vsurped of any ciuil prince,
On the other side, where he challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
authority ouer all princes, &amp; so
ouer al the clergy, that he did exempt
them from the ciuil iurisdiction, this
is contumelious, &amp; iniurious against
al christian kings. And therfore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prince in his own dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, ought
to cast off the yoke of his subiection,
and to bring al ecclesiastical persons
vnto his obedience and iurisdiction.
Here haue we the first part of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of supreame gouernment ouer al
persons. In matter or causes ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical:
likewise, the pope doth not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
presume against god, as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but also against the lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
giuen by God vnto men. For
he forbiddeth princes to medle with
reformation of Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or to make anye lawes pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to causes of religion, answering
them, that those things do appertain
onlye to him &amp; the general counsel.
But when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth to debate anye
thing with his clergy, then al laws &amp;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12169:75"/>
knowledge, are enclosed in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
of his brest. When any generall
counsel must be holden, all that they
doe receiueth authoritie from him.
For except he doe allowe, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And he is so wyse, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the councell, nor without
the counsell he can erre or thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
in matters Ecclesiasticall: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is not onely lawful, but also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for Princesse, if they will doe
their dutie, to looke to the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of religion, and to make lawes
of matters Ecclesiasticall, but so that
we confounde not the offices of the
Prince and the Pastour. Eor, as it is
not lawfull for the Prince to preach,
nor administer the Sacramentes: no
more is it lawfull for him to make
lawes in Ecclesiastical causes, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the knowledge of his learned
Pastors. For, as these three partes of
a pastors dutie, are graunted to him
by God, preaching, ministring of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and Ecclesiasticall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
he maye no more take from a
Pastor the third, then he may the two
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12169:75"/>
first. By this it appeareth, how farre
it is lawful for Princes to intermedle
with causes Ecclesiasticall: namelye
that it is the chiefest poynt of their
dutie, to haue especiall regarde that
God may be glorified in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and therefore they ought to
make ciuill lawes to binde the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vnto the confession of true faith,
and the right administring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of the sacramentes, and to all
ecclesiastical orders, that they beeing
instructed by the worde of God, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the ministerie of the preaching
of the same, shall vnderstande to bee
profitable for edifying of the church
of Christe, and the aduauncement of
the glory of God. If any shall offende
against the laws, whether he be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
or hearer, beside the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
censure, which he shoulde not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
he is also to be punished in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
by the ciuill magistrate. This we
see that all christian Emperours ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
that when anye controuersie
arose, either of doctrine, or of order
and ceremonies, they commaunded
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12169:76"/>
the Cleargie to consult &amp; determine
thereof, according to the scripture,
who assembling togeather incounsel
obeyed their commandement. Their
conclusion then by authoritie of the
Emperour, was commaunded euerye
where to be obserued, and those that
impugned it, to be punished: the same
order we reade also to bee obserued,
by the christian kinges of Fraunce &amp;
Spaine, yea and of this our Brittany
also, in gouerning their Ecclesiastical
state, by the aduise of the Cleargie of
their dominion. But it will perhaps
be sayd, that for Princes to subscribe
to the determination of priestes (as
they call them) is no supremacie, but
a subiection. We answer, it is no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
vnto men, but to God &amp; his
worde, to doe nothing in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but by the faithfull aduise of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that know his will, &amp; are bounde
to teach it vnto all men: No more
then it is to be counted a subiection
for a Prince in ciuill affayres, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the aduise of wise and faithfull
Counsellers. Whereby we see that if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12169:76"/>
Gods ordinaunce were not plaine in
the scriptures, yet reason it self wold
conclude, that if in Temporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
a wise prince wil doe nothing of
weight, without the counsell of wise
men: how much more in Gods busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
which are of greatest importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce,
shold they not decree any thing with
out the aduise of them, that be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in those matters. And if all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by heathen wise mens iudgments
are so rulers, that they are seruaunts
of the laws, &amp; of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon wealth:
why should it be accounted for anye
dishonour vnto princes, to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the lawes of God their father,
and to serue to the commoditie of
the church their mother? It is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honor to be the son of God, and
the child of the church, then to be a
monarch of al the earth. Of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
subiection to GOD and
his church. Esay prophesieth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.
49. 23. <hi>Kinges shall be thy nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 49. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and Queenes shall bee thy
Nurses. They shall worship thee with their
faces towardes the earth, and licke the dust
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12169:77"/>
of thy feete, and thou shalt know that I am
the Lord.</hi> The prophet meaneth, that
Kinges and Queenes shal be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for the preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the church,
that they shall thinke no seruice too
base for them, so they maye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
the Church of Christ withal. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this honourable subiection, the
holy Ghost exhorteth princes in the
second psalme: after that they haue
tryed that they preuayle nothing in
stryuing againste the kingdome of
Christ: <hi>Be now therefore wise (O yee
Kinges):</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 2. 10. 11</note> 
               <hi>be learned that iudge the earth,
serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him with trembling,</hi> Declaring that it
is a ioyfull seruice to bee obedient
to Christ: yea to serue GOD is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
to reigne. And especiallye
it is to be noted, where Saint Paule
commaundeth prayers and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
to bee made for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of Kinges vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, and their own sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that he alleadgeeth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 2.</note>
               <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
life, in all Godlinesse and honestie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12169:77"/>
their protection.</hi> A godly and honest
life, wee may liue, vnder enemies of
the Churche and persecutors: but a
peaceable and quiet life in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and honesty, only vnder a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prince. This thing therefore the
Church most humbly desireth of the
prince: for this end the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
prayeth to GOD for the
Prince: in this respect the Churche
most obediently submitteth her self
vnto the Prince, as a Childe to his
nurce, that both prince and people
may honour God in this life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this life, reigne with Christe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we breefely set foorth a
form of reformation, touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ecclesiastical (as we are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded) agreeable to the word
of God, and as we are able to proue,
consenting with the example of the
primitiue Church, building only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the most sure foundation of the
canonicall scriptures: but intending
more at large, if occasion shall serue,
hereafter to set foorth, the practize
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12169:78"/>
and consent of the Godly fathers in
their Actes, Counsels and writinges,
following the same rule &amp; interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the scripture that we haue
done. Therfore we protest before the
liuing God and his holy Angels, and
before the Lord Iesus Christ, that shal
come to iudge the quicke and the
dead, and before the Queenes maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
our most gratious Soueraigne, &amp;
the whole assemblie of all estates of
this Realme: that as the whol world
may plainly see, we seeke hereby not
our owne profite, ease nor aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but onely the glorye of God,
and the profite of his Church: so by
this present writing, wee discharge
our conscience, according to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
which is to shew vnto all men the
true waye of reformation: and to
mooue them that haue authoritie to
put it in practize, and to seeke by all
lawfull and ordinarye meanes, that it
may take place, that if it may please
God to giue it good successe, at this
time to be imbraced, we maye fulfill
the rest of our course with ioy. But if
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12169:78"/>
our sinnes be the let, that this or the
like grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded vpon Gods worde, may
not now be receiued: yet the present
age may see &amp; iudge, what is the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
of our desire, concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
which hitherto for lacke
of such a publike testimoniall, hath
been subiect to infinite slaunders, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
by the aduersaries of Gods
truth &amp; hinderance of Godly proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
vnto reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. And that the
posterity may know that the truth in
this time, was not generallye vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
nor vntestified, concerning the
right regiment of the church of god:
nor this disordered forme of ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
gouernement, which we haue
receiued for the most part of popery,
deliuered to our Children without
contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that our example shold
not be preiudicial vnto them: as the
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple of our Godly fathers (which
in this poynt neglected their duetie)
hath beene preiudiciall vnto vs. The
Lorde graunt for Christes sake, that
we beeing so farre from perfection,
God may open al our eyes to see the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12169:79"/>
same, and bend our heartes earnestly
to labour to attaine therevnto: and
in the mean time, so farre as we haue
attained, that we may proceede al by
one rule, that we may be like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to seeke the glory of God, and
to build vp the ruynes of his temple,
that with one hearte and with one
voyce, we maye praise the Father of
our Lorde Iesus Christ in his holye
Temple, which is the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of saints in the holy ghost,
to whom be al honor &amp;
Dominion for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
Amen.</p>
