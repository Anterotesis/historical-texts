            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THO' I had much rather this Paper had been Publisht whilst that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whose <hi>Wicked Errors it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes,</hi> was Living, yet since it can be Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by divers Honest men that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten whilst He was Living; And since it is to Me so Evident that the Book I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho it carries such a <hi>shew of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> is <hi>full of Deadly Poyson</hi> to the Souls of Men, I think it my Duty to Give out to the World an <hi>Antidote</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. I earnestly beseech the Reader to Consider that it cannot be long before He and I shall Appear before the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat of CHRIST to give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our <hi>Censures</hi> of all that we <hi>Hear,</hi> or <hi>Read.</hi>

            <p>THE Reasonableness of Personal Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 4.
<q>We little know how far Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Reason may be prevail'd upon to quit its Throne, and resign its Scepter into the hands of Lust, and Appetite.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unsanctified Reason is Always Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to some Lust, or Inordinate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 5.
<q>Appeals to Reason may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Reformation in some men sooner than Appeals to the Scriptures, or Principles of Faith.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Contrary to the Common Sense of All True Christians, and the Express word of JESUS CHRIST, who says,
<q>Without Me Ye Can Do nothing,</q>
And (by the Mouth of his <hi>Holy Apostle</hi>)
<q>Without Faith it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to Please God,</q>
And certainly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109239:4"/>
it is the same thing <hi>to produce Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in any man, and to Perswade him Effectually to do those things, which are Pleasing unto GOD, which cannot be Done <hi>Without Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 9.
<q>It (Reason) stands ready to offer its service to thee to Save thee from, or to receive thee out of those Mischiefs thou hast, or mayst run thy self into, if thou will but hear, and obey its advice.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis evident He speaks of Reason in Contradistinction to Religion, for thus He begins this Section:
<q>The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose Reformation I particularly design by this method, being men that exercise more Reason, than Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion </q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it can be no other than a most Detestable <hi>Heresy</hi> to Assert that Reason any farther then as it is <hi>Regulated</hi> by the <hi>Principles of Faith,</hi> can ever Save a man from those Mischiefs, which he would run himself into.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 20.
<q>Notwithstanding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Captivity of Reason under usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and domineering Lusts, so long
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109239:4"/>
as it hath a permanent and fixed Root, and Principle in their Nature 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it may recover its Throne, and Empire over them again.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unsanctified Reason may turn its <hi>Subjection</hi> from one Lust to another, but can never have a True Victory over any one Lust, but by <hi>Subjecting it self to the Principles of Faith,</hi> that is to say, by ceasing to be <hi>Vnsanctified,</hi> and Partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>True Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Power of God unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 21.
<q>Reason would only regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and legitimate your Delights, and Religion Sanctify them.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very Injurious to the Souls of men Professing Christianity to possess them with a conceit that they may Lawfully, or According to the Will of God Act by Two Distinct Principles under the Notion of <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; For Christianity Obliges All men, Whatsoever they Do in Word, or Deed, to Do All to the Glory of God, which is the <hi>Principal Points</hi> of Right Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 99.
<q>What is the matter when all is sifted and examin'd? why the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109239:5"/>
matter is this, some will be more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, strict, and conscientious than others think fit, or necessary for them to be.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a most <hi>Devilish</hi> False Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: And we the True Sons of the Church of England APPEAL to Our Blessed LORD, the True Head of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> to Judge between Us, and this most Impudent <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> and his Companions: We Aver Before God, Angels and Men, that their <hi>Schism</hi> has been the Cause of many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, particularly, That it has been an Encouragement to the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi> to <hi>Publish</hi> their BLAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHEMIES. What BLASPHEMIES their Neglect of the LORDS PRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER has Occasion'd is also Manifest to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 130.
<q>Such as you are, whose whole Lives have been polluted with Profaness, and All Impiety. —You cannot think as others do, that you need no Repentance, or Reformation. In this respect therefore you lie near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Door of Hope, and Mercy than other Sinners do.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109239:5"/>By other Sinners he must needs mean those that have not been so Great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And whether the Greater or Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Sinners, that is to say, whether those that are <hi>More,</hi> or those that are <hi>Less</hi> Averse from <hi>True Godliness,</hi> are Nearest to the <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> let any man Judge who is neither <hi>Brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Stupid, nor <hi>Diabolically</hi> Impudent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 139.
<q>This is the change I am here pressing him to. — <hi>P.</hi> 140. It is not in any Man's power to convert himself—Yet he Can Do, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to Do many things, the Doing, or Forbearing of which has a true, tho remote tendency to his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and not Doing, or Forbearing of them, his Destruction is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Destruction is not of himself Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he Forbears to Act (or Do any thing in his own Natural Power, or Without the Divine Assistance) but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>Rejects</hi> the Divine Assistance, which by the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> is Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously Offer'd unto him. 'Tis Evident by J.F's saying,
<q>This is the change I am
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109239:6"/>
pressing him to, Compar'd with these words, He Can do, or Forbear to do many things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
That he Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges men to Act towards their <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in Their own <hi>Natural</hi> Strength, Whereas Our Preaching is this, That we Can do Nothing, but <hi>Sin</hi> Without the Help of JESUS CHRIST; but 'tis Always Possible for those that <hi>Trust</hi> in him to Abstain by his Assistance from All Known Sin. Now whether this Way of Preaching, or <hi>I. F</hi>'s <hi>Way,</hi> be the True Preaching of the Gospel, I leave to the Judgment of Any man of <hi>Common Honesty,</hi> that has Read the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 140.
<q>Nor do I know any reason why you cannot compose your selves, when engaged in God's Publick, or Private Worship, to a close, and serious attendance to those Duties.</q>
               <hi>I. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed he might have said, I know no reason, why Any man when he makes <hi>Confession</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and says the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> should not Do it Sincerely, which if he Do, he is <hi>Converted:</hi> But to Suppose (as 'tis Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

he does) that the Persons to whom he speaks, continue <hi>Vnconverted,</hi> and yet to say to them,
<q>Nor do I know any reason,
why you Cannot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>TO Mr. JOHN GALPINE, Concerning His Printed <hi>Encomium</hi> Of <hi>J. F.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOUR undertaking to Adorn the Memory of such a PESTILENT <hi>Schismatick,</hi> puts me in mind of what I wrote about Ten Years since, concerning a Person that had a Fancy to shew the like Kindness to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of T. HOBBS. My words were these:
<q>To Adorn the Memory of T. H. what is it but to Provide that the <hi>Corps</hi> of one that <hi>Dyed of the Plague may lye in State,</hi> that People coming to Behold it may contract the Infection?</q>
            </p>
            <p>You say that <hi>I. F.</hi> 
               <q>was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Mysteries of the Gospel, and in special with that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Mystery of Man's Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109239:8"/>
by Jesus Christ.</q>
How well he was acquainted with the Mystery of the Gospel we shall take Liberty to Judge, who have Observ'd the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical</hi> Falsehood of a great part of the Doctrine he has deliver'd in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, particularly in the Book which he Impudently Entitles, <hi>The Fountain of Life Open'd:</hi> In the 182 pag. of that Book he has these very words:
<q>There are not a whole World, no not half, but the far less part of the World Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd with the Blood of Christ.</q>
If he that Believed this was well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Mystery of the Gospel, of that admirable Mystery of Man's Redemption by Jesus Christ, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Blessed Apostle was very Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, who Says Expresly,
<q>HE is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but also for the Sins of the WHOLE WORLD.</q>
Since it is the Practice of so many of those that Deny the Truth of the Gospel, as <hi>I. F.</hi> did, to Accuse us, as if we did derogate from the Doctrine of the Necessity of the <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> to Do any thing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109239:9"/>
in order to our Salvation, who Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we have <q>Learnt to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God the Son, who hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, and ALL MANKIND.</q>
I shall shew you that J. F. shew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be Guilty of this <hi>Pernicious</hi> Error in his Answer to the 20<hi>th Question</hi> in the <hi>Sea-man's Catechism.</hi>
               <q>But I have no Strength of my own to come to Christ by, and is it not absurd to urge me upon impossibilities in order to my Salvation?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is indeed a Question of the Greatest Importance to the Souls of Men. The Answer that is given to it by all True Christians is this, That though of Our selves, or in Our own Natural Strength we are not Able to Do any thing Acceptable to God, we May Do All things Through CHRIST Enabling us: And CHRIST Offers the Assistance of His <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to All those, who upon the Hearing of the Gospel are Sensible of Their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency to Come to CHRIST, or to Walk in the <hi>Ways of God.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which <hi>I. F.</hi> gives to this Question
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109239:9"/>
is Contrary to the Sense of All True Christians: for He w<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Perswade a man to Act in order to his Salvation in His own Natural Strength.
<q>You are more absurd, says He, in pleading, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending your Impotency against your Duty.</q>
To which I Reply, that No man shall ever be Able to Perform any Duty, that he owes unto God, 'till he shall be Convinc'd that Of Himself, or in His own Natural Strength, he can Do Nothing, but SIN.
<q>For you think, says He, you have a Power to come to Christ, else how do you quiet your Consciences with promises, and resolves of Conversion hereafter?</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They Follow the <hi>Father of Lies</hi> who Quiet their Consciences with any thing, but a Sincere Resolution by the Help of CHRIST to Abstain from All Known Sin, and to Perform All Known Duty both towards God, and towards Man. Nothing can be more Absurd than for one, who Professes himself to be a Preacher of the Gospel to Disswade men from Believing that of themselves, or Without the <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109239:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are altogether Unable to Perform any Duty, to Do any thing Acceptable unto God. You say,
<q>He did what lay in him to live Peacebly with all Men.</q>
Let them Judge whether you speak the Truth, who Consider the Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reproaches he casts on the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the last Book he Publisht, and in his Book Entitled <hi>Husbandry Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualiz'd,</hi> and in the Sermon, you have Publisht, Entitled <hi>The Character of an Evangelical Pastor. Husb. Spirit.</hi> p. 94. This Book was Printed in the Year of Our Lord 1669, in which thus He <hi>Rails</hi> at the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               <q>Tho there be Preaching, Prayer, and other Ordinances left (at least the names, and shadows of them) yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God is not with them. There is no marrow in the bone, no milk in the breast, and so, as to Soul-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, 'tis all one, as if there were no such things.</q>
In the Sermon you have Publisht, your <hi>Evangelical Pastor</hi> (that had FOUR WIVES) <hi>Harps upon the same string.</hi> 'Tis manifest that the Minister he inveighs against are the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109239:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>English Clergy</hi> in that he Marks them by the Character of those that <hi>Live upon the Profits,</hi> And in that he gave the <hi>Whole Church of England</hi> the same Character, in such plain terms, in the Year 1669.
<q>There is no marrow in the bone, no milk in the breast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Is not this the same with what he now tells us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>They Preach, they Pray because they must do so, but none are the better for their Prayers, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They seem to labour an hour, or two in a week; but their labours turn to no account. Nor can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to turn to any good account, whilst they are neither animated by <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> nor guided by <hi>Prudence. Agricola</hi> writing <hi>De Amantibus Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneis,</hi> tells us of a certain kind of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that converse in <hi>Minerals,</hi> and much infest those that work in them. They seem to busy themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of Workmen. They will digg and cleanse, melt and sever the <hi>Metals,</hi> Yet when they are gone, the Workmen do not find that there is any thing done.</q>
I Challenge

You, and All your Brethren to Say any thing Like Truth Against what I Say in Defence of the Church of <hi>England, viz.</hi>
               <q>That it is most Evident that those Men are Guilty of <hi>Abominable</hi> Iniquity, who Endeavour to Seduce any People from the Communion of this Church, in which the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles</hi> of the Christian Religion are so clearly, and fully Exprest, and those most Important Expressions so frequently Repeated, that Persons of the <hi>lowest Intellectuals,</hi> who do not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against the Light,</hi> in frequenting our Religious Assemblies, may more easily attain to the Knowledge of all things that are Necessary to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than by Hearing, or Reading the best Sermons that have been, or shall be Preacht by any of the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> to the End of the World: Which Assertion is as Evident, as it is, That any <hi>Illiterate</hi> Persons, may more easily Meditate on Truths plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exprest, and frequently Suggested to their Remembrance, than <hi>Collect</hi> the same Truths out of divers large

Discourses, if they were therein <hi>Imply'd:</hi> So that it can hardly be imagined, how any Man can be in any thing more Serviceable to the <hi>Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Souls,</hi> than by Teaching People to <hi>Despise our Catechism,</hi> and <hi>Common Prayer.</hi>

<q>Lord! How long shall mean Delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be permitted to have so powerful and prevailing influence?

Surely there will come a time, when God will hear the Prayers, and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulations of his Servants: When the faithful Shepherd shall gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those that are scattered, and bring back those that are gone astray: When he shall carry them on his shoulders rejoycing, and triumphing in the disappointment of the beasts of prey: But who shall live, when this comes to pass?

            <p>YOU say that all that have seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously perus'd Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi>'s Books must needs <hi>suffrage</hi> with you that <hi>He was a Man of a sound and solid Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I have perus'd divers of his Books with this Serious Consideration, That I must give Account to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God what Censure I pass on them.

<q>When Fruits are shaken down from their Trees, then the Husbandman separates them; the far greatest part for the Pound, and some few he reserves for an Hoard, which are brought to his Table, and eaten with pleasure. This excellently shadows forth that great separation, which Christ will make in the end of the World, when some shall be cast into the Wine-press of the <hi>Almighty</hi>'s

               <q>Those fruits which are preserved on the tree, or in the hoard, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but an handful to those that are broken in the pound. Alass 'tis scarce One of a Thousand, and such a small remnant of Elected Souls hath God reserved for Glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can you in good earnest conceive it was Judiciously done of this Famous Man thus to Compare the Wrath of God against the Damned, and his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to those that are Sav'd, to the <hi>Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Hoarding of Apples.</hi> To any man that so <hi>Blasphemes</hi> the <hi>Divine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy,</hi> as to say that God has <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Reprobated</hi> All Mankind, except such a small Number, as One of a Thousand, I shall give no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer but this, <hi>The LORD Rebuke Thee.</hi>
